      <P>Where permanent county council workers, pensionable under the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts, are detached temporarily from their normal county council work to act in a supervisory capacity, or in a post requiring special skill, on schemes carried out by the Special Employment Schemes Office, they may have the period of such employment credited for pension purposes under a special arrangement with the county council.  The men are retained on the council payroll, and are seconded for the temporary work, subject to the amount of their wages and other costs being repaid to the council.  This facility is available to county council gangers as well as supervising gangers. It does not, however, apply to persons who are not employed permanently by the county council, and who would otherwise have been unemployed during the period they were engaged on Special Employment Schemes Office schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing subsidy is intended to encourage urban housing authorities to rehouse persons displaced from unfit or overcrowded dwellings at rents which they can afford.  It is not legally payable in respect of tenant purchase schemes and it is not proposed to seek powers to enable it to be so paid.  The terms of such schemes are already financially favourable to the purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the continuation of such a subsidy would encourage tenants to purchase their own houses and that refusal to continue the subsidy means that they will lose the desire to purchase houses because they would lose the benefit of the subsidy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms on which these houses are offered are quite <Col N="926" /> favourable as they stand.  The continuation of the subsidy was never intended for purchase schemes; it was rather intended for rehousing those displaced.  It does not seem to be appropriate to the purchase of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a family occupying a tenancy dwelling would be desirous of purchasing a house of their own and that they could be encouraged to do so by making the subsidy available?  This would be of great assistance to the local authority waiting list.  It also makes a contribution towards the existing very serious housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how that would arise.  Continuation of the subsidy means that much more money is taken out of the general pool which should, in fact, be going towards subsidising further houses for more people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <P>The Order was made by the Corporation on 29th December, 1962, and was submitted for my confirmation on 28th March, 1963.  A public local inquiry into the objections received was held on 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th November, 1963.  These dates were arranged with the Corporation as part of a programme of inquiries.  They requested that this inquiry be held not earlier than 26th November.  The inspector's report on the inquiry was received in February of this year.  This delay occurred because the transcript of evidence given at the inquiry was not received until June, 1964, and because of pressure of other work on the inspector, including work in connection with other compulsory purchase orders, over the period.  The Poplar Row-Spring Garden Street area compulsory purchase order was itself a complicated one which was strongly contested and the great volume of evidence given at the inquiry involved lengthy study before a report could be furnished.</P>

    <P>The total area included in the compulsory purchase order was 6 acres 1 rood 19 square perches on which the Corporation proposed to erect 228 flats.

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, disability benefit is not payable in respect of the first three days of a period of interruption of employment through illness.  Such a waiting period has always been a feature of sickness insurance schemes, the view being that after a relatively lengthy period of employment a person may be expected to bear himself the cost of the first few days of illness.  In this connection I may mention that unless an interval of more than thirteen weeks has elapsed since disability or unemployment benefit was last obtained payment of disability benefit is made as from the first day on which it is claimed.  Legislation to provide for payment of benefit in respect of a period of illness of three days or less is not contemplated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of na Buan-Óglaigh are required to deliver mail to the married <Col N="938" /> quarters in Cathal Brugha Barracks because, under regulations of An Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa, postmen are not permitted to distribute mail within military barracks.</P>
    <P>As the occupants of the married quarters are not direct customers of the Electricity Supply Board, it would not be appropriate to have the electricity meters in the quarters read by employees of the Board.</P>
    <P>The question of furnishing detailed written statements, showing electricity consumption and the charges therefor, to the occupants of the quarters is being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the Minister's familiarity with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, can he say why the Department prohibit postmen from delivering the post at military barracks?  Surely if Dublin Corporation workmen can empty bins at military barracks, it should be possible for postmen to deliver the post there without the personnel having their correspondence passed through censorship of officials?</P>

      <P>The provision of houses for married soldiers is not primarily a matter for my Department and the most that it can hope to achieve in this direction is to supplement the efforts of local authorities at centres where the need is greatest.  Soldiers are not in a different position from others in the same income group as regards their eligibility for housing by local authorities.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal by the General Electric Company to erect a factory at Dundalk for the production of small electrical appliances held out prospects of viability, substantial exports to Britain, and worthwhile employment.  After the factory went into production the conditions on overseas markets changed appreciably, mainly owing to over-production in England, and the company decided that the Dundalk operations had become uneconomic.  I am satisfied that the decision by the company to cease operations received the most careful consideration and examination.  I have impressed on the company the necessity to keep redundancies to the absolute minimum.  The Deputy <Col N="942" /> will appreciate that there are no other remedial measures open to me.</P>
    <P>Information about a company's paid-up capital is available from the Companies Office.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to give information about the amount of Foras Tionscal grants until the annual Report is made available but, in view of the exceptional circumstances.  I am prepared to give the information in the present case.  The amount of State grants paid is £341,000; there are no State Loans.</P>
    <P>There is not an associated company at Dunleer; the two factories belonged to the one company.  The grant of £341,000 was made towards the cost of the new factory buildings at Dundalk, the plant and machinery at Dundalk, and certain items of plant and machinery installed at Dunleer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is pretty frightening that a firm which received a grant of £341,000 and was established for about a year could suddenly fold up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a frightening thing, but, as the Deputy knows, it is a reputable firm who invested a good deal of their own capital to back up their confidence in the market and it was after a very thorough examination of the prospects that it would be viable and give employment and would be <Col N="943" /> worth supporting from that point of view.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is <Col N="945" /> aware of the serious unemployment position which has resulted from redundancy and lack of employment in the Labadish potato processing factory, County Donegal; and if he will take steps to ensure that more continuous employment is available in this factory in future, including (a) the assurance of a steady supply of potatoes by an agreement with the local farmers' organisation to buy potatoes of seventeen per cent starch content at a guaranteed price of £9 per ton and (b) the conversion of the existing factory into a confined unit for the manufacture of starch and glucose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with potato starch factories elsewhere, the Labadish potato starch factory operates on a seasonal basis, the length of the production campaign each year being governed by the availability of potatoes for processing.  There was an unusually early layoff this year, caused by the shortage of potatoes.  Ceimicí Teoranta endeavour to the fullest possible extent to ensure a continuity of employment by means of a continuity of supplies. However, the price obtainable for potato starch, which is sold in highly competitive markets, would not, I am informed, justify a price for potatoes greater than that which the company is now paying.  The glucose factory at Corroy, County Mayo, is already producing sufficient glucose to meet the country's requirements of that product.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the cost of production at the Labadish potato processing factory, County Donegal is greatly inflated by the fact that shortage of storage space has resulted in the management spending considerable sums in renting such space; and if he will carry out a thorough investigation of the management methods in this semi-State factory, including, particularly, such matters as storage, transport, disposal of end products, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Ceimicí Teoranta that they are unaware of the basis of the statement that considerable sums are being spent on rented storage space.  The present <Col N="946" /> storage space at the Labadish factory is sufficient for the needs of the company, taking into account the fact that major export sales occur during the production season.  Storage space, I am informed, is rented only when production is above normal, because of an unusually large supply of potatoes for processing, and the rental charges involved are quite moderate.  Markets, both home and export, have been developed for disposal of the industry's end products, potato starch and potato pulp.  The quantities produced depend on the quantity of potatoes available for processing.  I have no reason to doubt that the company are managing this factory efficiently, and I see no need for an investigation of the type suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will observe from the Board's Annual Report for the year 1964, recently presented by me to the House, that greyhound exports have been at a record high level, that there have been further improvements, with the aid of subventions from the Board, in greyhound racing facilities and track amenities resulting in increases in meetings, entries of dogs, prize money and attendances of patrons; that substantial grants have been made by the Board for the development of coursing grounds and for increased stake money; and that many useful measures were taken by the Board for the purpose of the better control of and supervision over greyhound breeding, racing, coursing and sales.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of such a pig fattening unit is something that should be undertaken by local interests.  I am not aware of any proposal from the Labadish area in the matter.  Pig fattening units in other areas have been almost entirely established by co-operative societies formed in association with the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  Pig housing grants have been given in those cases by my Department and some of the societies have also received loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I am advised that while potato pulp may be used as a &ldquo;filler&rdquo; to pig rations it is not a balanced material and could not be regarded as suitable to form the principal ingredient of a pig ration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the 12 months ended 30th April, 1965, the number of persons under sentence in the prisons to whom temporary release was granted was 71 and the corresponding number in St. Patricks was 45, making a total of 116.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> In 38 cases temporary release for Christmas was granted for the period from 23rd December, 1964 to 1st January, 1965; in six cases periods of temporary release, up to a maximum of four days, were granted on account of death or grave illness of a member of the family; in five cases, where the periods ranged from one day to 15 days, release was granted because of serious domestic difficulties and in one case a female prisoner was allowed two periods of temporary release totalling two months in connection with her confinement and the care of her baby.</P>
    <P>In the remaining 66 cases, the temporary release granted related to temporary absences for interviews with prospective employers and to actual employment, mainly on a day-to-day <Col N="954" /> release basis, that is, sleeping-in and working out.</P>

    <P>NOTE.</P>
    <P>1.  The Garda statistics of crimes, including the number of convictions recorded, relate to the year ended 30th September in all cases.</P>
    <P>2.  The available statistics in relation to indictable offences do not distinguish between (a) persons who were convicted and (b) persons in respect of whom a charge was held proved and an order made by the Court without conviction.  The table in the answer relating to indictable offences refers, accordingly, to the total of these two categories in each case.</P>
    <P>3.  The tables of convictions distinguish between the Dublin area and the rest of the State. For the years prior to 1964 the Dublin area is the former Dublin Metropolitan Garda Division, which was roughly equivalent to the County Borough of Dublin plus the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  The corresponding figures for 1964 refer to a new police area, known as the Dublin Metropolitan Area, which extends to most of County Dublin and part of County Wicklow.</P>

    <P>1.  ECONOMIC SURVEY.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the appearance in recent weeks of a variety of publications, official and non-official, dealing with our economic position and prospects, I may, perhaps, be excused for offering today only a very brief summary and for going on to discuss some major problems which must be solved if we are to maintain the satisfactory growth achieved over the past six years.</P>
      <P>The publications to which I refer include the detailed analysis of the economy in 1964 and review of likely prospects for 1965 made available by the Department of Finance to the National Industrial Economic Council and published last week as part of the first progress report on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion;</i> the Council's comments on this document; the usual Central Statistics Office publication &ldquo;Economic Statistics&rdquo;; and the annual survey of Ireland by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provisionally estimated that a growth rate of 4½ per cent was achieved in 1964 through improvements in both agricultural and industrial output.  Agricultural output rose by about 4 per cent; for all industries and services there was a record increase in output of over 9 per cent. In industry and services the increase in total incomes was 13½ per cent, mainly due to the &ldquo;ninth round.&rdquo;  Agricultural income was 17 per cent higher as a result of larger output and a sharp increase in prices, especially of meat. The average annual movement of some 10,000 from agriculture has made it difficult to achieve net gains in total numbers at work, despite substantial annual increases in employment in industry and services.  Last year, however, a larger net gain in employment was registered than in previous years. On the trade side, exports rose by £26 <Col N="963" /> million and are now more than double the 1956 figure.  Imports rose by £41 million and, despite a net improvement in invisible receipts, the balance of payments deficit expanded to £31 million, as compared with £22 million in 1963.  An exceptional feature of the year was the rise of 6½ per cent in average consumer prices, caused more by internal than by external factors.</P>
    <P>For 1965 my Department has ventured to publish for the first time an integrated set of economic forecasts. These indicate that a further 4 per cent growth of the economy is possible but, of course, this is far from saying that it is certain.  A full recovery in cattle exports may be delayed until the Autumn.  Because of this, of the continued operation, though at a lower rate, of the British surcharge on imports of manufactured goods, and a possible slackening in the growth of demand in other export markets, it was thought reasonable in making the estimates not to assume that exports would increase in 1965 as much as in 1964.  On the other hand, a smaller rise in imports is expected, leaving the balance of payments deficit at much the same level.  The trade figures for the first quarter of the year suggest that, while the assumption about imports may be reasonably valid, attainment of the export target will require a combination of more intensive effort and more favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>Even this brief survey conveys a hint of the problems I wish to discuss. These problems are inter-related and as they all influence the balance of payments, which indicates the pressure we are placing on the resources available to us, I can best begin with some comments on this general economic indicator.</P>
    <P>To recall briefly the course of events since 1956, we had over the years 1957-1961 inclusive virtual equilibrium in the balance of payments.  In 1962 a deficit of £13 million was incurred, followed by a deficit of £22 million in 1963 and one of £31 million in 1964. We face a deficit of about £30 million again in 1965, indeed, a larger one, if the trade figures do not improve.</P>
    <P>The external deficits of 1962-64 inclusive <Col N="964" /> were more than covered by an inflow of capital.  This inflow was largely, though not entirely, autonomous, in the sense that it represented voluntary investment by foreigners in Ireland&mdash;in industry, national loans, industrial securities, property development and so on.  Last year, direct borrowings of $25 million were made in New York to help finance the Electricity Supply Board and the Air Companies.  Because the capital inflow exceeded the deficits in the balance of payments our external reserves increased from the end-1961 total of £225 million to £242 million at end-1964.  In the first quarter of this year, however, the reserves have borne the impact of the increase in the trade deficit.</P>
    <P>Ireland's external reserves are, of course, still strong and we can draw comfort from the fact that the balance of payments deficits of recent years have, as the OECD and our own NIEC have pointed out, been associated with a rapid increase in gross capital formation.  The ratio of investment to gross national product (GNP) has risen from under 15 per cent in 1960 to 20 per cent in 1964.  Nevertheless, one must recognise the vulnerability of an expansion programme which is dependent on a continuation of a capital inflow of the recent unprecedented size. The NIEC has commented that &ldquo;deficits of a higher order than at present would reduce the room for manoeuvre, especially if the capital inflow should weaken or if there should be an adverse movement in the terms of trade&rdquo;; and the OECD concludes a balanced review of the situation in recent years by saying that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...there is a limit beyond which it would be unwise to allow the current deficit to rise, if only because it would increase the degree to which the economy was exposed to change in external conditions.  The Second Programme envisages a deficit of £12 to £16 million (in 1960 prices) by 1970; this would imply a rather sharp contraction of the deficit, and perhaps a sharper one than may prove necessary.  Nevertheless, it would appear reasonable over the next few years to aim at a reduction from the present level&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> A further consideration is that the capital inflow may be adversely affected by the measures recently taken in two of the principal capital markets, the United States and Britain, to restrict the outflow of capital.  In addition, the recent removal, by Presidential Order, of our immunity from the United States interest equalisation tax makes it more expensive to borrow in New York.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, a prudent and reasonable aim of policy this year to avoid an increase in the balance of payments deficit over the 1964 figure. Indeed, some reduction would be acceptable if this proved compatible with a 4 per cent growth rate.  These must be our guiding lines in budgetary and credit management.</P>
    <P>This means that the Budget of 1965 should be so constructed as to result in a balance on current account while providing for the scale of public capital expenditure envisaged in the Second Programme.  In the credit field, it must be accepted that the commercial banks cannot afford to expand credit as liberally as in recent years and that, in any case, it is undesirable that they should lend so much as to cause the balance of payments deficit to exceed the 1964 figure; at the same time, they should ensure that credit is available for productive purposes, especially those connected with the expansion of exports of goods and services.  I understand that the Central Bank has had this matter under consideration and will shortly convey its views to the Irish Banks' Standing Committee.</P>
    <P>The trend of prices, costs and incomes will also be of crucial importance for a continuance of steady growth of production and employment in 1965.  So far as can be foreseen at the moment, it is improbable that external circumstances will lead to any significant rise in prices this year. If, therefore, we avoid a rise in internal costs and prices, we can achieve a measure of price stability which will aid our external position considerably, with very important consequences for increased output and employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> The NIEC in a report earlier this year on industrial progress in 1964 expressed the belief that in the case of many Irish industries exports are barely competitive.  In its comments on the Department of Finance's review of the economy the Council pointed out that a faster rise in employment than has heretofore taken place under the Second Programme could be achieved, amongst other ways, by using some part of the annual increase in productivity to reduce prices and thus make possible an expansion in sales and in new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Our national aim in 1965, therefore, must be to improve competitiveness. Industrial adaptation is essential and urgent but the trend of wages and salary costs and the level of profits also require careful attention.  There is a community of interest between the Government and both sides of industry in ensuring that, according as the benefits of increased national production are distributed, the distribution will be carried out in such a way that our domestic and foreign competitiveness will be improved.  It is to the benefit of every section of the community that we should maintain a steady rate of increase in output and employment, through expansion of exports, and that we should avoid the balance of payments difficulties and the consequent &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; which have had such disturbing and retarding effects in other countries.</P>
    <P>Price stability depends on a correspondence between increases in incomes and national productivity and on adequate competition, rather than on any system of control.  Experience in other countries has shown that price control, however extensive or intensive, cannot prevent price increases if costs are rising.  There is also abundant evidence of the difficulties and disadvantages associated with a system of general price control.  The Government accept the duty to act to counter unnecessary price increases where competition is defective; in recent months they have intervened in a number of such instances and the burden of proof will continue to be thrown on those who <i>prima facie</i> have raised prices unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" /> A significant contribution towards easing the balance of payments situation can also come from savings. There was an encouraging increase in 1964, the ratio of gross savings to GNP having risen to 17½ per cent, as compared with 16 per cent in 1963 and 12 per cent in 1958.  Investment also increased sharply in 1964, an investment ratio of approximately 20 per cent being achieved as compared with 18 per cent in 1963 and 12 per cent in 1958.  The closer these two ratios&mdash;of savings and investment&mdash; can be brought together the smaller will be the deficit necessary in our external payments.  Last year, rather less than one-sixth of total investment was financed externally.  A further increase in domestic savings this year would enable this percentage to be reduced and ensure a continued upward trend in domestic investment without any enlargement of the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Trade with Britain</i>
    </P>
    <P>The foregoing survey underlines the extent to which our economic wellbeing depends on ability to sell our products abroad in increasing quantities according as our production grows. Essential to the balanced expansion of our external trade are satisfactory terms of access to our principal markets.  The import surcharge of 15 per cent imposed last October by the British Government, now reduced to 10 per cent, was a sharp blow to 30 per cent of our exports to Britain.  This breach of our rights under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreements was the subject of urgent representations in discussions between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister following which it was agreed that the two Governments should consult together about the possibilities of improving the permanent trading relations between the two countries.  These consultations are still continuing and there are grounds for hoping that in the course of the next few months it will be possible to settle the main features of the new agreement.  In the negotiations our principal objective will be to devise arrangements which will be conducive to the <Col N="968" /> maintenance of a high level of trade and which at the same time will be consistent with ultimate entry into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>
      <i>EEC</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is still the intention of the Government to reactivate our application for membership of the Community as soon as it is possible to do so.  While the past year has not afforded opportunities for any new initiatives on our part, there has in recent months been evidence of an improving situation which confirms the Government in their belief that the objective of membership of the Community by 1970 is still a realistic one.</P>
    <P>
      <i>GATT</i>
    </P>
    <P>Meanwhile, we are proceeding with our application for accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  The slow progress in the multilateral trade negotiations, known as the Kennedy Round, has delayed the initiation of discussions with Ireland and other countries which are considering acceding to GATT.  It now appears that discussions on the terms on which we might accede will commence this summer and that we may be introduced into the Kennedy Round negotiations in the Autumn. The Government consider it important that we should participate in these negotiations in view of their significance for international trade generally and of the fact that they represent a serious attempt to negotiate a multilateral lowering of barriers to international trade in agricultural products.</P>
    <P>
      <i>IMF</i>
    </P>
    <P>An important change in our financial relationship with the International Monetary Fund is taking place this year.  Following a review of quotas the Board of Governors has decided on a general increase of 25 per cent and special higher increases for sixteen countries including Ireland.  Our quota or subscription is increased from $45 million to $80 million.</P>
    <P>There are now 102 members in the Fund and its capital exceeds $15,000 million; the pending increases will raise its capital to over $21,000 million. In recent years there has been much discussion among monetary authorities <Col N="969" /> as to the adequacy and distribution of international liquidity, having regard to the rate at which world trade and payments are growing.  Though a solution of this problem will eventually require the creation of a new international fiduciary currency, the raising of quotas will make a significant interim contribution in that the additional stock of gold and currencies in the Fund will be available for use in an orderly and controlled way.</P>
    <P>The increase in our quota will involve a payment in gold of £3,125,000 which will be advanced by the Central Bank under the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957.  The balance of the subscription&mdash;£9,375,000&mdash;will be in Irish currency, mainly in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand notes.  The contribution in Irish currency which will be credited to the account of the Fund in the Central Bank will be called upon only in the unlikely event of Irish currency being required by other members for the settlement of their international payments.</P>
    <P>In return for the increased subscription, Ireland will be entitled to a substantial improvement in drawing facilities and to an increase in relative voting strength in the Fund.  The resources of the Fund are available to members, in proportion to their quotas, to tide them over short-term balance of payments difficulties.  On the basis of our present quota of $45 million, Ireland may, in effect, draw automatically up to the equivalent of $11.25 million in currencies of other countries and, subject to certain conditions, a further $45 million.  The revised quota of $80 million will increase these drawing rights to $20 million, and $80 million, respectively.</P>
    <P>A consequential increase from $60 million to $85.3 million arises in our subscription to the capital stock of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, better known as the World Bank, which is linked with the Fund.  The main function of the Bank is to provide financial and technical assistance for productive purpose for member countries, especially the less developed.  Its resources consist of the subscriptions of member countries to the capital stock <Col N="970" /> of the Bank and funds raised by direct borrowing in world capital markets. The increased subscriptions will facilitate the Bank in providing additional aid for less developed countries and our payments thus represent a real contribution to the economic welfare of such countries.</P>
    <P>Our additional subscription to the Bank's stock will involve a payment of £90,000 in dollars and £813,000 in Irish currency.  These sums will also be advanced by the Central Bank under the 1957 Act.  The remaining 90 per cent of the increased subscription will remain at call and is unlikely to involve a cash commitment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Relations with Northern Ireland</i>
    </P>
    <P>To complete this review, and before turning to the budgetary position, I should like to refer to the historic meetings which occurred earlier this year between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. They agreed that there was considerable scope for practical co-operation between the two areas and that the possibilities should be examined further.  Since then, a number of meetings at ministerial level, as well as discussions at the level of officials, have taken place on a wide range of subjects.  Further meetings and discussions have been arranged or are envisaged.</P>
    <P>Already specific results have emerged.  A joint committee has been set up to investigate the technical and economic possibilities of co-operation in the field of electricity.  On the tourist side there has been a number of developments.  It has been agreed to invite the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte to appoint a joint committee to consult on any improvements that may be desirable and practical to facilitate and encourage cross-border tourist traffic in both directions, on the improvement of tourist statistics and on promotional efforts.  The joint committee would also make recommendations to the two Ministers on further measures of co-operation.  The Minister for Transport and Power has authorised scheduled flights between Dublin and St. Angelo airfield near Enniskillen. <Col N="971" /> The development of this airport will facilitate tourist traffic in the surrounding areas, including Donegal and Sligo.  Four additional cross-border roads have been approved and four new customs posts opened.  The requirement of a triptyque on entering Northern Ireland has been abolished.</P>
    <P>These initial developments augur well for the new era of co-operation between the two parts of this island. As further discussions take place on the wide range of possibilities for co-operation, we can expect more developments which will, I hope, operate to the benefit of the people on both sides of the border.</P>
    <P Just="Center">2.  CURRENT BUDGET</P>
    <P>
      <i>Outturn,</i> 1964-65.</P>
    <P>Revenue receipts last year were most satisfactory, exceeding the budget estimate by £3.9 million.  Tabacco duty made a striking recovery from the setback in the early months of 1964, following the United States Surgeon-General's report.</P>
    <P>Expenditure, however, was also greatly in excess of the estimates, with the result that there was a deficit of £4 million.  There was excess expenditure on items such as rates relief and milk price supports, but the principal cause of that deficit was the high cost of pay settlements for the Civil Service, the Army, teachers, and the staffs of health authorities.  The settlements involved were mainly eighth round adjustments, the cost of the ninth round having been provided for in the Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public services remuneration</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a result of the ninth round and other pay adjustments, the remuneration elements in Government current expenditure rose from £55 million in 1963-64 to almost £71 million last year.  In this financial year it is estimated to be £72¾ million, or 30.4 per cent of total current expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government have accepted the various arbitration findings affecting pay in the public services and have used them as a basis for conciliation settlements for grades which did not <Col N="972" /> seek arbitration.  The process of settling the pay of so many individual grades has been a long one but, as my predecessor stated, it will have been worth while if it carries a measure of finality. When the present adjustments have been completed, the various grades will have been currently brought into proper relationship both with each other and with their outside counterparts.</P>
    <P>The arrangements whereby pay claims are dealt with by a variety of conciliation and arbitration tribunals, which are under no formal obligation to take account of national economic considerations, or even of the repercussions of awards on comparable categories, involve serious risks not for the Exchequer only but for the whole economy.  As matters stand, a status increase secured by any grade from one such tribunal can evoke appeals to the same or other tribunals from other classes on the ground that a former relativity has been disturbed and should be restored.  This can obviously become a never-ending cycle, giving rise to a continuing increase in costs of Government.  Grievances and unrest may persist amongst the classes concerned, despite large pay increases, and demands may be generated for corresponding increases outside the public sector.  This is a major problem which must receive earnest consideration in the wider context of the amendment of the Industrial Relations Act.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the rates of pay now settled should stand unless and until there are substantial changes in pay outside the public service.  There is no injustice in this for any class of State-paid personnel. On completion of current adjustments, all will have received liberal treatment, having had, since the beginning of 1963, a status or other increase as well as the 12 per cent ninth round.  Any future general increase in the remuneration of such personnel should accord, in time and amount, with the terms of a national agreement.</P>
    <P>The volume of public expenditure on remuneration is not determined by rates of pay alone.  Continuing demands for new public services are also a problem <Col N="973" /> in this context.  Extra staff must be provided for many expanding activities including telephone services, schemes for the eradication of livestock diseases, and for economic and physical planning.  With numbers and pay both increasing, it is more important than ever to pay attention to organisation and methods, work study and automatic data processing.  These activities are being extended and developed within the Civil Service.  The possibilities of using newer techniques such as operational research and cost-benefit analysis are also being investigated.</P>
    <P>The work now being done by advanced automatic data processing in the Civil Service includes income tax assessments, Post Office Savings Bank accounts and telephone accounts. Other installations include the new mechanised system of paying teachers. A special team of automatic data processing experts has been recruited and trained.  They are engaged full-time in studies related to the feasibility of extending the use of automatic data processing equipment, including computers, in the Civil Service.  Already some of these studies have reached an advanced stage.  The years immediately ahead should see big developments in the field of automation in the Civil Service, with substantial improvements in efficiency.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive programme of staff training is being developed.  It is notable that the countries in Western Europe which have made the most rapid strides in general development in recent years are those in which a great deal of time and attention is paid to the training and preparation of personnel in the public, as well as in the private, sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget,</i> 1965-66</P>
    <P>The White Paper entitled &ldquo;Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure&rdquo; sets out the basic figures of this year's Current Budget.  Specific allowance has been made in the White Paper for the cost of pay claims which were settled between the preparation of the Estimates Volume and the end of March last and also for the cost of the temporary <Col N="974" /> assistance for industry arising out of the British import surcharge.</P>
    <P>The gap between revenue at present tax rates and current expenditure, as shown in the White Paper, is £3.53 million.</P>
    <P>As the special assistance for industry is, I hope, purely temporary and non-recurrent, I think it reasonable to charge the estimated expenditure of £1½ million under this head to borrowing.  I shall treat it as a &ldquo;capital service&rdquo; in order that specific provision will be made, through the Capital Services annuities, for wiping out the debt.  The gap between revenue and current expenditure is thereby reduced to £2.03 million.</P>
    <P>There are still pay claims in course of settlement and we may, as usual, expect to have to meet supplementary requirements under other heads before the year is out.  I consider £3½ million a reasonable provision to make for these.  This increases the gap to £5.53 million.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we would be justified, bearing in mind the growth in the volume of revenue and expenditure, in adopting a figure of £4 million as the deduction to be made this year for errors of estimation.</P>
    <P>The amount which would then remain to be found, £1.53 million, would present no great problem.  It would, in fact, be open to the Government and Dáil Éireann to stop there: to have what would be virtually a standstill budget by contrast with the position in various European countries where taxation has been heavily increased.</P>
    <P>As matters stand, the combined capital and current budgets contain substantial additional provision for both social and economic services.  For example, the provision for housing is £4.4 million, or 25 per cent higher than last year; for education it is £3.12 million, or 10½ per cent higher; and £1 million, or 5½ per cent, more is being provided for the health services.</P>
    <P>At this point, therefore, the decision has to be taken whether new expenditure should be incurred which will require additions to existing taxation and, if so, for what purposes.  We have to consider, on the one hand, our <Col N="975" /> social obligations to the aged and less fortunate members of the community, as well as the adequacy of existing development aids, and, on the other hand, the need to avoid increasing taxation to an extent that would seriously affect the cost of living and disturb the economy generally.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>It will be seen from Table II that current expenditure on economic services will be 10.6 per cent more this year than in 1964-65.  In the case of agriculture, a further £400,000 must be provided for the recently announced quality bonus of a penny a gallon for creamery milk.  This will bring the cost of the price support for milk and milk products to over £10 million and the estimated current expenditure on agriculture this year to £33.7 million &mdash;£3.6 million more than actual expenditure last year.  The improvement in farmers' incomes in 1964 should continue this year.  Beet, wheat and barley prices have been raised; cattle prices have increased and remain high; financial provision has been made to support fat cattle prices and pig prices are to be increased in the autumn. Also, the volume of agricultural production is expected to be higher this year.  All in all, Exchequer expenditure for the benefit of agriculture will be almost £53 million this year, £34 million from revenue and £18½ million in the Capital Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is general agreement on the desirability of increasing the proportion of national resources devoted to social services in the broad sense, including housing, education and health, as well as social insurance and assistance.</P>
    <P>The projections of public expenditure in the Second Programme made allowance for an increase in net expenditure on current goods and services from 11.7 per cent of GNP in 1960 to 13.2 per cent in 1970.  The bulk of expenditure on education by central and local authorities falls under this heading.  To repeat the words used in the Programme, the intention was to <Col N="976" /> provide for a relative increase in expenditure on education and on services of importance to the development of national resources.</P>
    <P>The view has been expressed that the expansion of educational services could be fitted so easily within this allocation that room could also be found for bigger improvements in other social services.  The question is whether the projection, geared to increased national production, which was made for social welfare under the heading of &ldquo;current transfer payments&rdquo; can be increased.  It is, however, too early to answer this question.</P>
    <P>There cannot be social advance except on the basis of economic advance and the more economic progress there is the more social improvement is possible.  The whole purpose of economic planning is to achieve social betterment, to use the growth of national wealth to improve the living standards of all the people.  Clearly the best way to do this is to provide for productive and permanent employment, to see that there are good housing and educational facilities, to extend the health services, and to improve the social benefits for those unable to provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>Studies have been in progress on various aspects of social policy, including the lines of development of welfare services, but completion of these studies and consideration of the position of the welfare services in relation both to economic possibilities and changing social needs, are not possible until the shape of future policy on education, health, the training, retraining and placement of workers, urban development and other services can be more clearly determined.</P>
    <P>There will, however, be no standstill in social welfare services pending the consideration of an integrated programme.  The Government have expressly recognised that an increase in outlay on such services contributes to social justice and a more general raising of living standards and in this way creates a climate conducive to steady national development.  Evidence of the Government's continuing anxiety to <Col N="977" /> improve the situation is provided by the measures which have been taken in every budget in the past six years to increase social welfare payments. The Government feel with confidence that they have general support for giving an exceptional rise this year in these benefits.  The estimates already provide £35.5 million for social welfare services.  The proposals which I have to announce will cost the Exchequer another £5.7 million in a full year and £3.22 million this year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase the maximum rate of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions by 10/- a week for persons whose annual means do not exceed £26 and by 5/- a week for others.  The personal rate of unemployment assistance and the allowance for an adult dependant, both in urban and rural areas, will each be raised by 5/- a week; and, as regards insurance benefits, the personal and adult dependant rates, respectively, of old age and widows' contributory pensions, unemployment benefit, disability benefit and maternity allowances will be increased by 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>As is customary, the increases in social assistance will take effect from the beginning of August and those in social insurance benefits from the beginning of January next.</P>
    <P>The infectious diseases maintenance allowance for a married couple and the disabled persons maintenance allowance administered by the Department of Health will also be increased by 10/- a week from the beginning of August.</P>
    <P>The proposed scheme for payment of unemployment assistance on the basis of a more favourable means test to smallholders in the Congested Districts will be introduced as from the beginning of next January.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>As already announced in the press, provision is being made for a further increase in the pensions of retired civil servants, national teachers, gardaí, members of the defence forces, military service pensioners and holders of special allowances and for <Col N="978" /> appropriate recoupment of the cost of increases that may be given in local authority pensions.  This increase follows on a recommendation by the Committee on Post-Retirement Adjustments in Public Service Pensions, under which pensions based on eighth round and pre-eighth round pay levels will be increased sufficiently to offset the increase in the cost of living from November, 1959, to February, 1964. Thus, civil servants who retired before 15th December, 1959, and whose pensions are, therefore, based on seventh round pay levels, will have their pensions raised to compensate for the rise in the cost of living between November, 1959, and February, 1964.  The cost to the Exchequer of the increase, which will be effective from 1st August next, will be £400,000 this year and £600,000 in a full year.  By granting this increase recommended by a representative committee, the fourth consecutive budget increase to public service pensioners since 1962, the Government have given very fair consideration to their claims.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>These additional charges raise the budget deficit to £5.55 million and I propose to raise this amount by increasing the tobacco duties by the equivalent of 3½d. on the packet of twenty standard size cigarettes; the spirits duties by the equivalent of 2d. per glass; the petrol and oils duties by 3d. per gallon; the beer duties by the equivalent of 1d. per pint and the wine duties by 1/- per bottle, subject to allowance in all cases for the incidence of turnover tax.</P>
    <P>Before deciding to increase these main revenue duties I took account of the current and prospective consumption patterns of the commodities involved.  This year we are in the happy position that the yield from all these commodities has shown a marked buoyancy and it is clear that the increases I propose can be borne without serious adverse effects.</P>
    <P>In determining the amount of the increase in the case of the tobacco duties I have taken into account intimations received from manufacturers that because of increased costs under various heads they intended to increase <Col N="979" /> their selling prices in the immediate future and that the minimum practicable increase for cigarettes would be 1d. per twenty packet.  Settlement of the duty increase at the level of 3½d. per twenty will mean that a retail price increase of 4d. can be expected.  The tax increase adds about 4d. to the duty element in an ounce of pipe tobacco.  I understand that the manufacturers intend to increase their profit margins by 1d. per ounce so that, in general, the retail prices would advance by 5d. per ounce.  However, I am raising the existing rebate for hard-pressed tobaccos by 1d. per ounce and the price increases for these varieties, representing over 85 per cent of total production of pipe tobaccos, should not therefore exceed 4d. per ounce.</P>
    <P>In the case of the oils duties, the increase will be offset for diesel fuel used in road passenger services by an increase of 3d. per gallon in the present rate of repayment of duty. Bus passenger fares should not, therefore, be affected.  Hydrocarbon oils, other than petrol, will continue to be relieved completely from duty when used otherwise than as road fuel.</P>
    <P>It is of course too much to expect that these additional taxes will be popular but they are proposed in the conviction that it is an urgent social responsibility to improve the lot of the less fortunate members of our society and I hope they will be accepted in this spirit.  I would ask the man who takes a drink or smokes a cigarette to reflect that the slightly higher price he has to pay for his pleasure represents his contribution towards the relief of hardship amongst those who can rarely afford these luxuries.  If, however, it is to be effective, and cause no economic or social harm, this contribution must be made out of his own pocket and not be reduced to an empty gesture by being made a ground for recoupment through an increase in wages or salaries.</P>
    <P>Even with these changes, taxation in Ireland will still be lower than the average for Western European countries and Central Government current <Col N="980" /> expenditure will bear the same proportion to national production as last year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Miscellaneous</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a minor cleaning-up operation, I propose to provide in the Finance Bill for the abolition of certain excise licences which have outlived their original purpose and the trifling revenue from which does not justify their retention.</P>
    <P>Also, arising out of the enactment of the Pawnbrokers Act, 1964, I shall move a Financial Resolution specifying the amount of excise duty payable on pawnbrokers' licences.  The effect on revenue is insignificant.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax, Sur-Tax, Corporation Profits Tax and Stamp Duty</i>
    </P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that in November of last year the British Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that he would have a major change to propose in his 1965 budget, namely, that he would substitute a new corporation tax for the existing income tax and profits tax on companies.  My predecessor, Dr. Ryan, at once wrote to the Chancellor expressing his concern about the effects this proposal might have on our balance of payments position and also on the arrangements, which go back almost 40 years, between our two countries for the relief of double income tax.  In the course of his reply the Chancellor said he had been advised that there was no reason to suppose that residents of this country in particular were likely to be adversely affected by the change and that he would be happy to agree that there should be discussions at official level.  In the circumstances I am hopeful that it will be possible to arrive at a solution satisfactory to Irish interests.  The British proposals have now appeared in Finance Bill form and official discussions aimed at an appropriate revision of the double tax treaty will be held as soon as possible.  The new British corporation tax is not expressed to come into operation until 6th April, 1966, and until that date, at least, the present double taxation relief arrangements will remain fully effective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> In fulfilment of announcements already made, the Finance Bill will contain provisions extending the period of operation of three of our industrial tax incentives, namely the exports relief, the mining relief and the double initial allowances for capital expenditure.  The Bill will include two other incentive reliefs.  It will provide for the writing off of capital expenditure by traders on scientific research in one year instead of over five years as at present and for relief from stamp duty in the case of schemes for reconstruction and amalgamation of companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill will implement certain outstanding recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation. First, it will provide that, where a business is carried on in partnership, each partner will be assessed to income tax separately on his share of the profits.  This will enable partnership profits to be brought within the ambit of the system introduced in 1963 and known as &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo;.  Secondly, the Bill will repeal section 14 of the Finance Act, 1944, under which in certain circumstances the profits of a subsidiary company might be treated for purposes of corporation profits tax as profits of its parent.  And thirdly, in certain cases where at present the decision of the Special Commissioners on claims for income tax relief is final, the taxpayer will be given the right to a rehearing by the Circuit Court judge and both the taxpayer and the Revenue a right of appeal by way of case stated to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I might mention that I propose also to authorise Inspectors of Taxes to admit late appeals against assessments in appropriate cases&mdash;a power reserved under existing law to the Special Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Special Commissioners will be empowered, where they postpone or adjourn the hearing of an appeal against an assessment to income tax or corporation profits tax, to direct that a suitable payment on account should be made.  They already have this power in relation to surtax.</P>
    <P>To meet the requirements of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; in a case where <Col N="982" /> property changes hands in a year of assessment, there will be a provision for apportionment of Schedule A and Schedule B assessments.  The necessity to have regard to tax in preparing apportionment accounts will thus be eliminated.  I also propose to terminate the provisions under which an occupier for the time being may be required to pay tax due by a former occupier.  It will no longer be necessary, therefore, for a purchaser to protect himself by obtaining a certificate under section 6 of the Finance Act, 1928.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; system will be fully operative with the new provisions in the Finance Bill. Combined with centralised collection, the system is already producing considerable administrative economies; but, if the maximum benefit is to be derived from the change, it is essential that all tax be paid promptly on receipt of the Collector-General's demand.  A section charging interest on overdue tax was introduced in 1962 and I hope it will not be necessary to take stronger measures.  Public co-operation is important because there are now no local collectors of taxes to call on taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1935, was introduced to ensure proper taxation of builders' profits and profits from speculative dealings in land.  The section has been found to be somewhat defective and I propose to strengthen it.  Financial Resolution No. 7 applies. Lands which continue to be used solely for agricultural purposes will not be affected by the new provisions.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1963, which imposed a general charge to income tax on profits from lettings of buildings and lands, included provisions to prevent avoidance of liability by the granting of short-term leases wholly or partly in consideration of premiums which in the normal course would not be taxable.  My attention has been drawn to a number of other devices whereby what in reality is rent may be received in the form of a capital sum.  I propose to insert in this year's Bill provisions to defeat such devices.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will continue for a <Col N="983" /> further three years the exemption from corporation profits tax granted to certain public utility companies and other concerns.</P>
    <P>The Income Tax Bill, 1964, which was intended to consolidate the Income Tax Acts up to and including the Finance Act, 1964, was circulated in February last.  It was indicated that the Minister for Finance would be glad to consider suggestions received up to 30th April, 1965, for alterations designed to perfect the Bill as a consolidating measure.  The Bill, of course, lapsed on the dissolution of the last Dáil but I would like to say that any suggested alterations received up to 30th June, 1965, will be considered.  When the suggestions have been examined, a formal consolidating Bill will be introduced covering also the provisions of the Finance Act, 1965, which will include some minor technical amendments of the code.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech last year my predecessor said he intended to examine how the facilities provided by the Finance Acts of 1957 and 1959 in relation to covenanted subscriptions for research and for teaching the natural sciences might be modified so as to prevent abuse, while leaving an adequate, though temporary, incentive for such subscriptions.  I am keeping this matter under review and may, indeed, have to withdraw the present privileges but I have decided to defer it for reconsideration next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Turnover Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>It has been contended that the Finance Act, 1963, does not make it clear that turnover tax is payable on moneys received for goods and services supplied by clubs to their members.  I propose to introduce a Financial Resolution, with effect from tomorrow, to remove any doubts in this connection.  The Resolution will also confirm, again with effect from tomorrow, that tax is payable where some person other than the seller receives the proceeds of a sale.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will contain a provision in regard to farmers who carry on a retail trade in their own produce. <Col N="984" /> Under the law as it stands, such a retail trade comes within the scope of the tax only if carried on through a shop.  This limitation has given rise to anomalies and the law will be amended to provide that, where retail sales by a farmer exceed £150 a month, tax will be payable whether the sales are made through a shop or otherwise. While the necessary Financial Resolution will be moved today the new provision will not come into operation until 1st August next.</P>
    <P>There will also be an amendment of the provision under which persons who sell goods procured from non-taxable sources are not obliged to register and account for tax unless their receipts exceed £250 a month.  There have been complaints from registered traders that the allowance of a tax-free limit as high as £250 has disturbed pre-existing patterns of trade in such commodities as fruit, vegetables and milk.  There is evidence to substantiate these complaints and I propose therefore, with effect from 1st August, 1965, to reduce the tax-free limit from £250 a month to £150 a month in the case of goods procured from non-taxable sources.</P>
    <P>Finally, I intend to provide machinery whereby an accountable person may appeal to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax in the case of disagreement with the Revenue Commissioners as to his liability to pay turnover tax in respect of a particular activity.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Death Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>In response to various representations for some relief of the estate duty payable on small estates, I intend, in estates not exceeding £15,000, to grant an abatement of the estate duty on benefits to which the deceased's widow or children under the age of sixteen years succeed.  The abatement will amount to £150 in the case of the widow and £100 in the case of each such child.  I also propose to abolish the legacy and succession duties on benefits derived from the deceased by his spouse, lineal ancestor or lineal descendant.</P>
    <P>Gifts made within three years of a donor's death are normally liable to death duties.  I propose to extend this <Col N="985" /> period to five years but, at the same time, to increase the exemption limit for gifts from £100 to £500.  Also, gifts made in consideration of marriage are exempt from duty.  To remove any doubts as to the scope of this exemption, legislation will be introduced expressly confining it to the parties to the marriage and the issue.</P>
    <P>I have been impressed by complaints of death duty avoidance and I propose to bring in provisions to deal with the situation.  The additional duty flowing from the anti-avoidance measures will, it is estimated, pay for the death duty reliefs.  I might mention that the Revenue Commissioners will soon publish in one volume the Acts relating to death duties.</P>
    <P Just="Center">3.  CAPITAL BUDGET, 1965/66</P>
    <P>As in recent years, a separate paper on the capital budget has been published.  The amount required for capital purposes in 1965/66 is almost £104 million.  This is broadly in line with the Second Programme projection when allowance is made for price increases.  Public capital expenditure last year came to £97.8 million, including £3.6 million for the purchase of the British and Irish Steam Packet Co. Ltd.  This year's programme shows an increase of £4½ million for housing and sanitary services, £1¼ million for schools, and £2 million for industrial grants and credit.</P>
    <P>The financing of this big programme of investment will not be easy.  As I have already mentioned, the two great external sources of capital, Great Britain and the United States, have, in the light of their overall balance of payments positions, taken steps to restrict capital outflows.  For us this means that for the current year even greater reliance than hitherto will have to be placed on home resources. As it is, the level of savings in this country, notwithstanding the big improvement of recent years, which owes so much to the good work of the Savings Committee, is below that of many progressive countries.  It is not too much to hope, however, that the upward trend will continue with the growth in our national product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> Loan repayments, small savings and receipts of Departmental Funds are expected to realise £33 million, leaving a balance of £36 million to be found.  Of this, £4.35 million will be paid by the Central Bank to meet our capital obligations to the IMF and World Bank to which I referred earlier. The traditional type of National Loan will be expected to make a large contribution and I hope for a substantial receipt also from a new type of security, the first issue of which I would now like to announce.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Bonds Issue</i>
    </P>
    <P>The subscription lists will open next Monday, 17 May.  The principal features of the new security will be:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  It will be issued in units of £100 with no limit on the amount that may be invested either by any individual or in total.</P>
    <P>(2)  It will not earn any interest but will be repaid in 1977 with the addition of a premium of 50 per cent. This premium will not be subject to tax.</P>
    <P>(3)  One in forty of all bonds issued will be drawn each year for immediate redemption at the full maturity value of £150.</P>
    <P>(4)  The security will be a charge on the Central Fund, it will be a trustee investment and will be quoted on the Dublin and Cork stock exchanges.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that this new security will make a worthwhile addition to our range of investments and that it will help considerably in the financing of the capital programme.  The substantial capital appreciation which can materialise long before the final redemption date in twelve years time should make it particularly attractive.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Decimalisation of Currency</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government decided in principle in February, 1962, to adopt a decimal currency.  A working Party was then set up representing the Central Bank, the Departments of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Posts and Telegraphs and the Revenue Commissioners, to advise on the appropriate time for adopting decimal currency and on the steps necessary to effect the change <Col N="987" /> in the most economical way.  The Working Party's Report will be published next week.  Interested parties and the general public were invited to submit their views to the Working Party and they will now have an opportunity of commenting on the conclusions in the Report before decisions are taken.</P>
    <P Just="Center">4.  CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has been traditionally regarded both as the holder and as the watchdog of the public purse.  It will continue in this necessary role.  It is essential that a central agency of Government should see both that no unnecessary expenditure of public moneys is incurred and that whatever is spent is spent to good purpose.  The Department has also been regarded within and outside the public service as a negative and even reactionary part of the State machine. Whatever truth there may have been in this in the past, it is certainly not true today, nor has it been true for many years.  It is my intention that the modern, progressive role of the Department will become more pronounced. The work of economic programming, both for the year ahead, as exemplified in this Budget, and for a period of years, as exemplified in the Second Programme, will continue to be coordinated and developed by the expert staff of the Department.  New techniques of economic, financial and personnel management will be studied and brought into operation.  I want to banish forever the idea that the Department of Finance is the enemy of other Departments of State.  I will encourage my Department to take initiatives in spheres that it might hitherto not have entered, to adopt an even more active promotional role, to associate with other Departments in the promotion and examination of new <Col N="988" /> ideas for our further social and economic development, to be a Department of whose existence a wider public will be conscious throughout the whole year and not only at budget time.</P>
    <P>This is my first budget and I think it can be fairly described as a social services budget.  It gives expression to the view of the Government&mdash;and indeed to the widespread feeling in the community&mdash;that it is desirable at this stage of economic development to mark in a special way the conviction that everyone in the community should benefit from the steady upward trend in national prosperity.  I think this has been achieved.  The increases which are proposed in social welfare payments extend beyond a mere cost of living adjustment.  They put those payments at a new and higher level.  The other aspects of social development have not been neglected.  Generous provision has been made for expenditure on education, health and housing.  At the same time the budget, in the sums which are being made available for economic services, acknowledges the basic fact that our economic progress depends on increased production.  In view of our balance of payments position, we must ensure the continued expansion of exports in order to sustain the improvement of the economy characteristic of recent years.  If increased production is to give a faster rise in employment as desired by the NIEC and by the Government, it must be directed to export markets, and increased productivity must therefore be applied, in part at least, to reduce prices and promote competitiveness. These are objectives which, if vigorously pursued, will give us a satisfactory rate of increase in employment at rising real levels of income.</P>

    <P>GENERAL NOTE:</P>
    <P>The figures in the table add up to the net total of the estimates published in the 1965/66 Estimates Volume after allowing for the revision of the 1965/66 estimates for voted capital services referred to in the Capital Budget paper and excluding the estimate for Posts and Telegraphs.  The reason for the exclusion of the estimate for Posts and Telegraphs is that, in the national income and expenditure accounts published by the Central Statistics Office, the Post Office is treated as a trading body and only its surplus of receipts over expenditure (with certain adjustments) appears as gross trading income.</P>
    <P>FOOTNOTES:</P>
    <P>(a) £934,000 deducted in 1964/65 and £414,000 deducted in 1965/66 for sale of cattle slaughtered under bovine tuberculosis eradication and brucellosis eradication schemes.</P>
    <P>(b) Includes grant of £1,350,000 in 1964/65 and £1,847,000 in 1965/66 to An Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>(c) Includes interest portion of liability under Land Acts which is treated finally as a subsidy.</P>
    <P>(d) Payment to Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>(e) Includes £9,422,000 in 1964/65 and £12,500,000 in 1965/66&mdash;agricultural grants paid into Guarantee Fund and subsequently paid to Local Authorities.</P>
    <P>(f) £2,000 deducted for refunds of housing grants in 1964/65 and 1965/66.</P>
    <P>(g) £10,000 deducted for sales of property (Vote 9) in 1964/65 and (Vote 8) in 1965/66.</P>
    <P>(h) Includes £4,500,000 grant-in-aid to An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>(i) Grants to An Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>(j) Includes principal portion of liability under Land Acts which is treated finally as a capital grant to enterprises.</P>

      <P>The Budget the Minister for Finance has just introduced comes very shortly after the conclusion of a general election and it is true to say, I think, that on that account his Budget has been awaited with considerable interest by all Members of this House, but particularly by the Fine Gael Party, because we fought the recent general election in support of a just society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We drew public attention to the existence of social injustice and poverty in our community, to the poor housing, to the inadequate health services, to the limited educational facilities, to the neglect of the aged and the handicapped, and to many other defects in our social system which ought not to exist and which should be remedied. Our proposals in relation to a just society were countered during the election campaign by the Fianna Fáil Party.  They queried whether what we advocated could be done and the ability of the financial resources of the country to provide for the things we advocated.  I think we can say fairly now that such measures of social relief as this Budget contains are due in large degree to the efforts of the Fine Gael Party.  We welcome what the Minister proposes to do.  This is the Minister's first Budget and I am confident he feels considerable pleasure in introducing a Budget that can be termed an approach to a just society.</P>

      <P>It is not often that a Minister for Finance has such a pleasure and it is a happy augury, I think, that Deputy Lynch, as Minister for Finance, should be doing in his very first Budget so many of the things we felt it was possible to do.  But, while we welcome what is being done, we regard the proposals in the Budget today as merely a first step on the road towards a just society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A Budget based on the principles of social justice <Col N="1004" /> should provide many things for which there is no provision in this Budget today.  It should provide for the raising of standards generally, for a re-organisation of our health services, for the provision of proper services for the mentally and physically handicapped, for the extension of retirement pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions to the large numbers in our community not covered by existing legislation, for the extension of adequate educational opportunities to all our children and for the provision of a proper youth programme.  We hope all these things will be achieved in due course and it will be the concern of the Fine Gael Party here in opposition in the Dáil and throughout the country to press forward towards the achievement as rapidly as possible of a just society.</P>
      <P>The increase of 10/- a week for the old age pensioner with little or no means is an act of public recognition of the appalling poverty in which many of our aged live.  But we should not be too complacent.  Remember, what is proposed in this Budget today, added to what has been proposed already for the provision of other social services, a total sum of something in the region of £86 million, represents only 34 per cent of public expenditure on these services. Two years ago the figure was 37 per cent.  In fact, this year we are providing a percentage less towards these desirable services&mdash;social welfare, health and education&mdash;than we did a few years ago.  It is true that the percentage of the gross national product, with the increase this year, is about the same as last year.  While more is being done, we should not be too complacent or feel we have achieved everything by doing what it is proposed to do today.</P>
      <P>Since we welcome the social welfare proposals in this Budget, it is not our intention to oppose, apart from certain exceptions, the necessary taxation to provide the moneys for them.  We will query one item of taxation because of its possible effect on the cost of living and on prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make this comment?  For the second year the Minister for Finance has come into this House to tax beer, <Col N="1005" /> tobacco and spirits and petrol.  These are the items of taxation which, two years ago in the Budget of 1963, we were told could bear no further taxation.  It is worth recalling and recording that these items&mdash;beer, tobacco, spirits and petrol&mdash;which were supposed to have reached saturation point in 1963, therefore rendering the turnover tax necessary and inevitable, are now being asked to yield a further total of close on £11 million.  There it is.  The fact is that the first three of these items&mdash;beer, spirits and tobacco &mdash;apparently were felt to be capable of bearing the taxation now proposed; and, as they are being taxed for a worthwhile and desirable object, the taxation appears to us to be socially just.</P>
    <P>May I pass just one comment on the tobacco tax?  This year, unlike last year, the Minister for Finance proposes to extend the taxation to all forms of pipe tobacco, including hard pressed tobacco.  The Minister must realise that in doing that he is taxing the very tobacco which the old age pensioner may in many instances be in the habit of smoking.  The Minister is doing it as of now, while the increase in the old age pension will not operate until 1st August.  When we come to discuss the Resolution, I certainly will suggest to the Minister that the taxation he has proposed on that item in his Budget Statement should be reformed in some way to provide an exclusion.</P>
    <P>We will have reservations, which will be expressed later, in relation to the petrol tax, because of its possible effect on the distributive trade and on the level of prices.  It would, in our view, be disastrous if anything were done in the Budget by the Government which would in any way add further to the cost of living problem and to the prices situation.  It is worth recalling in relation to prices that there has been in the past 18 months a very significant rise in consumer prices.  From August 1963 to February of this year, the increase has been over 11 per cent. This is a highly dangerous trend and certainly we feel this proposed tax may cause difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> Having said that in relation to taxation, I think it is a pity, when the Minister was taxing the way he did, he did not search around perhaps for other objects of taxation which, in a Budget of this kind, might be thought desirable.  Dancehalls used to be taxed. I do not know whether the Minister has considered the reimposition of a tax of that kind.  We can all recollect the circumstances in which that form of tax was remitted.  Perhaps there are other items that might have been considered.</P>
    <P>May I say a word or two in relation to other aspects of the Budget, or perhaps other things which are not in this Budget?  This Budget is introduced at the end of the first year of the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> I wonder have the people of the country, or indeed many Deputies, bothered to consider what this Second Programme means or what it is designed to attain?  It is worth noting that under the provisions of the Programme and its organisation, there is a Council, known as the National Industrial Economic Council. It is the duty of that Council, on the eve of the Budget, to give advice to the Government in relation to the year just concluded.  We have had the benefit this year for the first time of the advice extended to the Government by the National Industrial Economic Council. That Council referred the Government to certain features of the economy which appeared to require attention.  In particular, the comments of the Council referred to the fact that the increase in employment this year was not in accordance with the targets and aims in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>Deputies will perhaps be aware there has been a decrease of some 10,000 people in employment on the land of Ireland.  There has been an increase of some 13,000 in industrial employment.  There is, therefore, a net increase in employment of 3,000.  That represents a percentage increase of .4. While that is desirable, the Council point out the fact that under the Second Programme it was envisaged the increase this year would be .7.  In other words, about half the increase in <Col N="1007" /> employment has in fact been achieved. I would have thought, in a Budget at the end of the first year of this Programme, this factor would have been borne in mind by the Minister for Finance and that he might have indicated certain steps he intended to take or plan for this year to step up the rate of employment, particularly as he was given, in the second paragraph of the NIEC submission, advice as to the four steps which should be taken as a matter of urgency to deal with what appeared to be the slow rate of employment. I am sorry the Budget does not contain any indication as to whether any of the steps suggested in this Report have been considered or adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>Again, I think it is worth reminding Deputies that, in this the end of the first year of this Programme, as recorded in the Report of the National Industrial Economic Council, it appears that emigration this year ran at the rate of 25,000 people.  In the Second Programme it was hoped that emigration might be reduced to a rate of 18,000 people, but at the conclusion of the first year, the rate of emigration is 40 per cent higher.  What do the Government say about that?  There is nothing in the Budget about it.  The National Industrial Economic Council draw attention to the fact that we have an emigration rate of 25,000 people at the end of the first year of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Where are we going? Surely these matters should have engaged the attention of the Minister for Finance, and some indication should have been given of his plans for the future.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Economic Council also draw attention to the fact that in the course of this year there has been an unemployment rate of 58,000 people.  With emigration at a rate of 25,000 people in the year, and unemployment at the rate of 58,000, that certainly does not call for any display of ministerial complacency as to the state of the economy.  It is in relation to matters of this kind that <Col N="1008" /> in the NIEC Report there is a disturbing reference to what appears to have been a down-turn in the volume of industrial production in the first quarter of this year.  It certainly appears that the growth of the volume of industrial production has slowed down.  That may be a temporary feature, and it may be due in large measure, as the review for the first quarter of the year mentions, to the effects of the building strike and the delayed reaction from it.  It is a fact that there has been a slowing down.</P>
    <P>In the Report this fact is referred to, and the Government are asked, as a matter of urgency, to keep under review preparations for the taking of any necessary corrective action.  Again, it is a pity we have not heard from the Minister what, if any, corrective action the Government propose to take in relation to any possible down-turn in the economy.</P>
    <P>We have heard from the Minister&mdash; and it is referred to in the various documents circulated prior to the Budget&mdash; reference to the economic growth rate increase of 4.2 per cent.  There is a real danger that people hearing this mentioned, and repeated by Ministers, may think everything is fine, that the sun is shining, and the future is rosy, but the fact is that this rate of economic growth is low when compared with Western Europe.  Certainly if it is the target for our activities here, it means that in the foreseeable future we will not have solved the problem of providing here at home decent employment for a larger number of people.  A growth of four per cent which is aimed at next year means that at least 18,000 people will emigrate, and that we will still have to carry a large number of unemployed people.</P>
    <P>All this is the result of the manner in which economic development is now being carried on.  The policy being pursued is aiming, on the basis of past experience, at targets which may or may not be achieved.  Economic programming may have its advantages, but it certainly has its disadvantages if it consists, as this programme appears to consist, of hazy hopes, and if they are not achieved, one just shrugs one's shoulders and says: &ldquo;Maybe we will do better next year.&rdquo;<Col N="1009" /> We in the Fine Gael Party believe that the need of this country in the competitive age in which we live is economic planning.  We propose in Opposition to advocate&mdash;and we hope eventually to impress on a large majority of our people&mdash;the urgent necessity for economic planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Budget, the attitude of the Labour Party will be consistent with the attitude we have adopted over the past six or seven years.  It is true that in the Budgets introduced in the past six or seven years certain concessions were given to social welfare recipients, in particular, the old age pensioners who were granted an extra 2/6 per week.  With those concessions to those people there were also&mdash;there were always, I should say&mdash;tax proposals.  We have been criticised by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, in particular, who said that while we wanted social welfare benefits, we would not vote for the tax proposals to finance them.  Our retort to that was that we voted against those proposals because we believed that out of the new money raised, a fair proportion was not being given to the social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>As I said, we will be consistent on this Budget.  We recognise that in it an effort is being made to help the social welfare recipients, and that there is a break-through particularly so far as the old age pensioners are concerned.  While we have a view and a policy in regard to taxation, and particularly in respect to the emphasis by the Government on indirect taxation, we concede that we have no serious objection to these proposals as an interim measure.  These taxes are being raised in order to ensure that the social welfare recipients will receive the increases proposed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the 28th or 29th Budget introduced by Fianna Fáil in the past 33 years.  Let us concede that improvements have been made&mdash;in our opinion never enough, and in our opinion through wrong taxes.  It has taken a long time, and the old age pensioners have had to wait a long time for a greater measure of social <Col N="1010" /> justice.  In this they have got a greater measure of social justice than has heretofore been given them.  I think the Taoiseach is an astute man. He learned a lesson in the last general election.  I do not care who takes credit for it, whether it is a Fine Gael plan or a Fianna Fáil plan.  In any case, I think the people who voted for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour&mdash; and it should be remembered that we increased our votes substantially&mdash;told the Government and the Taoiseach that, in their view, they were prepared to make a sacrifice in order to ensure that this section of the community should get a little more of the national cake.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are gratified by the result of our pressure.  We have been consistent in that, as far as social welfare is concerned, not for the past two years or 12 months but generally throughout the past three or four decades.  In any case, we must give credit to the new Minister for Finance for making this, in the main, a social welfare Budget.  Until we have more details about the social welfare proposals, it is not possible for us to comment on them in detail.  Frankly, I do not like this new means test.  What it entails I cannot say.  I do not know how many old age pensioners and non-contributory recipients have less than £26 a year.  I suspect, and I may be wrong, that the greater portion of old age pensioners and widows have no means whatsoever.  I hope I am right in that because it will mean that the vast majority of them will receive the maximum of 10/-.  In any case, I think nobody welcomes the idea of an added means test as far as non-contributory old age pensioners are concerned.</P>
    <P>People will say, when I make the criticism that August or January is too long to wait, that when I was Minister for Social Welfare I did the same thing.  That is true, but is it not possible to introduce, not alone in this year but in future years, these proposals at an earlier date?  The old age pensioners, widows, unemployed and sick people and all those in the social assurance and social assistance groups <Col N="1011" /> will find it difficult to understand why they should have to wait until August to get their increases when public servants on being granted a pay award invariably get it retrospectively to, say, last November or last February. Deputies, of course, do not get retrospective payment.  I know there are administrative difficulties involved in this.  I know that on one occasion when the question of an increase arose old age pensioners were told by telegram that they were entitled to get a certain amount extra.  I still have a copy of such a telegram.</P>
    <P>August is too far away, particularly in regard to the old age pensioners. Some of them I am sure will be pleased when they hear the announcement that they will get 10/-.  A lot of them are not in very good health, and it will be another three, four or five months before they get the increase. This may not be possible to arrange this year, but, surely, an effort should be made in future years, by officials of the Department of Social Welfare, to ensure that this money will be given in a far quicker time.  In any case, I trust the attitude displayed by the new Minister for Finance as far as social welfare recipients are concerned will be continued.  He said that the ten per cent increase provides for more than the increase in the cost of living; I presume he means this since they got the last increase.  I do not think we should relate old age pensioners, in present circumstances, to cost of living. You cannot talk about cost of living compensations to people who have been in receipt in £1, 27/6, 32/6 and 37/6.  There is no question at all of compensating them for an increase in the cost of living.  What we should be trying to do, and I trust this is a first step by the Minister for Finance, is to ensure that social welfare recipients will have a proper standard of living.</P>
    <P>One thing that concerns me is how all these increases can be carried out on £3,220,000 in the remainder of the year.  It may be that the burden in respect of non-contributory widows and non-contributory old age pensioners has diminished gradually in the past five or six years because of <Col N="1012" /> the introduction of the contributory old age pension scheme.  However, we can discuss this more fully when the Minister for Social Welfare brings in the Bill to implement these proposals.</P>
    <P>Whilst these concessions are welcome, the new Minister for Finance between now and the next Budget ought to apply himself to an examination of the general taxation system. I know he holds the view, and he has demonstrated his view and the view of the Government in this Budget, that there should be more indirect taxation. We believe that money can be got from other sources&mdash;perhaps not any substantial amount, but every million pounds means 2/6d or more for old age pensioners.  When we make proposals for direct taxation on capital gains, I do not think it is proper for a Minister to delay concessions when there is not much money involved. If there is money to be collected, there are people who can afford to pay it. I think Ministers for Finance should go after that kind of money in order to relieve the people on whom indirect taxation falls heavily.  We must remember that while we have the taxation on cigarettes, tobacco and drink, we still have the turnover tax implanted in our taxation code.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing for the country that we had a general election.  I had some doubts as to whether or not the turnover tax would have remained at 2½ per cent, were it not for the general election.  The Taoiseach made an announcement during the election campaign that there would not be an increase in the turnover tax this year.  I think it was a lucky thing he was heckled for I believe it was in reply to heckling that he said this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not convinced, even though discussing the Budget of 1965, that the Government will not increase the turnover tax, again in order to relieve themselves of the trouble of looking for money from other sources.  I thought in this Budget there would be an attempt to exclude certain items from the turnover tax&mdash; food, clothing and footwear, and <Col N="1013" /> certain other essentials.  We still have it and if there is to be any tinkering with the turnover tax and any adjustment considered, serious consideration should be given to the freeing of foods and certain other essential items from taxation.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House because the Minister for Finance has been on his feet a long time.  However, I should like to mention a few things quickly and I hope in the general debate to be able to deal with them in a more detailed way.  Deputy T. F. O'Higgins spoke about employment. Things seem to be going all right according to all these books we have. Gross national product is still maintaining an increase of 2.4 per cent.  The balance of payments, whilst the biggest ever, is not a cause for alarm.  Industrial production has been going up, even though there was a decline in the latter part of last year&mdash;due to a 15 per cent surcharge, a building strike, and so on. One good feature is that agricultural production increased last year, the first for a long time.  These are all good signs and, having regard to our history and background, the real test of progress is employment.</P>
      <P>We have fallen down badly on that. Boasting about the increase in industrial production is all right but we have to consider the over-all figures.  These figures tell me, according to pre-Budget statistics, that in the past five years, from 1960 to 1964, inclusive, the number of extra jobs provided in this country was 4,000.  These are figures produced by the Government.  The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> talks in terms of an extra 78,000 new jobs between 1960 and 1970.  So far, we have 4,000 new jobs, which means our task between 1965 and 1970 will be quite a formidable one indeed.  It means we will have to create an average of 15,000 new jobs per year.  There does not seem to be any sign that we are going to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remarks made by the National Industrial Economic Council should be taken as a warning by the Government, that while in other spheres progress is good, we are not getting a real result. They have made, to my mind, excellent <Col N="1014" /> suggestions as to how this business of getting increased employment can be effected.  The NIEC are certainly perturbed, to say the least, about this. Other countries in Europe, which are small, have not the same problem as we have here.  We have a situation here where the figures for unemployment have shown no change whatsoever in the past five or six years.  We still have five per cent of our insurable workers unemployed.  We had the same number unemployed, in March of this year, as we had in March, 1962, and in March, 1961.</P>
    <P>The other alarming thing about this is that emigration is increasing.  I remember the Minister for Transport and Power making a boast here about two years ago to the effect for the year ending February of the particular year, emigration was only something like 11,000 to 12,000.  The figure for emigration for the year ending February of this year, was 27,400.  I do not consider there is any room for complacency as far as economic progress is concerned because it is not reflected in increased employment, decreased unemployment or decreased emigration.</P>
    <P>Let me say this, again.  This is a good day for social welfare recipients but there are many other problems which have to be tackled.  We have to tackle health, education and particularly the building of houses.  I, therefore, suggest that the Government ought to have another look at their <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i>  They certainly should have another look at the progress report for 1964.  I am sure they have done that and, having done that, they must make up their minds that, as far as progress is concerned, the best indication of our success is increased business and less emigration.</P>

      <P>This section imposes a duty on petrol and diesel oil.  While I understand from the Minister's speech there is a relief in respect of diesel, if used in buses, I take it, in respect of trains run by diesel, there is also a relief. I assume while the freight section in CIE and other companies is run on diesel, a great number of smaller distributors use petrol-driven vans for the distribution of goods.  This will increase the cost of distribution and affects prices, as Deputy T. F. O'Higgins pointed out.  We believe it is not necessary in order to finance the reliefs which have been proposed because the tables given indicate there is sufficient revenue available from tobacco, beer, spirits and wine to cover the proposals which include extra payments to social welfare, agriculture and special services payments without the addition of this tax. This tax will, in effect, increase the cost of distribution and thereby affect prices and, as such, we propose to vote against it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be only just that some exclusion be made in respect of hard pressed tobacco, which I call plug tobacco?  If he does so agree, could he indicate in what way it could be excluded from this duty? If it cannot be done at present, I hope it can be considered at a later stage when I may move an appropriate amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to that appeal.  Last year, hard plug was excluded and I submit the Minister would be well advised <Col N="1027" /> to except the old people who use hard plug.  The amount involved would not be so significant because not many use hard plug.</P>

      <P>All pipe smokers are wealthy people.  It would not be possible to make an exclusion.  The old man who smokes three ounces a week would have an extra cost of about 1/- a week.  As I mentioned in my Budget Statement, I have given an extra rebate on hard pressed tobacco in order to depress the increase by a penny on hard pressed tobacco as compared with 5d. on flaked tobaccos.</P>

      <P>The duty is being imposed now and the old age pensioner who survives until 1st August next will have to pay the extra amount this duty is aimed at.  I am sorry to hear the Minister, so soon after becoming Minister for Finance, deducting that this imposes only 1/- a week on the average person.  A shilling a week to the Minister or myself, pipe smokers, may be very little but to an old age pensioner between now and August, it will amount to 10/-.  Will the Minister give them all a bonus of 10/- on 1st August?  Administratively, it <Col N="1028" /> would be possible.  Leave the duty on but give a double 10/- on 1st August.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in his opening statement on this Vote delivered a brief which runs to some 23 columns in the Official Report and I note with considerable disappointment that he devotes only three-quarters of a column to the essential matter of prices, which governs to a tremendous degree all activities in industry and commerce.  It affects incomes, affects the balance of trade and it can depress or accelerate the rate of economic growth.  Notwithstanding the vital and essential part prices play in our whole economy, all the Minister can say on the matter can be concentrated into three-quarters of a column in a 23-column brief.  Even at that, it amounts to no more than an apologia for the inactivity of the Government in the whole field of price control.</P>
      <P>At the same time as we have inactivity on the Government's part in relation to prices, we have the same Government perpetually complaining about the inflationary trend caused by increases in wages.  We had this in the famous Whittaker report; we had it adopted as official Fianna Fáil policy that wages must be kept to the lowest possible figure because they and they alone are condemned by Fianna Fáil as being the inflationary trigger-factor in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prices include an element of profit and profit is a form of income.  We in Fine Gael condemn the Fianna Fáil Government for their consistent failure over the past seven years to have a proper incomes policy, that is, a policy which would regulate not only wage incomes and salary incomes but which would also regulate incomes from non-wage and non-salary sources, and that includes incomes which can be earned from profits.  I do not for one moment want to sabotage the incentive which profits give to the <i>entrepreneur</i> to <Col N="1038" /> expand his industry, to increase his production and to increase opportunities for earning more profit, but what we in Fine Gael say is that if there is to be an increase in national wealth, it should be shared equally and no section of the community should be permitted to hold up to ransom the remainder of the community by enjoying excessive profits.</P>
    <P>The Government's only policy in relation to prices is to be found in the 1958 Prices Act.  The Minister said that the Government had used to the full the powers under the Prices Act, 1958 and he asked the House to accept that as being sufficient.  We do not accept that he has used to the full the powers in that Act.  We do say that even if he did, we still have the inflationary spiral such as we have had over the past few years and which from August, 1963 to date has meant an increase in prices of 11 per cent. The effect of all that is that national wage and salary agreements are not going to meet with the confidence of the workers.  We feel that a sensible incomes policy is necessary and that it means the difference between stability and a firm distribution of national wealth on the one hand, and the type of anarchy and lack of planned advance which we have had over the past few years.  The Minister said the price control&mdash;or shall we say, the price superintendence&mdash;which they have, worked because of the vigilance of the consuming public.  That I suppose is a backhanded compliment to the Opposition but whenever I have heard members of the Opposition being vigilant about prices, they have always been told that the horse had gone and it was too late to lock the stable door. However, all the efforts of the Government amount to locking the door when the horse is gone.</P>
    <P>We do not think that it is a sensible price control measure.  We would prefer to see the kind of machinery they have in Norway, Holland, Belgium, Austria and other countries where price increases cannot take place without prior notice to the national agencies which advise on prices.  That is the sensible way of doing it.  to have advance indications <Col N="1039" /> given so that consideration can be given before the price increases take place, instead of what we have had under our administration where prices have increased, and after they have increased, the whole tedious machinery of the State is applied, in some instances, and by the time a report and recommendations are brought in a year or more later, circumstances have changed again.  In most cases as we know, this heavy and slow-moving machinery has simply confirmed the justification for the increased price.  If prior warning had been given a year or so before, there would have been an opportunity of preventing the increase taking place.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the OECD report on prices and profits and non-wage incomes emphasised the success which price control had in Norway.  It stated that in Norway regulations of varying types, some quite general, others more specific, applied to prices or distributive margins of goods and services, accounting for about half of the total rate of the consumer price index.  It goes on to state that:</P>
    <P>The Norwegian authorities believe that effective supervision of prices and profits, backed up by appropriate statutory powers, are essential to win the confidence of the wage earners that the authorities both in principle aim at and in practice are able to achieve, a satisfactory control of the development of non-wage incomes.</P>
    <P>It is open to us to apply the same machinery here.</P>
    <P>We should certainly in principle aim at&mdash;and if we aim at, we have every opportunity and prospect of achieving in practice&mdash;that reasonable degree of control of elements in prices and as long as we carry on the &ldquo;I-couldn't-care-less&rdquo; attitude of the Government, we are going to have that inflationary spiral continued.  The experience of people over the duration of the existing National Wage Agreement is such as to urge them when the next wage agreement comes to be negotiated, to ask for more than the <Col N="1040" /> economy can perhaps spare because their experience has been that while they have been asked to accept 12 per cent, the incomes and profits of others have been allowed to drift without any control at all.</P>
    <P>This was emphasised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently when they pointed out that in a period during which wages were restrained to a figure of an eight per cent increase, profits increased by 46 per cent.  It seems to us to be totally inequitable that one section of the community can enjoy an increase of something like 46 per cent and during the same time the worker should be asked to accept only eight per cent.  The kind of rational policy which we should like to have applied would prevent that kind of thing developing.  The machinery which would be a required to implement this would be a supervisory tribunal on which management and workers and the Government would have representation.</P>
    <P>I think there has been an acceptance in recent times here of the need for economic forecasts and we have had a considerable amount of forecasting in economic and financial matters.  It is also only sensible that we should try to estimate and forecast what should be the appropriate increase in incomes not only for the wage earner but also for the non-wage earner and income earner because with both of these factors known and having information on prices generally, such a tribunal if it had the confidence of the trade unions and the confidence of the consumers, would be able to set certain guides within which prices could move. If the tribunal were established, the producers of the goods or the fixers of the prices would also have confidence in its recommendations and judgement.</P>
    <P>I do not ask for the imposition of emergency price control which might be justified in war time.  We do not think that is necessary, desirable or practicable but we say there must be a coming to grips with the whole question of prices, of incomes, of wage incomes and non-wage incomes, and if we do not do that, all the efforts and <Col N="1041" /> forecasts in economic and financial matters will go astray.  We already know that the country is off-target so far as the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is concerned: we know from what we heard today that the Government have not taken the necessary corrective measures to put the national economy back on target and if, in addition to that, we also allow the drift to continue in matters of prices, then we shall return to the stage of anarchy and the ludicrous situation in which a great deal of money and effort is being spent on economic forecasts which will go astray because of the indifference the Government have displayed in matters of prices.</P>
    <P>Another serious omission from the Minister's statement concerns industrial relations.  I can think of no two more universal elements in economic life than prices, on the one hand, and industrial relations, on the other.  In his 23-column brief, which the Minister has now put on the records of the House, we find that while prices got three-quarters of a column, we fare even worse in relation to industrial relations to which a half-column is devoted.  We think this is most unfortunate and it is about time the Government ceased running away from that extremely awkward but very fundamental problem.  We are led to believe that the new Parliamentary Secretary, whom we all wish well, is being asked to concern himself with this problem.  We would hope he will do so and that we shall have an end to the appalling history of industrial disputes which we have here.</P>
    <P>Many people like to boast of the fact that we have good labour conditions and that we have little trouble in the labour sphere but compared with some other countries, our experience in recent years is disastrous.  In one recent year, for instance, we find that while we had a loss of 43.9 working days per 1,000 people, Germany had only 1.2; the Netherlands also only had 1.2 working days lost and Sweden had only .4 of a working day lost due to industrial disputes.  We must try to achieve a similar target here.</P>
    <P>The recently-published <i>Statistical <Col N="1042" /> Abstract</i> for 1964 also shows that trend has continued.  The figures I have quoted were.  I think, for 1959 and some years since then have been worse. In the year 1961, the number of working days lost per 1,000 of the population was 135; in 1962, it was about 47 working days and in 1963, it went up again to 83 working days lost, due to industrial disputes.  There are two sides to every dispute and there has been a tendency on the part of some people to blame the worker for all such disputes.  Last year we had a Government sunk in a mire of internal dispute allowing a crippling industrial dispute to last here for several months and it only came to an end with a Government crisis and a Minister resigning. At least he had the courage and integrity to resign: there were others who held the same view as he still holds about unions and workers because if there were not other members of the Government who held the same views as Deputy Smith, the Government would not have failed to act&mdash;as they did&mdash;for three months.</P>
    <P>In any case the Government had a crisis and as a result the dispute which had reached deadlock was suddenly resolved.  We do not want that kind of thing to continue&mdash;not that I am in the least worried about a crisis in the Government: that would be a good thing for the country as we know from the past&mdash;but we do not want further industrial disputes to develop because of the lack of prior consultation, because of the lack of thought beforehand.  They drift into stalemate of confusion and bitterness.  It should be possible to develop industrial machinery which would avoid these disputes at the beginning.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Donegan, the Fine Gael spokesman on Industry and Commerce, opened the debate for the Opposition, he referred to the success of the joint labour councils in certain industries on which both the staff and management are represented.  He spoke of the high degree of success which these committees have had.  He mentioned that they did not have entire agreement, that they had their arguments and differences but that they had been reasoned out in a sensible <Col N="1043" /> manner and had been hammered out on the whole successfully without having to resort to industrial action. That is the kind of thing we need.</P>
    <P>In Germany, where they have a loss of working days only one-fortieth of ours, as I have mentioned, they have work councils in all industries employing more than 50 people.  It is compulsory.  The law of the land so requires it.  It may well be that we need to take action of a similar kind here to make it compulsory to have these joint labour committees or these work councils. There may be a great deal to be said for having these based like the old craft unions on the particular industries rather than leaving the settling of all disputes to an outside body like a labour court.  Quite clearly, the Government will have to tackle this problem.  It is a problem in which the whole community has a right to speak.  It is a problem which affects the whole economy.  Unless there is a grappling with it we will be unable to reach the targets which have been set for this country for 1970.</P>
    <P>There are other possible improvements which could be applied in industrial relations.  One of these would be the requirement that a longer term of notice be given by employers before dismissal of employees.  A corollary to that would be that employees would have to give longer notice to employers.  This appears to be a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  Practice requires long notice to be given for many forms of contracts, such as the supply of goods or services or housing accommodation.  All these are a great deal less important than the question of human labour.  If practice and legislation have required ample notice to be given for the discontinuance of services of another kind, we think it is time our social contracts imposed the need to give longer notice before terminating employment whatever obligations might flow as a consequence.</P>
    <P>Incentive bonus schemes and profit sharing are things which many managers and employers are afraid of. There is a need for Governmental action to suggest lines to employers which would make it relatively easy <Col N="1044" /> to have such incentive bonus schemes and profit sharing.  It may well be that it would require some measure of tax relief or some other form of fiscal incentive to get these things going but if we are to achieve the rate of growth which we hope for these things must be implemented and that must be done very soon.</P>
    <P>The much vaunted <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisages that we will be short of 100,000 necessary jobs by 1970.  If we fail in the least to be on target, even for that disappointing goal, then we will have an appalling social and economic mess here.  We are only five years from 1970 and we cannot afford to drift any further in industrial relations and in prices.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a need for true human equality to express itself in industry.  This can only be achieved if there is complete confidence between management and staff.  We are drifting far away from that kind of Christian objective and I would certainly hope that the Government together with employers and trade unions would be able to achieve a degree of industrial happiness commensurate with what is already experienced in Germany, Holland, Sweden and other places.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid some glowing tributes to the Fair Trade Commission. Many of us found it very interesting to discover that the Commission was alive at all because it has been noted more for its inactivity over recent years than for anything else.  The Minister mentioned, for instance, that the Commission had inquired into practices in the intoxicating liquor trade and said that the Commission are satisfied that there was no collective action taken to enforce enhanced prices and that a reasonable element of competition exists.  One would like to know what exactly the Minister and the Commission have in mind when they speak of &ldquo;a reasonable element of competition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One case which has been brought to the notice of the Commission in recent times, and I understand also to the Minister's notice, is one in which a licensed beer wholesaler, a Dublin <Col N="1045" /> concern, which has a licence from the courts to carry on a business as a licensed beer wholesaler, has been refused supplies by a number of breweries.  It would appear that there is a tendency for all breweries here to channel their output into the one distribution concern.  It appears to be entirely wrong that supplies should be denied to legitimate beer wholesalers and one would like to know the reason behind this limitation of distribution. I would hope that the Minister and the Commission would look into that matter.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion within the past year to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would take steps to render void clauses in mortgages and leases which compel the mortgagors and lessees to insure properties with particular insurance companies.  This is another activity in which the Minister and the Fair Trade Commission are empowered to take action.  It is about time they did.  At present, quite a number of mortgagors and ground landlords compel people to insure with particular insurance companies.  Many of these companies have their headquarters outside the State and the result of this is that premiums for necessary fire insurance are being paid to companies which in turn are investing the money outside the State.</P>
    <P>I know there has been an increase in the amount of money invested by insurance companies here, even those that are foreign-owned, but it is clearly unfair practice to require people to insure with any particular company. There are often cases where people are agents for particular insurance companies and if they insure with the insurance companies in question they are entitled to whatever agency fee is going.  Also, some people like to keep a portfolio of insurances with the one company.  Clauses of this nature are clearly unfair and are unnecessary and the sole justifiction for them would appear to be that the mortgagees or lessors in question, by imposing this condition, are able to make whatever agency profit is afforded to them.  There appears to be no social justification whatever for <Col N="1046" /> maintaining these restrictive clauses and I do think the Minister and his Department and the Fair Trade Commission should take some action in connection with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department also concern themselves with the question of hire purchase transactions.  I am not too sure what the exact figure is for the amount outstanding on hire purchase transactions at the moment but it is somewhere in the region of £28 million to £30 million.  That is a great deal of money, even if you say it quickly.  Unfortunately, a great deal of that money has been put out on unsound hire purchase transactions and there are quite a number of unsound transactions and of questionable contractual credit transactions which I think the Minister should take action to control.  The old moneylenders, the old money extortionists and the pawnbroker, who is a respected member of the community, are declining in number.  There are not so many of them going around now as there used to be.  These have been replaced by a number of sharp-practice hire purchase operators.</P>
    <P>We have asked here from these benches for a control of hire purchase transactions at people's houses.  This has become a serious social evil in parts of Dublin, particularly in the housing estates occupied by workers.  Cases have come to notice where housewives in serious financial trouble have entered into hire purchase transactions for a washing machine or some other unit of household equipment where they are clearly unable to pay for the equipment in question, and the reason they entered into it was to obtain custody of the goods and then to sell the goods before the expiration of the hire purchase repayment period.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to that to say that to sell goods which are on hire purchase is a criminal offence.  It is, of course, a criminal offence but most of the unfortunate housewives and others who are under pressure financially do not appreciate that or, even if they do, they decide to take the risk.  There has been a case in which one housewife bought three washing machines, three television sets or three refrigerators, and the only reason the unfortunate <Col N="1047" /> lady purchased them was in order to gain custody of the goods to sell them and thereby obtain some liquid assets in exchange for the hire purchase commodity.</P>
    <P>That practice is continuing.  I do not know whether the Minister's Department is yet convinced of the need to do something about it but we have seen where in the neighbouring island legislation has been introduced to remedy that state of affairs; now contracts may not be signed at people's homes and there is a cooling off period.  These are things which the Minister should seriously consider and, if he does, we may have an end to the undesirable hire purchase transactions which are taking place.</P>
    <P>I have here a cutting from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 31st March, 1964, in which the Reverend James Coulter of St. Columb's College, Derry, speaking at the Christus Rex Congress in Bangor, is reported as saying that &ldquo;when agents were not restricted, the housewife was frequently tricked by pressure selling&rdquo;.  That is perhaps a milder or more refined way of putting what I was saying but it is interesting that a sociologist has observed this.  The Minister should take a serious look at activities of this kind which are clearly undesirable and which are leading people to enter into financial commitments which they are in no position to meet.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have done a great deal of work and could do more to break people from the vicious entanglements of hire purchase.  The credit union movement has been knocking at the door of the Department of Industry and Commerce for some years past asking for legislative powers and for modernisation of friendly societies.  I appreciate the restriction on advocating legislation on an Estimate debate but I would ask the Minister to expedite consideration of that problem.</P>
    <P>The Friendly Societies section of the Department of Industry and Commerce is, I suppose, the Cinderella of the Department.  It is hardly thought about at all but quite frequently it concerns itself, or should concern itself, with <Col N="1048" /> small voluntary societies in which local communities invest their savings or try to promote a certain amount of parochial, neighbourly co-operation. Some of these have not been entirely successful and the Friendly Societies section has not been strict enough in requiring these societies to make their annual return.  It ought to be more strict if only for the purpose of encouraging the kind of enterprise for which the Friendly Societies legislation was introduced.  The Act under which our friendly societies operate at the moment was passed in 1896 and, without advocating any fresh legislation on the matter, I was thinking the Minister and his Department should consider whether or not the machinery and ideas of 1896 are strictly applicable to the needs of 1965 and the second half of the twentieth century.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister was present at a meeting of the Federation of Trade Associations and he may have heard there Mr. Leo McCarthy, the President of that body, express concern at the extent to which urban property was passing into foreign hands, particularly in the distributive trade.  It is wholly undesirable that so many of our distributive outlets should be allowed to fall into the hands of foreigners and the Minister should take steps to control this.</P>
    <P>One certainly likes to encourage foreigners who are bringing over here new skills, new knowledge and new enterprise and providing new export markets, but most of these invaders into the distributive trade are not bringing over any skill, knowledge or wealth which is not already here.  What they are doing to a great extent is imposing on Irish industry the duty to supply them with greater profits.  That is what the supermarket system amounts to.  It is a machine whereby the wealthy can compel the manufacturer or original producer of the goods to provide them with substantial discounts; the effect of giving bigger discounts to those foreigners is to give them bigger profits, and the economy in the long run must bear these larger profits.</P>
    <P>The result of all this is that, while Mrs. <Col N="1049" /> Murphy thinks that by spending 1/10d. in the supermarket and saving 9d, she is doing well, in fact she might be paying only 1/6d in the old-style, traditional grocer's shop if these foreign invaders and profit-winners had not entered into the distribution system at all.  Perhaps I am overstating the case.  I would not like somebody to say that the figures I have given here paid by Mrs. Murphy represent the entire profit distribution in the supermarket activity.  However, it is worth consideration because the trend is for these foreign concerns to increase in number and influence.</P>
    <P>In addition, there have been a number of take-overs by foreign industrialists of successful Irish concerns. This is also something which is not to be encouraged.  It is one thing, as I say, if they bring in new skill and provide opportunities which were not there before, but when they take over entirely successful Irish business, it is time for the Minister for industry and Commerce to cry halt and to ensure that it does not happen.  If this is not done, we shall be in an extremely awkward position in years to come where successful Irish industries which have flourished on their own, in bad times as well as good, may be closed down altogether because the international combine which backed them may find it more profitable to operate in London, Hamburg, New York or elsewhere.  I do not say that is what happened in Dundalk. I do not know enough about the recent unfortunate developments in Dundalk to say that, but there is that danger, once foreigners are allowed to take over Irish enterprises and the chill economic wind blows upon the parent company elsewhere.  Therefore, the Minister should not be indifferent about the number of foreigners taking over successful Irish enterprises</P>
    <P>Last Autumn we had a grim tragedy in Dublin in which a young boy lost his life as a result of a homemade bomb exploding.  At that time I asked the then Minister for Industry and Commerce if he would take steps to control the sale to juveniles of sodium chlorate and other chemicals used in the manufacture of explosives.  The Minister informed me that he had <Col N="1050" /> under consideration revision and codification of the law relating to explosives and other dangerous substances and he would consider a provision on the lines I suggested.  I would hope the Department has not put this matter on the long finger.  It is very important that tragedies of the kind that happened last year should be avoided and, if the Department would expedite consideration of the matter, I am sure many people would be very relieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton and others referred to the large number of bodies which must be consulted by people considering the establishment of new industrial enterprises or the expansion of existing ones.  The time has come, I think, to amalgamate all the existing bodies under one authority.  We have at the moment the Industrial Development Authority, Foras Tionscal, Córas Tráchtála, the Industrial Credit Corporation and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  We hear a great deal of talk about rationalisation and modernisation, the chief spokesman for these views being the Department of Industry and Commerce, and one is naturally amazed to discover, in the light of that, five different units in the State dealing with new industrial enterprises or the expansion of existing ones.</P>
    <P>I know each of these bodies has a particular function; one tries to encourage foreigners to come in here and establish industries; another provides loans and grants for new industries or the expansion of existing ones; another tries to find export markets for the manufactured goods; another provides loans; and the Department has a general supervisory function in relation to all of them.  Foreigners who come over here naturally get somewhat confused by this large number of different bodies, each of which must consider the same suggestion.  It should be possible now to amalgamate these into one body.</P>
    <P>Some very kind words were spoken during the debate about the Industrial Development Authority, all the more remarkable because of those who uttered them.  The Minister spoke about the success achieved by the Industrial Development Authority in <Col N="1051" /> attracting new industries from abroad. At column 810 of Volume 215 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    <P>The success achieved by the Industrial Development Authority in attracting new industries from abroad is reflected in the fact that 25 of these new industries were started with external participation.  The total capital investment represented by the 32 new industrial units is estimated to be of the order of £10 million.</P>
    <P>Later, at column 854, Deputy Crowley said:</P>
    <P>I am especially pleased with the modern and dynamic approach which the Industrial Development Authority are displaying in going after new business in various countries.</P>
    <P>One would not anticipate that these words could be spoken here by disciples of Deputy Seán Lemass who, from this side of the House, when the Authority was set up, undertook to demolish it as soon as he got back to Office.  Listening to all the praise heaped upon the Authority, one would think that the Authority was the baby of Fianna Fáil.  Far from it.  They were not the parents of it and they did everything they could to ensure it would be stillborn; when their efforts failed in that direction, they undertook to kill it as soon as they got the chance. We are glad that the malice and envy then displayed here has now turned into wholehearted support of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>We are glad Fianna Fáil have found themselves obliged to accept the Fine Gael policy of encouraging industrial expansion by means of grants and also glad that they have found it necessary and desirable to encourage industrial exports by means of tax incentives. We, on this side of the House, take some pride in the fact that it was we who compelled a reluctant Fianna Fáil Party to accept these ideas.  Had they not been introduced into the Irish economy, we would have had in recent years an entirely different picture and, instead of the limited <Col N="1052" /> degree of industrial expansion we have had, we would have had a continuing failure, had we continued on the old dismal policies of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I want now to pay a well deserved tribute to Irish industrialists, both management and staff, for the magnificent way in which they overcame the 15 per cent British levy.  They did that notwithstanding the wails and moans of the Taoiseach and members of the Government.  Recall for a moment what happened when the British Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the imposition of this levy.  The Taoiseach talked about a body blow.  Other members of Fianna Fáil said this levy would disrupt the whole <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Others said it would throw us back years.  It was not the Government and Fianna Fáil who saved the day.  It was the management and staff of Irish industry, who ignored the wailing and the moaning and who set about putting their own house in order.  When that was done, they went to the Fianna Fáil Ministers and told them exactly what was needed.  It is those people who deserve to be thanked now, the people in the field, and not the Fianna Fáil Government who had not the capacity to control the situation, a situation never as disastrous as they tried to pretend it was.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Committee deserves congratulation for the good work they have been doing.  It is a sad reflection on us that it needs something of what Fianna Fáil called a &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; to stimulate such a campaign and also to stimulate our people into accepting the wisdom of buying Irish: one hopes this campaign will continue. I agree with the Minister that there is emphasis on sophistication and we need to encourage our people to buy Irish because of quality and because of what it means to the economy as a whole.  We wish the Committee well.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear during the week that one of the members of the Committee, who holds a licence for the manufacture here of a particular article which sells well abroad, is distributing this in boxes made in Britain. If there is one thing we can manufacture here, it is boxes and cartons.  One wonders how on earth a member of <Col N="1053" /> the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; Committee got a licence for the importation of these boxes.  Perhaps the Minister would look into this and see if he can persuade the individual concerned to distribute these goods in Irish manufactured cartons and boxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised us a new manpower authority to forecast the need in relation to various skills and various types of labour.  He said that, in addition to having this manpower forecasting agency, he also proposed to set up a new training body to train people who become redundant in circumstances which he described.  The circumstances the Minister described were redundancy as a result of the movement towards free trade and the preparations being made to increase the efficiency of industry towards that end.  We are very disappointed that the manpower agency and training body are to concern themselves only with redundancy following a movement towards free trade.</P>
    <P>We have a chronic seven per cent unemployed.  We have institutions we call labour exchanges which are citadels of depression and despair.  The employers who bother to consult a labour exchange to deal with their labour problems must be few and far between.  If they do, it is certainly only in respect of labour of the unskilled and, in most cases, unwanted type.  A community which ignores the retraining of their seven per cent chronic unemployed is failing seriously.</P>
    <P>We believe the Minister will have to go much further in his proposed employment and training agency than simply caring for perhaps three per cent of the existing pool of employed&mdash; people who may become redundant as a result of our movement towards free trade.  The <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> says at paragraph 104, page 39:</P>
    <P>Special consideration will be given to the need for ensuring an adequate supply of personnel, with the requisite knowledge and skill, at all levels of industry.</P>
    <P>That was said by the Government seven years ago.  Seven years later, we <Col N="1054" /> are told we have not got an adequate supply of personnel at all levels of industry, because the Government did nothing since 1958 to provide the necessary manpower agency or the necessary training at all levels of industry.  All they did do was pass the Apprenticeship Act four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>That is a sad commentary upon the Party who boast as a matter of policy that they are going to expand the economy.  They failed to take the necessary steps to increase the number of trained personnel available.  The seven to twelve per cent who have been unemployed over that period of seven years could have had those wasted years put to good use if the Government had only introduced the necessary steps for the retraining of those people.  One must welcome the fact they have now awakened to their duty and hope they are not just rubbing the sleep out of their eyes, which appears to be all the Minister has in mind, judging by his opening statement.  We would ask him to do the sensible thing and have extensive retraining and training machinery available, not only for those who may become redundant in future because of free trade, but also for those who are regarded at present as chronically unemployable because they are not trained for the needs of our modern economy.</P>

      <P>It took six years for you to accept the idea that ground rents should be abolished.  If it takes six years for a good idea to get from this side of the House to the other side, one despairs about the possibility of this good idea being put across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are very serious problems, and we do not think the Government are looking at them in the proper way.  The NIEC Report also mentions the fact that we have not got sufficient trained personnel at present.  They mention that total employment does not seem to be rising at the rate envisaged in the Second Programme, mainly because of a more rapid decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture and a slower increase <Col N="1055" /> in employment in the services sector.  The Report says that the slower rate of increasing employment is not the result of a general labour shortage. Indeed, we all know that because we know that seven per cent of our people are unemployed all the time at the best of times.  The Report also points out that unemployment remains high and annual emigration has recently been about 25,000.  What that represents in £ s. d., heaven only knows. If we are to continue to drift, with a totally inadequate plan for our manpower resources, we are going to be off target by 1970 or any other year.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question I had down today to the Minister for Defence, I was told the number of personnel in the Army at present is 8,500 and the number of civil servants in the Department of Defence is 500.  We have a Minister of State, the whole paraphernalia of a Government Department and 8,500 men in uniform to deal with a problem which may never arise&mdash; the defence of our country.  But we have not got a Minister of State or a dynamic State institution to deal with the much greater problem of providing proper working conditions and proper retraining facilities for over 1,000,000 of our people who work in one way or another.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary is a move in the right direction.  We would hope he will never have about him an army of 500 officials and 8,500 in uniform to lead our labour force.  But we think there is drastic need for a completely new approach to our manpower resources.  Manpower is one thing we have here in plenty, although one would think from the emigration figures that we have a surplus of it. But we have it here in plenty and we ought to use it to the best advantage. We will not do so until we have a much more ambitious approach to the manpower and labour problem than the small reference the Minister made to it in his opening statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    <Col N="1056" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be interesting.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The task of placing re-trained persons in industry will involve an extension of the functions of the employment exchanges and the reorientation of their activities.</P>
      <P>That does not give much hope when read in conjunction with what went before it.  All it says is that any person who becomes redundant as a result of free trade will not be asked to join queues at the existing labour exchanges but will be put somewhere else.  I do not know whether this is forecasting that the employment exchanges will be taken out of the hands of the Department of Social Welfare.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary shaking his head.  He disappoints me seriously.</P>
      <P>If our employment exchanges are to be used as places for distributing relief to the chronically unemployed, we should stop calling them employment exchanges because they are no such thing.  They are social welfare institutions or something of that kind. If we are to have employment exchanges which live up to their name, we should take away this stigma which has grown to be attached to them. Some people regard employment exchanges in the same way as our forefathers looked upon the County Home or the Union.  Some people who could well do with whatever assistance is distributed are unable to join the queues of depressed people who habitually go to those depressing institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I learned with some surprise recently that a rather imposing building in Lord Edward Street was originally erected as a labour exchange.  It is now occupied by the Revenue Commissioners.  One wonders why the change was made. Perhaps our society was embarrassed by the appearance on the public street of the thousands of unfortunate people who have to resort to our labour exchanges.  Instead of the imposing building in Lord Edward Street, there is a rather unimposing building hidden away behind some decaying buildings in Werburgh Street to which we send our unemployed to sign on for the <Col N="1057" /> dole, and to remind them on several days a week that for all practical purposes society has forgotten them.  I am afraid the Minister gives them little hope that they will be provided with new opportunities, new skills and a new prospect of advancing their personal fortunes.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should talk about expansion and improvement in our economy, unless at the same time we radically improve the opportunities for employment which are available to all our people, not only those already in industry.  A most awkward age for employment is under 18 years, and if a boy does not get an opportunity then in a reasonable post, the chances are that he will be chronically unemployed.  The Minister gives us no hope that he will provide training for that kind of boy.  There are also many people over 50 years of age in the ranks of the unemployed.  Their chances of getting new employment are diminishing as time goes on, and there is no hope for them in what the Minister said in his opening statement. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has better news.  If he has, I hope he will give it to us before the debate closes.  We must consider not only the dry fiscal figures but also the human problems.</P>
    <P>May I say that we on the Fine Gael side of the House are delighted to see a radical change in national policy tucked away in a comment in the Report of the NIEC?  This comes from the NIEC and not from the Government, and it underlines what we in Fine Gael have been saying for the past half dozen years or so.  The comment is:</P>
    <P>...it is necessary to maintain a balance between projects which are immediately productive (including housing to facilitate industrial development and other necessary infrastructural investments) and investments which lay the foundations for future increases in productivity (such as education, research and development).</P>
    <P>The interesting thing here is that the National Industrial Economic Council emphasise what we in Fine Gael have <Col N="1058" /> been saying, that is, that social policy is an essential part of economic policy. Where the Government have failed badly is that they have tried to divorce the two and, in divorcing the two, they have put housing in among the things which can be ignored. The result is that we have lost from a potential labour force many of our most skilled operatives.  They have left Dublin city over the past five or six years for no other reason than that they could not get a house at any price.  It will be many a long day before we return to the happy position which obtained under the first inter-Party Government when the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of External Affairs had to get out booklets for distribution in England to entice back our skilled workers who had been sent away by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>No nonsense at all. The Parliamentary Secretary may forget that his Party were in power in 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960.  During those years a number of skilled workers left the country because even if they could earn a good income, they could not get houses in which to live.  They regarded housing for themselves and their families as essential, and they went because Fianna Fáil ignored the advice we gave them about the necessity for building houses.  The comment made by the NIEC emphasises what we have been preaching, that is, that housing is a necessary part of industrial development.</P>

As I said, the whole activities of the Department are immense but many problems have been ignored because of a certain emphasis which was put on a limited amount of their activities in recent years.  We need a very comprehensive approach to those problems, and I hope the years ahead will show some effort on the part of the Government to remedy the many defects which unnecessarily occur under the present Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to keep my contribution short.  However, if I may, I should like to deal with the subject of industrial relations.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Clearly, we must continue our efforts to improve the machinery of industrial relations so as to ensure that the production losses and social suffering arising from prolonged strikes should be obviated as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I can concur in and agree with that view, and I think every member of the House will equally agree with it.  One of the great problems besetting this nation of ours today is the unsettled position of labour relations. This is a very small country.  Up to date we have had the very good fortune to live in what has been virtually a classless society, in a society where our families followed various occupations and lived at various income levels.  It is difficult to understand, in these circumstances, why we have not achieved a better management-employee relationship.  I have no doubt there is no lack of goodwill on the part of the management and on the part of the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the problem here is bound up in the defective communications between both sides of industry. It seems to me that in bringing about a solution of this problem the Government <Col N="1060" /> have a part to play, that is, not to impose solutions or to act in the role of dictator, but to create a situation where solutions may be found.  I think this should be the Government's role.  The Labour Court, in my view, was founded at a time and in circumstances which no longer exist.  We are more advanced industrially now than we were at the time of the founding of the Labour Court and we must take a new look at this Court.</P>
    <P>I think the Labour Court authority, or rather its prestige, should be enhanced.  It would be enhanced if it had conferred upon it authority by way of payment and by way of status of the High Court of Justice.  That is the point.  Now, having said that, I may be asked what the personnel of the Labour Court should be.  The Court should be small in numbers, and should consist of trained professional personnel from the unions.  I feel that professional management, one or two people from the universities, would add to the prestige of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I think, further, the Labour Court should have funds at its disposal which would enable it, in its deliberations, to seek the aid of, say, sociologists, and professionally trained people.  It should have a permanent staff of professional consolidators, that is, public servants who are prepared to make a career in the field of labour relations.  They should have opportunity for promotion within the sphere of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The vital point, as I see it and as I have outlined it, is that the Labour Court should be the last court of appeal in labour disputes.  It is very unfortunate that we must have strikes, but it is one of the penalties we must pay for our democratic liberties.  I do not think strikes are an altogether intelligent approach.  In my view, of course, it would be very wrong ever to think of making strikes illegal, apart from the consideration whether any such law would be enforceable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> There is one thing I should certainly support and I think the gentleman who said &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo; a moment ago would possibly agree with me, that is, there should be some sort of legislation to prevent picketing in support of unofficial strikes.  I am sure the Labour Party opposite will agree with this proposal.  Without such legislation, in my view, one is always on the verge of industrial anarchy.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the question of the Labour Court being the last court of appeal.  It must be able to speak with the voice and authority of the nation.  I should like, before I resume my seat, to make one last point.  Once and for all, the offices of these benevolent busybodies should be closed.  I feel that they add further confusion and uncertainty to an already confused and certainly uncertain situation.  Such self-appointed pacificators should not be dealt with at all.</P>
    <P>If I make a comment on the Minister's introduction of the manpower policy, I think it is a first-class document of its kind.  Having said all these things and having put them down in black and white, they should be implemented immediately.  I thank the House for listening to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened by that part of the Minister's speech which deals, however vaguely, with the realisation that we do have an unemployed, under-employed and redundancy problem in this country. At long last, there seems to be some dawning of an awareness on the part of the Government of the need to do something about it.  It is patently clear to all of us that the vigorous competition with which Irish industry will have to contend in freer trade circumstances, whether we join the Common Market or not, will have disastrous consequences for many thousands of Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the fact that we have lived for decades with an appalling unemployment problem, the figure of unemployment averaging 60,000 a year and in fact exceeding 90,000 at peak periods, and despite the <Col N="1062" /> further fact that we have in this country an abnormally high rate of emigration, from which we have lost, since we secured partial freedom and the establishment of this State and this Dáil, one million of our race, we are now presented with the startling revelations contained in the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister or the Government will not attribute any ulterior motives to me in quoting this Committee on Industrial Organisation.  These were impartial Committee meetings, comprising trade union officials, the best in management we can provide and the best that can be provided from the Minister's Department.  The report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation must be accepted as being fair, impartial and objective.</P>
    <P>The Committee has now investigated 26 Irish industries and the outcome of these reports is that of the 26 Irish industries surveyed, which employ 77,350 workers, it is the view of the Committee on Industrial Organisation that as many as 11,000 Irish workers will lose their jobs in conditions of freer trade.  The redundancy figure could be as high as 23,000 if the recommended adaptation measures stipulated by this Committee are not implemented.  These are pretty startling revelations.  Some hope and pray that these reports are on the pessimistic side and that the situation will not be all that bad in freer trading circumstances.  May I say, in passing, that Harold Wilson did something of a service to Irish industry when he gave what the Taoiseach called, at that time, the Wilson wallop, in placing an embargo on imports to Great Britain?  It had the effect at least of staving off the day when Irish industry would lose the protection which it enjoyed by way of tariff and quota over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident to us in the trade union and Labour movement that, when the protective tariffs are removed and when Irish industry is at last exposed to the blast of freer competition, very many of our industries will go to the wall and we will have a great human problem to contend with of <Col N="1063" /> many thousands of people thrown on the unemployment scrap heap to be added to the present list of approximately 60,000.  In these circumstances it is obvious that the trade union movement and the employers' organisations are not competent to cope with such a formidable task.</P>
    <P>The duty to do something for our industries devolves on the Government. This problem has been created by the Government in deciding, under freer trading conditions to take away the protection which Irish industry has enjoyed over the past 40 years.  The responsibility of taking the necessary steps to cope with this problem devolves on the Government.  This problem has been very largely created by them and has not been imposed on them by any outside circumstances of any kind.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour movement know the steps which should be taken. Before the Minister made his remarks on the question of redundancy, re-training and re-absorption of people in other employment the trade union movement and the Labour movement had been saying down the years what must and should be done.  Indeed, in the past few months, this Party have tabled a Bill which has not yet been reached, which makes clear the way we are facing up to the issue of redundancy and the desire of our Party to ensure that redundant workers will be adequately catered for.  There should be, in the first instance, adequate notice of dismissal.  The days of indiscriminate hiring and firing are over despite what Deputy Andrews may think.  We lay it down, as a qualification before workers are dismissed, that there must be adequate notice of intention to terminate employment and henceforth provision must be made for adequate compensation on the basis of years of service rendered in that employment. Again every effort must be made by the employer to increase production, to absorb redundant workers and to find alternative work for them.</P>
    <P>The State has a duty to step in in this matter and set up the machinery for the retraining and re-absorption of these people into our society and put <Col N="1064" /> them into productive work.  In the meantime, there is the further obligation of providing for these workers an adequate means of livelihood.  The present meagre unemployment benefit must be supplemented.  There must be adequate compensation for years of service.  There must be adequate payment for the period while they are being trained before they are eventually absorbed.  We are pleased to see some indication of that in the Minister's remarks, however vague they may be at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that the Department of Social Welfare would have a part to play with regard to redundant workers, their retraining and re-absorption, by way of monetary compensation, which he has in mind in the future.  It is my opinion that the Department of Social Welfare, particularly, are obviously lacking in cohesive machinery to deal with this very great problem.  Whatever about leaving this matter in the hands of the Minister's Department, the suggestion of handing over to the Department of Social Welfare any function whatsoever in respect of the problem of redundancy and how to deal with it must be opposed by this side of the House. The Department of Social Welfare is ill-equipped to deal with this problem. It has obviously the wrong outlook. The Minister must have sensed that when he spoke about the reorientation of outlook in that Department.  That Department, as far as I am concerned, consists mainly of labour exchanges which are nothing more, as I have said in this House and other places, than places where men and women suffer for a time in humiliation and degradation.</P>

      <P>The Minister ought not to have referred to another Department in his brief at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are submitting that what is clearly required is the establishment of a distinct Ministry to deal with unemployment, <Col N="1066" /> under-employment and redundancy which we know is being created as a result of freer trading circumstances.  We suggest that it should be a distinct Ministry of Labour charged with responsibility for a positive manpower policy.  We envisage the creation of a Ministry of Labour as vital to organised, planned, developed economy.  There is a Ministry of Labour in every progressive country.  We, on these Labour benches, envisage the day when we shall have a Ministry of Labour in this country too whose primary function it will be to enrich and ennoble the life of labour in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister will realise that redundancy payment, enshrined in a statute, is nothing new.  Many years ago, progressive countries in Europe saw the wisdom of giving their workers some semblance of security during their working life, in sickness, in old age and particularly when it came to the time when their services were no longer required.  There is contained in the statute books of most countries of Europe a provision for adequate notice and severance payments.  In Great Britain, there is much evidence of it. Many trade unions have been able to negotiate redundancy compensation schemes with employers or groups of employers but it is a difficult task and one which, strictly speaking, needs to be done on a national basis.</P>
    <P>In Belgium, there is provision since 1900, amended in 1954, for redundancy payments and adequate notice before workers are dismissed.  In Italy, likewise, since 1924, there is a code of law governing the manner in which workers' employment will be terminated.  In Yugoslavia, there is legislation of a similar kind.  Likewise in Luxembourg, Australia, Greece, France, The United Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I am conveying to the Minister the feeling of my Party that provision for a positive compensation of this kind is long overdue. <Col N="1067" />  He is now being adequately forewarned by the reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation of the size of this problem.  The Committee on Industrial Organisation have made clear, in relation to the 26 Irish industries investigated, that 11,000 Irish workers would lose their employment in freer trading circumstances and that the figure could be as high as 23,000 if recommended adaptation measures are not implemented.</P>
      <P>Whether or not we join the Common Market, the tendency is towards freer trade.  The Minister indicated his intention of still further reducing tariffs and of increasing quotas until they disappear in a very short time.  It was rather fortunate for some Irish industrialists that we did receive that alleged Wilson blow which had the effect of retaining some form of protection for the time being because when this protection is removed many of us fear the consequences which will flow from that action and the unemployment and the great human problem with which we shall then have to contend.</P>
      <P>Redundancy and unemployment are human problems and bring with them great suffering and great privation. Now is the time for the Minister to provide against that kind of problem. It is rather important, too, to note that the new Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Dr. Hillery, was our Minister for Education up to a very short time ago.  He will know my views on the vital matter of education and on the need for providing our technical schools with all the staffs, techniques and the know-how for the training of our young people in the new skills which are required in this modern age.  Likewise, there is the important matter of proceeding with the erection of new schools of technology.</P>

      <P>Despite their white skin and the fact that they spoke the English language, they found themselves at the very bottom of the British labour market in respect of skills and craftsmanship.  The House will now see the reason for my proposal for education in skills, techniques and know-how which we shall require if we are to progress in the field in which we shall have to compete in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, too, that I must advert to the plight of our coalminers at the present time.  I appreciate the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Power to a Dáil question the other day.  However, I would add my voice to that of Deputy Pattison and others who are appealing to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have regard to the mines of this country which stood us in very good stead in the Second World War, and after it, when we suffered an acute shortage of imported fuels.  These mines, <Col N="1069" /> by and large, are State enterprise mines.  Quite a substantial amount of State money has gone into them.  It would be a great tragedy if, for lack of financial aid or technical skill, they were now allowed to go by default. It is particularly sad for the many miners in Wolfhill Colliery at Castlecomer and possibly in my own constituency at Ballingarry which is not yet affected.</P>
    <P>We must concern ourselves about the redundancy now rearing its ugly head in the mines in these counties and appeal to the Minister to do all in his power to relieve that sorry situation.  I understand there is still a sizeable tonnage of anthracite being imported at a time when some of our mines are finding it extremely difficult to make sales on the home market.  If we believe at all in the principle of Arthur Griffith on the protection of our home industries, this is something that deserves our immediate and urgent support.</P>
    <P>Again I appeal to the Minister to give support to that industry, to give it financial aid where necessary.  The duties of the men are arduous, the work difficult and they are filling a great national need.  I express the hope that the Minister in his Department will use his good offices with other Departments, particularly the Department of Local Government, to see that in plans and designs for the many new houses being erected, the heating of these homes will be by Irish anthracite and not by foreign substitutes.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Mullen, raised a question the other day which to my mind is indicative of a great national scandal when he revealed the startling facts that there are large imports of foreign fuel oil which is not being processed through our refineries at Cork at a time when the refineries there could do with the work and when our anthracite miners are becoming unemployed.  In the planning of our society and in the expenditure of such large amounts of public money, regard must be had to these problems.  If anthracite were used in this vast new housing estate in the city of Dublin we would not have this sizeable redundancy problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to make some contribution to the question of industrial relations, and in particular to the question of industrial disputes.  I am afraid many of the speakers appeared to believe that industrial disputes are largely if not entirely due to the consideration of increases in wages, but the analysis of industrial disputes is something which needs some scientific knowledge and some objective approach.  I have read with great interest a book, which is widely regarded as one of the standard works on the subject, entitled <i>The Social Psychology of Industry</i> by J.A. C. Browne, published in paperback.  It is full of very interesting facts which deserve much fuller consideration than they have got in this debate so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this book, the author refers to surveys made in other countries and in particular to one made recently in a British factory where 325 women workers were asked to name ten items in order of importance as having an influence in industrial disputes, particularly leading to strikes.  It is of great interest to me to find that the results of this survey were that the most important <Col N="1071" /> item was steady work, that is, security of employment, and the question of increase of pay came sixth in the list.</P>
    <P>In another study involving 100 department store employees, the question of pay came sixth.  In a survey where 150 miscellaneous workers gave their views, the question of pay came seventh.  The matter of security of employment rated far above pay in each case.  I agree with Deputy Treacy to a considerable extent on this point of security of employment but this is a matter in which the Government cannot interfere directly.  It is something which only the trade unions and employers together can really solve. I believe very much in the suggestion that we should have some system of contract of employment for all workers. Whether this can be achieved by legislation or by agreement between the two parties in industry is irrelevant at this stage, but it is essential we should appreciate that lack of security is something which inevitably causes trouble.  When a man or woman is uneasy at work the curious thing is that their minds turn to money.  They feel that money will solve their worries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas in fact it does not.  At the back of their minds, whether they know it or not, is this haunting fear of losing their jobs and even a man who has a right to a week's notice has that fearful dread hanging over him because a week's notice is no use to him.  At the end of the week when he has worked out the week his pay is ended and then he has to start to look for another job.  There has got to be a very substantial contribution by employers to the solution of the problem which means a great restriction on the right of hiring and firing. That is something which the employers should accept readily and which, in the heel of the hunt, will be very much in their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No man should be allowed to hire and fire indiscriminately.  At the same time, it is impossible for an employer, or unusual for an employer, to be able to take on a new employee with complete <Col N="1072" /> certainty that that man will be able to do the job for which he is employed.  Accordingly, we would have to have some arrangement whereby there would be a short trial period.  Again, there would have to be some safeguards to prevent unscrupulous employers&mdash;and there are some of them around still&mdash;from cashing in on employees on trial.  That could be easily arranged, and no person or company should be allowed to employ more than a certain percentage of staff on a trial basis at any time.  Once the trial period is over and the man has thereby gained something in the nature of permanent employment, his right to compensation should rise steadily and obviously up to some maximum period. I would envisage a period of a maximum of six months or a year at full pay, after five, six, eight or ten years, some period during which if his employment were terminated, the employee would be able to have some chance of re-establishing himself.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve this, we will have to get some drastic improvements in the whole system of collective negotiation.  The present system is completely defective.  Neither employers' organisations nor trade unions have really any power to conduct final and binding negotiations with each other.  We must have some arrangement whereby when an employers' organisation meets a trade union and where agreement is reached, that agreement must be enforceable.  There is no point in reaching the agreement otherwise.  This is something which has greatly handicapped those who have tried to conduct negotiations in the past.  I speak as one employed in a managing capacity and I have had considerable experience of trade union negotiations.  There is no doubt that as an employer you are inhibited from going the full distance to meet the trade union by the knowledge that even if you reach agreement with the trade union delegates on the other side of the table, that agreement may be turned down subsequently by the trade union membership, in which case the agreement reached in the initial stage will be used as a jumping-off board for the next demand coming up later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> I do not wish to be taken as criticising trade unions purely, because the employers' organisations are in exactly the same position.  If the Federated Union of Employers reaches agreement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers cannot force their members to accept that agreement any more than the Congress of Trade Unions can force their member-unions, or members of individual unions, to agree with what has been negotiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy accepts the principle of reference back to the general members of the union? That is democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I am making.  That is the complete nonsense of the present position. Democracy is a question of a rule being exercised by an executive few over the many who have elected them.  That is democracy.  Where everything has to be referred back&mdash;and I use the word with no intention of being offensive&mdash; that is, strictly speaking, the definition of anarchy, where there is no control by an executive.  That is the main weakness of the employers' organisations and the trade unions at the moment.</P>
      <P>Sooner or later we must have a situation where the executive of a trade organisation of employers or employees must be able to bind their members, and there is no reason why they should not, no reason in the world.  That is the way we run the country.  We do not have a referendum every time a new Bill comes up.  The people elect a Government and the Government act and then have to stand on their merits or lack of merits when the next election comes up.  The people do not want everything referred back to them. Strictly speaking, that would be anarchy.  Democracy is where the majority hand over the control of their affairs to a small executive, on the strict understanding that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to differ on the Deputy's version of anarchy and my version of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be uncivil to the Deputy but if he checks <Col N="1074" /> up on the dictionary definition, he will find that I am right.  This is a point I have studied very considerably.  We have got to get a situation like that; otherwise you cannot have collective negotiations on any firm basis.  There is no use an employer asking a trade union delegate: &ldquo;Do you agree with that?&rdquo; and then the delegate replies &ldquo;Yes, I agree: we will now put it up to our members&rdquo;, and then the whole thing goes back into the melting pot. We cannot conduct negotiations on that basis.  It has to be negotiation between plenipotentiaries.  If we can get this, we will take another great step forward.</P>
      <P>To my mind, one of the weaknesses of trade organisations on both sides of industry is that far too few people take a real interest in the routine administration of those organisations.  You will always get a minority of employers who take an active part in their organsations.  The history of the trade union movement has been the same, that very often you find a small group attending union meetings and electing the executive.  The great majority ask themselves: &ldquo;Why should we bother attending the meeting.  There is something good on television to-night.  What difference does it make whom we elect on the executive?  They cannot do anything because before they do anything, they have to ask us.  It does not make any difference who is president, secretary or treasurer; they have to come back and ask us.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a terrible source of weakness.  If employers and employees could face up to this fact and then deliberately and of their own free will hand over control of their affairs for a period of even one year to an executive, they would be a darned sight keener about who formed the executive.  That would be for the good of the trade union movement and of the employers' organisation as well.  At the moment there is not that spirit of realism involved in these collective negotiations and the trade union movement and the employers' organisations are suffering greatly as a result.  I hope this matter will be given very serious consideration because this constant referring back as a democratic <Col N="1075" /> process is a complete illusion.  I am not trying to be rude to Deputy Treacy and I hope he will think this out.  I think it is a complete illusion and a very dangerous one.  If we can get all trade unionists to be loyal members of their unions, to turn up to every meeting, and particularly to their annual meeting, so that the executive will be a really representative and able executive, we will have taken a great step forward.</P>
    <P>We have had encouraging signs.  The formation of the Irish Congress has been a great step.  The trade union movement has been able to recruit some very fine, new personalities on its executive staff but they are not being used as efficiently as they might.  The same goes for the employers.  Unless we get this voluntary acceptance of some sort of discipline between individual employers and employers and the trade union movement, we are bound to have strikes.</P>
    <P>Here again the whole conception of strikes and dismissals is completely outdated and anyone on the employers' side who says: &ldquo;We must defend at all costs the right of the employer to dispense with his staff&rdquo; is no more and no less out of touch with reality than the trade unionist who says: &ldquo;We must defend the right to strike to the very end.&rdquo;  The right to strike and the right to dismiss are purely acts of force; we are getting back to the law of the jungle by having a test of strength to see who is going to win.  In normal human relations, we have given up that and we should be devoutly thankful we have done so; it is not a question of one having better ability with the gun, knife or sword or some other weapon that solves human problems.  If two individuals have an argument or difference of opinion, they are not allowed to beat each other over the head; they must refer their case to a dispassionate and well-qualified court of law.  Even in international relations, we are striving to get something of the same sort because everybody realises that the use of force to settle disputes does not make sense any more, if it ever did.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> There is no reason for believing that industrial disputes are in any way different.  They must also be settled by the rule of law and not by the law of the jungle.  The strike is an utterly obsolete weapon.  It came in when the workers had no statutory rights, no Government protection, when there was an over-supply of labour and not enough work to go around and when there was collective exploitation of really defenceless men, women and children.  In these circumstances and in the rather simpler form of society which then existed, it was possible to hit the employer in the only way in which it could be done, hit him only and hit him where it hurt.</P>
    <P>That is not the situation any more, especially when you get a firm of any size.  When only a very small private company is involved where there are perhaps eight or ten employees, a small family shop, if there is a strike, that will certainly affect the owner and it will affect him to such an extent that it will put him out of business and the eight or ten employees will not have a job to go back to.  A strike is not much use in that case.  When you come to the big companies, the strike does not hit the man you are fighting.  If the employees go out on strike, let us say, in the ESB, who is going to suffer? Will it be the board of directors?  Will they lose their summer holidays or have to cut down on their smoking?  I do not think so, or even the senior executives; the managers, the men with whom you are conducting the negotiations&mdash;they will not be hit.  The only persons who suffer in a strike are first, the strikers themselves, their wives and families and, secondly&mdash;and even worse &mdash;the other workers who are disemployed as a result of the strike.</P>
    <P>We had that happening in the builders' strike.  Granted, the building employees suffered badly enough but the strike spread to the builders' providers and to other industries; everything began to slow down and men and women lost their employment.  That strike was not a strike against certain builders half as much as it was a strike against the community.  The real blow was struck against all the other suffering <Col N="1077" /> men and women who had to live on very much reduced weekly incomes.</P>
    <P>There might be some point in a strike if the impact could be directed at the person with whom you are arguing but that is no longer the case, and now, in our much more complex society, it is almost impossible to have any big strike without causing terrible suffering in other industries.  We have had that happen with the builders' strike, and then with the builders' providers; then we had the question of the oil strike and the industrial gases strike and now we have the ESB strike hanging over all of us.  Nobody wants a strike and everybody would be only too glad if there were no necessity for a strike.  At the moment I am sure that everybody on both sides in the ESB dispute are racking their brains to find some way in which this stupid situation can be avoided because we all know that if the ESB strike comes off, tens of thousands of people will be out of jobs instantaneously, people who have no hand, act or part in the dispute.  Let it be clearly understood that there are two sides to every dispute.  I cannot readily think of any trade dispute where I could say that the issue was absolutely clear between right and wrong.  There is always some responsibility on both sides if people fall out with each other and employers must take their share of responsibility also.</P>
    <P>If we are to avoid strikes breaking out, we must have discipline but it cannot be discipline imposed by the Government.  We must have agreement and this must come voluntarily, although possibly the Government suggest it.  This has to be something which both employers and employees will accept readily.  What we can do at this stage is try to analyse the real issues that are at stake and encourage people on both sides of industry to do some hard, realistic thinking. There must be sacrifices on both sides: it is not just a question of saying to the unions: &ldquo;You must abandon strikes as a stupid weapon.&rdquo;  It is not as easy as that.  Strikes do not happen for no reason.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for people to say: &ldquo;Strikes are always caused by some <Col N="1078" /> hot-headed shop steward looking for popularity or prominence in his own shop&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;strikes are caused by workers who want to have much more say in, and profit out of the industry.&rdquo;  It is not as easy as that.  We must try to get a situation where employers and employees meet as equals and can discuss things calmly and a situation in which if they fail to reach agreement, they will both agree to leave the matter in the hands of a court to make a finding.  There is no reason in the world why they should not do that and every reason why they should.</P>
    <P>I know the past history of the trade union movement is very hard to forget; the unions have had a hard time over the years but surely they must admit now that if they have a case, as they very often have, they have no reason to fear going before a court and proving it and there will not be any feeling of inferiority complex about it and no feeling that inevitably the court will be rigged by capitalists against honest working men.  That is just nonsense in this day and age. There is every reason for having a labour court to which matters must be referred and the decisions of which must be final.</P>
    <P>Other people may not agree with me.  At least, I want to put that forward with the utmost sincerity because I believe it really does point to the only way in which we can get some stable society&mdash;sacrifices on the part of both&mdash;sacrifices by the employer of his right to hire and fire, the sacrifice by the employer that if by any chance he has to dispense with somebody out of his employment, he must pay him very adequately indeed; sacrifices by the employees that they will not for no adequate reason, collectively withdraw their labour and upset the whole economy in that way but that both sides will voluntarily put their case before a court and accept the decision.</P>
    <P>That means we must review, as Deputy Andrews has suggested, the whole question of the Labour Court. I agree with him on that.  It would have to be a very comprehensive review but not just by imposing something.  Here <Col N="1079" /> again, we must draw on all the experience and wisdom of both employees' and employers' organisations.  We must build up a court which has complete acceptance by both sides.  That does not mean that we must anticipate that all its decisions will be welcomed by both sides.  That does not happen in a court of law.  When a court of law gives its decision, there is always one fellow who feels that he has got a poor deal. Over all, we do realise that the courts of this country do mete out justice, whether we like it or not.  Very often, we are looking for privilege rather than justice.  But, in this case we must set up a labour court which is acceptable to both sides of industry and the decisions of which can be enforced.</P>
    <P>If we can reach agreement on this, I would hope that at this stage both sides might ask the Government to introduce legislation so as to give final legislative sanction to the whole proceedings.  This is not a matter on which the Minister can dash in rashly.  He very well may not feel ready at this stage even to comment on anything I have said.  I would not blame him if he found himself in that position, particularly during this week, but I do hope that he will consider it and that both employees' and employers' organisations will also consider it.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer, that is, the question of the State companies, companies wholly owned by the State.  This is a matter which has been raised by the Committee of Public Accounts during the last session and, as a member of that Committee and as a private individual, I feel unhappy at the amount of public control of these companies.  The share-holding is vested in the Minister for Finance as a representative of the Government but I do not think that is enough.  We should be able to devise some system whereby each of these State companies would have an annual meeting with shareholders present.  The best people to act in the capacity of shareholder would be some committee appointed by this House.  I am in danger of being out of order, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because that would involve a revision of the Rules of the House but I would hope that the Minister <Col N="1080" /> would consider in what way this matter could best be handled.</P>
    <P>It is quite inadequate that the Minister or some official of the Department of Finance should attend the annual meeting of these companies and just propose one of the formal resolutions.  It has been suggested that it might be difficult to get directors to act in that capacity in State companies if they were going to be held up to public comment by a parliamentary committee but every other director of a public company has to stand before his shareholders and there is quite a queue of people only too anxious to become directors of State companies.  I do not think we would have much difficulty in getting volunteers if anybody resigned.  We have to get these companies into the position where they are held accountable by the awkward people, namely the shareholders.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of dealing with small matters of detail, of discussing with CIE why they have closed Booterstown railway station.  That is not the point at issue.  The idea is that there would be some group who could examine the accounts with the directors and with the experts and try to analyse policy generally and get explanations of the policy which up to now we cannot get.  It is not the Minister's province to give us explanations of the policy of the State companies and we cannot get at them at all.  It is frustrating for us as public representatives and it is very bad for the companies also.  So, I would urge the Minister to direct his attention to this question and to see whether we can solve a problem which has been troubling many other countries also. No easy solution has yet been found but I am perfectly certain that we can find it if only we work at it.  If we can get some parliamentary committee to act in the capacity of shareholder and discuss company policy with the directors of State companies it will be very much in the interest of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I should like to wish the Minister all the best of good luck in his new office and in particular to offer my sympathy in the circumstances in which he has come to office.  I do hope that wiser councils <Col N="1081" /> will prevail in the ESB and that this threatened strike may be avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with previous speakers in complimenting the Minister on his appointment to his new office.  It is not without good reason that the Minister has been so appointed.</P>
      <P>There is a matter of grave concern to Galway city that I must bring to the notice of the Minister.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of it.  I should like to know what hope he can hold out to the workers and their wives and families as to the future of the Potez industry.  We hope and pray that the industry will achieve the target it set for itself.  The future of young families for whom Galway Corporation provided houses is bound up with that hope.  It is a matter of concern to the city and to the families of the workers in the industry.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, I raised in this House a question as to redundancy in this factory.  This factory was to employ 700 workers within two years. It has now been established about four years.  Not one-quarter of that number are employed at the factory and those who are employed are on a day-to-day basis and three-quarter time.  When I raised this question with the Minister for Transport and Power he told me that the factory was on short time due to orders not having come in as a result of the mild winter.  That is a lame excuse.  It is only reasonable to expect that anybody intending to install heaters would not wait until the snow was on the ground, that orders would be placed in advance.  The explanation given by the Minister for Transport and Power was ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in order to relieve the fears of these young families, some of whom have been invited to come back from England, that I would ask the Minister to make a statement as to the prospects for this industry.  Not only have we in the Galway Corporation provided the site for that industry but also, over the past year and a half, we have provided a site for a proposed electronics industry at Mervue, Galway. <Col N="1082" />  We were being told from day to day that if we did not provide the site, the industry would be lost. Recently we saw certain things happening in regard to the provision of fittings and we began to worry.  I hope our worries are unfounded and that this industry will be on its feet before long.</P>
    <P>It is rather a sad thing to see, as I see in our town, long-established industries closing down, having been refused grants towards modernisation and equipping themselves to meet the challenge of the present industrial drive.  There is a feeling that unless you have a foreign name&mdash;and I am beginning to accept that there is a certain element of truth in it&mdash;you will get nowhere as far as industrial grants are concerned.  There is a slogan now in regard to industries: no Irish need apply for industrial grants.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the Minister; I understand there are a number of other speakers but I would ask him to give a ray of hope for the future to these industries and to the workers in our city.  Once again I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty is a very pleasant one, to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I do not need to tell him that the standard that has been set and the lead given is a very high one, in the first instance, by our architect of industry, the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, and by Deputy Jack Lynch, who is now the Minister for Finance.  However, I am of the opinion that the Clareman can take his stand equally anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few matters with which I wish to deal on this Estimate.  The first one is in relation to the attitude of my colleagues of the Fine Gael Party to the industries in Cobh.  They became very anxious about the industries during the past few weeks but we heard nothing about them from the Deputies for the past four or five years. I want to reassure Deputy Barry and Deputy Burton, who are so anxious about the workers who were laid off there, that, since the Industrial Gases <Col N="1083" /> strike has finished, all those workers are now back in employment in Irish Steel.  It is to be hoped that with the advances that have been made, we shall have further employment there.</P>
    <P>These Deputies also attacked me over certain statements I made during the election in regard to the employment that would be given, should Fine Gael become the Government.  During the three years when Fine Gael were last in office, employment in Irish Steel dropped by 300.  I wonder what is the attitude of Fine Gael towards industry. Is it the attitude they displayed in this House towards Verolme Dockyard, or have they one policy when preaching in Cobh to the dockyard workers and another policy when they issue an election address of this description in County Cavan?</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael financial policy is based on the elimination of extravagance and waste such as Verolme (Cork) Dockyard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give the reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That election address was issued by the Fine Gael Party in County Cavan.  It was signed by Deputy Thomas Fitzpatrick who has now been promoted to the Opposition front bench, and the former Deputy Patrick O'Reilly, and published by Mr. R.J. O'Brien, the election agent for the candidates.  Is that the policy of Fine Gael?  I was glad that there was a further order to the Verolme Dockyard for another large vessel.  I warned the workers in Verolme Dockyard of this election address.  I had a poster printed and I handed it to every worker leaving the dockyard.  I have no apology to make for letting them know what would happen to their employment.  One moment Fine Gael are talking about the number of unemployed and the next moment they try to blacken an industry that is giving employment to nearly 1,000 men, and go so far as to force a vote on it in this House to drive those 1,000 men out on the roadside to add to the number of unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> Let us hear now from Deputy Thomas Fitzpatrick why he issued that election address in Cavan and why, at a time when Fine Gael talk about 40,000 or 50,000 unemployed or of the number of emigrants, he is endeavouring to drive another 1,000 either on to the unemployed list or to emigration. These are the things we want to know. We also want to know&mdash;certainly I do &mdash;the reasons why, when they were last in office, they prevented the general manager of Irish Steel from buying billets to run his industry, on the ground that Deputy Sweetman, Minister for Finance, did not want to spend the money.  He then prevented him from using first grade scrap, which was to be exported in order to find money to keep the Fine Gael ship floating.  The matter went so far that the general manager, who raised that place from a bankrupt concern to an industry giving employment to 500 men, Mr. Christy Fitzpatrick, threw up the job and walked out in disgust rather than produce an inferior article and employment in that industry had dropped to under 300 men on the day we ultimately got rid of the Fine Gael mixum-gatherum.  These are the things in which the people are interested and these are the things that cleared Fine Gael out of the town of Cobh during the last election.</P>
    <P>Let us get things clear.  You cannot look for industries, on the one hand, and endeavour to close down existing industries on the other.  Fine Gael will either have to row in in trying to find employment for our young men and women or they will have to stand up here and tell us openly that they intend to get rid of industries, as they did in the case of the Verolme Dockyard, and the emigrant ship is the place for our young men and women.</P>
    <P>Some years ago my constituency was an eyesore.  There were three derelict towns.  In the town of Cobh, Fine Gael had brought about the very happy position in which there was a caretaker at the gate, minding the shore, and that is all the employment that was provided there.  I saw the dockyard grow.  As a matter of fact, I saw the previous dockyard started and I saw <Col N="1085" /> what happened.  I heard Fine Gael Deputies here pleading with their own Ministers for a subsidy to keep that dockyard in a position to continue giving employment.  I heard that subsidy refused and I saw that dockyard close down.  It was purchased by the gentleman who takes over derelict sites here, Raymond Thompson.  Every piece of machinery was sold at seven successive auctions.  After the Emergency I saw a ship coming in there, pulling over to where the old dockyard used to be, and the hole in her side was filled with cement to enable her to go elsewhere for repairs.  The Government then had to make a start. It was impossible to purchase machinery or anything else, but they had to start and fix that dockyard so that ordinary repairs at least could be carried out.  Thank God, that day has now gone and thank God we now have an industry giving employment to 1,000 young Irishmen who would otherwise have to emigrate.  I do not believe any Deputy was elected to this House to drive out of employment the 1,000 workers there.</P>
    <P>Haulbowline was in the same position.  The Cumann na nGaedheal cure was to have an auction of the machinery there every three months and the only employment in the town of Cobh was that provided for the couple of fellows who were brought over to prepare the machinery for auction or smash it up for scrap.  That situation has changed.  In the town of Cobh to-day and in the surrounding district no man is idle.  During the last couple of months we have had, thank God, another industry established there giving employment to about 200 more. In the town of Midleton the only employment was in the flour mill, which, under Deputy McGilligan's policy, gave employment to only 20 men on three days a week.  Today there is not a man idle in the town.  Only last year the new food processing plant was established there, giving employment to 100 people and, in a couple of years time, please God, we will have 600 employed in that plant.</P>
    <P>I remember Deputy O'Gorman, God rest his soul, telling us about the derelict town of Youghal.  He said it came <Col N="1086" /> to life for only three months in the year when the visitors arrived.  Today there is not a man or girl idle in the town.  There are four flourishing industries giving full employment.  I remember the time when I would go there, canvassing during election time, and the door would open and the woman of the house would say: &ldquo;Poor Mick has gone to England since you were here last.  He had to go over and try to get a bit of bread for us.&rdquo;  That was the condition of affairs then.  It is not the condition of affairs now, thank God.  I warn the members of the Fine Gael Party to keep their palsied hands off the industries in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I find difficulty in inducing industrialists to come in to what might be described as the backward parts of my constituency.  Even the town of Fermoy, which badly requires an industry, is hit.  I have approached four different industrialists in an effort to induce them to bring industries to either the Newmarket or Kanturk areas.  The difficulty involved is similar to that in west Clare, with which the Minister is conversant.  Therefore, I would ask him to consider some means whereby those people would be induced to bring industry there.  The labour is available. Young men are trained in our technical schools, which I regard as the best in Europe.  I know that each year a certain number of boys from the technical schools are given employment in Mallow sugar factory.  But something more is needed, something that will ensure that the boys and girls in that area will not be reared to leave on the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>Let us endeavour to get our industries out into the countryside, where, unfortunately, there is no outlet for young boys and girls except leave the country.  I should like the Minister to devote his attention to that problem during his term of office.  He knows, as I do, the conditions in west Clare which are similar to those in the northern part of my constituency.</P>
    <P>I should also like to deal, if I may, with the threat of strike at present hanging over our industries.  During the past six weeks I saw what happened at Irish Steel as a result of the <Col N="1087" /> strike at Industrial Gases.  We know what will happen if there is a strike in the ESB.  The sooner legislation is passed to cover essential industries and some method devised, through a court or otherwise, by which strikes can be avoided, the better it will be for everybody concerned.  The issue is now one of such gravity that it is time the Government took note of it.  I raised the matter a fortnight ago when I saw the conditions in the steel industry.  I am raising it again with the Minister now in the hope that the Government will find some solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment not alone the Minister but his two predecessors on the changes they have made in the face of Ireland, particularly in my constituency.  If it were otherwise, I would say so too.  I must compliment him on the change brought about in what was once a derelict countryside where now there is plenty of employment for all.  I only wish the same could prevail throughout all my constituency and over the country as a whole.  The will is there and I believe the way can be found.  With Deputy Dr. Hillery as Minister, I believe the initiative is there and that we will go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Corry on at least one matter and ask the Government to assist the smaller towns and country areas in securing industry.  I understand it is Government policy to establish six or seven industrial centres throughout the country on the lines of Shannon.  I could not agree with that policy.  We were told today that the Industrial Development Authority brought 25 new industries into the country during the past year.  They have not been seen in Kilkenny or anywhere near us.  I understand from some Government spokesmen that the towns surrounding these industrial centres will be used as dormitory towns &mdash;that the people will go to work in these industrial centres but will come home again to reside in their native places.  I do not think that would last long.  People will not continue <Col N="1088" /> travelling all the time in that way.  If they go to a town to work, they will surely settle down there.  I would ask the Minister to look into that policy.  We are anxious to have industries established in Kilkenny and other places.  There is much unemployment at present and more young men are coming from the schools.  The local people have gone as far as they can in an effort to promote industry. They find it very difficult.  Whether or not it is because we are an inland town and not in the same position as the sea ports, I cannot tell.  Whatever the cause, the fact is that no industry was brought to us by the IDA during the past year.</P>
      <P>The principal reason I intervened in this debate was to draw attention to the position of the anthracite coal industry.  This industry must be immediately investigated by the Government and put on a proper footing.  In the past few weeks three coal mines on the borders of my area have closed down involving the disemployment of 150 workers, that is, over 10 per cent of the workers engaged in the whole industry in the country.  Apart from those three, we have Castlecomer collieries, one of the largest coal mines in the country, working only every second week because stocks are increasing.  Production in the whole country averages 150,000 tons per year.  The average imports over the past three years were 50,000 tons, that is, over 33 per cent of the native production.  I am sure that local production could easily supply the whole market, and there would be no necessity for imports.</P>
      <P>The coal industry employs something like 1,300 workers, and it deserves very serious consideration from the Government.  It plays a very big part in our national economy, and these firms could easily produce the full requirements of the country.  Up to last year, exports of anthracite coal amounted to 23,000 tons per year.  I suppose the British levy had a bearing on the closing down of exports, and it brought further hardship to the coal industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a crisis in the Castlecomer mine last summer.  It was a financial crisis but, with the aid of the Minister, <Col N="1089" /> the crisis was overcome.  I think the present crisis is much worse than the crisis of last summer.  People are now working only every second week.  Men will not stay in employment when they work only every second week while there is plenty of demand for their energy and know-how in England, and there is a demand for miners in England.  Ballingarry mine is a good mine and it had a large employment content, but it is now feeling the pinch. Stocks are increasing week by week and people are getting very anxious.  I had an interview last week with the Minister for Transport and Power and he told me he was calling together the coal producers and the merchants in the hope of doing something about liquidating the surplus of coal.</P>
    <P>I understand Dublin city merchants would prefer to import anthracite coal than to take it from the local industry. I suppose there are reasons for this. Their coalyards are convenient to the docks, and perhaps it is easier to bring in anthracite from Wales by boat than to get it from the country here and get it unloaded, but that should not deter them from supporting Irish industry. I believe that where there is no difference in price or quality, they are inclined to import the foreign commodity.  There is no excuse for the importation of coal when there are large stocks in the country.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister's efforts will be successful in respect of the distribution of those stocks, but more is required than the immediate relief of the present position.  The industry needs stability and security for the workers who at present feel insecure.  They know that last year there was practically a close-down in Castlecomer, and now they are working only every second week, although the coal is of the best quality. With the high cost of living, the workers cannot carry on if they are employed only every second week.  As a matter of fact, last Saturday I had a communication from the Parish Priest of Castlecomer, the V. Rev. William O'Keeffe, which was also signed by Canon Edward Curry, Rector of Castlecomer.  They are perturbed about the situation, and they invited me to <Col N="1090" /> bring the position in Castlecomer to the attention of the Government.  I could give this communication to the Minister if it would be of help to him in his efforts to find some solution for the problems in the coal mining industry.</P>
    <P>I believe that the only hope for these people is to get a substantial grant to open shafts down to the coal face. Apparently they have not the capital required to open new shafts down to the coal face.  After all, the Government are prepared to give grants for the start of new industries, and why should they not give grants to an industry which has been there since before the State was established? Castlecomer colliery has been working for years and years, and apparently there are still millions of tons to be mined and brought to the surface.  It is only a matter of getting the proper equipment and handling the matter properly.  Capital is also needed, because stocks accumulate in some parts of the year and have to be carried over to other parts of the year.  I know grants are necessary for putting in machinery and shafts, and I think loans should also be made available.</P>
    <P>We are very glad that the Committee of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign are trying to do their best for the industry, but it is hard for that Committee to do much if the merchants do not stock the material.  I think we should have a Sell Irish Campaign which could be used on behalf of the coal industry.  No matter how anxious a householder is to purchase Irish anthracite, particularly in Dublin city, he cannot purchase it, and that is why I think we should have a Sell Irish to the Merchants Campaign.  There is no reason why one ton of foreign anthracite should be imported, and whether by tariffs or by other arrangement, the Government should do something, and they should take a deep interest in this problem. The livelihoods of over 1,000 workers and their families are concerned.  I would ask the Minister to make a statement, if possible, on Government policy on the anthracite industry, because these people are anxiously waiting to see what the Government <Col N="1091" /> will do for the industry.  It is only by Government intervention both as regards imports and capital that the industry can be put on a sound footing for the coming years.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in complimenting the Minister on his transfer to this most important office, and to wish him well in his efforts to bring about a complete industrialisation of the country, and thereby provide prosperity and employment for our people.  Many speakers have mentioned strikes, lock-outs and general disagreements in industry.  Here also I must compliment the Minister on his efforts to bring about a solution by bringing together the FUE and the trade unions to hammer out a scheme under which the need for strikes will be obviated, so that we can have progress in industrial relations which will benefit the people generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four hundred years ago John Donne said: &ldquo;No man is an island.&rdquo; That is equally true today, but greater emphasis must be laid on it today because when a strike occurs, it may affect not only one industry but many other industries also.  At the same time, we must be realistic about this and realise that no amount of wishful thinking will end strikes.  We must remove the cause.  Perhaps a wage demand is the most common cause of a strike.  It has been suggested that both capital and labour might consider the introduction of some system of profit sharing.  I am not quite sure how this would work out.  If a worker seeks a wage increase and says he is looking for a share of the profits from the industry, the employer might say: &ldquo;Righto; we will give you a share of the profits but you will also have to share the losses.&rdquo;  We must remember that workers may have to share the losses.  If the losses are too great, they lose their employment and they must accept it.  I have complete confidence in the Minister and in his efforts here with the two sides to bring about something useful whereby we can face our European friends in a competitive market.  We are mature enough to realise that if we cannot produce <Col N="1092" /> goods at a price at which they will sell abroad, we will not sell the goods, but instead we will be exporting our workers to find employment in other countries.</P>
    <P>Another matter refers to recruitment in the various trades.  I am aware of the great work being done by the National Apprenticeship Board, An Cheard Comhairle.  However, I think they are working too slowly and they must intensify their efforts in introducing apprenticeship schemes for all industries.  They must step up their training facilities so that our young girls and particularly our young boys will be assured of a complete training for industry.  Then we can face the future knowing that our young boys and girls are as well trained as the Dutch, the Germans or the Belgians. I know that point is dear to the Minister's heart and I have the utmost confidence that he will get things going in this direction.</P>
    <P>There is one thing confronting the parents of working people in every part of the country.  They do not want to see their sons and daughters going into blind-alley work.  The future life of their children is their responsibility. These boys become messengers at 17 or 18, they feel they are making progress in this line but the result of taking up this casual employment is the emigration ship.  I recall an incident some months ago when the British Government introduced the 15 per cent import levy.  Some workers in Droichead Nua and in Dublin came forward and agreed to work without pay in order to beat the levy.  The reward came from a then Member of this House who described them as dupes and fools.  I am sure the workers felt this criticism and I think it is a shocking thing that a Member of our National Assembly should so speak.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to mention is the ship-building and ship repair industry.  So far, too many of Irish Shipping Limited vessels are going abroad for repairs.  I realise Irish Shipping Limited are working hard to have the repairs done in the home yards.  Because of the noncompetitive prices they have to pay, <Col N="1093" /> Irish Shipping Limited have to go abroad and get repairs done.  Ship repair work is something you cannot protect by tariffs.  The Minister might consider giving a subsidy to some of these home yards so that ships could be repaired here.  We have ship building in Cork and I remember a few years ago it was done in Dublin in a much smaller yard.  I think a lot of employment could be given to platers, riveters, and so on.  There is an onus on the companies to perfect their machinery and their organisation so that they can compete with their continental counterparts.</P>
    <P>It is pleasant to look at the building trade and to observe a great boom at the moment.  As far as Dublin city is concerned, we in the City Council with the help of the Minister for Local Government promise to try to ensure that never in our time will there be a slump in the building trade. The Minister for Local Government said the other day that it was only a dying city that had no housing problem.  I know that we will always need houses and if we can so organise our building industry there will be a demand for building operatives and for many years to come there will be a need for building in the country and in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to mention is in relation to the spread of supermarkets, particularly in the city. Unfortunately, it is hard to stop the spread of the supermarkets as they are products of this century.  What is worrying is they are foreign-owned. When they are firmly established here in huge chains, they will become the main distributors of foreign-made goods.  They will be able to buy goods in bulk in their own countries and will hit our industries here.  That is something which must be carefully watched.  I shall conclude by again wishing the Minister every success in his new task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House too long on this debate.  I rise to support my colleague, Deputy Crotty, in the appeal he has made to the Minister to try to do something with regard to the coal industry.  I can bear out everything that has been <Col N="1094" /> said with regard to Ballingarry and Castlecomer coal mines.  Any help the Department will give in respect of this industry will be money well spent. As the Minister can readily understand, people who are not in constant employment are inclined to get dissatisfied and eventually they will leave on the emigrant ship.  That is something we should not allow to happen in this country.  At all costs we must keep our workers at home.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign has, I believe, been a success.  I for one have always believed that Irish goods should get preference on display by any trader.  I always make a point of asking for Irish goods whenever I approach a shopkeeper.  If everyone were to do that, we would be helping to keep our people in employment at home.</P>
      <P>I should like to say with regard to grants and loans that we hear criticism from time to time about grants being given to foreign industrialists.  I am in favour of the Department helping anybody, or any reputable firm, who tries to start an industry here and gives employment to our Irish people.  I fully realise that none of us is infallible.  You may come across perhaps one or two cases where the grants may be lost.  Any of the industrialists, on the whole, who have come here have made good use of the grants given to them.</P>
      <P>Whilst I approve of this, the Minister should also look after the interests of the established Irish industries.  They should not be forgotten.  Whilst people may come in here to start up their own industries and be helped by Irish capital, those who have weathered the storm&mdash;perhaps there are industries in this country at the moment which need help and would be entitled to it from the Department&mdash;should be given sympathetic consideration.  In mentioning that, I am thinking of one particular industry, the coal mining industry at Castlecomer.  I should like the Minister to consider the case of that company and do anything he can to keep these workers at home and in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the establishment of industries, I am very anxious that any <Col N="1095" /> factories started should be spread throughout the country.  Naturally, I should like to see some of those industries coming to my own constituency. I suppose we may be regarded as being in a happy position in the town of Carlow because we have a number of industries there.  We have, in particular, the sugar beet factory but there are times of the year during which we have unemployment.  The Carlow Chamber of Commerce have actually made a study of the area and can at any time give to the Department, or those interested, a list of sites that would be available for anybody interested in starting further industries. Whilst I say that we have pretty full employment, as you can readily understand, the sugar factory is naturally not working on full production throughout the entire year and at times it is a sorry sight to see so many of our people standing outside the labour exchange. Many of these people get tired of waiting and leave again on the emigrant ship.  Whilst we have a number of industries in this constituency, the impression should not be gained that we have not more labour available.  We have in this country, and down in my constituency, workers who are equal to, and better than, those in any other country.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned strikes.  I believe, personally, that strikes are bad both for employers and employees.  I do not believe, in the long run, anybody gains from a strike. I am one of those people who believe that if workers' representatives and employers can sit down at a table, any settlement can be reached.  If they meet together, they could probably come to a better agreement than they will at the end of a month or so when everybody has got sore and there has been dissatisfaction, families are out of employment and are short of money. This is something which the Department or the Minister should try to prevent in every way possible.  Whenever disputes may arise, they should try to bring about a settlement before there is any long term of unemployment or hardship which is sure to arise for both employers and employees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> In conclusion, I want to say that I have always found every section of this Department of great help whenever I had occasion to make inquiries.  I should like to take the opportunity, even from the Opposition benches, of wishing the Minister success in his new office.</P>

      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to wish the Minister success and good luck in his new appointment.  It is probably one of the most difficult appointments in the Government.  Probably he was selected by the Taoiseach for that very difficult position because of the many excellent qualities which he possesses, two of which are courtesy and patience.  Many of the difficulties which usually confront the Department of Industry and Commerce may in the future be ironed out smoothly because of the courtesy and the patience which he possesses.  Nevertheless, his job is a very difficult one.  To be in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce must, as every Deputy will admit, be an extremely difficult job and a very great responsibility.  The virtues of patience and courtesy combined with understanding and reasonableness and give and take, augur more pleasant relations between employees and employers as well as in respect of the many difficult problems which may confront the Labour Court or any branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add my voice to the voices from this side of the House on the subject of the coal mining industry. That is one of the reasons why I rise to speak on this Estimate.  I am interested in the coal mining industry, with particular reference to the Leinster coal fields.  I am familiar for over 20 years, since first I became a member of this House, with the undertakings and the development of the coalmines in my constituency in south Laois.  The upper part of the Leinster coalfield is in Castlecomer and subsidiary mines stretch from Crettyard and Doonane and right across to the Wolfhill part <Col N="1099" /> of my constituency.  I am particularly interested in this matter.  I know the amount of work which is available for the miners.  I know the mining tradition which has existed there for so many years.  I know how the town of Castlecomer depends on the output of the mines and the volume of work provided for the miners in the district.  I know also the tradition of mining in the Doonane and Wolfhill part of my constituency which is of equal importance to the miners and their families there as is the mining industry to the miners and families in the town of Castlecomer.</P>
    <P>Let us face facts about the mining industry.  I think the time has now come when the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so far as the mining industry is concerned, should, so to speak, take the bull by the horns. Either let us have coalmining, properly established, with security for the workers employed in the industry, or, for heaven's sake, let us cease tinkering with the industry as it has been tinkered with in the past.  The development of our coal resources is, in my opinion, of equal importance to our turf development.  I could never understand why the Government concentrated on the development of turf as a fuel&mdash;and rightly so, and with very great credit to Bord na Móna&mdash;while leaving the important industry of coalmining, particularly the mining of our anthracite, entirely at the mercy, so to speak, of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage at which it will not pay private enterprise to invest huge sums in coalmining.  It takes some tens of thousands of private capital to open up new shafts. If new drills and modern boring equipment have to be purchased, it may take tens of thousands of pounds to purchase even one single unit of machinery to be used in the opening up of these coal shafts.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for us on any side of the House to offer expressions of sympathy to miners who are out of work.  We have a responsibility to the <Col N="1100" /> wives and families of those people in my constituency who at this very moment are faced with no future and no security.  I venture to say that should any officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce travel down to the coalmining districts of south Laois, he will find a very high degree of poverty and distress in the homes of the miners who are now out of work as a result of the closing of a number of small mines there.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to the serious state of affairs which faces the Castlecomer collieries.  I am one of the Deputies who received a deputation of the clergy, the management and the workers concerned.  I am quite satisfied, from the information placed at my disposal by all those interested in the development of the Castlecomer mines and by those who have the future of the Leinster coalfield at heart, that the time has now arrived when serious Government action must be taken in regard to our coalmining industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty and Deputy Governey, among other Deputies, are greatly concerned in this matter.  I presume Deputy Gibbons, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, like the other Kilkenny Deputies, has spoken on this matter, too, because it is of very great concern to him.  I should like to hear a statement of positive Government policy from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the future of our coalmines.  Are we now reaching the stage when we will allow these coalmines to close, one by one, because of lack of capital and marketing difficulties?</P>
    <P>The equipment in the coalmines is not up to date and does not give an economically increased output.  I am reliably informed that the private companies in south Laois and part of Kilkenny cannot continue to invest in them as they have been investing.  The time has come when the State must assist in opening new shafts and guaranteeing whatever financial accommodation may be required to help in the provision of up-to-date boring <Col N="1101" /> equipment, all aimed at providing security of employment for miners.  It is very difficult for families with a mining tradition to settle down to any other sort of employment.  In the area of Castlecomer there is no other means of employment.  For generations the people have been in the mines and the danger now is that they will emigrate, at the cost of great loss to the industry.  When they emigrate, their families will follow.  Any of them who have done so have settled down beside the Welsh coalmines and in other mining areas in Britain.  If they find security in the mining industry there, they will not come back here to face insecurity.</P>
    <P>I fear the distress that will follow the closing down of coalmines in Leinster.  The workers' representatives in the trade unions and the clergy in Castlecomer, as well as the mine managements in Laois, have been pointing out the distress being experienced throughout the area among families with a mining tradition. In all sincerity, I invite the Minister to visit the village of Doonane to witness that distress.  He will find it appalling. I hope the fact that we, as Deputies representing Laois-Offaly and Carlow-Kilkenny, have focused attention on the plight of the coalmining industry throughout Leinster will mean there will be serious Government action as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I gave an undertaking to Canon Curry and to others concerned with the welfare of the people there that I would direct the Minister's attention to the problem by raising it publicly in the Dáil.  I have not done this for the purpose of causing any embarrassment to the Government but because I am very concerned to protect an industry which has given such good employment in the past.  I suggest to the Minister in all good faith that he take a page from the copy of Bord na Móna who have organised the peat industry of the country so successfully. I am not advocating legislation.  Without legislation the Minister could set up a board to ensure the future of the mining industry and to protect security of employment for the miners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> I should like the Minister to tell us why we import anthracite when we have anthracite dumped alongside the mines in the Leinster collieries because there is no market for it.  Surely the Minister cannot lend a deaf ear or turn a blind eye to that state of affairs.  I appreciate that in our agreement with Britain, which one might call the coal-cattle pact, we agree to take a certain amount of coal and anthracite, but it has been pointed out that up to some time ago we had a considerable export of anthracite.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the position concerning the amount of duff anthracite available in large quantities in parts of Laois.  When I last visited the coalmining part of my constituency some time ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I can recall very clearly my attention being directed to the fact that while ships were taking anthracite out of the country, they met other ships on the seas bringing anthracite in.  That has never been explained to me.  I cannot understand why we should import anthracite with one ship and export anthracite with another.  Perhaps the Minister would explain it when he is replying tonight or tomorrow afternoon.  I expect him to go very fully into the question of our imports of anthracite so that we shall know what steps may be taken to prevent imports of anthracite until we put our own mines in a shape to operate successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister&mdash;the officers of his Department already know it&mdash; that anthracite produced here has been described abroad as being the best in the world.  Therefore, there seems no good reason why home-produced anthracite should not be made available to all concerns here.  I was interested to hear Deputy Crotty say that the Minister for Transport and Power was taking steps to ensure that home-produced anthracite would be used for transport and other power purposes.  The time has come when very serious action must be taken in this respect.  If our mines are allowed <Col N="1103" /> to close down, our miners will emigrate and even if we find it possible to reopen them at some future time, the miners will not be available to operate them.  One other matter I should like to deal with is the criticism now and again levelled against Fine Gael in relation to Irish industry.</P>

It is a terrible pity that members of the Dáil on any side should attempt to make political capital out of Irish industry.  It is a pity that anyone should bedevil Irish industry by making a political plaything of it.  Fianna Fáil have been painting a picture that they were the be-all, the end-all, the saviours of Irish industry.  Fine Gael started the beet factories and the Shannon Scheme. Fianna Fáil, anxious to get a crack at them, described the beet factories and the Shannon Scheme as white elephants.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to explain, so far unsuccessfully, how Fianna Fáil have endeavoured to discredit Fine Gael in relation to industry.  I have gone to great lengths to point out that Fine Gael were the first to establish industries.  The former Deputy McGilligan, as the first Minister for Industry and Commerce, had the difficult job of establishing our first industries and they were belittled by Fianna Fáil and described as white elephants with which the people should have nothing to do.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority was set up by the former Deputy Morrissey, as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I can remember listening to the Taoiseach standing where I am now standing and saying that if he got back into office, he would scrap the Industrial Development Authority, that everything which Mr. Morrissey did in relation to the furtherance of industry was wrong and not in the best interests of the country and that at the first opportunity he would repeal everything Mr. Morrissey had done.  The Taoiseach did get back into office but he did not change anything <Col N="1105" /> and he agreed that the setting up of the Industrial Development Authority was a good step in the interests of the promotion of industry, despite his former promise.</P>
      <P>Now we are told that Fianna Fáil are the people who have done everything for industry.  Then there came the stage when certain tax concessions were given which made it easier for outside investment to come in and establish industries.  That was done not by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance but by Deputy Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance.  Did we hear any Fianna Fáil Deputy speaking on this Estimate, or on any other occasion when matters relating to the Department of Industry and Commerce were being debated, giving one word of credit to Deputy Sweetman for the tax concessions he gave which resulted in industries being established here and which resulted in many silver keys being given to Fianna Fáil Ministers when they were opening industries for which the foundations were laid by those tax concessions?  Everybody knows that is the position but Fianna Fáil are so wrapped up in their own sense of importance, mixed with hypocrisy, that they cannot see any good coming from anybody except themselves.</P>

      <P>That is an example of the one-track mind: everybody is wrong but them.  They are the only people who are right all the time and they never give any credit to anybody for having any intelligence. All the intelligence, ability, drive and initiative are on the one side and they say that everybody with commonsense and intelligence votes for Fianna Fáil and those who have not got commonsense or intelligence do not vote Fianna Fáil.  Naturally enough people get the type of Government they deserve.  I am endeavouring to show that there are people on this side of the House as much concerned about the development of industry as people on the far side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time we have heard criticisms of the industries established at Shannon Airport.  Not once but ten <Col N="1106" /> times I have been on record in this House as completely approving the undertakings of the Shannon Development Company.  I have visited the area and have been impressed beyond all expectations.  I was impressed by the buildings, by the skill of those engaged in the industries, by their output and by the markets which they have.  If I see employment being provided, that is good enough for me, and I saw evidence from my visit that employment was being provided there for Irishmen. I would sooner see those people making pianos or anything else at Shannon than making them in Britain, Canada, the USA or anywhere else.  The only thing that is wrong is that there are not sufficient industries like the industries we have at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to everybody connected with the Shannon Development Company, from Mr. Brendan O'Regan down.  They are men of initiative, courage and drive and the industries established there have been an asset to the workers. Instead of being critical, we should be giving them a clap on the back for providing employment at home for our workers and for producing an article for export which is a good advertisement for what Irish workers can produce at home.  That is my opinion.  Somebody else may have another opinion but every Deputy is entitled to his own opinion.  These factories are a credit to the country and I would like to hear any other Deputy say otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am speaking for myself but because I am praising the industries, Fianna Fáil now disagree.  They disagree if I condemn them and they disagree if I praise them.  It is very difficult to know how to satisfy some Fianna Fáil Deputies.  I want to put it on record that if I have evidence before me that industry is moving, if I see workers coming out of the factory when the whistle sounds, if I see them with pay packets at the end of the week, I say that is progress and that is what is wanted.</P>
    <P>I may go further.  Many say that national book-keeping is very important.  That is true but which is more important, keeping the books right or <Col N="1107" /> keeping the people employed in their own country?  Whether the books are right or wrong, our primary responsibility is to provide employment for our own people at home.  If I see evidence of that, I am all for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry has made an appeal. He is dealing with all the towns in his constituency but he singles out one with which he is not pleased, Fermoy. He wants an industry established there.  While listening to him, I could not help thinking that there is a pencil factory in Fermoy producing good pencils while his Party was purchasing imported pencils for the State and leaving pencils on the factory shelves in Fermoy.  He wants a factory for Fermoy but his Party will not take the pencils for Government use that are manufactured in the Fermoy factory because we are told by the Government that they do not make hard pencils there.  I assure Deputy Corry that there are pencils made in Fermoy as hard as his neck, and that is pretty hard.  I have evidence of that and I challenge Deputy Corry or the Minister or any other Minister to say that pencils made in Fermoy are not as good as any imported pencils.  I cannot see why in a Party with members as vocal as Deputy Corry in regard to industries in his own constituency, the Deputy would not have the courage to say: &ldquo;Cut out the foreign pencils and use pencils from my constituency,&rdquo; instead of leaving it to Deputy Flanagan to raise it in the interest of those whom Deputy Corry is paid to represent.  I hope we have focused attention again on pencils manufactured in Fermoy and that steps will be taken to give more encouragement and assistance to the Fermoy pencil factory.  That industry gives employment and produces a first-class article and I cannot understand why there has not been greater support for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry has been very vocal about the dockyards in his constituency.  I visited those dockyards and I saw the workers of Cobh and Passage West employed there and, as a member of this House who believes <Col N="1108" /> in Irish industry, I would far prefer to see Irish workers employed making Irish ships in Haulbowline than see those ships being built abroad.  I never saw anything wrong with the building of our ships there and I do not care whether the name of the firm is Verolme or not, if it gives work to Irish people and produces seaworthy vessels.  I am satisfied the industry is an asset and I fail to understand why Deputy Corry should seek to decry a Party who are endeavouring to promote industry, by painting a picture that everybody in that Party is anxious to take steps to close down the Verolme Dockyard.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on record that if there had been a change of Government three weeks ago Verolme Dockyard would still be open today.</P>

As it is, I am making a better speech than Deputy Clohessy could make and as good a speech as Deputy Allen could attempt to make and a speech equal in standard to Deputy Corry's, but because there is any question of praise for Irish industries from this side of the House they dislike to hear it. There are men on these benches more concerned with the promotion and development of Irish industries than they ever were in Fianna Fáil.  There are men on these benches who give more employment than half the Fianna Fáil Party put together and men who treat their workers even better than is laid down by the trade unions.</P>

      <P>Even though Deputy Corry spoke at length and was looking for a factory for Fermoy, he did not know that the pencil factory could not sell their pencils to the <Col N="1110" /> Fianna Fáil Government.  He did not as much as sneeze about it in the corridors of this House when the Fermoy pencils were thrown out and left aside and the foreign, imported pencil was being supplied by Fianna Fáil to all the civil servants in the public service.  I should like to hear Deputy Corry talking with a little sincerity and determination about the development of a worthwhile industry in his own constituency.  I venture to say that of all the industries in Deputy Corry's constituency there is none more deserving of more support, particularly in Fianna Fáil, than the pencil factory in Fermoy which Deputy Corry did not know was there.</P>
      <P>I want to refer very briefly to Fianna Fáil's sentiments in regard to decentralisation of industry.  We are all with them on that.  Is there any Deputy in the House who will say that we are wrong in that?  Silence. Then we must be right.  We are with them on that.  I have not heard the present Minister at it yet but I presume that when he finds his feet after a couple of weeks he will be singing the same old song about the opening of various factories and making suggestions as to the new factories that have been opened in the past few years.  Is it too much to expect that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce is replying to this debate his officials will have equipped him with a list, constituency by constituency, giving details as to where those new factories are situated?  I have been listening to all the talk about new factories but I see none of them in my own constituency and when I visit the neighbouring constituency the people there tell me that they have none of them either.</P>

Bord na Móna cannot be included amongst the industries which Fianna Fáil say have been established as a result of investment of foreign capital here.  What is wrong with Deputy Allen is that he is jealous of what my <Col N="1111" /> constituency got from Bord na Móna whereas his constituency did not get anything from Bord na Móna.

      <P>I agree, and I hope we will not hear any more of it on this Estimate.  I was referring to the establishment of industries and was asking the Minister to give, constituency by constituency, the towns in which these industries that he is talking about have been set up.  They are not in my constituency.  I do not see any of them.</P>
      <P>The only industry ever set up in Portlaoise was the Irish Worsted Mills which was sponsored by the late Deputy Davin.  From that day to this, no industry has been brought to Portlaoise.  Salts (Ireland) Ltd. is the only industry ever established in Tullamore. Where are all the Fianna Fáil industries?  I do not see any in Laois-Offaly. Will the Minister now give us the names of the towns where these industries are, the number of persons employed in them and state whether the production is for the export or the home market?  We would be able to discuss the question of these industries if we knew where they were.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of mystery surrounding the Fianna Fáil industries.  A Minister when speaking in Drogheda, can refer to the industries they have started in the south and when speaking in some part of Munster, can refer to all the industries established west of the Shannon, and when speaking in some other place, of the industries started in Dublin or Cork, but when one wants to know where these industries are, there seems to be great mystery about them.  Would the Minister clear the air and tell us where the industries are and the record in regard to employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister know that, while he talks about the establishment of industries, on this very day there are 100 unemployed men in the town of <Col N="1113" /> Tullamore signing at the labour exchange?</P>

      <P>I agree again, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I want now to refer briefly to what Deputy Governey said about the sugar beet factory in Carlow.  Carlow is a town which provides employment for a large number of my constituents.  When the beet factory is working short time, that situation reacts mainly on my constituents.  It might be a wise thing for the Minister to direct the attention of the responsible authorities to the need for continuity of employment in the sugar industry so that casual workers, who have no security, can be given some guarantee of employment. The provision of work is a very great responsibility, and one way in which we can provide additional employment is through a wise industrial programme.  I want to assure the Minister that he will have our full support and active co-operation in any steps taken towards the sponsoring and development of Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign has done a considerable amount of good to Irish industry.  I hope the drive to buy Irish is not going to last only as long as the British Government decide to retain any part of the levy they imposed some months ago. There is a duty on all Irish people to purchase Irish goods on every possible occasion.  The British levy has been a blessing in disguise to this country because it has made us realise the importance of buying what our own people produce, and I hope that will continue.  I regret that it should ever have been necessary to beg and persuade, by publicity and otherwise, from platform and pulpit, our people to buy what they produce themselves. The Irish people have an inferiority complex in this regard: unless an article is foreign made it is no good. We can produce and have been producing <Col N="1114" /> in many branches of industry the best that could be produced in any part of the world.  I am glad we have now begun to realise that by buying Irish goods, we are keeping our own people in employment and making further investment in Irish industry possible.  Any steps the Government take in regard to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign or in regard to promoting industry will be welcome.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that he give consideration to the establishment of industries in which the by-products of agriculture will be used.  On another occasion I asked a section of the Minister's Department to investigate the possibility of the establishment of a pulp industry in conjunction with the Forestry Division. Our forestry has grown to such an extent that it should be possible to establish more industries which are based on the by-products of our forests. In this connection I would remind the Minister that Laois-Offaly has some of the best forests in the country.  He should consider the establishment of a pulp industry convenient to these extensive and successful forests which have been a credit to the Forestry Division, the workers and all concerned. Such an industry would be a benefit to the whole community.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's term of office will be one in which there will be few differences between management and workers and that industry will make further progress.  The Minister's job is one which will undoubtedly bring him under fire occasionally, and he may be the subject of very severe criticism. We are all criticised from time to time but surely those of us who are sufficiently long in public life, particularly old warriors like Deputy Corry and me, have gone beyond the stage when criticism will have any effect on us.  We believe that working hard and being ambitious to achieve results, as I believe the Minister is, will be the means of putting Irish industry on a sound basis, increasing the number in employment, increasing exports and enabling us to cut down imports.  By increasing exports and reducing imports, we shall be taking a courageous step towards rectifying our balance of payments problem <Col N="1115" /> which is rocking the Irish ship very severely at the moment and which could present us with a more serious problem within the next three or four years.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in his new office.  I am sure he will not be subjected to any unwarranted or unnecessary criticism.  I always feel obliged to make a constructive speech in the hope that it will fall on sympathetic ears and that the Minister will endeavour to put the recommendations I make into practice.  Constructive criticism is in the best interests of all concerned, particularly those who are anxious to see that Irish industry makes the best contribution possible to the development of our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure you, Sir, that it is not my intention to delay the House more than a few minutes to-night.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on what I call his promotion from the Ministry of Education to that of Industry and Commerce.  If it has to be a Fianna Fáil Minister there&mdash;and this House decided that by a majority vote some weeks ago&mdash;the House is lucky in having a man as broadminded as I know the Minister to be. I want particularly to impress on him in the few words I have to say that, coming from a provincial town as he himself comes from in Clare, I hope he will not become city-minded like many of his predecessors in that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must know, as many rural Deputies know, that many of our towns and villages throughout the length and breadth of Ireland have seen better days.  It is unfortunate that a Deputy should have to say that here in respect of people and their families who for generations got a comfortable living in our towns and villages.  I had occasion to refer here some 12 months ago to what I believed then was the start of the decay that was setting in in these towns and villages.  I do not know if I may refer to it here but I feel sure the House and the Minister will not take any exception if I repeat that I thought it a pity&mdash;indeed it was a sad state of affairs&mdash;that the then Taoiseach or some Minister did not try to <Col N="1116" /> prevent supermarkets from taking control in our towns and villages.  I said then, and I repeat, that there was a move afoot to wipe out all the small traders in this country.  Unfortunately in many cases my prognostications have proved to be right.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing about these supermarkets gaining control of the businesses in our towns and villages is that a great deal of the money that is going into exterminating our small traders and shopkeepers is foreign money.  I hate to think what will happen when these people get full control and achieve their objective of wiping out many of our retailers and traders.  I do not know if the Minister can see at this stage any way of preventing this objectionable development from becoming worse than it is.  The Minister's outlook must be a sympathetic one where provincial towns and villages are concerned and I am sure he will bring both his ability and his experience to bear on the situation with beneficial results for those who still remain in our villages and towns. They are not many.</P>
    <P>I was not here when Deputy Corry was speaking, but I understand from Deputy O.J. Flanagan that he referred to the town of Fermoy.  That is the town in which I live.  It is a town much admired by all who know it.  Unfortunately Fermoy was one of those towns which lost all it practically had in the fight for independence.  No matter what anyone may say, I believe that the industrial drive, which seems to be concentrated now on our four principal cities, could be directed to towns like Fermoy.  I appeal very sincerely to the Minister to instruct his officials to direct some of the industrial drive to towns like Fermoy. There are families more than willing to stay in their own country, provided they can find employment in it.  Unfortunately many of our skilled workers have left Fermoy and towns like it.  The sad feature is that, having gone, they get married abroad and that means whole families lost to their native towns and villages.</P>
    <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate and I did so only for <Col N="1117" /> the purpose of joining with Deputy O.J. Flanagan in giving the lie to the propaganda of the fallacy by the Fianna Fáil Party, and notably Deputy Corry, that Fine Gael are anti-industry. That is not so.  Any criticism that was made of the Verolme Dockyard and any questions that were asked&mdash;I asked one or two&mdash;were motivated solely because of rumours current and in order to allay anxiety.  Like Deputy O.J. Flanagan, I am glad so many workers are employed in the Verolme Dockyard.  The employment is good and the conditions are ideal.  Having said that, I trust we have now heard the last from Deputy Corry of our alleged intention to close down that industry.</P>

    <P>The debate was wide in range and I should like to deal, first of all, with the criticism that was made that my introductory statement did not deal in depth with many of the subjects in which Deputies are interested.  Since the introductory statement took nearly an hour and a half, I think the opposite criticism might be more accurately levelled against it.  If not exhaustive, it was certainly extensive.  The operations <Col N="1118" /> of the Department and the associated State bodies are so wide that it is difficult to present a full picture to the House without taking a very long time indeed.  I intend to give some thought to another method of presenting Deputies in future with a picture of the year's happenings and I would remind those who raised questions that the various semi-State bodies associated with my Department all produce annual reports.  If Deputy O.J. Flanagan still has doubts about the existence of certain factories, he will find a list of them according to counties in the report of Foras Tionscal.  However, I imagine he was not so much seeking information as working off the last vestiges of election steam.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's difficulty and the difficulty of the other Fine Gael speakers who say we stole their policy and then proceed to criticise that policy.  I think we have reached a stage now in which we find both sides of the House agreeing that Irish manufacturing industry is the vital key to our future.  That is a good start and, if both sides claim credit, there is plenty of credit to go around.  I believe the people who really earn the credit are the industrialists themselves and not members of any political Party.  A great deal of credit is due to our industrialists, particularly in view of the proof they have given this year that they are strong enough to meet and overcome, to a great extent, the handicaps presented by the imposition of the British levy.  The fact that this levy has now been reduced is a help but our industries are still working under difficulties and will continue to do so as long as the levy remains in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take issue with Deputy Ryan who said there was no credit whatever due to the Government or to Government Departments for the way in which the difficulties generated by the levy were surmounted.  He must not have read the remarks of prominent industrialists at a conference in Killarney recently <Col N="1119" /> when they gave unstinted praise to the Government for having, without being asked, brought in market development grants without which the manufacturers could hardly have survived.  They also praised the Government for having done so almost overnight.  There is plenty of credit to go around and we should not attempt to concentrate it all in one place or deny it where it is obviously deserved.</P>
    <P>The main theme of our thinking, in terms of simplifying our approach to industry, should be that we set out to give employment to our own people at home.  To do this, we have to have a big expansion in our manufacturing industries.  Our goods must be of a class, price and design to be competitive.  They must win support in the home market and find extensive export markets.  That programme requires the very best efforts of our industrialists.  It requires also the attraction of new industries, but a great deal of the expansion expected from this sector in the Government's Second Programme is expected to come from the older established industries.  We are expecting a great deal from our industrialists and, at the same time, we have to supply Government help.</P>
    <P>I often feel that the survival of this nation through history has been one of the miracles of history.  I see the present economic challenge as the equal of any other we have met before.  I approach it in the same spirit&mdash;that our people can and will survive when tested.  The progress to date has been good.  Last year we saw an increase in the output of manufactured goods of about ten per cent and an increase in the export of manufactured goods by about 30 per cent as well as a big increase in the number of jobs provided in manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should go back a little to see where the Government can help in the establishment of new industries and supporting the old.  Foras Tionscal was first constituted and empowered to make grants in the Undeveloped Areas Act in 1952, which I remember well because it was the occasion of my <Col N="1120" /> maiden speech in the House.  I was quite surprised when Deputy Donegan claimed that the principle of Government grants to industry was first introduced in 1956 by their Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  The Industrial Grants Act, which gave grants for factory buildings all over the country, was in 1956.  You merely had yours for the undeveloped areas in 1952.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Grants Act of 1956 empowered the IDA to make grants for the establishment of industries in areas other than the undeveloped areas.  The Industrial Grants Act of 1959 transferred the power to make grants to these undertakings outside the undeveloped areas from the IDA to Foras Tionscal and also empowered Foras Tionscal to complete payments of grants already made by the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that there is some confusion for the foreign industrialists because of the number of state agencies and that the IDA and Foras Tionscal should be combined. In practice, the IDA is a promoting body.  It undertakes the responsibility of coordinating with the other State bodies all the necessary action for the establishment of an industry by a foreign interest.  I feel there is a good advantage in having the body whose job it is to persuade a foreign industrialist to set up here separate from the body which decides the financial assistance he should get.  The House will appreciate that this ensures an objective assessment when it comes to the <Col N="1121" /> grant stage.  Therefore, I think there is a case for the existing close co-operation between the IDA and Foras Tionscal, but I feel strongly it is better to have two separate authorities&mdash;one promoting with all its energy the development of industry and the other scrutinising the worthiness of the development for a grant.</P>

      <P>I am using it with the Deputy's permission.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan spoke of the variety of announcements of the number of new factories established.  I was able to mention the number of new jobs provided last year.  But there is another side to the picture when an industry does not develop at the speed expected. <Col N="1122" /> I was asked to-day to say something about the Potez factory in Galway.  All I can say is I have no reason to assume that this firm will not, in time, build up to the production and employment envisaged when the factory was first adumbrated and developed.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that changes in world trading conditions can upset the plans of even the most efficient firm.  To-day at Question Time I dealt with the closing down of such a firm, the GEC factory at Dundalk.  Deputy Corish asked was it not frightening that this could happen.  I agree with him, but perhaps he could have used the word &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo;.  Here was a reputable firm which had made a substantial investment of its own and had done its own marketing research. Before agreeing to give a grant, Foras Tionscal satisfied themselves that the company's estimate of the market potential was realistic.  As I said, the company showed their own confidence in the project by investing very heavily in it.  There was a slump in the market which resulted in over-production of appliances of the type being produced at Dundalk.  I understand GEC were not the only large manufacturers of electrical equipment affected by this slump in the market.</P>
