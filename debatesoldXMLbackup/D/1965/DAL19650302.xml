      <P>I have seen the document in question. The cost of providing for an extension of services as outlined therein would be very considerable.  In reply to a question in the House on 28 May, 1963 (Dáil Debates, Volume 203, column 202) I gave an estimate of the cost of providing a &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; health service, such as is now envisaged in the Labour Party document.  On costings for the coming financial year, I would now estimate that the total annual cost of such a service, excluding capital expenditure, would be of the order of £44 million, representing an increase of about £15 million on the cost of the present health services.</P>

      <P>The average rate of maintenance allowance payable annually by health authorities to foster parents in respect of boarded-out children is £53.  In addition to these maintenance allowances, health authorities pay school fees for boarded-out children who, on completion of their primary school education, continue their education in secondary or vocational schools.  Health authorities also provide the full range of health services for boarded-out children, free of charge, where the foster parents wish to avail themselves of the services for the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clothing allowances paid by health authorities in respect of boarded-out children are generally graduated according to the age of the child.  The average rate of annual allowance for the older age groups is £15 12s. 6d.  Some health authorities <Col N="1125" /> supplement the clothing allowances by special payments for First Communion and Confirmation outfits.</P>

      <P>The present statutory provision under which medical practitioners can be required to notify to health authorities the occurrence of disease is limited in its application to infectious diseases. The basic purpose in, and the justification for, requiring such notification is to enable steps to be taken in good time to prevent the spread of these infectious diseases through the community.</P>
      <P>While it would be of value to have fuller information about morbidity generally, particularly so in the case of diseases the incidence of which appears to be on the increase, an extension of the scope of compulsory notification of leukaemia, which heretofore has not been regarded as infectious, and to other diseases in the same category, would represent a major departure from the present policy followed heretofore and would require very careful consideration.  The Deputy will appreciate that ethical issues of considerable moment for the medical profession would be involved.  For these reasons, I do not at present propose to consider amending legislation, as suggested.</P>

    <P>No steps have been taken to carry out a serological survey such as is visualised in the question, but a special analysis of cases of the disease in Ireland in the years 1952 to 1961 was made in 1962 by a member of the medical staff of my Department.  The comprehensive survey which the Deputy has in mind, involving as it would the testing of practically the entire farming population, would be very expensive and, having regard to the small number of cases, would not be justified.</P>

      <P>I have difficulty in interpreting the Deputy's question. Does it, for instance, relate to radioisotopes for medical use only or to radioisotopes generally?  By &ldquo;procurement&rdquo; does he mean the source from which they may be obtained (they are not manufactured in this country), or whether there are restrictions on their supply from abroad or their purchase here and so on?  Similarly, in regard to &ldquo;distribution&rdquo;, I am not clear whether the Deputy has in mind special requirements regarding the method of transportation to, or within, this country or whether he is anxious to get information on the principles underlying decisions that they should be available <Col N="1127" /> in a particular hospital but not in another.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the difficulties of a Minister in attempting to reply to a question in so imprecise a form.  Perhaps he would be good enough to put down another question indicating more clearly the information he requires.</P>

These provisions are referred to in a reply to a separate question by the Deputy which is being answered to-day.</P>
    <P>The general question of the quality of medical preparations used in the health services, and by the general public, is under active consideration in my Department and I am at present considering certain further steps to provide additional safeguards in this respect.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister received any complaints as to the unreliability of the specifications of certain drugs furnished to the medical profession?  If he has not received such complaints, would he consider addressing an inquiry to the Irish Medical Association as to whether such complaints have reached them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I had better reply to the latter part of the question.  Would the Deputy not consider it unreasonable that a Minister should be expected to go to any association or organisation and ask them whether they have any complaints in relation to a matter in which they may be specially interested, complaints which, no doubt, if they had received them, they would have passed on to the Minister?  With regard to the first part of the supplementary question asking if I had received complaints, the answer is: yes, I received complaints some years ago.  I did not <Col N="1129" /> receive them regularly, and latterly I have not received any &mdash; at least none was addressed to me personally as Minister.  I suggest the Deputy might be good enough to put down a question and I will give him fuller information.</P>

The requirements include the furnishing for examination by my Department, of information regarding methods of manufacture, and of tests applied at various stages of manufacture, and the submission of lists of expert staff concerned and information regarding containers.  Import and manufacturing licences are not granted until full information has been submitted and considered.</P>
      <P>Four samples of antibiotic preparations, not covered by the Therapeutic Substances code, were sent for testing in the past year.  These items were sent for testing on 11th August, 1964, 27th November, 1964, and 15th February, 1965.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of other commitments in preparing material similar to that included in the annual reports of my Department&mdash;and in this respect I refer particularly to the several descriptive and explanatory memoranda prepared for the Select Committee on the Health Services&mdash;it has not been possible for my Department to keep up-to-date in issuing these reports.  I would, however, point out to the Deputy that much of the material usually included in these reports is otherwise readily available from published sources.  Comprehensive information on vital statistics, with commentaries thereon, is contained in the annual reports on Vital Statistics and my statements to the House each year on the Estimates for my Department give a full account, readily available for reference, of current developments in the health services.</P>
      <P>I have, indeed, considerable doubts as to whether reports of the kind formerly published each year are worth the annual effort involved in their production and am inclined to the view that a report covering a period of years&mdash;say, five&mdash;would be more appropriate. Work on such a report covering the period up to 31st March, 1964, is proceeding.</P>

    <P>In stamp duty law, apart from the special relief afforded in respect of grant-type houses, no distinction is made between sales of land and of houses.  Abolition of the duties on sales of houses would, it is considered, have to be extended to sales of lands as well as of houses and the cost to the Exchequer of such a measure would be considerably in excess of the figures I have quoted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware that the special service charge for electricity supply asked of Mr. Joseph McPartland and of four other farmers in Lacoon, Glenfarne, County Leitrim, is beyond their capacity to pay; and, if so, whether the ESB will consider a reduction in the charge on these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the subsidy arrangements for rural electrification introduced by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1962 it is possible for some 96 per cent of rural dwellers to have electricity at reasonable charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining 4 per cent are in locations remote from the supply lines and the cost of extending supply to them is very high.  In their case, despite subsidy of £75, high charges are necessary to remunerate the capital which the ESB would have to lay out in extending the supply to them.  Unfortunately, there is no way in which those charges <Col N="1145" /> can be reduced short of an inordinately high subsidy which I could not recommend to the Government.  I should add that the same principles of charging are applied throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The householder mentioned in the Deputy's question was quoted a high special service charge because of the very isolated position of the premises. The other four householders referred to have been quoted terms which include special service charges amounting to approximately 40 per cent of the fixed charges and these terms have been accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement that only four per cent of the people are in this particular category and, as he has admitted that they are living in isolated areas which the Minister must remember is not their fault, surely he will agree that it is unfair to ask these people in isolated areas, and mostly poorer areas, to pay the full cost as they are asked to do at the moment and pay the extra service charge?  Is it not a fact that the remainder of the community would willingly give that additional amount in order to give fair treatment to these unfortunate people living in isolated areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made the position quite clear on a number of occasions.  If the special service charges were abolished the additional loss to the ESB on rural electrification would be of the order of £350,000.  On top of the existing loss of nearly £1 million, there would be an additional loss, if the people living in these very remote areas were connected, of the order of £330,000.  I should regard 96 per cent connection in our circumstances as very satisfactory and I think we are doing the very best job we can under the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute that but what I want to bring home to the Minister is this: is it not a fact that the Government at present are suggesting, at any rate, that they have a really keen interest in the welfare of people in rural areas, particularly isolated areas, and would this not be a most practicable way to show the Government's <Col N="1146" /> sincere interest in the welfare of these people?

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The right of patients in mental hospitals to be registered as electors and to vote at local elections existed prior to the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1963.  In consequence of subsection (9) of section 1 of the Electoral Act, 1923, such patients could not, however, be registered as being ordinarily resident in the hospital. Section 5 of the 1963 Act removed that restriction in relation to long-stay patients.  It provides, in effect, that patients should be registered as ordinarily resident at their homes if they are expected to return there within 18 months while patients who, in the <Col N="1150" /> opinion of the registration authority, will continue for an indefinite period to be patients or inmates of a mental hospital should be registered as being resident there.</P>

      <P>It is the duty of the Returning Officer to do everything necessary for effectually conducting an election.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government when a grant from the Road Fund was sanctioned by his Department for the construction of a roundabout at Walkinstown, Dublin; whether he considers that an excessive period of time has elapsed from that date to complete the formalities with regard to this proposal; <Col N="1156" /> and when it is likely that this proposal will be proceeded with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme for the provision of a roundabout at Walkinstown was approved by my Department in 1958 for execution under a grant of that year.  I understand that the acquisition difficulties which are preventing the execution of the scheme relate to some extent to the reluctance <Col N="1157" /> of the county council to displace the occupier of a cottage on the site because he is very old.  In the circumstances I would not like to express an opinion as to whether the time which has elapsed from the approval of the scheme is excessive, nor can I say when the work is likely to proceed.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the provisions of section 48 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, which empower sanitary authorities to provide facilities for games or other recreation or to contribute to the provision of land for games or recreation and to the provision of equipment, including buildings, for recreation purposes on such land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he approves of the principle whereby an applicant for <Col N="1158" /> rehousing (name and address supplied) who is living in rooms considered by local authorities as being suitable housing accommodation should have to pay an increased rent owing to the fact that his Department will only allow a subsidy at the rate of one-third instead of the normal two-thirds subsidy rate; and what steps he proposes to take to alter the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal rate of subsidy is one-third.  The two-thirds rate is payable only in respect of the rehousing of persons displaced from unfit, dangerous or overcrowded houses, or on medical or compassionate grounds.  None of these conditions would appear to apply in the case referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities are well aware of my views that the rent payable by a tenant of a local authority house should be related to financial and family circumstances rather than to the subsidy payable in respect of the particular house.  The fixing of the rent payable by individual tenants is a matter for the housing authority concerned but as indicated in the recent White Paper on Housing, page 29, certain proposals are under consideration to induce the general adoption by them of rents related to incomes.</P>

      <P>No person can receive unemployment assistance unless he is the holder of a qualification certificate, the <Col N="1159" /> grant of which depends, in the main, on the applicant's age and yearly means.  Once he has such a certificate the person must satisfy certain statutory conditions and be free from certain statutory disqualifications before he can obtain unemployment assistance.  As there are a number of these conditions and disqualifications, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the official Report a statement setting out particulars of them.  I may add that these particulars are available to applicants in explanatory leaflets issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">STATUTORY CONDITIONS FOR THE RECEIPT OF UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE.</P>
      <P>The following are the statutory conditions to be satisfied by the holder of a qualification certificate before he is entitled to receive unemployment assistance:</P>
      <P>(a)  that he has made application for unemployment assistance in the prescribed manner and proves in the prescribed manner that since the date of his application he has been continuously unemployed;</P>
      <P>(b)  that he is capable of work and is available for and genuinely seeking but is unable to obtain employment suitable for him having regard to his age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence, and family circumstances;</P>
      <P>(c)  that the weekly rate of his means (as shown on his qualification certificate) less 5/- in the case of a person with a dependant, or 2/- in the case of a person without a dependant, does not equal or exceed the scheduled rate of assistance applicable to his case;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the pattern of investigation of applications for the Service (1917-1921) Medal laid down by An Rialtas in 1957, reports were sought in the case which the Deputy has in mind from all available persons recorded as having been, during the three months ended 11th July, 1921, officers of the battalion and company of which the applicant claimed membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence obtained did not establish that the applicant was a <Col N="1171" /> member of Óglaigh na hÉireann (IRA) during the three months ended 11th July, 1921, and, consequently, the medal could not be awarded to him.</P>
    <P>The person who made the &ldquo;declaration&rdquo; to which, it is assumed, the Deputy refers is not recorded as having held any rank during the critical period.  His name appears on the relative company roll as a volunteer. As such, his evidence would not be acceptable for the purpose of verification of entitlement to the Medal.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the reports received from former IRA officers who co-operate in the investigation of applications for the Medal are confidential documents and that the contents of such reports, or the identity of their authors, cannot, therefore, be disclosed.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this person who made the affidavit was a section commander?  If he has been returned on the list as a volunteer that is inaccurate.  He was a section commander between the relevant dates, that is, 1st April, 1921, and 11th July, 1921.  I did not ask the Minister for the nature of the reports nor did I ask him for the names of the officers who certified that he was not a member.  I asked for the ranks of the officers.  The battalion officers were many miles away from this person and could not know whether he was a member or not without inquiring from people of equivalent rank, that is, to a section commander or a person like that in the area.  They would not, any more than myself, be able to say of their own knowledge that he was a member.  What I want to know is the rank of the officers whose evidence the Minister accepts in regard to that period.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,775,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for Grants to Local Authorities in Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land.</P>
      <P>The Estimate in the Book of Estimates for 1964-65 under this heading was for £9,422,000 and I am now asking for an additional £1,775,000.  Added to the year's Estimate for £9,422,000 were certain matters provided for in the Budget where it was proposed to increase the primary allowance from 70 per cent to 80 per cent and the supplementary allowances from 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  The round figure in the Budget was £1,400,000.  In fact, the amount required was £1,359,000 which was £41,000 less.  In addition to that, there was under-estimation in the original Estimate amounting to £416,000 and that gives the total of £1,775,000 which I am asking for now. I might say that the gross rate levied on land during the current year was £17.4 million which, of course, was the highest ever paid.  Agricultural grant was also the highest at £11.2 million.  Paid by the farmers in rates for the year was a figure of £6.2 million which, I am glad to say, was the lowest paid by farmers for land in ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were on the Government side of the House, one might, perhaps, suggest that this is good news for the farmers.  It is, however, not such good news at all because it must be remembered that rates are going up.  I do not accept the Minister's statement that this will result in a lower rate being paid by farmers than they have paid for some years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On land, yes.  That qualification makes some difference, but it is not a major difference.  I believe the farmers will pay considerably more in rates.  The Government are paying £1,775,000 more in respect of three-tenths of the rates raised on the total valuation.  Surely, if the Government are paying more, the farmer will also have to pay more?  If one takes the grants given by the Government over the years, one finds they have increased considerably and the burden of rates was such that the Government were compelled to meet it to some extent.  Otherwise, there would have been such a political and public outcry the Government would have been brought down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is rather like a sop to Cerberus. It is also very like patching the hole in the political dyke so that the Government will be in a position to state that they are helping the farmer <Col N="1181" /> to some extent with his rates.  What are the facts?  The last major change occurred in the financial year 1962-63 when the Government gave 25 per cent and remission on valuations over £20.  In that year the amount paid by the Government was £8,530,000.  This year it will be £11,197,000.  In 1962-63, the Government raised the 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  If one takes the total payments of rates by farmers, it is extremely difficult to pursue the computation but it will be found that farmers this year will pay something in the order of £4 million more than last year.  One has to take a great many estimates and find what will be the average increase in the £ in rates.  Even taking into account the Government's £1,775,000, I believe it can be proved that the farmer will pay £4 million more this year as compared with last year and it can be proved that the farmer paid an additional £6 million in rates since 1962-63.</P>
    <P>What are the causes?  The first thing one has to remember is that rates in relation to a farmer are quite different from rates in relation to anybody else. A man with an income of £700 or £800 does not pay income tax, if he has a wife and child.  On the other hand, a farmer with an income of £700 or £800 pays rates, not only on his house and outbuildings, the use of which he enjoys, but also on his land.  I like to refer to this as part of his stock-intrade. Whether he has 13 children or none, whether or not he is married, he must pay this impost.  In equity, it would appear quite impossible to justify the continuation of various items, such as health, coming within rates expenditure.</P>
    <P>The figures I have mentioned are quite conservative.  They will probably be exceeded.  We on this side of the House maintain that the farmer will pay an extra £4 million in rates this year and that he has paid since 1962-63 an extra £6 million in rates.  This is a very serious matter because of its disastrous effect on agricultural expansion. It is because of that we on this side of the House prefer to be conservative in our criticisms.  It is impossible for the Minister to controvert <Col N="1182" /> the figures I have given.  They are correct.</P>
    <P>What are the causes?  It can quite properly be argued that a farmer uses the roads more than the urban or town dweller does.  From that point of view, it can, perhaps, be argued that more should be charged against him from the point of view of roads.  The idea 50 years ago was that the rates paid for the roads and small items such as the very restricted medical services, the county homes, and home assistance.  Since then the pattern has changed completely.  The rates now have to pay 50 per cent of the cost of health services.  A farmer, earning £700 or £800, with five or six children, would, if he were an employed person, pay neither PAYE nor any other sort of tax.  As a farmer, he must pay rates regardless of family commitments.  It is our policy that the cost of health services, outside of hospitalisation, should not fall upon the rates.  This would result in reducing the rates by something like 4s. in the £.  There is no more justification for a situation in which a man, who would not have to pay income tax, or any other sort of direct taxation, has to pay rates, and that without any consideration at all, for his responsibilities to the children God has blessed him with.</P>
    <P>I have given the relevant figures. They are conservative.  If the Minister wants to play politics&mdash;I am sure he does not&mdash;he may throw back at me something which may apparently put my figures awry.  One must take into account that you have the primary grant varied from three-fifths to 80 per cent and the secondary grant over £20 valuation changed from 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  These changes were, of course, forced upon the Government because of the fantastic impost of rates.  I describe this as a sop to Cerberus.  This is the action of the man who puts the piece of rag in the hole in the dyke in the hope that it will hold the water in.  There is no hope for any alleviation in rates until there is a major change in policy. One of the changes should be the removal of the health charges, outside of hospitalisation, from the rates.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is necessary to patch <Col N="1183" /> the hole in the dyke.  From that point of view we accept it.  It is not evidence of solicitude on the part of the Government for the farmers.  It is not evidence of the Government's solicitude for the farmer in the position in which he finds himself in relation to rates.  This is a political expedient.  The Government have to do this because of the increasing burden falling on the farmers since 1962-63.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past few years the Government have been hoodwinking the farmers in regard to examining their problem of rates, particularly as it refers to land.  The aim of the Government&mdash;and, I presume, of the main Opposition Party&mdash;is to increase output from the land.  If proper use is made of the land, we can give the community greater social benefits, embark on more desirable educational programmes and provide the health services to which the people are entitled.  We have few sources of wealth in Ireland, apart from the land. One would imagine, therefore, that the Government would take all possible steps to ensure that the maximum production is achieved from the land.  Instead, we have this annual tinkering with inducements to farmers to increase output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure of relief to the farming community will not increase output by one iota.  I will go further and say that, as far as the expenditure of this money is concerned, 50 per cent of it is being misspent and should be channelled in a different direction if the Government are serious about increasing production.  The people who will benefit from this relief measure are mainly the large farmers. I worked out the figures for the Minister last year, showing beyond contradiction that aid is being given, not to the man who deserves it most and who has to produce in order to exist &mdash;the small man&mdash;but to the bigger man.  No attempt is being made by the Government in this measure to segregate the gentleman farmer, the telephone farmer, the rancher, the race-going farmer from the working farmer.  No attempt is made to segregate <Col N="1184" /> the absentee farmer, particularly in the midlands, from the small farmer.  He will get the same benefits in proportion to the size of his holding, although his land may not be producing one-tenth of what it is capable of producing.</P>
    <P>Surely the time has come to examine that situation?  What the Government are doing is subsidising inefficiency and laziness, subsidising those who can spend two days a week going to race meetings and other sporting functions.  They are being given relief of rates at public expense in order to have a good time for themselves. It is time that outlook was changed.  We have in Ireland from 11,000 to 12,000 holdings with a total poor law valuation of £2¼ million. That represents three per cent of the holdings of Ireland.  We have another 200,000 holdings, representing 70 per cent of the holdings in the country, with a total poor law valuation of less than £2 million.  Therefore, we have three per cent of the holdings in Ireland with a greater poor law valuation than 70 per cent.  We can see straight away where the money is going which is given towards the relief of rates.</P>
    <P>If the Government are serious about the implementation of the Land Bill, they should spotlight those 12,000 holdings to which I have referred and which between them have a bigger valuation than 200,000 holdings.  One of the ways the Government could acquire the necessary land to produce the 45-acre holding is by going after the people in that limited group.  What do they do?  They pass legislation to ease the burden of rates upon them. Twenty years ago a commission reported on the methods by which incentives could be given to small and medium farmers to increase output and, at the same time, to create a pool of land which would enable a greater number of economic units to be established. One of the recommendations was that, instead of helping inefficient farmers by giving them relief on rates, the rates should be doubled and trebled on every acre they had above a certain figure.  That recommendation was made by Most Rev. Dr. Lucey, Bishop of Cork.  I am glad I have him behind <Col N="1185" /> me when I make it.  That is one method by which the necessary pool of land could be acquired.  If we go on voting money on the basis we are asked to do so today, no pool of land will be made available.  Instead, we are helping these people with anything from 300 acres to 2,000 acres&mdash;some of them with chain farms of 300 acres or 400 acres each&mdash;in a country where the majority of the small farmers are huddled together in groups on uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise&mdash;the major Opposition Party should realise it, too&mdash;that a political promise to completely derate land is not for the benefit of the small farmer.  The small farmer is not the fool he is taken for by the people who make this promise. Those who will benefit by that type of action are the large farmers, the inefficient farmers.  The people who talk about this should tell us whether they are serious in saying they will completely derate agricultural land for those farmers who do not know what to do with their money and who are not concerned with getting the utmost out of the land.</P>

      <P>It is easy to talk about the cost so far as the small farmer is concerned.  The man under £25 valuation has at least two-thirds remission already.  Does the Deputy think he is conferring some wonderful benefit on the small farmer by suggesting his rates be completely remitted but, at the same time, he will be contributing to a health scheme in another form of rates contribution to which the Deputy has referred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The small farmers will not have to pay under our health scheme.  I want to make that clear for the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have this latest relief of rates measure which I say will be a blanket relief, irrespective of what type of land you have or the amount of land, or whether or not the land is being efficiently used.  I should like the Minister at this stage to have examined in his Department the possibility of making available, as soon as possible, funds for  local authority which is prepared to aid the farmers whose lands are flooded for six months of the year.</P>
      <P>I think this House would be unanimous in supporting the Minister if he said that instead of giving a substantial sum of the taxpayers' money to the rancher in the form of rate relief, he would instead divert that money, or portion of it, to the small farmer in any part of the country whose land is subject to flooding.  The position at the moment is that along the river Shannon and the river Suck, and along the major tributaries of the Shannon, the small farmers have in many cases more than 50 per cent of their land flooded from October to March.  I know many farmers who do not see their land from October, and perhaps sometimes from November, until the beginning of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it not possible to aid these people?  Surely it is a terrible condemnation of a Government that after years of waiting, and of promises that our drainage scheme would be undertaken, these people are still waiting for relief in that respect?  While they are waiting for the necessary drainage works to be implemented, they still have to pay rates on land which they cannot use.  I cannot picture the Minister, or any Deputy, deprived of his income or salary for six months of the <Col N="1187" /> year and then being asked to pay income tax on that portion.  I know the row that would be kicked up.</P>
    <P>We are asking farmers whose lands are flooded for five or six months of the year to a depth of three inches, or even two to three feet, to pay rates on that land.  The Minister has first-class officials advising him, men who would be able to devise a suitable scheme whereby the necessary funds could be channelled towards the relief of the type of farmer to whom I have referred. There would be far greater support from the general public for such a measure if they felt it was contemplated that these people were to get aid rather than some of the people concerned, that is, the combines, the telephone farmers, the absentee landlords and the haw-haw gentlemen who seldom see their estates except for two or three months of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no means of making a calculation that would bear out what Deputy Donegan says, or perhaps not bear him out.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy McQuillan's talk, he said this is only tinkering.  This is an expensive type of tinkering, I can assure the Deputy, because providing £11.72 million for farmers' rates can hardly be regarded as tinkering.  My idea of tinkering is something small and trivial and not of much use.  I cannot agree with Deputy McQuillan, though he has made the statement before, that it is the larger farmers that get relief rather than the smaller farmers. After all, as the Deputy is aware, on the first £20 valuation, every farmer, whether large or small gets 80 per cent relief of rates, that is, he pays only 20 per cent of the rate.  That must benefit the small farmers and, in fact, very much more than it would the bigger farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Deputy McQuillan, about 80 per cent of the farmers are under £20 valuation and, therefore, they get this relief of 80 per cent.  Consider the amount it takes to pay for these various subheads: primary allowances, £8 million, or within £25 of it; employment allowances, another million and supplementary allowances to landowners over and above the £20 <Col N="1188" /> valuation, £2,250,000.  On that division, therefore, it is evident the small farmer is benefiting very considerably from the way the grants are administered.</P>
    <P>There is one other item I should like to mention.  When Deputy Donegan spoke about the new health scheme which is proposed, did I understand him to say that the small farmer would not have to contribute at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £32,500 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for certain Miscellaneous Expenses, including certain Grants-inAid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two items in the Supplementary <Col N="1189" /> Estimates which I should like to explain.  First of all, an Insurance Compensation Act was passed in 1964 to deal with any company that might go bankrupt and to provide that those who were assured with that particular company before it went bankrupt would get certain compensation in respect of any claims that might arise. A fund was established under that Act and the Minister for Finance was to contribute £30,000.  As well as that, that fund had income by way of levies from non-life insurance companies, whether foreign or Irish, and there was a provision that one could borrow. We had to pay £30,000 into that fund which was taken out of the Contingency Fund and I am now asking the Dáil to repay that amount to the Contingency Fund.  The Fund is under the control of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice and money can be paid out only by court order.  I may tell the House that so far no money has been paid out, even to the Equitable Insurance Company which is the only one that came up under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that where money is urgently needed, and the Dáil is not sitting, it has to be paid from the Contingency Fund and then repaid to the Fund and, therefore, it is appropriate that I should take the Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has any worry about defending this at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second item is in regard to the National Anthem.  Deputies may not be aware that in 1933 some proceedings were threatened in court against a theatre by the author and representatives of his partner in setting the song to music.  They had threatened proceedings against this theatre for playing the National Anthem without permission to use it.  At the time the Government stepped in and purchased the rights from the author, Mr. Peadar Kearney and from his partner, Mr. Michael Heaney, who was dead at that time but whose representatives were there, and for £1,000 they bought the rights.  That appeared to be the end of the matter at the time.  The intention in buying out the existing rights was to free the Anthem of vested interests and make it freely available for performance. That, as I said, appeared to be all right until recently it was realised that the right which was bought would lapse between 1967 and 1993. That was as a result of the Commercial Property Protection Act, 1959 which gave a right for 25 years after the person's death.  That is all the person could dispose of, for 25 years after his death, but his legal representatives would be entitled to benefit from the performance of this song and music between that and 1993; in other words for 25 years.  When we realised this we had to set about buying the rights between 1967 and 1993.  Eventually, we secured an agreement with the representatives of both Mr. Peadar Kearney and Mr. Michael Heaney and bought the rights for £2,500.  When the Estimate was introduced some of the newspapers said that we had to be quick about this because the time was running out.  It was not exactly that, because there were a few years to <Col N="1191" /> spare, but the bargain was eventually made and one of the conditions was prompt payment.  That is why we had to pay for it out of the Contingency Fund and I am asking Deputies to replenish the Fund in that amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever made that condition in relation to the second item knew the devious ways of Government Departments, including the Department of Finance, in letting things run for a very considerable period.  When there was such an urgent necessity for payment it was perfectly proper that it should have been paid out of the Contingency Fund and, of course, it is perfectly right that we should now reimburse the Fund in respect of subhead J. However, it is not in relation to that subhead that I want to make some observations on this Supplementary Estimate but in respect of the first one.  I do so mainly in the light of observations that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made in this House on the 10th February, 1965, particularly at column 112 of the debates for that day, debates which we had initiated by reason of a motion this Party had put down complaining of the manner in which the claims of policyholders in the Equitable Insurance Company Limited had been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say at the beginning that, like the Minister for Finance in his personal capacity, I in my personal capacity have some connection with insurance but I got none of the information to which I am about to refer from those insurance contacts.  I got it because quite accidentally I happened to be concerned in another case on a later day on the court list and happened to hear some comments in relation to the administration of the Equitable Insurance Fund.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made it clear, when he was discussing this matter in the House on the 10th February, in the reference I have given, that he did not really know what delay was involved.  I want to suggest that there are only two possible explanations for that statement.  I do not believe for a minute that the Minister <Col N="1192" /> for Industry and Commerce made a statement like that knowing it to be a deliberate lie.  Either he had not read his brief or the brief was not properly submitted to him.  This money is asked for under section 4 of the Insurance Act, 1964 and is being made available by section 4 to the Fund for the purpose of making payments out of the Fund under the authority of section 3 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act is the section that authorises the payment of moneys where there is an insolvent insurer and where the liquidator makes the proper application to the courts in the liquidation matter.  &ldquo;Insurer&rdquo; is defined as meaning an insurance company or syndicate holding an insurance licence to carry on an insurance business. The plain fact of the matter is that the Act was badly drawn and that the legislation was muddled in its presentation to the House and that the delay has arisen because section 3 was so badly drawn that no payments could be made under it without the Minister having to resort to a subterfuge.</P>
    <P>An &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; is defined in the Act as being a person who has a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had terminated&mdash;and properly so&mdash;the licence of the Equitable Insurance Company Limited.  The effect of that termination meant that section 3 was entirely nugatory and that nothing could be done.  The court directed the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to that fact.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the Minister's reply in the Dáil on 10th February was to put the blame on the liquidators and the court.  In fact, there was nobody to blame for this delay but the Department of Industry and Commerce itself.  What had to be done in order to get over this botch made by Industry and Commerce?  When they came here to this House with this imperfect Bill, a new licence had to be given.  We are now in the extraordinary position that in order to pay claims under the Act, the Minister has had to grant a new licence to an insolvent company, the Equitable Insurance Company Limited.  He has had to <Col N="1193" /> grant a licence to carry on the business of an insolvent company, which is in the course of liquidation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to do that, to grant a licence to an insolvent company solely for the purpose of getting around bad drafting in an Act, is the wrong way to go about business.  It would have been much fairer, much more honest and much more reputable if the Government had come to the House and said: &ldquo;When we were drafting this Bill, we made a mistake. We did not intend to apply it.  It was only where a person had an existing licence that the fund could be used for payment in this way.  Accordingly we want to change it.&rdquo;  If they had, there would have been unanimity in the House in five minutes and there would not have been this Supplementary Estimate in order to hide that some of those licences had been given to an insolvent company to carry on insurance business, perhaps with the undertaking that though the licence is given, it will not be used.  I am quite certain it will not be used because the liquidator and the court will not allow it.  It seems to be a crazy way of doing business.</P>
    <P>It was because I had accidentally become aware of this that I suggested to the Minister for Finance that it is done in this way to avoid having to explain to the House that it was due to the vagaries of the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to this matter.  I may say when I heard that had been done and a licence had been granted to an insolvent company, I first refused to believe it.  I then made some further inquiries and I was assured that it was true.  I was told the reason why it was true.  It was that without the grant of a new licence to an insolvent company, no payment would be made to the policy holders. That was the cause of the delay.  It is not the fault of the liquidator in any way or the fault of the court but the fault of the Government and the Department concerned.</P>
    <P>It is only fair in relation to people who cannot defend themselves in this House to say that they have not asked me to say a word about it.  It is only to put matters right that this subterfuge has been adopted to get around <Col N="1194" /> the expressed though wrong statement in the legislation, that there will be no further delay, that people who are affected will be paid and that they will not have to wait until Tibb's eve.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged that when he said that not one single claim had been paid to anybody because of the insolvency of the Equitable Insurance Company.  Is that not an appalling state of affairs?  It is ten months after the company was put into liquidation.  It was in May that the order of the court was made, putting the company into liquidation. That is ten months and not one payment has been made.  It seems to me that this payment should be taken entirely out of the sphere of the Contingency Fund and should be made one for the Vote itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that in section 4 of the Act there is no time limit provided in relation to the making of the grant of £30,000.  It merely says the Minister will make it.  Therefore, he would only have put the money into the fund if he believed it was going to be paid out forthwith.  There was no immediate payment, as the Minister knows.  I am afraid the idea of dealing with it in that way was to avoid the Department of Industry and Commerce having to have the facts disclosed to this House as they would have been if it had been dealt with by a Supplementary Estimate for that Department.</P>

I am quite sure he is not afraid to come along and face the music about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £210,330 be granted to defray the charge which will come <Col N="1195" /> in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art) for certain Miscellaneous Educational and Cultural Services, and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The additional sums being provided in this Supplementary Estimate are required for the following purposes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A.1&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances : Provision is made in the Supplementary Estimate for payment of the general increases in salaries allowed with effect from 1st February, 1964, the ninth round, and also for certain status increases with effect from 1 January, 1964.  The increases result from agreed recommendations or awards under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for civil servants.</P>
    <P>A.2&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses: The excess in the subhead is occasioned by improvements allowed, subsequent to the preparation of the original estimate, in the terms of recoupment of travelling, subsistence and removal expenses.  These improvements were in accordance with agreed recommendations made by the General Council of the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  The relevant regulations were issued in June and July, 1964, and had retrospective effect to different dates, 1st April, 1962, 1st January, 1964, and 1st April, 1964.</P>
    <P>A.3&mdash;Post Office Services: These services are provided by the office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on a repayment basis.  The extra cost has been attributed by that office to the higher public postal charges in force since 1st June, 1964, and to certain other increased charges arising from pay increases to members of the staff.</P>
    <P>C.1&mdash;Purchase of Specimens: The increase of £5,600 in the Grant-in-Aid under this subhead to the National Museum arises from the purchase of a large silver two-handled porringertype bowl (Richard Smart, Cork, about 1675) which was among a collection of Irish silver auctioned at Messrs. Christies, London, in December last.  It <Col N="1196" /> is a very important early piece of Irish provincial work and bidding for it was extremely keen.  It was necessary to bid up to £5,600 to secure it for the Museum.  In this connection I may say that prices for all works of art have been increasing steadily over the past few years and the price of this important and early piece of silver was merely in consonance with current market values.</P>
    <P>F.3&mdash;Grants to Colleges providing Courses in Irish : The extra sum required reflects the continuing increase in the number of students attending courses in the colleges in recent years. The extent of the increase has been such as to cause an excess in the original estimate for the subhead in each of the last three financial years. In 1961/2 expenditure was over £29,000 as compared with the estimate of £25,000, and in 1962/3 the expenditure was £36,600 approximately, when the estimate was £35,500.  The estimate for 1963/4 at £39,000 was exceeded by over £2,300.  The original estimate for 1964/5 was put at £44,000 but expenditure is now expected to reach £47,000.  This upsurge in the numbers attending the courses is very gratifying and I feel confident that it will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The number of students in respect of whom grants were paid increased from 8,726 in the financial year 1961/2 to 10,700 in 1963/4, while the number of colleges providing courses in Irish increased from 20 in 1959 to 35 in 1964.</P>
    <P>F.4&mdash;Grants to Periodicals published in Irish and Newspapers publishing current news in Irish: The additional provision under this subhead is required to enable a payment to be made to the Irish weekly <i>Inniu</i> to meet certain debts due to increased costs because of increases in salaries consequent on the 9th round and certain other increases in charges such as for postage and telephones.  <i>Inniu</i> employs a relatively large professional and editorial staff and I am satisfied that this extra assistance being allowed is fully justified.</P>
    <P>F.5&mdash;Irish Folklore Commission: The additional provision is required to <Col N="1197" /> meet the increased cost of salaries and wages consequent on the ninth round increases.</P>
    <P>F.7 &mdash; Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge : The extra money being provided in the supplementary estimate is intended to meet increased charges for salary and office expenses, including salary increases due to the ninth round, as well as certain other increased costs arising for An Chomhdháil from its various activities.  I am satisfied that this extra sum is required to enable it adequately to discharge its functions in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>G.1&mdash;Royal Irish Academy : In this case also the increased provision is required to meet ninth round salary and wage increases.</P>
    <P>G.4&mdash;Adult Education Courses: The additional sum of £800 is required for the purpose of a grant to the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology towards meeting a deficit in the Institute's running expenses in the year 1963/4.  The Institute has for ten years been supplying adult education to an ever increasing number of students through courses ranging from Industrial Relations, Trade Unionism, Economics, Public Speaking to Social Science.  In particular, it conducts two Diploma Courses: (a) A Diploma in Social Science&mdash;a three year course, and (b) A Diploma in Industrial Relations&mdash;a two year course.</P>
    <P>In 1963/4 it had 1,181 students on its rolls and a weekly class attendance of 1,300.</P>
    <P>The Institute explained, in connection with its application for aid from the Department of Education, that it had exhausted all possible sources of obtaining the revenue it needed to continue its work, that it had been operating on an overdraft for a long time and that the students' fees could not be further increased.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Institute is doing very useful work in the field of adult education and I consider that it should be supported in its efforts by the making of this financial grant to it.</P>
    <P>G.8&mdash;Scientific Research Grants to Students: These grants are awarded on the recommendation of an advisory committee on which are representatives <Col N="1198" /> of the Department of Education and the Universities.  A meeting of the committee is held each year in October or November to consider the applications received and to make recommendations in relation to the making of the awards and the operation of the scheme.  Having regard to the fact of a significant increase in the number of highly qualified applicants in 1964 and to the recommendations of the advisory committee, I considered it was necessary to increase the original provision for these grants made in the Estimate for 1964/5.  The extra provision allows for the making of a greater number of awards and for an increase in the value of some of the individual awards.</P>
    <P>G.11&mdash;Expenses in connection with organised Educational Tours etc.: Educational courses and seminars, to which I attach considerable importance, have been organised in recent years for Irish teachers in the United States of America.  The Department of Education made a grant of £1,500 towards the cost of the project for the first time in the financial year 1963/4 and a similar provision was made in the Estimate for 1964/5.  Representations were subsequently made to me, however, that, because of certain organisational arrangements, the cost of the course to the Irish participants would be greater in 1964 than in 1963.  On consideration of these representations I was satisfied that a grant of £3,000 was in all the circumstances called for.  A supplementary provision of £1,500 under this subhead is, therefore, necessary.</P>
    <P>G.13&mdash;Muintir na Tíre (Grant-in-Aid): Following publication by Muintir na Tíre of the document &ldquo;A Plan for Community Development in Ireland,&rdquo; the organisation sought a Government grant to enable it to undertake the work envisaged in that plan.  After full consideration of the matter it was decided to give for organisational purposes a subvention of about £5,000 for a few years, during which the organisation could strengthen itself and improve its membership and its finances, so that it could carry on without a grant thereafter.</P>
    <P>H.&mdash;Deficiency in Appropriations in Aid: It had been anticipated that the final agreed instalment of £2,700 from <Col N="1199" /> OECD in respect of its share of the cost of the survey in relation to investment in education in this country might possibly have been received before 31st March, 1965.  As, however, the survey has not yet been completed, payment of the final instalment will not have been received in the present financial year and this amount has now been credited instead to the estimate for 1965/6.</P>
    <P>With regard to the following Supplementary Estimate for Secondary Education, the sum of £80,000 is the additional amount required in the current financial year to defray the cost of increased scales of incremental salary which are being introduced for secondary teachers with effect as from 1st November, 1964.  The increased scales arise from an agreed recommendation of the Conciliation Council for these teachers.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of the new scales, the &ldquo;standard salary&rdquo; of a secondary teacher, that is, the incremental salary paid by the Department, plus the minimum of £200 per annum, called the &ldquo;basic salary&rdquo;, paid by the school&mdash;ranges from £840 to £1,600 in the case of a married man and from £670 to £1,270 in the case of a woman or a single man.  The special increment which is payable in addition to standard salary in the case of a teacher holding an honours degree or equivalent has been increased from £65 to £110 per annum.</P>
    <P>This increased level of remuneration for secondary teachers has been authorised pursuant to the policy which was stated towards the end of 1963 and which indicated the Government's willingness to consider further status improvements for teachers to be achieved over a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>On Vote 32, Vocational Education, the additional Estimate of £129,000 is, as Deputies will observe, divided over three subheads.  The greatest amount is in respect of an increase in the annual grants to vocational education committees.  The provision here arises from ninth round salary increases granted to teachers and other officers of vocational education committees. Committees' estimate of financial requirements for a particular <Col N="1200" /> financial year must be completed before 1st December of preceding year, and State grants to the committees are decided in relation to those estimates. The ninth round of salary increases, however, was sanctioned on 1st April, 1964, with effect from 1st February, 1964, and so it is now necessary to make payments to committees in excess of what was provided for in the original estimates.  The State grant in this instance represents one-third of the additional cost falling on the vocational education committee as a result of this particular award.</P>
    <P>The House is being asked, also, to agree to an increase of £300 in the grant-in-aid to Macra na Tuaithe, for which an amount of £4,000 was included in the original estimate for the current year.  The grant is to assist Macra na Tuaithe in their educational work among the young people of the countryside, and the increase of £300 now sought arises from the additional costs in salary and administration attributable to the ninth round of salary increases.</P>
    <P>The final item of £3,000 is on the subhead for examinations.  The number of candidates at the various examinations held under the Technical Instruction Branch of my Department was rather substantially higher than had been expected when the original estimate was prepared, with a corresponding increase in the examiners' fees and in the cost of travelling and subsistence for those examiners who conduct oral and practical tests.</P>
    <P>Vote 34, Universities and Colleges and Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, is required:</P>
    <P>(a)  to make provision for increases in salaries in accordance with the provisions of the ninth round for the staffs of the National University, and its Constituent Colleges, Dublin, Cork and Galway and for the staffs of Trinity College and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  to enable an increase to be made in the grant originally provided for the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>
    <P>The amount of the ninth round increase <Col N="1201" /> is that shown in the relevant subhead of the Supplementary Estimate except in the case of UCD and UCC.  The actual cost of this increase in the case of UCD is £85,000 but this amount is offset to the extent of £60,000 saving in part (4) of the subhead due to the fact that because of the strike in the building trade last autumn progress in building operations at Belfield was not as great as anticipated. The estimated cost of the ninth round increase for the staff of UCC is £32,500.  A saving of £9,000 on the estimated cost of the site works for the new science building reduces the over-all charge to the subhead to £23,500.</P>
    <P>The additional amount for the Dublin Dental Hospital is mainly required for equipment and structural building alterations work, the cost of which could not be accurately estimated at the time of the preparation of the original estimate.</P>

      <P>We will get that i nGaeilge from the Laboratory at Gormanston, later on.  This Supplementary Estimate amounts to £464,400 and having heard the Minister's statement, we find that the great bulk of this money is required for additional salaries in connection with the ninth round.  It is exactly two years ago since the Taoiseach in this House informed us that there must be a standstill on wages.  Within two months, the Minister for Finance came into this House and, in a very quiet tone, informed us that there would be a 2½ per cent turnover tax which would not affect the cost of living.  Then he found that the cost of living had risen so steeply that it was necessary to give this ninth round 12 per cent increase in salaries. Even then, the Minister did not see what it would cost the country and hence we have this Supplementary Estimate for almost half a million pounds. I take no exception to it whatsoever in so far as it is necessary for the increase in salaries to bring them in line with the ninth round but there are a <Col N="1202" /> few matters to which I should like to refer.</P>
      <P>I am very glad indeed to see that additional grants are being made available to colleges for providing courses in Irish.  I wonder what types of courses in Irish are envisaged for these students attending colleges or what Irish they will be taught.  Is it the Irish of Ulster, the Irish of Padraic Ó Conaire in the west or the Irish of the late Seabhach in Kerry, or is it this Irish invented by the civil servants? I saw the Minister recently on television and first I must compliment him on his appearance and on the manner in which he put across what he had to say but I heard him say that the cradle of Irish will no longer be the Gaeltacht but will be a laboratory in Gormanston College down in County Meath.</P>

      <P>I was listening to the Minister and watching him carefully. Mind you, he had difficulty in getting his say in there because Deputy Faulkner certainly did not like it. Deputy Faulkner knows where the cradle of Irish lies.  It lies in Gweedore, Rannafast and other parts of Donegal, in Connemara in the west and down in Kerry.</P>

      <P>The Minister is the last for whom I should like to create trouble&mdash;and that goes for himself and a good many of his Departmental staff.  However, I was amused to hear on television that when this laboratory is in full swing, the Irish language will be on the move again. That is one of the matters to which I take exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second is this.  We are all complaining about the lack of money for <Col N="1203" /> scholarships.  Actually, the Six-County Government provide five times as many scholarships in the Six Counties as we do in the Twenty-six.  A scholarship per year does not cost a lot&mdash; about £300 or £400.  But when I see the Minister bring in a Supplementary Estimate here asking this House to provide £5,600 for the purchase of a large silver two-handled porringertype bowl&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is one of the items we are being asked to subscribe to, not in the annual Budget or Estimate, but in a Supplementary Estimate. We are told there was great difficulty in procuring this valuable&mdash; I do not know whether to call it &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; or &ldquo;container&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That would be the proper word.  We are told we had to bid up to £5,600.  I wonder who was bidding against us?  I am sure it was not any of the smaller nations or countries but some millionaires trying to procure it for their sideboards&mdash;if it is something someone does place on a sideboard or underneath it&mdash;but, certainly, I think we are going from the sublime to the ridiculous, in these days <Col N="1204" /> when we are all asked to tighten our belts, when we go to this trouble to secure such an item.  It is an Irish provincial work but it does not say by whom&mdash;yes, a Corkman, Mr. Richard Smart.</P>

That is the only criticism I have to make on the Supplementary Estimate.  As far as the ninth round is concerned, the Minister has no option but to pay.</P>
      <P>I did not hear a great deal of detail regarding the subhead in respect of the universities.  I see on page 2 of the Estimate, as furnished to us, a grant for general purposes to the National University of £3,500.  I do not think that any great detail was given in regard to that.  I may be wrong in saying that but if the Minister could refer me to the particular page in which details are given of that item, I should be very glad.  It says there is £3,500 for the National University; UCD, £25,000; UCC, £23,000; UCG, £24,000; Trinity, £78,000 and the Dental Hospital £100,000.  I think we have no details of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that. I am wondering what the £25,000 for UCD is and under subhead F we find under a Trinity College grant towards secular education, the additional sum required is £78,000.  I do not understand what that is for.  If it is the ninth round it seems very large in comparison with what is allocated to the other university colleges.  I refer to the Estimate as circulated under the heading &ldquo;Universities and Colleges and Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.&rdquo;  These global figures are given but there is no breakdown.</P>

      <P>There was a saving on account of the building strike.  That is quite in order but it does seem a considerable sum of money to pay towards the employees, academic or otherwise, of Trinity, this £78,000, as the ninth round.  And that deals only with secular education. I understand there is a Divinity Faculty in Trinity but, evidently, we do not contribute towards that.  It does seem a very high figure but if the Minister tells us that is the figure, we have no option but to accept it.  We have nothing further to say on the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>With how much more enthusiasm we in the Labour Party could support this Supplementary Estimate if it provided for more things than mere salary increases arising out of the ninth round.  It is truly lamentable that the Minister did not avail of this occasion to include provision for bringing about some of the radical changes required in our educational system.  I know the main Estimate will be coming up in due course but still the defects of the system are so blatant and the urgency of reform so evident that we expect the Minister to avail of every opportunity to provide essential moneys to bring about the changes we so much desire in order to ensure that every child will be afforded an opportunity of going on to post-primary education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are features of these Estimates which we support enthusiastically, such as the amount of money provided for <Col N="1207" /> the extension of adult education courses.  Those who availed of these courses have nothing but the highest praise for the university authorities and the vocational committees who facilitated these extra-mural courses attached to the various universities.  It was Dr. &mdash;now, I think, Monsignor&mdash; O'Rahilly who was primarily responsible for initiating these adult education courses.  They have been widely availed of by trade unionists, by young farmers and by many other categories of our people.  Many of us owe the degree of education we possess today to the facilities provided in these courses for the learning of such important subjects as sociology, economics, accountancy, public speaking, chairmanship and all these important subjects.  So that the provision of money for these courses is something we support enthusiastically, especially for the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister's main Estimate will be coming to the House in due course, that the scope of the debate on that occasion will be wider and that we will have an opportunity of putting forth Labour's policy on education.  Suffice to say that we support the Supplementary Estimate in its present form and express the hope that when the main Estimate is being introduced the Minister will ensure that the schools of technology, the break-through in our university system, the extension of the scholarship system, the erection of schools of technology and all the things to which we aspire will be brought at least a step forward.</P>
    <P>I opened my remarks in Gaelic, expressing my surprise that the Minister for Education did not see fit to speak in Irish on the occasion of the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>By and large, we support the Supplementary Estimate and all that it contains and look forward to the introduction of the main Estimate in due course which we hope will contain most of the features of Labour's policy on education.</P>

      <P>Ní dúirt an tAire nuair bhí sé ag labhairt ar an dtelefís go raibh sé de chuspóir aige féin ná ag an Roinn Oideachais deireadh a chur le Gaeilge na Gaeltachta, mar dúirt an Teachta O'Donnell.  Ní chreidfeadh duine ar bith go ndéarfadh an tAire a leithéid.

      <P>Dúirt an tAire gur caitheadh breis airgid le ceithre nó cúig bliana anuas ar na cúrsaí Gaeilge a bhíonn ar siúl gach Samhradh sna Coláistí Gaeilge.

Ní Gaeilge Rinn Mhic Ghormáin a mhúintear ins na Coláistí céanna ach Gaeilge na Gaelteachta.  Is aoibhinn liom a rá go dtéann micléinn go dtí na Coláistí sa Ghaeltacht, agus ón bhaint a bhíonn agam leo, is féidir liom a rá go mbeireann na daoine óga roinnt mhaith Ghaeilge abhaile leo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House very long but there are one or two headings in this Supplementary Estimate on which I should like to comment.</P>
      <P>First, subhead G. 13 on page 8 of the Minister's speech refers to a subvention of £5,000 to Muintir na Tíre in relation to plans for community development. I welcome this subvention which is to enable Muintir na Tire to reorganise itself.  I had seven or eight years' close contact with Muintir na Tíre prior to my entry to this House and I am very well aware of the tremendous potential it has for promoting the economic and social well-being particularly of the people who live in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this plan for community development was submitted to the Taoiseach some months ago, I directed a question to him asking him to make a statement on the matter and I was rather surprised that the question was replied to by the Minister for Education because, of course, Muintir na Tíre is not purely an educational organisation: it deals with economic and social matters as well.  However, I am very glad that this subvention, which I hope is only an initial one, is being handled by the Department of Education because community development is new to this country in its terminology.  What is known to UNO, UNESCO and the various other international bodies as community development was preached 30 years ago by the late Canon Hayes. <Col N="1211" /> What Canon Hayes had in mind was to organise the local community and to channel its latent potential into projects for the economic, educational and social betterment of the rural community.</P>
    <P>I understand that Muintir na Tíre will be paying particular attention to leadership training and community education.  I have devoted a good deal of study to this question of community development and I believe the two basic prerequisities for successful community development are: (a) leadership training and (b) community education.  I have the greatest confidence that the Muintir na Tíre organisation will prove worthy of this subvention and I am quite sure it will be money well spent. It is a good thing that having this financial assistance, Muintir na Tíre will not be depending, as they have been for so long, on voluntary workers. I hold the view strongly that voluntary effort can be carried too far.  It is recognised by community development workers all over the world that you can go a certain distance through voluntary effort but that assistance from the State or local government is then necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to Subhead G. 4, the subvention to the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology towards meeting the deficit in the Institute's running expenses for the year 1963/64. I spoke on a previous Estimate on this question of adult education of which, like community development, I have had a great deal of personal experience. The House voted money to the Catholic Workers College on a previous occasion and, as far as I am aware, this is the first occasion on which the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology has received any subvention.</P>
    <P>The need for adult education is recognised all over the world.  In recent years we have come to recognise its importance in this country.  There are bodies such as the Catholic Workers College and the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology which, largely by voluntary effort, have been doing a tremendous job of work. There is also the question of the adult <Col N="1212" /> education courses at University College, Cork, to which Deputy Treacy also referred.  When Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly launched the adult education courses in UCC, a certain Government grant was given&mdash;I think it was £4,000&mdash;but when these courses proved themselves, this grant was reduced by half, which is something I could never understand.  I am speaking from memory but I think I am right in that.</P>
    <P>Now that a sum of £800 is being granted to the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology, I sincerely hope it is an indication of the growing awareness on the part of the Department of Education of the importance of adult education and I shall be looking forward to seeing in future Estimates increased recognition being given not merely to the Catholic Workers College and the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology but to University College, Cork, and the other voluntary bodies throughout the country that are doing so much to promote adult education. Adult education is of particular importance in this country by reason of the fact that until quite recently&mdash;in fact it still applies to a great extent&mdash;the vast majority of our children did not receive any formal education beyond the age of 14 and from this point of view opportunities should be provided for part-time study.</P>
    <P>A sum of £80,000 is provided for salary increases for secondary teachers. Might I express the hope that we shall never again have a repetition of what happened last summer regarding the dispute between the secondary teachers and the Department of Education and that the expedient which had to be resorted to at that time in the supervision of examinations and correction of papers will never be allowed to occur again.</P>

      <P>As regards the increase in salary to secondary teachers, as far as I can gather, the Secondary Teachers Association and certainly a <Col N="1213" /> section of the secondary teachers, particularly the younger teachers, are not satisfied with the increase which has been granted.  If we are to attract the right type of university graduate to secondary education, we shall have to give them not merely a maximum salary which will be comparable with what graduates get in other walks of life but also a satisfactory starting salary.</P>

      <P>Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall.  Ar an ábhar sin ba mhaith liom an méid seo a rá : tá a fhios agam go bhfuil Gaeilge ag an Aire.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé ar thaobh na h-athbheochana agus rudaí den tsaghas sin.  Ach ní leor sin; tá gá le níos mó ná sin.  Caithfidh an tAire ní h-amháin bheith ar thaobh na h-athbheochana ach caithfidh sé theaspáint go bhfuil sé ar thaobh na t-athbheochana, mar a dúirt an Teachta Treacy.</P>
      <P>They are the few words I wanted to say in the native tongue.  I say them stumblingly because I did not have an opportunity of acquiring the language at a very early age.  I congratulate Deputy Ó Ceallaigh from Clare on his splendid delivery.  I did not understand all he had to say but it was delightful to hear the language spoken so fluently and so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to discuss the question of the grant-in-aid to the National Museum.  I do not fall out with the purchase of a large silver two-handled porringer type bowl.  I assume it has some aesthetic quality, that it will bring enjoyment to those who contemplate it in the National Museum. I assume that portion of the moneys we are being asked to vote for it will come from what is known as the Shaw Bequest.  In that connection I should like to take this opportunity of mentioning in passing the fact that <Col N="1214" /> we are acting in no very creditable manner in so far as the memory of Shaw is concerned in hiding his statue in the National Gallery as if we were ashamed of it.</P>
    <P>This man, through his works, has endowed to the extent of nearly £500,000 in royalties some of our institutions.  It was suggested by me, and privately - expressed agreement came from members of the Government, that his statue should be displayed publicly in St. Stephen's Green or some such place where the citizens might be able to see it without having to go to the trouble of finding it in this backwater at the rere of Leinster House.  I would ask the Minister to try to give some attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>What we are doing at the moment is indulging in obscurantism which we should have long left behind us. Shaw was a Dublin man, a world figure, a giant in letters, a man of letters who, with Yeats and O'Casey, brought fame to this city.  His will has benefited this city to the extent I have mentioned.  Surely it is not too much to ask that instead of seeking to hide his likeness in the National Gallery we ought to display it publicly to show that we are proud of this man.</P>

Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúil dó nach raibh culú ar cheist na Gaeilge ar feadh na gcúig mblian atá imithe.  Tá taobh eile leis an gceist seo.  Bhí sé de nós ag gach Aire Oideachais a ghabh romham Meastacháin Fhorlíontacha na Roinne a thúirt isteach i mBéarla.  Ach nuair a bhí an gná-Mheastachán á thúirt isteach acu bhí sé de nós acu leagan Béarla a chur ar fáil do na Teachtaí.

    <P>Do thagair an Teachta O'Donnell do rud adúirt mé, dar leis, ar Thelefís Éireann.  Ní cuimhin liom anois cad dúirt mé ach tá a fhios agam ná dúirt mé an rud adeir an Teachta O'Donnell adúbhras faoin scéim chun daoine óga a chur chuig an Gaeltacht.  Tá a lán <Col N="1215" /> airgid dhá iarraidh agam chun páistí a chur chuig an Gaeltacht.  Tá scéimeanna eile im aigne agus scéimeanna ar siúl chun daoine a chur chuig an Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta O'Donnell ó Luimneach go raibh laghdú ar an deontas a bhí ag dul do Choláiste na hOllscoile, Corcaigh.  Níor déineadh aon laghdú.  Nuair a bhí Seán Ó Maoláin ina Aire Oideachais bhí £1,500 sa bhliain le fáil mar dheontas ag an gColaiste ar chúrsai áirithe gach bliain.  Bliain amháin, áfach, do thug an tAire míle púnt sa bhreis chun fiacha an Choláiste i leith na gcúrsaí a ghlanadh.  Ní raibh ceist ar bith an bhliain a bhí chugainn go mbeadh an míle púnt sin le n-íoc ath-uair, ach dúirt Uachtarán an Choláiste san am go raibh gearradh anuas ar an deontas. Creidim gur iarr an tAire ar an tUachtarán an ráiteas sin a tharraing siar agus ansin dúirt an tUachtarán nach raibh aon cheist faoi ghearradh anuas ar an deontas.</P>

Níl ceist ar bith ann gurbí an Gaeilge amháin atá dhá <Col N="1216" /> múineadh; tá an Béarla agus teangthacha eile dá múineadh ann freisin ach tá staidéar dhá dhéanamh acu ar an méid Gaeilge ba chóir a bheith ag páistí ag fágaint na scoile dhóibh ionas go mbeidh seans acu úsáid a bhaint aisti agus deis a bheith acu níos mó a bhailiú de réir a chéile agus iad ag fáil taithí.

Ach dealbh mór atá ann agus tá sé in áit phoiblí san Áiléar agus ní dóigh liom gur aon mhasladh é sin.  B'fhearr liom an dealbh a fheiscint ansin ná in aon áit eile mar is don Áiléar atá an t-airgead ag dul.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £675,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for <Col N="1218" /> payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The net amount of this Supplementary Estimate, together with the previous Supplementary Estimate, added to the original Estimate for 1964/65, brings the total net expenditure from the Vote for my Department to £30,999,700.</P>
    <P>As is customary in the case of Supplementary Estimates relating to a limited number of subheads, I shall confine my remarks to the items covered in the present Estimate.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first with Subhead K.11, the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, for which an additional provision of £200,000 is proposed.  This is, however, more than offset by the additional £260,000 expected in receipts under the Scheme and shown under Subhead P, Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The progress in the past few months has been greater than we had anticipated, even in November last when I asked for an additional sum of nearly £600,000.  When the Supplementary Estimate was then under discussion, we expected that the total number of reactors which would be sold to the Department within this financial year would be 31,000.  It now seems that, by the end of March, a total of 33,700 will have been taken up. This compares with a total of 115,000 reactors taken up in 1963/64.  In addition, the higher market prices for cattle have been reflected in the compensation that we are paying.  On the average, the compensation paid since 1st April last has been £68 for cows and £59 for other cattle.  The corresponding figures for the previous year were £58 for cows and £47 for other cattle.</P>
    <P>The momentum of the BTE Scheme is increasing steadily in the six southern counties according as we draw near our goal of total eradication. It will be recalled that at the beginning of 1964 my Department envisaged the attestation of the south in two stages.  It is now clear that, if the progress at present being achieved can be maintained, we can bring all these southern counties along together <Col N="1219" /> and have the whole country attested by the autumn.  The completion of the eradication scheme in just 11 years from its commencement in September, 1954, will be no small achievement.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead K.14 we are looking for an additional £200,000 for the Scheme of Grants for Calved Heifers. Added to the provisions already made for this purpose in the original Estimate and the previous Supplementary Estimate, this will bring the total provision in 1964/65 to £3,155,000.</P>
    <P>The response by herdowners to the Calved Heifer Subsidy Scheme has far exceeded expectations.  When the previous Supplementary Estimate for this scheme was taken last November, it was expected that there would be a considerable seasonal drop in the numbers of applications for grants during the winter months, but in fact the demand for grants has continued at a high level.  The total number of heifers on which the grant of £15 will be allowed up to 31st March, 1965, is now estimated at about 203,500 as compared with the estimate of 190,000 heifers last November.  The benefits of the scheme have been widely diffused throughout the country, including the western counties and the smaller holdings in particular have benefited.  The average individual grant works out at £37 representing over two animals per herdowner.</P>
    <P>The target for increased cattle production in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> would require an average annual increase in cow numbers of 75,000 up to 1968.  This figure has been exceeded in the past year.</P>
    <P>Next we come to Subhead K.19 which is the new subhead to provide for the temporary scheme of payments, announced in January last in respect of good quality fat bullock and heifer beef exported to the United Kingdom. Payment is at the rates currently payable in the United Kingdom under the British Fatstock Deficiency Payments Scheme.  Our new scheme was introduced in order to arrest the serious decline which was taking place in the trade of the meat export premises due to lack of supplies of finished cattle. <Col N="1220" /> Total slaughterings of fat cattle and cows at meat export premises declined from 403,700 in 1963 to 302,000 in 1964.  Exports of store cattle increased from 565,200 in 1963 to 637,000 in 1964.  A falling-off in the number of cows slaughtered, arising from a number of factors, led to a serious decline in the export of boneless beef to the United States.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that steps should be taken to increase the numbers of cattle fattened at home.  This would benefit both the feeders and the industry.  Its advantage to producers is that any farmer who is in a position to finish cattle, but who might ordinarily consider it more prudent to dispose of his cattle at the attractive store prices prevailing, can now hold on to the cattle in the knowledge of getting a satisfactory price for them when they come to be sold for beef.</P>
    <P>The scheme is not, of course, and should not be regarded as in any way directed against the store trade.  The export of store cattle to Britain is a traditional and very necessary part of our cattle economy and the link with the British Deficiency Payments Scheme is of very great importance to us.  However, this store cattle arrangement does militate against the finishing of cattle here and makes it difficult for the meat processing industry to get sufficient supplies of raw material.  As our total cattle production expands, however, there should be plenty of scope both for the store and the dead meat trade.</P>
    <P>We are hoping that the present scheme will arrest the decline in activity which took place in 1964, particularly in the latter half of that year, in our meat export industry.  This is one of our most important and efficient agricultural processing industries, giving considerable employment and contributing substantially to our export earnings; and it developed without State assistance.  In 1964 our exports of beef, mutton and lamb in carcase and processed forms and of offals and by-products earned this country about £23 million.  We estimate that this figure will have declined to about £21 million in 1964 in spite of higher prices in that year.  The industry <Col N="1221" /> enjoys farmer confidence and the survey team which examined its activities a couple of years back confirmed its efficiency.</P>
    <P>Payments under this scheme arise only when deficiency payments are made in Britain.  The British scheme provides for the breaking down of the guaranteed price there into a series of weekly standard prices, the weekly price being highest in the earlier months of the year when cattle are scarce and lowest during the late summer and autumn periods of heavy supplies. The subsidy rate payable is broadly the difference between the weekly market price and the weekly standard price.  Because of the strong market for beef last year and the consequently high market prices for cattle in Britain, no guaranteed payments were made there from June to the middle of January with the exception of small payments for one or two weeks in November.  Payments having now resumed seem likely to continue for the time being.  Because of the continuing relatively satisfactory prices for beef in Britain, it is not expected that these payments will be high.  We accordingly estimate that our commitment up to the end of March will be of the order of £50,000.  From April to June the estimated expenditure is £150,000.  What the situation in the trade will be by the end of June.  when this Scheme is due to end, I could not at present attempt to predict.  We can only judge the situation as we see it then and decide what measures, if any, are necessary for the continued well-being of our cattle and beef industries.</P>
    <P>A sum of £700,000 is included to meet the cost of the ninth-round wage increases and status claims in respect of the staff of my Department.  For convenience the total estimated cost, which covers several subheads of the Vote, is provided for under a single subhead (A).</P>
    <P>The favourable trend in prices being received for our butter on the export market has resulted in a smaller demand being made by Bord Bainne on the Exchequer than was estimated.  A saving of £215,000 on Subhead N is <Col N="1222" /> anticipated and this reduces the total net additional amount required to £675,000.  This is a matter for congratulation and I would like to commend Bord Bainne on their continuing endeavours to improve the position in regard to our exports of dairy produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this Supplementary Estimate was circulated only this morning means that the House had not a full opportunity of examining in detail all the items included in it.  I suppose, since Government business did not seem to be coming forward, this had to be so. However, it is not a very difficult Estimate to discuss and I am sure we can discuss it without leaving out any point that should be made.</P>
      <P>The net amount of the Estimate is £675,000, and Subhead A7&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;accounts for £700,000.  What we have before us, therefore, is not a large increase in expenditure.  In fact, it reflects a net decrease.  Two items must be taken into account in regard to the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme&mdash; Subhead K11, the cost of the scheme, and P.&mdash;Appropriations in Aid, which gives the value of the reactors sold. Here there is reflected an increased turnover&mdash;if one can use that expression in respect of the scheme&mdash;rather than an increased loss.  The Minister referred to the fact that cattle prices were higher.  If that is true, the price got for the animal when the Department sold it was higher, so that the appropriations-in-aid increased proportionately. It is a matter for rejoicing that it now appears as if the eradication scheme will be finished more quickly than had been at first anticipated, and in one step where two had been envisaged.  We welcome that because we feel it will bring great benefit to the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Scheme of Grants for Calved Heifers shows a small increase.  During the previous discussion here, it was pointed out that the original Estimate was very far wrong.  It was found that the original sum of £450,000 had increased to £2,950,000. Now there is a further £200,000. There is a certain anxiety which the <Col N="1223" /> Minister always seeks to dissipate by indicating that the size of the claim here is small.  Nevertheless, there is an anxiety in the country that a large number of farmers are keeping heifers but, when they calve on one occasion, when the herd number has increased, they intend to discontinue the keeping of cows or heifers and return to their previous method of keeping dry stock only.</P>
    <P>From the statistics that can be produced, it is difficult to know whether or not that anxiety is justified.  However, we shall know in the succeeding years whether or not, along with new people coming along to increase their herds, we will have a decrease in the number of calves because of people who, having got the £15 and having increased their basic herd numbers, are getting out of the scheme.  We can only hope that this will not be so and look forward to a continued increase in the number of heifers being mated.</P>
    <P>The temporary beef export payment scheme, subhead K. 19, is something we welcome.  The Minister is right when he says payments will not be large, that it is necessary in these operations to produce a flow of price. It is true some of our meat processing factories were finding it difficult to carry on with the rather minimal sum indicated by the Minister, together with his prognostication of what the losses will be up to June.  We have succeeded in keeping these factories in operation.  That is good and we welcome it.  The payments are small in such a large industry and a good export is something which is pleasant to consider.</P>
    <P>The question of butter and the extra price being received for it is something that should properly be considered here also.  It is now two years since Fine Gael indicated that, because of the increased prices now available on the British market for butter, the saving to the Exchequer could be expected to be something in the order of 1d.  and this should be given to the farmers.  The Government afterwards followed our line and gave it to the farmers.  It is true the <Col N="1224" /> saving of up to £215,000, arises out of higher prices for butter at a time when we are paying an exceptionally low price for milk.  We hope the Minister will attend to the quality milk, as he has done in the past week or so.  That is something that was suggested from these benches some two or three years ago.  At that time I remember it was a source of merriment to the Fianna Fáil backbenchers, notably Deputy Corry, but I am glad the Minister has now fallen in with our line on this matter and says he is to pay a premium for best quality milk.</P>
    <P>If as a result of the GATT agreement, whereby Britain has been limiting imports of butter by quota, we are to get a better price for butter, even though some is affected by temporary increases in quota, we feel this should be passed on to the farmer.  He is hardly getting an economic price for his milk.  If there is an increase in prices and it is reflected in savings, these should be handed out to the farmer by way of increased price for milk.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I wish to say on this Supplementary Estimate except to repeat that the Minister has been extremely fortunate in the turn of the terms of trade.  Butter has helped him.  The fact that the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme went on well is parallel with the fact that there were considerably higher prices for the slaughter of animals.  The ledger in this case seems to have balanced in the Minister's favour.  The total gravamen of this Supplementary Estimate is that there was a reduction of £25,000 if one removes the ninth round of wage increases which is properly paid to officers of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement about the speedup in the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.  I hope, like other Deputies, the momentum will continue so that there will be no delay in bringing it to an end.  A Supplementary Estimate is not a proper Estimate on which to indulge in wide discussion, even though the matters on which I should like to speak are contained in <Col N="1225" /> this Estimate.  Therefore, I propose to be brief.</P>
      <P>In connection with the Calved Heifer Subsidy Scheme, I note the Minister has suggested that the benefits of this scheme have been widely diffused throughout the country, and particularly in the western counties and the smaller holdings.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on that in his reply.  If we follow up the Minister's remark that &ldquo;the average individual grant works out at £37, representing over two animals per herdowner&rdquo;, that average was worked out I gather from figures taken all over the country in respect of the biggest herdowner down to the smallest.  On that basis, I should like the Minister, seeing he has been able to get figures on the lines given here, to give a breakdown to the House on the average given to farmers with a valuation under £20.  Then we would see where the real benefits are and who is really benefiting by this particular scheme.</P>
      <P>I maintain, and I shall repeat it again and again, that the small farmer, particularly the small western farmer, is not benefiting to the extent the Minister is seeking to suggest.  I am open to contradiction by the Minister, provided he gives statistical proof to back up what he has said here.  How can you compare a herdowner with a valuation of £15 on a small holding with a man of £300 valuation, and the number of cattle both have, and work an average of £37 as representing two animals per herdowner.  I think the Minister is not being fair to his Department in giving a figure like that unless he is prepared to segregate the payments according to the valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I should like to mention is the Minister's reference to the State subsidy or aid now being given to the dead meat trade, the factories in operation here.  Let me say the Labour Party are very anxious to see this particular line of agricultural processing developed to the maximum. I note the Minister has taken the opportunity of stressing that this industry has developed without State assistance.  I do not know what he <Col N="1226" /> wants to convey to the general public by that.  The fact is he is coming in here looking for State assistance for the particular industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant they got no Foras Tionscal grants or anything like that up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are getting them now.  I do not think there is any point in the Minister's stressing &ldquo;without State assistance&rdquo; if at this stage they need it.  The point is they are highly desirable industries.  There are areas in the country where these industries should be established and the Government should have taken cognisance of the necessity and established these processing industries in the particular areas which are suitable and where the employment content is available.  I can think of nothing better as an industry for a county such as Roscommon than a dead meat trade.  The county is noted throughout the length and breadth of Ireland for its cattle production.  If there were to be a dead meat trade, which is highly desirable, I believe that county is the place in which to establish a processing factory for that industry.</P>
      <P>The Government are not too late yet.  I believe this trade will expand and I think it highly desirable that the maximum expansion should take place.  After all, we have the situation that at this stage nobody wants to harm the store cattle trade.  At the present time it seems to be our main lifeline with Britain but, as far as employment content is concerned, it is not the best lifeline.  It is not the best production line from the land, particularly for the smaller farmer.  It may be said that it is a traditional part of our economy, as the Minister has said. Everything that is traditional is not necessarily the wisest type of line to pursue for the future.  The Government have had traditional views over the past 40 years on certain matters and they were not long changing them when the time came to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The store cattle trade, to my mind, is not the best line for the small farmer in any part of the country.  The Minister should take every possible <Col N="1227" /> step that is open to him without damaging the economy to wean the small farmer away from this least productive line of agriculture.  I see a small farmer at a fair in Roscommon, or in any part of the west, selling two or three beasts which are bought for the midlands for direct shipment to Britain without any employment being given in the country, barring the farmer looking at the cattle in the field, and I find that that farmer has two or three sons who must go over to England with the cattle and the sons work in British processing factories on the very cattle the father sold at the fair.  We know that the by-products of cattle are far in excess of the meat value so that the employment given in processing the by-products in the cattle industry is of the utmost importance and whatever processing has to be done should be done here.</P>
    <P>The Minister should realise that the people in the dead meat industry do not give a damn about the economy but are engaged in it for the profits they are making.  The Minister has a primary duty to see that the maximum development takes places in this industry, even if it means much greater State intervention.  When I say State intervention, I mean that the State should have a certain amount of control which it could exercise over the industry.  I did not think this Government should have any qualms now as far as the public are concerned about pursuing a more socialistic line in this regard.  The Government have taken over control of the outlet for our cattle; the shipping lines are now in the hands of the State.  I am glad that has been done.  It is only a step from that to see that, if necessary, in regard to the outlet, some of those people who have had it very good for years without doing any great work should realise that the State can also intervene on behalf of the producer.  We have the State intervening on behalf of the producer in the beet industry and there is no outcry.  The farmer is protected and the consumer is protected and we have first-class markets obtained by the people employed by this State company.  As far as the dead meat trade is concerned, the Minister <Col N="1228" /> should take the necessary steps to set up a meat marketing board.</P>
    <P>I know that there are people who will say that this is a question of the State intervening for the sake of intervention, for some particular philosophy. As far as agriculture is concerned, it has been left, willy-nilly, on the basis that there has been no proper planning for its development on intelligent lines and on such lines that the farmer may have confidence that when he produces he will have a market for his goods. We talk at present about the availability of the British market and that there is a first-class market there for our cattle, but the fact is that no Government and no political Party can take credit for the demand in England for our cattle, or our lamb or anything else.  The British housewife has been the deciding factor and it is her demands that are being met.  Perhaps a certain amount of skill was involved in negotiating with the responsible people in Britain but the fact remains that the demand is there and it is up to us to meet it in the best possible way so that the best price is given to our producers and at the same time the maximum amount of employment given at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set up his pilot schemes in the west and is to examine what can be done to improve conditions for people on small holdings.  He has visited the west recently and, being the intelligent man he is, he will realise that the small holdings in the areas he visited will not give a living to a farmer and his family if they persist in having as the main source of their income the production of store cattle.  It should be said, and repeated again and again, that there is no future for them in that, and let tradition be damned.  They only produce the store cattle for finishing off in the midlands and they have been at the beck and call of the jobbers and buyers from Kildare and Meath and elsewhere, tipping their hats to the so-called gentlemen at fairs as if the small farmer of the west had to thank these people for taking the cattle off their hands.</P>
    <P>I often thought it was a disgraceful performance to see, outside some <Col N="1229" /> country hotel.  this line-up of small farmers waiting for the gentlemen jobbers until they were ready to pay for the cattle they had bought that day.  I am convinced that the small farmer had the impression that they would never have sold their cattle except that Mr. X had appeared at the fair.  And you could see Mr. X with a big sombrero and with a big cigar about nine inches long and all the farmers are expected to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not talking about a cigarette holder.  I am talking about what I have seen.  When I spoke about this matter to these farmers and said that they should be more independent, I found I was treading on dangerous ground and I know that possibly I am all the time, as far as the political end is concerned.  However, it has to be said.  The younger farmers have not the outlook that many of the older men have with regard to the sale of their cattle.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to change his views, as expressed in this document, about the small farmer.  He seems to suggest in it that this heifer subsidy scheme is of particular benefit to the smaller farmer and to the farmers in the pilot areas which he has visited.  If he does, then he is contradicting himself on the issue as to why this type of industry on the land is the most important and should be the No. 1, as far as the small farmer is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not deal in any detail with the butter problem but I will say this.  I do not know what the Minister's mind is so far as the milk prices are concerned. If he is going to be fair again to the small producers, he should tackle this problem of milk prices on the basis of a higher price for a limited amount of milk so that the small farmer, at any rate, will get the top price for good milk up to a certain volume or for a certain production end of it.  After that, I would consider it not unreasonable that a second price <Col N="1230" /> be fixed for milk over and above that figure.  I do not know what the Minister's views on this are.  I know it has been put to him before but I believe this is the proper way to face this problem.  I should like to hear his views on this as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  I just want to say, first of all, that I agree with what Deputy McQuillan has said in regard to the small farmer who is dependent on store cattle, whether he is near Dublin or in any other part of the country.  If he is living on a small holding of land, he is not living as a man should.  While the present Minister for Agriculture is a highly intelligent man, a man with many resources of intellectual ability, I want to say this is one of the national problems we have to face.  The problem of the uneconomic small farmer with a small holding of land is a national problem. The man who has all his eggs in one basket and who is depending on store cattle will not make a living.  He can make a living only if he has a big holding of land.  When a man has a large holding of land, it does not always pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Dublin small farmers are greatly dependent on market gardening, the production of milk or other subsidiary products.  The standard of living of the small farmer in the country is, on the whole, very low.  That happens where they are completely dependent on store cattle.  We have often spoken here of establishing pilot schemes and co-operative movements. That is something worth following up because the co-operative movement will have to come in order to uplift the standard of living of the small farmers. In my young days, the woman of the house kept the home going with eggs, butter and pigs, along with the farmer doing everything he could to have all the tillage possible on his land.  If he had stock, it was fed with the produce of the farm.  That economy kept generations of Irish people alive in small farms throughout the country. They were completely self-supporting. That trend has gone.  I remember in many parts of the country everybody <Col N="1231" /> produced pigs.  There was plenty of fodder there.  There was plenty of butter and the people were self-supporting. They were fairly good tillage farmers. They tried to produce everything possible.</P>
    <P>That trend seems to have gone.  I admit the population has gone down in rural Ireland.  It has gone down, not alone in rural Ireland, but in rural parts of other countries as well.  The trend of moving to the cities and towns is prevalent, not alone in this country, but in other countries throughout the world.  I have often thought deeply about this matter.  I see sometimes farmers who cannot afford machinery. They have not enough work for machines.</P>

      <P>I will just finish with it on this point.  The problem of the small farmer is a big problem.  I am sure the Minister will try to take up this idea of co-operative farming.  I am not going to get into it now because I will possibly have an opportunity at a later date.  I welcome this Supplementary Estimate for £675,000. It shows the Government are solvent and that the country is in good hands.</P>
      <P>I see the net expenditure from the Vote for the Department of Agriculture is £30,999,700.  This is a very fine Estimate.  It shows the policy of our Party is to put all the money the State can afford into agriculture to try to help those people in every way we can.  That has been our policy since we started and I am delighted to see that that policy has been continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> With regard to the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, I want to congratulate the Minister and his predecessor on the progress made.  I notice that by the end of March a total of 33,700 reactors will have been taken up.  This compares with the total of 115,000 reactors taken up in 1963/64.  I notice the compensation paid since 1st April last has been £68 for cows and £59 for other cattle.  The corresponding figures for the previous year were £58 for cows and £47 for other cattle.  We all welcome these figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan spoke on the calved heifer scheme.  It must be seen that we have succeeded beyond our expectations in this matter as a Government and as a Party because we have paid out the total provision in 1964/ 65 of £3,155,000.  This shows, no matter how pessimistic one is, that we have many more cattle in the country. If this goes ahead according to the present expectations of the Minister for Agriculture, by 1968 the figures will have gone up 65 per cent.  That is a wonderful target to look forward to.  The only thing which would destroy that would be a change of Government, but please God, the people of Ireland will have sense enough to realise that will not happen until such time as we have tried to put our farmers in a happy position economically and otherwise.  I notice that the figure in respect of export of dead meat is almost £23 million.  This is an innovation that has started over a short period of years.  That is a very good position for the nation.  On the other hand, the store cattle trade has increased this year because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister said that exports of store cattle increased from 565,200 in 1963 to 637,000 in 1964.  He said that a falling off in the number of cows slaughtered, arising from a number of factors, led to a serious decline in the export of boneless beef to the United States.  There is no doubt as Deputy McQuillan said, that our dead meat trade will be a great asset to the nation if we can develop it.  On the other hand, over the <Col N="1233" /> years, we have been delighted to have our traditional store trade.  So far as we can, we must try to increase our store trade and our dead meat trade, and that is what the Department of Agriculture and the Minister have set out to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister is doing a very good job.  I do not wish to delay the House by going into more detail.  This is a very encouraging document and it is encouraging to see that the nation can afford to do things we have all dreamed of, in an effort to improve our agricultural economy, and to improve the lot of our farmers generally.  In that way we will be improving the nation as a whole, because agriculture is one of our great assets, and it helps us with our adverse trade balance.  Everyone is concerned about agriculture, from the young man in the streets of Dublin to the young man standing at the corner in Castlebar. We all depend on our export market, and it is wonderful to see that our cattle exports are going strong.</P>
      <P>I am very proud to be a member of the Party who are so generous to the farmers.  Any money the Government have they get from the taxpayers, and that money is being ploughed back for the benefit of the nation, and for the benefit of posterity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing the Supplementary Estimate, which because of its nature limits the scope of our discussions to the subheads for which it makes provision, did not think it necessary to refer to subhead A, which I think is most remarkable.  The Estimate for Salaries, Wages and Allowances, as revised by the First Supplementary Estimate for this Department, is £815,000.  The Minister now tells us he requires an additional £700,000 for that subhead.  I should have thought a proposal to double the estimate which his predecessor was responsible for introducing in the House at the beginning of the financial year would call for some words of explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the truth is that in common with most other branches of the Civil Service, we are now realising the full impact of the inflationary <Col N="1234" /> spiral in which the Government are involved.  Though we appropriate very large additional sums for the remuneration of the Civil Service, the net result is that the Civil Service are no better off than they were before we got involved in the tornado of inflation which is at present blowing.  We cannot relate the individual remuneration of each civil servant here, but when we recall that the cost of living has gone up by 30 per cent in the past seven years, and when we recall that the old age pension of 37/6 today buys what 28/- would have bought seven years ago, I hazard a guess that the increased remuneration of the Civil Service today in fact confers upon them not much greater purchasing power than they had seven years ago. In this subhead there must be a very substantial addition to the total personnel of the Department.  It cannot all be increased remuneration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a remarkable achievement to have doubled the remuneration of the staff of the Department of Agriculture in 12 months.  I think this is an event over which the Minister cannot with propriety pass, when seeking close upon £1 million to finance it, without offering some more detailed explanation to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the honour of being Minister for Agriculture in this country for two successive periods.  In those days we took a particular pride in the Department in knowing our job.  We liked to have our Estimates correspond accurately to what the event would demand.  I like to look back on the fact that that aspiration was usually realised.  What are we to say of a scheme introduced here by the Minister for Agriculture under Subhead K.14&mdash;Scheme of Grants for Calved Heifers&mdash;when we see that estimated expenditure for 12 months was £405,000, and actual expenditure for 12 months was £3,500,000?  Someone has fallen down on the job.  Either the Minister who formulated the scheme had not the remotest notion of what the scheme was about, or else he <Col N="1235" /> got estimates from his advisers of a far different kind from those I was accustomed to receive.</P>
    <P>I think I know the explanation.  The scheme was formulated without any conception of what it was all about, and without any clear idea of what it was intended to do.  At this moment I very much doubt if the Minister has any clear view as to what this scheme will involve over the next four or five years.  In the course of his statement he said:</P>
    <P>The target for increased cattle production in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> would require an average annual increase in cow numbers of 75,000 up to 1968.  This figure has been exceeded in the past year.</P>
    <P>Where does he get that statistic?  The only statistics available to me were the intercensal estimate as of 1st January and the more accurate enumeration associated with 1st June.  The Minister takes out of the air&mdash; whence he got it, I know not&mdash;a figure of 75,000 which he says is somewhat less than the increase in the number of cows in the country&mdash;when, or in comparison with what period?  The phraseology appearing in the statement, to my mind, means nothing and I think is just thrown in for the purpose of sounding doubtful.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say that I just do not know how this scheme for calved heifers is working.  I am perfectly certain that the figure mentioned by the Minister of an average individual grant which works out at £37, representing two animals per herd owner, is a piece of dissimulation on his part which is unworthy of a Minister for Agriculture.  He knows as well as I do that an average figure of that kind has no more significance than if he had whistled <i>Yankee Doodle.</i> If you take, simply, the number of farmers and divide them into the total number of grants made, it means nothing at all.  What would be meaningful is if the Minister told us&mdash;which he ought to be able to do&mdash;the number <Col N="1236" /> of herd owners who received grants for more than 100 heifers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>That is not so.  The Minister has a duty to explain to the House how it was conceivably possible that the Minister for Agriculture could advise this House that a considered scheme which was to cost £405,000 in its first year has in fact cost £3,155,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, which I am happy to remember I initiated is now reaching its final stages.  I am hopeful that the Minister's ambition that the scheme, inaugurated in September, 1944, will be completed just over 11 years after its commencement, will be realised.  On the whole, bearing in mind the magnitude of the problem <Col N="1237" /> that presented itself to us, particularly in the six south-western counties, that is not a discreditable performance. When we recall that we have carried the burden of that eradication scheme on our own Exchequer, compared with a number of our continental competitors who were facilitated in realising it by vast grants from the Government of the United States, I think the farmers of this country have reason to be proud of their achievement.</P>
    <P>I have learned, with growing concern, of the virtual disappearance of what I thought always was a very valuable market, that is, the market we established, not without difficulty, in the United States for boxed frozen beef.  I should be glad if the Minister would give us further particulars of the factors which have led to the very serious decline in the export of such beef to the United States.</P>
    <P>I remember when that trade began. It began as a dual purpose trade.  There was an export trade in prime carcase beef and this remarkable opening of a boxed boneless beef trade resulted mainly from an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Mexico whence this class of manufacturing beef had largely been drawn.  I remember prophesying at the time that the market for prime carcase beef in the United States was non-existent, that it was a matter of bringing coals to Newcastle to bring prime cascase beef to Omaha, Nebraska and Illinois but that boxed, boneless beef, which was used for conversion into salami and soup and such products in America, had immense potentiality, particularly in view of the extraordinary difficulty which the Government of Mexico and some South American Governments experienced in bringing foot-and-mouth disease under control.  I think this market was worth something like £10 million a year?</P>

      <P>It grew from nothing to almost £10 million a year and it is now fading out.  I have been told that the reason for its decline has been competition in demand from other sources. That is something we have reason to <Col N="1238" /> congratulate ourselves upon but I am at a loss rather to understand why we have not been able to meet whatever demand may have presented itself on the continent plus the demand in America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think there was a considerable volume of them still available and that there was still scope for the supplying of aged cows that are annually available here to take care of this trade.  It is, of course, satisfactory if we can dispose of the meat more advantageously on the continent but we ought to bear in mind&mdash; and this would argue for the case made by Deputy McQuillan for a meat marketing board&mdash;that there has always been a problem in this country of drifting in and out of markets.</P>
      <P>We have experienced, again and again, the problem in a variety of agricultural products of our marketing operations being completely frustrated by our failure to maintain continuity of supply.  There is no doubt whatever that we had built up in America a very high reputation for the quality of Irish manufacturing meat to the point that we even had cases in which the boxes in which this meat was exported were being used a second time by illegitimate traders who were putting inferior products into them in order to trade on the excellence of the reputation of our product.</P>
      <P>I am dismayed that a market, worth £10 million, which was built up in the United States and which my Government had every prospect of continuing suddenly vanished overnight because we switched our supplies elsewhere.  I am by no means certain the same continuity exists in the continental markets to which we have now diverted our supplies and I should be glad to be reassured by the Minister that, in his judgment, the alternative market which absorbs the bulk of our supplies holds out the same prospect of continuing demand as the American market undoubtedly did particularly as we had established our reputation in manufacturing circles there as a source of very reliable quality-manufactured meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> We have now for the first time engaged in the subsidisation of beef exports and, superficially, that seems to be an unexceptional course.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.  I remember very well when we negotiated the 1948 Trade Agreement, there were two courses open to us and a very definite choice had to be made between them.  We could enter into competition with the British farmer in what they regarded as their traditional domestic market for meat. Remember our meat is not like Argentine meat: our meat was identical in quality with British or Scottish beef.  Or we could adopt the line that instead of constituting the British farmer a powerful vested interest in opposition to our interests in the British market, we should make them a powerful vested interest more and more dependent on the supplies of store cattle which they drew from this country.  We deliberately took the view that it was very much better to mobilise the National Farmers' Union in England as a powerful vested interest in support of our livestock trade than to array them against us as a powerful vested interest gravely apprehensive that we would go into competition with them and possibly beat down the level of prices available to them in their own domestic market.</P>
    <P>I remember distinctly arguing at length with the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, and Mr. Tom Williams that two beasts slaughtered in England should be paid for on an identical basis without regard to where they were calved.  I remember very well, in the course of the negotiations, the Chancellor of the Exchequer who was leading the British delegation, turning to his own officials and saying: &ldquo;I think the Irish Minister for Agriculture is right and that we must concede this.&rdquo;  So it was done, and for the past 17 years we have enjoyed the advantage of what are called deficiency payments paid by the British Government to British farmers through the store cattle trade and I have no hesitation in saying that today, or certainly in the recent past, <Col N="1240" /> Irish farmers are or were getting £20 per head more for store cattle on account of the fact that they had this right to participate in the deficiency payments paid by the British Government to British farmers under the terms of that Agreement.  I know that Agreement was somewhat abridged when the British required our cattle to be three months in Britain before they qualified whereas originally they only required them to be there one month.</P>
    <P>How far do we intend to go in this business of subsidising exports of carcase meat?  Do we aim to substitute, on any substantial scale, the export of carcase beef for the export of store cattle and, if so, where are we going to send them?  Do we plan to export them to continental Europe because I should be very much surprised if it will long continue to enter the British market carrying a substantial subsidy from this side without producing a reaction gravely inimical to our livestock trade?  These are paths that should be trod with caution because there was a time when certain people here did not appreciate the value of the livestock industry to our economy.</P>
    <P>I think there are very few people who are so obscurantist as to misunderstand the significance of that industry today.  It would be a very grave catastrophe for us if this or any Government in Britain were persuaded by the powerful vested interests representing the British farming community to alter the attitude they have maintained to our livestock industry since the 1948 Agreement.  I want to emphasise that the terms of that Agreement have come to be understood by the British farmers as conferring very material advantage on them and it has become a very vital interest to the livestock feeder in England to maintain their source of supply of the kind of store cattle we have to offer.</P>
    <P>That has been a very powerful interest operating in our favour in a very vital matter.  When I look back on the years of effort and the millions of money that we put into the business of raising the standard of our <Col N="1241" /> cattle I often wonder what effect the promiscuous grants under the Calved Heifer Scheme will have on all that work.  I think the Minister could, with benefit, ask some of the more experienced officers of his Department to tell him the story of how we began by the importation of bulls from abroad to improve the standard of our cattle and how we eliminated the scrub bull.  I hope, in the events that followed, we have not introduced the scrub heifer because, mark you, production of livestock involves not only the bull but the heifer as well.</P>
    <P>There was a time when people here were very anxious to ensure that any heifer-in-calf was calculated to produce the kind of calf or yearling that would readily sell to a discerning buyer.  I doubt if that criterion has applied during the past 12 months.  During that time I believe anything capable of conceiving has been induced to conceive by the fact that for the first time under any scheme operated by our Department of Agriculture, production has been promoted without any reference to quality.  These are dangerous roads to travel and they are roads which I think may often be embarked upon by people with a very imperfect knowledge of the background on which they are working.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister where he expects the bulk of the subsidised carcase meat exports to go.  Will they go to Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take me some time to elaborate.  Because of the guaranteed payments scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that, but it seems odd to me that, if we are subsidising exports of meat to Great Britain simply because there is no immediate <Col N="1242" /> reaction to it, exports of carcase meat to Sweden or to Germany or to France or to any other continental destination would not carry a similar subsidy.  In fact, I believe if exports to these destinations could be effectively achieved by this procedure, there would be a more powerful argument for it than for the attempt on our part to offset the beef subsidy scheme operated by the British Government in favour of their own farmers.  I should be glad to know from the Minister what he believes the reaction of British farmers will be if this new export subsidy scheme should expand on any basis comparable with the expansion that has taken place in the scheme of grants for heifers.  Suppose this was a tearaway success and we began to flood the British market with carcase beef and starved it of store cattle, what does the Minister think would happen?  Remember, if anything does happen, it will be too late to take remedial measures.</P>
      <P>I should like to know where we are going and I should like to know what considered line of policy underlies this new departure.  I knew where I was going when I was Minister for Agriculture and the Government of which I was a member knew precisely where we were going.  I think, in retrospect, the decisions taken then have been more than justified by the event.  I think the quality and the volume of our livestock today have been an immense stay and prop to the economy of the country.  I would hate to see that trade disrupted.  It depends almost entirely, let us not forget, on the goodwill of the British farmer and when we speak of the goodwill of the British farmer, we are merely employing a euphemism for the self-interest of the British farmer. So long as our store trade with Great Britain serves the fundamental interests of the British farmer, it has a brilliant prospect; the moment it ceases to do so, I cannot see it surviving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being a bit romantic; I am being extremely pedestrian. The fundamental difference between the Minister and me is that I have some experience of it, the Minister has very little, and what I am apprehensive of is that we will embark upon adventures the end of which we have not anticipated or worked out.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister is aiming at in the subsidy for beef exports and he has not told us.  I am putting the question now: Suppose the volume of beef exports grows beyond his wildest anticipations, with consequent diminution in the supply of store cattle, what does he think the consequences of that will be?</P>
      <P>The last word I want to say is this: There is no more poisonous heresy in regard to the agricultural industry in this country than the rubbish that is talked about the small farmer being impoverished by the production of store cattle.  That is the kind of theoretical codology with which people who do not understand how our people live can bewilder themselves.  The number of farmers who confine their activities to the production of store cattle is microscopic.  It is like the fable of the man and the dog and the stick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the time when we used to be told in this country that the store bullock was the greatest enemy of employment that existed on the land of Ireland and that until we had every acre of land growing wheat, there would be no employment on the land and it was hateful heresy to say that the growing of wheat will end employment on the land and the removal of the livestock from the land on which it grew will substantially reduce employment on the land.  But most of the people who were bursting to grow more wheat lived to see the day when wheat became the great destroyer of employment on the land.  They saw the contractor come in, plough up the land, sow the wheat, go away, and put a chain on the gate until he came back in the autumn with his machinery and saved the wheat and removed it mechanically to the mill or to the grain store, without the employment of practically a single creature, but the <Col N="1244" /> man who kept cattle or the man who kept pigs or the man who kept sheep had to employ men.</P>
    <P>What small farmer in Ireland spends his time producing nothing but store cattle?  That is one of the nonsensical illusions but it is an illusion upon which appalling mistakes could be built up.  No small farmer in this country can long survive who does not engage in mixed farming and he can never long survive if he does not produce a wide variety of products on his land the bulk of which he walks off. It is the conversion of the crops he grows on a small holding into livestock of one kind or another, whether it be cattle, pigs or sheep, that makes it possible for the small farmer to remain on the land and to prosper on the land.</P>
    <P>Let us make up our minds to this: no small farmer in this country&mdash;and I mean a man with 45 acres or less&mdash; is ever going to enjoy the monetary standard of life which can be purchased in industrial employment in Great Britain or the United States of America and there will always be a certain number of people born in rural Ireland who will consciously make the choice of turning their backs on life on the land and choosing to live in Birmingham, Belfast, Dublin, Cork or some other industrial environs but it is equally so that there will always be a sufficient number of our people who, given a reasonable standard of living on the land, will prefer to live as property-owning farmers in their own holdings.</P>
    <P>These people are not only of incalculable value to the economic life of this country but they are one of the most valuable elements of our social structure.  We ought to apply our minds to the task of consolidating and strengthening the position of the small property-owning farmers, whether they are in the north, north-west, south, west, south-west, or indeed in any other part of Ireland.  None of them who have any prospect of survival engage exclusively in the production of store cattle.  Practically all of them who are destined to prosper and rear decent families on the land will, in conjunction with other activities, produce store <Col N="1245" /> cattle, and if they do not, they will not succeed.</P>
    <P>These are two generalisations which will cover 95 per cent of our small farmers.  You will find the exception that proves the rule, the man who produces soft fruit or the man who produces specialised crops here and there in different parts of the country. They are the exceptions that prove the rule.  The long-term prosperity of our people on the small holdings is associated with mixed farming, of which the production of cattle constitutes the linchpin.  It is mischievous and dangerous to promote this nonsensical heresy that the production of store cattle on small farms is a means of beggaring the farmer.  The livestock industry is the sheet anchor of our industry, as agriculture is, in the last analysis, the sheet anchor of our economy.</P>
    <P>I suppose any Minister entering a new and exciting Department, as the Department of Agriculture undoubtedly is, must be pardoned if in his salad days, he thinks he can break ice with a stick.  I do not complain of that. I do not think it is an altogether evil thing if one is sometimes a little more adventurous than mature prudence would allow, but, having made one's attempt to break ice with a stick, do not start breaking up the furniture in order to get a stouter stick to break the ice that will not give way.</P>
    <P>If there is some temporary reason for this new departure, well and good, but if anyone is toying with the idea that we should drop the store cattle trade in the belief that we can substitute for it the carcase beef trade, he is walking a road that leads to certain ruin because he will find that he will create, where there was a powerful vested interest in our favour, just as powerful and a far more ruthless interest to frustrate us.</P>
    <P>I do not congratulate the Minister on Estimates that bear no relation to those originally submitted to the House because I think it suggests that he does not know what he is about.  However, I must add this: there has been a change of Minister and the original Estimate was presented to us by the <Col N="1246" /> present Minister's predecessor.  I am not making him personally responsible for the wide and wild discrepancy that manifested itself in Subhead K.14. However, it is the responsibility of his Government because I know the history of that transaction.  That scheme was formulated to purchase a vote in this House without regard to whither it led, what it was going to cost or what it was going to do.  That may be good politics but it is not the right way to run the Department of Agriculture.  I should like to think that when I was Minister for Agriculture nobody would suborn my interest in that great Department and all it represents in the life of this country to a cheap political trick.  I hope it will not happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The coverage in this Supplementary Estimate is pretty wide, but it appears to me, glancing at it, that the emphasis is on beef production.  I noticed with interest recently that the Minister has been making a tour of continental Europe and that he has also been in contact with his opposite number, the Minister in charge of agriculture in the United Kingdom.  It is nice to know that finally the representative of agriculture in the Fianna Fáil Party has come down to the basic fact that beef production is the life of our economy.  This Supplementary Estimate is an indication of thinking on those lines and for that reason I welcome it.</P>
      <P>First of all, to deal with bovine tuberculosis eradication, I should like the Minister to give the House some indication as to the success of that scheme.  Admittedly, we have got to the stage in which we are dealing with the last six counties&mdash;the six Munster counties are the only ones that have not been attested so far&mdash;but there is, at the same time, a growing number of reactors in the areas already attested. I do not think that is peculiar to any county.  My own county produces a lot of livestock and quite a few people have found to their surprise that reactors are cropping up again here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this problem in other countries, particularly in Scandinavia where they have been for a long time <Col N="1247" /> working on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, they find that having got clean herds&mdash;the country is considered largely to be free of tuberculosis&mdash;the disease has an uncanny habit of turning up again.  It is a recognised fact that if a bird flying over a herd drops a piece of infected dung on that herd, the infection will go through it like a prairie fire.  I should like the Minister, if he has any statistics available or any knowledge on the subject, to indicate to the House that he is entirely satisfied that when we do eradicate tuberculosis, we are finished with it for all time.  We spent a sizeable sum on this and we spent this money purely for the purpose of the store trade.</P>
    <P>My views on the store trade do not diverge very greatly from what Deputy Dillon has been saying.  We are largely dependent on the store trade.  We are largely dependent on what we can export to the United Kingdom to get the finance necessary to buy the raw materials for our industries. At the same time&mdash;this is my personal view&mdash;I do not subscribe to the opinion that the store trade is the be-all and end-all of our beef production.</P>
    <P>We have got to learn that New Zealand, a country largely parallel with ours in its production, its size and its agricultural community, is exporting beef across the world, selling it to Nigeria, one of the countries in Africa which has a purchasing power.  If the New Zealanders are able to export their beef that distance to a country where there is a growing demand&mdash;it is only one of many&mdash;it is obviously easier in a modern world to export what you have got if you process it and ship it in a more easy fashion than is possible in the case of live animals.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate my view that it is fundamentally essential for our economy that we maintain our store exports, but at the same time I submit we should concentrate as far as is possible on the processing of beef to enable us to expand and diversify our market.  I am one of the people in this House who perhaps might not be <Col N="1248" /> accused of being anti-British.  I have had it yelled at me in debates that I am supposed to be pro-British.  I do not know whether I am or not.  I feel very strongly in relation to our trade agreements with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I remember some few years back, only about eight or nine years ago, when beef was not in such demand as it is today, when we farmers in Ireland who are beef farmers, of whom I claim to be one, had the greatest difficulty in selling our produce and the British were not so keen to buy from us.  Today there is an unlimited demand for beef.  From the opportunities I have had of studying the situation as a member of the agricultural arm of a UN body, I am satisfied that the demand will last into the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>There is a great demand for two agricultural products.  One is beef and the other is forestry produce that comes off the land.  Anything that aids us to build up our trade in processing and exporting beef is advantageous to us.  It seems to me there is practically only one country in the world looking for absolutely first-class beef.  That is the United Kingdom.  It has always been a theory in Britain that fresh beef, Irish beef that is killed there, is what they want.  Against that, we must consider that we are competing today against chilled beef, a different thing from the produce we had to compete with in days gone by.  We are moving into a changing situation.  For that reason, if we bring as much beef to maturity as possible, always providing we do not destroy our existing store trade, we shall be taking a step in the right direction.  It is a known fact that all over the world, perhaps to a greater extent elsewhere than here, there is less employment to be had on the land than heretofore. Therefore, the great risk we run is that if we continue on the existing lines, we will syphon more people off the farms here into the towns and cities, and I do not think we are sufficiently developed yet, nor do I think our future is sufficiently assured with the somewhat uncertain conditions that prevail in marketing and economic agreements in Europe and other parts, <Col N="1249" /> to absorb those people into employment.</P>
    <P>For that reason I cannot help feeling that beef in the foreseeable future is likely to be the basis of our raw material for the building up of an industrial arm based on agriculture. My personal view from experience gathered is that anything that helps to encourage our farmers economically to finish their beef is to the advantage of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Where does the small farmer fit into the picture?  If stores are a very high price, the small farmer who breeds them and who is the bulwark of the store trade in this country will get better prices.  Against this, we are told Government policy is largely to eradicate the small farmer, to increase our farm holdings.  I fear the time will come when the small farmer will be forced to buy stores the same as I do, the same as the bigger farmer does, the same as the Minister himself, perhaps. I do not know how much land he has but I do know he keeps hens.</P>
    <P>A stable price is therefore indicated. What I am trying to convey to the House is that I place no great reliance on the British market as such.  I do not think any Deputy can really feel the same respect for any trade agreement, any purchasing power the United Kingdom may have because of the treatment meted out to us recently.  Accordingly, we must look to ourselves in the future to ensure that we are able to produce what is most advantageous to us.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I think our exports at the moment to the United Kingdom in beef &mdash;in fact our exports to any part of the world&mdash;are somewhere in the neighbourhood of 80 per cent, excluding the boned beef which we export to America.  Of that our finished beef exports would be perhaps 20 per cent. It is desirable that in the course of time we would gradually evolve a situation where we would increase our finished beef exports so that we would not be dependent on restricted markets.  We should, at the same time, gradually reduce our store trade, being mindful of what Deputy Dillon said&mdash;it was fundamentally sound and true&mdash;that the small farmer is dependent on the <Col N="1250" /> price he gets from the early beef he produces, from the store trade.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I wish to add except to point out to the Minister that what the small farmer really needs to help him to meet the requirements within this Estimate is more facile credit.  The position at the moment is that the banks are not ready to lend money.  They seem keen to give money for anything except the purchase of livestock.  Farmers who have survived all sorts of vicissitudes, who have built themselves up, who have improved their houses and farm buildings and are in a position to increase their stock, are tied down for credit.  The Minister must direct his mind to that.  Beef, after all, is the future of Irish agriculture.  It always has been and it always will be if the Minister will move to revise the credit situation.</P>

      <P>I shall not detain the House more than a few minutes.  There is very little in this Estimate which is of direct concern to the farmers in the constituency I represent, particularly the dairy farmers. There are one or two matters in the Minister's speech upon which I have expressed strong views in the past and, lest it should be thought that I have changed these views, I want to say a few words now in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was at pains to extol the merits of the Calved Heifer Scheme.  On every occasion on which I have spoken on this scheme in this House, I have expressed myself as not being in favour of it.  I made that clear last November and I put forward the suggestion then that a much better approach to solving the problem of increasing cattle numbers would be a calf subsidy.  The Minister on that occasion pointed out that such a scheme would not be possible and that considerable difficulties stood in the way of the implementation and administration of such a scheme.  Since then I have discussed the matter with various dairy farmers and I am now more than ever convinced that the present calved heifer subsidy scheme is <Col N="1251" /> not the best way to approach the problem of increasing cattle numbers.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the average figure.  An average figure means nothing.  The Minister said only a small number received substantial payments in respect of the scheme. From my experience of County Limerick this scheme cannot be said to be of benefit.  Its benefits have not been widely distributed.  I have no doubt whatever about that.  A calf subsidy scheme, on the other hand, would provide an incentive to the small farmer to rear calves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall the total sum paid but I do remember that the average worked out at about two per dairy farmer.  That would be £30.  That coincides to a certain extent with the average figure.  Taking 10,000 dairy farmers in Limerick, that would be £30,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe an average does not give the true answer. I live in the heart of a dairying area.  I have made my own observations.  I have made inquiries at cattle marts and so forth.  I have been surprised at the number of farmers who did not avail of the scheme at all.  The picture, as far as I can judge, is that a certain number of farmers qualify for anything up to 20.  But there are numbers who have not qualified for any benefit at all.  The farmers' organisations in the creamery areas are convinced the calved heifer scheme is not a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication scheme is now drawing to a close, particularly in the six southern creamery counties.  The figure given by the Minister in November was 31,000 reactors sold to the Department to the <Col N="1252" /> end of March; it is now apparent that a total of 33,700 will have been taken up. That is a good thing.  There is just one point: the Minister knows I have had to make representations with regard to the price offered for reactors.  Other Deputies have also made representations in this regard.  I have had experience, and so have other Deputies, of farmers in the creamery areas disagreeing with the prices offered by the Department.  After lengthy representations and visits from three or four different valuers the prices were increased.  As the final stages are now being reached, I suggest the Department might be a little bit more generous. If they are, I have no doubt all reactors will be got rid of without any difficulty at all.</P>
    <P>In the last paragraph of his speech, the Minister referred to Bord Bainne and said that the favourable trend in prices for butter had resulted in a smaller demand being made by Bord Bainne on the Exchequer than was estimated.  I have paid tribute to Bord Bainne on a number of occasions.  We find now that a saving of £215,000 is anticipated as a result of improved prices for our butter.  At the moment there is considerable discussion in the creamery areas with regard to the subsidy being paid on milk for processing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal, first of all, with the points made by Deputy O'Donnell.  He was the last speaker and his remarks are therefore fresh in my mind.  I confess I cannot understand his approach to the calved heifer subsidy scheme.  Deputy O'Donnell does not like the scheme.  He says he does not think it is a good one.  I can only conclude from that that he thinks it should be stopped.  Deputy O'Donnell represents a milk producing area and the farmers in that area are benefiting considerably: 3,211 farmers in County Limerick have got £181,260 so far under the calved heifer subsidy scheme. Deputy O'Donnell, as far as I can gather, wants this to stop.  He does not think it is a good idea.  Up to 28th February, 1965, in the whole country, no fewer than 72,965 farmers got a total of £2,735,940 under this scheme.  Deputy O'Donnell does not think this is a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Would he not agree that a calf subsidy scheme would be preferable and lead to a more equitable distribution of benefit to the small farmer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not.  I already dealt with that aspect on the occasion when I introduced the other Supplementary Estimate last November. This scheme in our particular circumstances was decided on by all concerned in my Department and by the expert advice to which we had access as the most suitable and most beneficial.  Deputy O'Donnell says he does not think it is the best way to increase cattle production.  How can he possibly make that statement when the very success of this scheme has caused it to be criticised by his Leader, Deputy Dillon?  There is no doubt that it has increased cattle production. <Col N="1254" /> During 1964 no fewer than 175,000 heifers were accepted for payment of subsidy.  It is absolutely clear from the figures that cow numbers between June, 1963, and June, 1964, went up by 70,000.  Maybe all that is not specifically due to the Calved Heifer Subsidy Scheme, but the greater portion of it undoubtedly is.  When we come to January of this year, I have no doubt that the figures will show we will have over 100,000 cows over and above the numbers as at January, 1964.</P>
      <P>If we were trying to estimate what this scheme is going to mean, I could understand Deputy O'Donnell saying that, in his opinion, he did not think it was going to do this or that, but the facts and figures are before us.  Cow numbers have increased enormously and the scheme has certainly had the effect of increasing cattle production. You might argue it is too expensive or that we are getting these cattle numbers too quickly, but certainly you cannot say it is not having the effect of giving us more cow numbers and increasing cattle production.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon was critical of the Scheme also and suggested it was introduced for political reasons.  He said, in fact, it was concocted in order to procure a vote in this House.  I hope all the rest of Deputy Dillon's reminiscences and prognostications are a little more accurate than that particular one.  The records of my Department will show that this scheme was conceived and hammered out long before there was any question of procuring the particular vote to which Deputy Dillon refers.  This scheme arose directly out of the publication by the Department of Agriculture of the Brown Book and the setting of the targets for increased cattle production and increased cow numbers in that Brown Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was clear that if those targets were to be reached, some incentive had to be devised.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, evolved this particular scheme in preference to any other scheme which could be thought of.  A calf scheme was considered but <Col N="1255" /> rejected.  Because we had certain records available through the BTE Scheme, this heifer scheme was obviously the one to adopt.  It was adopted on the basis of the targets set out in the Second Programme and on no other basis whatsoever.  What is really worrying Fine Gael about it is that it has been so tremendously successful. I am happy we are spending far more money on it than we envisaged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell again makes this what I can only describe as a silly interjection.  He cannot on any basis establish that this is not a first-class, excellent scheme, availed of by no fewer that 72,000 farmers.  Deputy McQuillan was also interested in this scheme, and questioned me as to whether or not the small farmer was deriving benefit from it.  Again, the figures show conclusively it is the small farmers who are availing of this scheme and getting benefit from it.  In Roscommon, Deputy McQuillan's county, up to 28th February, 1965, 3,373 farmers got 7,712 grants totalling £115,680.  No matter how anybody tries to disguise the facts, that £115,680 went into the pockets of the farmers of Roscommon in the form of cheques from my Department, money that would not otherwise have come.  The fact that 3,373 farmers got 7,712 grants shows they got almost exactly two grants per farmer.  In that county in particular, the national average is reflected.  In the adjoining county of Mayo, to which Deputy McQuillan also referred, the figures are even more striking. There 5,895 farmers got 8,348 grants, much less than two grants per farmer, totalling £125,220&mdash;again a substantial sum of money going directly into the pockets of the small farmers of Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was down in the pilot areas of Roscommon and Mayo, I heard the advisers discussing with the small farmers there how they could secure an increased income from their small farms.  When I heard them discussing <Col N="1256" /> the question of getting into milk, the advisers were able to point to this scheme and show what a tremendous help it would be to the small farmers in those pilot areas to get into milk&mdash;the fact that the farmer could have these £15 grants for every calved heifer brought onto his farm.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan and with Deputy Dillon that the answer to the problem of the small farms, whether in the west or elsewhere, is more intensive forms of production.  I said in Limerick that we wanted to get the small farmers to build up big businesses on their small farms.  By that I meant they have got to go into more intensive lines.  Of course, the answer for the west is, in the main, milk and pigs.  In that connection this Calved Heifer Subsidy Scheme is one of the best possible inducements we can offer to the small farmers of the west to get into milk for the first time and to the small farmers in other parts already in milk to increase their cow numbers and increase their income.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked me about a meat marketing board.  I have already indicated to the House that this subsidy scheme for our meat exports is a temporary one.  It is due to expire in June and between now and June, I have indicated that we shall carry out an examination of the meat and cattle industry, its prospects and its likely lines of development. The things, of course, one must keep in mind in regard to our meat and cattle industry are the arguments for and against the establishment of a meat marketing board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke at some length about the 1948 Agreement and having the British farmers as a pressure group on our side.  This is all romantic nonsense, completely out of date and irrelevant.  He did touch on the truth on occasions when I interrupted him and said as long as it suits the British farmer to take our store cattle, he will take them, and, if it does not suit the British farmer to take our store cattle at the prices we ask, then he will not take them.  All Deputy Dillon's great big myth about the inestimable benefits of the 1948 Agreement are, as I said, completely irrelevant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> Deputy Dillon dangerously overemphasises the whole position.  He talks as if nothing else mattered but our store cattle trade.  It is very important, we all admit that.  It is fundamental to our whole livestock economy and, therefore, to our whole national economy.  But there are several more aspects of our economy to which Deputy Dillon did not refer. He, for instance, completely ignored the fact that in order to have a store trade, you must have a milk industry. You cannot have cattle production without milk.  What inestimable advantages has the 1948 Agreement conferred on us in this direction?</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about the development of our store trade as a result of the 1948 Agreement, but the store trade is not the end of our whole agricultural perspective.  We have numerous other agricultural products to be disposed of.  There is such a thing as putting all your eggs into one basket.  While we all recognise the value of our store trade to our economy, we must always have regard to these other vital sectors, particularly the milk sector.  I want to make it clear that there is no intention whatever, by the introduction of this subsidy scheme for carcase meat to Great Britain, to injure our store trade in any way.  This scheme was introduced as a short-term scheme to meet a specific short term situation.  There is no doubt that the operation of the British deficiency payments system has a tremendous drawing power on our cattle population.  By its operation, it drew into the store export trade increasing numbers of cattle which would otherwise possibly have been fattened in this country and would have been made available both to the live fat shipper and to our dead meat factories.</P>
    <P>The numbers themselves are quite significant.  Our exports of store cattle in particular went up in 1962, from 429,200 to 565,163, an increase of roughly 130,000 head.  In the period from January to November 1963, they were 540,600 and increased in the same period of 1964 to 612,300.  The picture was quite clear.  The operation of the British deficiency payments system was <Col N="1258" /> having its effect on drawing increasing numbers of cattle into the store trade and ensuring that they were exported as stores rather than being fattened here.  This places the dead meat factory here in a very perilous position.  There were not sufficient fat cattle coming on the market here to keep the factories going, so this scheme was carefully devised to ensure that to some extent cattle which were going out of store would be retained here by our farmers and fattened and would go on the market and be available for purchase either by the fat shipper or by the dead meat factory man.  We hope it will have that effect.  That is the purpose of it.</P>
    <P>I think it is ridiculous nonsense to look upon it in any way as a threat to our store trade.  There is no doubt that we are now well on the way to reaching the target set in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> These targets involve the annual output by 1970 of 1½ million head of cattle. In the context of that target, 1½ million cattle, there will be plenty of room for our store trade and for our dead meat trade.  There will be plenty of supplies available to both these trades, and we would be foolish at this stage, in the light of these forthcoming cattle numbers, to let our dead meat trade go to the wall.  There must be some limit to the number of our cattle that can go out as stores.  When we get these increased numbers in annual output, we have got to envisage a certain proportion going out as carcase beef.  I hope there will be plenty of supplies for both these trades.  It would be a national disaster for us now, in the light of this development, to let the dead meat trade go to the wall and not have it available when these increasing numbers are due in the years between now and 1970.  There is no doubt, and all the indications are, we will get these increased numbers we are planning for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked about the boneless beef trade to the United States. Naturally we are disappointed about the present position in that regard. This trade had been built up to very valuable proportions and the reputation established for our meat was excellent. We had very excellent trade connections <Col N="1259" /> and all of us would be very anxious that this trade would continue, but, unfortunately, the situation is that at the moment it has declined considerably. It has declined because there has been a reduction in the number of cows coming forward, both because of the tailing off of the BTE scheme and the reduction in the number of cows coming from Northern Ireland.  This has taken place side by side with a tremendously increased demand for our cows for manufacturing purposes on the continent of Europe.  I do not know what the future of this boneless beef trade to America is going to be. We all hope the circumstances will change and that it will be possible to revive it because I agree with Deputy Dillon that it is a very valuable outlet.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with him that the important thing to do in all our export markets is to try to build up continuity and try to expand and develop a particular market and not to be chopping and changing and switching from one market to another, but the situation is that that demand is there in Europe today for these cows and the prices are being paid for them and we could not prohibit their export to the continent of Europe, or contemplate denying our farmers access to these good prices that are being paid, so that unfortunately there is, as of now, at any rate, nothing in particular we can do about this particular trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned that he had been Minister for Agriculture and spoke of or implied his knowledge, experience and maturity in all these matters, but I am afraid for one so experience and knowledgeable about the Department of Agriculture, he committed a very simple but unforgivable little error in regard to the salaries paid by the Department.  He spoke as if this £700,000 for which I am now looking for salaries, represented a doubling of the salary bill for the Department.  Of course it does nothing of the sort.  The total salaries paid to the Department of Agriculture before the ninth round were somewhere in the order of £2 million. Despite his knowledge and experience <Col N="1260" /> of the Department, Deputy Dillon apparently overlooked the fact that Subhead A covers only some of the salaries, that the rest are distributed throughout the various other subheads, and that in fact all we are dealing with is an increase of £700,000 roughly in relation to £2 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The original sum was £815,000 and the increase is £700,000 so that the increase under that subhead is nearly 100 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not wrong.  That is an estimate of the increase.  I do not think there were any other points raised in relation to this subhead.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I just want to say that despite Deputy Dillon's strictures and gloomy and slightly sinister suggestions about these two schemes, the Calved Heifer Scheme and the scheme for subsidising the export of carcase meat to the United Kingdom, I think in our present circumstances they are both excellent schemes.  They are fulfilling the purposes for which they were devised and are contributing in a very satisfactory way to the long-term development of our cattle and of the meat industry.  For that reason, both the original amounts of money voted for them by this House are necessary and desirable and this increase which I am now looking for, when voted by the Dáil, will represent money well spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,816,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year <Col N="1261" /> ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is mainly required to meet increases in pay arising out of the ninth round settlement, and out of other settlements or awards under the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and similar arrangements.  Deputies may remember that I mentioned, when introducing the main Estimate, that it did not include any provision to meet these.  Accordingly, £3,679,000 must now be provided under Subhead A, Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  Of that sum, £3,420,000 is to meet the cost of increases in pay, including some £650,000 for retrospective payments relating to 1963/64.  The remainder of the supplementary provision is largely for additional telephone operating and engineering staff to meet the needs of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>On subhead B, Travelling and Incidental Expenses, the increase of £65,000, approximately, arises mainly from higher rates of travelling, subsistence and similar expenses.  On Subhead J, Superannuation and Other Non-Effective payments, approximately £45,000 is being provided to meet increased payments arising from increases to officers retiring, et cetera, on higher rates of pay.</P>
    <P>On Subhead K.1 £50,000 is being provided for an increased grant-in-aid to Radio Éireann to pass on, in effect, to the Authority revenue arising from an unexpected growth in the number of combined licences.</P>
    <P>The gross increase of over £3.8 millions is offset by savings on other subheads of £450,000, approximately, and by increased appropriations-in-aid amounting to £570,000, approximately, arising mainly from larger recoveries from telephone capital and from other Government Departments for services rendered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short statement but I suppose it covers what the Minister requires.  The amount for <Col N="1262" /> salaries is quite considerable.  It is £3,679,000.  The Minister says he mentioned in his statement last year he was not making provision for that sum.  It is a mistake when a Department knows that a sum has to be paid during the year not to make provision for it.  Any good accountancy firm would make provision in their estimate for that.  The Minister knew as well as anybody else that the ninth round was coming at the time.  It is a mistake that such a large sum should be brought in as a Supplementary Estimate.  Practically 25 per cent of the total Estimate is now shown as a Supplementary Estimate. That is not good business and in future years it would be better for the Department to make a much closer estimate than they have made in the past year. They should make provision for anything which comes along, especially as a result of a wage increase.</P>
      <P>We all knew how the ninth round came about.  It took place because of the turnover tax and all that followed from that.  I am very glad to see the Minister is looking for extra money for the telephone services but I think the sum should be much greater than he is looking for.  The expansion in telephone services has been increasing rapidly during the past few years.  I understand, in reply to a question recently, the Minister stated he had 13,000 applications for telephones, about 2,000 more than he had last year.  If we want to gear the country for industrial expansion the first thing we should provide is proper telephone communications.  The Minister has fallen down on his job or his Department have fallen down on their job to provide telephones.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very courteous when he is written to.  He acknowledges the letter and follows it up with another letter saying he regrets the telephone will not be installed for some time.  I was wondering during the year would I ever get a letter informing me that the telephone would be installed withing one, two or three months.</P>

      <P>The Minister should do something about the applications for telephones.  He is being pressed, when <Col N="1263" /> his Estimate comes up every year, from all sides of the House to do something about this matter.  I had occasion to write to the Minister about a telephone for a motor engineering firm which employs quite a number of men.  They needed the telephone service very badly.  They opened a new business in Kilkenny.  It was in the city so that there was not much to be done in regard to lines.  It was not in a remote part of the country.  The very same answer occurred to me.  I would ask the Minister during the coming year to look to this matter.  Has the Minister any power in the Department or any influence in the Government to insist that money would be allotted for extra telephone services?  I believe money allotted in this way would be very useful.  This is one of the services which pays its way.  It shows a profit every year and I would ask the Minister during the coming year to see that a full service is given.</P>
      <P>I notice £50,000 extra is being provided for Radio Éireann.  This arises because of the increase in the number of sets bought during the year.  We are all very glad to see that.</P>

      <P>I have constantly asked the Minister in this House the position regarding the number of people who have applied for telephones. I am sure the Government are very lucky to have such a man as Deputy Michael Hilliard as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister is such a likeable man that we often pull our punches.  At the same time, I should like to point out to him his record.  It is in the Official Report, volume 214, No. 2, column 323 of the 11th February last.  I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the number of applications for telephones at present before his Department, the number waiting over (a) one year, (b) two years, (c) three years and (d) four years, and the number of applications that were before his Department 12 months ago.  The Minister replied that the number at the 31st December before his Department was 13,215.  Of these, the number waiting over one year was 4,536, over two years 1,237, <Col N="1264" /> over three years 379 and over four years 29.  I think the 29 who are waiting four years must be in my constituency.</P>

      <P>The number waiting for telephones has increased by over 2,000.  I am sure the Minister's attention has been drawn to the fact that farmers far out in the country can give up sending their messages by runners or boys on bicycles.</P>
      <P>I see that the Estimate for salaries, wages and allowances is £3,600,000. That is a hangover from the cost of winning Kildare and Cork.  It is the 12 per cent which keeps recurring. People ask us how do we spend all this money; where is it coming from; what is the meaning of it; how can we expend so much?  The Minister coolly comes in here with an original Estimate for £9,633,000 and says he now wants £13,312,000, an extra £3,679,000.  He admits it is for the payment of the ninth round wage increases which were prompted by his own Government before the Kildare and Cork byelections. The people should know that is what they are paying out money for.</P>
      <P>It is good to see the extra £50,000 in Subhead K&mdash;Grant Equivalent to Net Receipts from Broadcasting Licence Fees.  I always find it hard to criticise our broadcasting organisation, or to criticise Radio Éireann, because enlightened officials in Radio Éireann have evidently made it the policy to subsidise the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra and the Radio Éireann Light Orchestra.  That is one of the things we should do, and of which we should be proud.  When we listen to the Light Orchestra we realise that the cost is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was informed outside the House tonight that the Minister would be taking his main Estimate with this Supplementary Estimate.  Now I see he is not.  I shall have another opportunity to take the Minister to task, and try to spur him and the Department on to greater efforts to instal telephones for <Col N="1266" /> the unfortunate people who have been waiting for them for years.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle may rule me out of order, but I want to appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to terminate the dispute in Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.

      <P>I suppose I can mention Radio Éireann because of the £50,000 in additional licence fees.  I <Col N="1267" /> shall have another opportunity later on.  In my opinion the shows on Telefís Éireann are becoming very &ldquo;hamish&rdquo;.  Lately there is too much talk, and I think there is too much Irish although I am not opposed to Irish.  There is no entertainment value in it.  Children who used to watch television are turning it off now and putting on pop records.  People pay to be entertained.  There should be a limit to talk and backchat by professors, and &ldquo;ham&rdquo; Irish shows.  If the shows are good I do not mind, but when you see children turning away from television and putting on pop records, you know they are not impressed by television. The same applies to adults.  I admit that Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann are there for educational purposes as well as entertainment, but people should get a little more of what they like, and pay for.  They are entitled to that.  It is all right to talk about Irish, but only about ten per cent of the people can follow the Irish programmes.  That means that 90 per cent of the people are victimised.  They are the people who keep Telefís Éireann going; not the ten per cent. They want a little more entertainment, and they are paying enough for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the forward-looking policy which he has at last decided to put into operation.  The sooner the better.  In some parts of the country there is no post, or the postal service is very poor.  No telegrams are sent since the 5/- charge was imposed.  That is an exorbitant charge.  It is cheaper to go to a funeral now than to send a telegram. The Minister should reconsider that decision.  I do not mind people being charged a fee for delivery but 5/- is too dear.  He should make an effort to improve the position with the finances at his disposal.  A great many technicians are required in that service if it is to be effective.  The Minister would be giving much-needed employment if he took in young boys from the vocational schools or the technical colleges and gave them the essential training.  It would not take long for them to acquire the skills necessary to lay lines and improve the telephone system.  Since I came into the House today I phoned my home in Belmullet, 200 miles away.  Matters have improved very substantially because I got through in about three minutes against an hour and a half only a year ago, or so.  That is a compliment to the Minister.</P>
      <P>This is a very restricted debate and I do not want to prolong it in any way. When the main Estimate comes before this House, I shall certainly have something to say about Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann, either of which is not giving the country the services one would expect.  There is no excuse for the type of tripe dished out on our television service, which is imported from America or some foreign country. We have plenty of native talent and it should be employed in the presentation of good Irish shows.  I am sure the Minister knows and feels that as well as I do.  If it should cost more money, go and spend it on them but make Telefís Éireann a symbol of our Irish statehood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let it be shown to the world that at last we have grown up because the tripe <Col N="1269" /> at present dished out from Montrose is something like what one would expect among the Lilliputians or something like that.  The Minister must intervene, even now, and give us decent programmes. Some of them are good but some are pure unadulterated tripe. Furthermore, they are biased in many ways, and biased politically, which is worse: I do not say they are biased in favour of the Government.  The Minister should intervene and see that justice is done to the people who have to pay £5 for their licence, having also paid maybe up to 130 guineas for their set by the time they have made all the payments on the Kathleen Mavourneen. Our people should be treated as adults and not brainwashed by people who want to dish out that type of tripe to us.</P>

      <P>There is not a lot to reply to on the debate on this Supplementary Estimate.  I know that the Deputies are looking forward to the main Estimate which I shall introduce as soon as possible.  Opening the debate for Fine Gael, Deputy Crotty seemed to think that provision should be made in the main Estimate for the increases in salaries and wages to the staffs in the Post Office.  He seemed to think that nothing more is concerned in this matter but the ninth round.  At the time, we did not know what wage increases would cost us. There were status claims to be dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme, as well as the ordinary ninth round applications.  I did make provision at the time for the payment of wage increases by increasing the postal charges and Deputies opposite made the welkin ring in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would advise Deputies to have a look at the other side of this account.

    <P>The Estimate for Defence for 1965/ 1966 is for a net sum of £10,440,700, which is an increase of £925,200 over the amount voted for the financial year 1964/65, not taking into account the <Col N="1273" /> Supplementary Estimate of £1,954,600 for that financial year about which I shall be speaking later.  In other words, the Estimate is £1,029,400 lower than the total amount required for 1964/65. In saying this, however, I must not mislead the House.  If the Cyprus operation should continue into 1965/66 &mdash;the present United Nations mandate expires on 26th March next&mdash; additional money will be required for the payment of the allowance associated with overseas services, and that will also be the case with regard to the revised pay scales for the Defence Forces which I shall mention when speaking about the Supplementary Estimate for 1964/65.  No provision has been made for those two matters in the Estimate for 1965/1966, so that I am afraid that a substantial Supplementary Estimate will be necessary later on.  The Estimate, I may add, is based on an average strength of 1,143 officers, 82 cadets and 7,000 other ranks.</P>
    <P>Since the Estimate for 1964/1965 was debated, the last Irish unit to serve with the United Nations Force in the Congo returned home&mdash;in May, 1964. From the time the initial request of the Secretary General of the United Nations was received by the Government in June, 1960, no fewer than 5,273 officers and men of Na Buan Óglaigh served in the 12 units and in the Headquarters staff elements which made up the Irish contingents of the Force over a period of almost four years.  Some of the personnel mentioned served on more than one occasion, giving a total of 6,335 separate periods of service.  Bearing in mind the size of our armed forces and the size of the country, our contribution must rank as proportionately one of the highest made to the United Nations.  Our thanks are due to all the thousands of our men who volunteered to serve the cause of the United Nations and who served that cause so faithfully and so well in the Congo.  I think it is a wonderful tribute to the spirit of the Defence Forces that every time a unit was being organised, more than enough volunteers were available.  Our renewed sympathy is extended to the families and relatives of the 26 gallant members <Col N="1274" /> of our contingents who died in the service of peace, and we hope that their sacrifice will not have been in vain. We should not forget, either, the many who were wounded in action and who have had in some cases to tread the difficult path of rehabilitation and resettlement.</P>
    <P>In thanking the Government for the contribution made by this country to the Force in the Congo, the Secretary General of the United Nations, speaking in relation to our soldiers, said: &ldquo;In their service in the Congo, they have faced many forms of difficulty and danger and have always had to exercise the severest restraint and understanding, no matter how great the provocation or how ominous the risk.  In performing their unusual and demanding duties in the Congo, they have been pioneers in international peace-keeping and have written a new and most important chapter in the history of this art.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The resolution to contribute troops to the United Nations Force in Cyprus was debated in the House last April and Deputies will be aware of our continuing commitments in the field of peace-keeping.  Indeed it happened that, for a short period last year, we had contingents serving in Cyprus and the Congo simultaneously, while we also had, and continue to have, a number of officers serving in the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in Palestine.  Last April, a battalion of 600 men and a small number of staff for the Headquarters of the United Nations Force were sent to Cyprus.  Not long afterwards the Secretary-General called for a further Irish unit, and when our commitments in the Congo ended this unit of 400 men was also supplied.  Since August last we have, therefore, had a contingent of something over 1,000 men with the United Nations Force there.</P>
    <P>The difficult situation in that troubled country is so well known that it requires no description by me.  It underlines, however, the hazardous task with which our troops were faced and the necessity for the exercise by them of strict impartiality in their dealings with the people of Cyprus.  I <Col N="1275" /> am happy to say that all the reports I have received indicate that the Irish units are doing a fine job.  Discipline and morale are of a very high standard and the health of the troops is excellent. Over the past five years, the Army has built up a tradition of service in peace-keeping operations which has brought credit to our troops and to the nation.</P>
    <P>Our Defence Forces have, since the end of the last emergency, been relatively small.  The contribution made to the United Nations placed an added burden of duty on the staffs and men at home.  This added work was accepted cheerfully and executed efficiently and this in itself stands as one of the greatest tributes to the morale and stability of the Defence Forces.  Not the least difficult task was the maintenance of efficient training arrangements for An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  The FCA and its naval counterpart, An Slua Muiri, make up two-thirds of our total strength, and the personnel of these voluntary bodies deserve our admiration and respect.  I would encourage them, and like them encouraged, to avail of the facilities afforded by week-end and annual training camps to maintain their standard of efficiency.</P>
    <P>It is my pleasant duty again to express my appreciation of the publicspirited activities of many individuals and firms who organised and provided comforts for our troops overseas.  The organisers of this valuable work came together spontaneously when the Congo operation started in 1960.  Since then their efforts have never ceased nor has their enthusiasm flagged.  By their work they provide a valuable channel through which persons and firms who so desire can express, in a practical way, their appreciation of and goodwill towards our troops overseas.</P>
    <P>At home, normal activities continued in many and various ways, to some of which the House would no doubt like me to refer particularly.  A third helicopter was received, and the Helicopter Service was fully operational throughout the last year.  The primary purpose of the helicopters is <Col N="1276" /> to carry out air/sea rescue work and to render assistance as may be required in other emergencies.  This primary function must take precedence over any other use.  Negotiations are however, at present being conducted with the Department of Health with a view to the establishment of a helicopter ambulance service for conveying emergency medical cases, such as brain injury and spinal injury cases, from outlying hospitals to Dublin hospitals.  The helicopters have also been used on a few occasions for spotting purposes in fishery protection, but their use in this sphere is limited since they cannot make an arrest or fix the position of foreign fishing vessels with the accuracy required by the courts. Deputies may be interested to know that in the last year, for sea/air rescue purposes, the Service was alerted on 16 occasions, carried out twelve searches and made two actual rescues. Other missions included bringing a patient to hospital, ferrying medical equipment and quite a large number of demonstrations.</P>
    <P>While speaking about the helicopter service, I may say that a major problem facing the Air Corps is the difficulty of retaining experienced technicians in service.  There is a great demand for these technicians in outside employment, because of the excellent training they receive, and in 1964, the Corps lost 92 technicians, as against an apprentice intake of 39.  I have drawn attention in previous years to the worthwhile openings provided by the Apprentice Training Schools at Naas and Baldonnel, which are recognised by the trade unions to the extent that personnel trained and qualified under these schemes may be accepted as journeymen and, on return to civil life, admitted as trade union members. I would like to see young people taking every advantage of these valuable schemes.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service continued its fishery protection duties during the year but, due to the shortage of key personnel to man the vessels, it is possible to keep only one vessel operational. Here again, recruitment is not keeping pace with wastage.  The extension of fishing limits provided for in the <Col N="1277" /> Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act, 1964, raises the whole question of the adequacy of our fishing protection service.  This question is being very thoroughly investigated, but it is one to which there is no easy solution.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the training of pilots for Aer Lingus is continuing at Gormanston Camp, and the third trainee class commenced training in December last.  Another scheme which is progressing well is that for the training of young fishermen at Haulbowline, where they are accommodated and learn subjects such as seamanship and navigation, in conjunction with further instruction at Cobh Technical School. The scheme is sponsored by the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>During 1964, two riders and four horses of An Scoil Eachaíochta formed part of mixed military/civilian teams which represented Ireland in the international shows at London and Dublin. Teams from An Scoil also competed at 26 provincial shows and 25 gymkhana during the year.  It is expected that Army riders and horses will compete in mixed teams at international shows at Nice, Rome, London and Dublin in 1965.  Either a mixed team or an all-Army team is also likely to compete at shows in Harrisburg, New York and Toronto.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Civil Defence Organisation has continued to develop satisfactorily during the past year.  According to returns submitted by the local authorities the total strength of Civil Defence volunteers on 31st December, 1964, was 17,246, which represents an increase of almost 5,000 on the corresponding figure which I gave last year for 31st December, 1963.  This is indeed a most encouraging trend and reflects great credit on all concerned.  It is, I think, also indicative of the continuing and growing awareness of the importance of Civil Defence and the existence of a spirit of unselfishness within the community as a whole.  During the course of visits which I have continued to make throughout the country to see local civil defence activities in progress, I have been struck by the dedicated manner <Col N="1278" /> in which the Civil Defence services in general have been carrying out their work.  They are doing what many unfortunately regard as a thankless job and I cannot praise them too highly for their efforts.</P>
    <P>I thank those Members of the Oireachtas and local authorities who have shown interest in the development of civil defence.  As I said last year, I am again looking forward with confidence to a continued increase in support from the elected representatives of the people so that those volunteers and officials who are actively concerned with civil defence at local level will derive from their support the encouragement which they merit.</P>
    <P>The warden service continues to expand and to attract volunteers who have special aptitudes for local leadership. About 60 per cent of the number of District Wardens required have now been trained.  Training in all the other services continues and members of some of these services have been of assistance to local authorities in local incidents such as fires, accidents, location of missing persons et cetera.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the position of control centres at county, subcounty and regional levels.  Despite the existence of difficulties which I then indicated some progress towards the implementation of proposals for these controls can be reported.  Existing buildings which with certain modifications or adaptations will be suitable as control centres have been selected as county controls in 15 areas.  It is expected that work on a number of these controls will be completed by 31st March, 1966.  In areas where no suitable existing buildings are available a scheme has been evolved for the building of annexes to existing local authority premises.  While these annexes are designed for primary use as control centres, they may also, if required, be used by local authorities for their own needs in peace-time.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the new arrangements which I outlined last year as to the role which members of the Voluntary Aid Societies would play in civil defence, is beginning to show results.  I wish to express my <Col N="1279" /> gratitude to the Heads of Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann.  The St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland, and the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps for their co-operation in agreeing to this new arrangement.  The total strength of the Casualty Service, including the members of the voluntary aid societies, is now about 4,000.</P>
    <P>On the training side there are now 219 training centres throughout the country, that is, 49 additional centres have been opened in the past year. Competitions, exercises, demonstrations, and week-end camps continued to be held by local authorities.  These activities are a most important factor in the development of the Civil Defence Organisation inasmuch as they give added experience to units as a whole and weld the service into a more composite and effective organisation.</P>
    <P>An important development during the year was the extension of Civil Defence measures to Government Departments.  A series of courses for the training of Civil Defence officers and instructors for all Departments of State was commenced with a view to giving instruction in civil defence to Departmental staffs.  The training of instructors for local authorities, Defence Forces, and Garda Síochána continued during the year at An Scoil Cosanta Sibhialta.  A lecture hall and associated improved amenities to which I referred last year are now in use in the School.</P>
    <P>During the past year arrangements were well advanced for the printing of a booklet which sets out in simple terms general information as to the hazards of nuclear warfare and the measures which people could take to mitigate such hazards.  It is hoped to have these booklets issued to every householder within the next few months.</P>
    <P>Looking at the individual subheads, it will be seen that there are substantial increases in all the pay and allowances subheads, A, B, C, D, E and F. During 1964, we had the ninth round increase in remuneration and very big increases in children's allowances and in other allowances such as ration <Col N="1280" /> allowance and travelling and subsistence allowances.  Because of the size of these subheads, all others had been cut to the bone, only the most essential expenditure being provided for.  Indeed, many things which ordinarily we would regard as essential have had to be omitted.  The largest increases are in Subhead M&mdash;Clothing and Equipment, Subhead P&mdash; Naval Stores, Subhead S&mdash;Buildings, Subhead T&mdash;Barrack Services, Subhead Y&mdash;Post Office Services and Subhead DD&mdash;Lands.  The Clothing and Equipment provision of £454,000 includes £200,000 for mobilisation stocks which are being built up.  The initial issue of new type uniform is now almost completed and is an improvement, both in appearance and comfort, on the former one.</P>
    <P>The increase in the Naval Stores subhead is due to a provision of £65,000 for two launches required to maintain communication with Spike Island when the proposed bridge linking Haulbowline with the mainland is completed.  The only passage capable of being navigated at all tides is what is known as the &ldquo;back channel&rdquo;, which will be crossed by the proposed bridge.  Existing launches will not be able to pass under the bridge, so that two new ones will have to be designed and constructed.  The alternative would be to build a bridge with an opening span, and this course was not considered satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The provision for buildings covers a variety of proposed works, including the modernisation of men's billet blocks, modernisation of old type soldiers' married quarters, and further accommodation for An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil in rural areas.  Provision is made for the erection of 20 houses for soldiers in Athlone and for a further six which it is hoped to build in some other area&mdash;possibly Limerick.  These would bring the total built in recent years to 196, and it is intended to continue the policy, to which I have referred previously, of supplementing local authorities' efforts in the provision of housing by providing, from the Vote for Defence, houses for married soldiers at centres throughout the country where there is the greatest <Col N="1281" /> need.  The increased provision in Subhead T, Barrack Services, reflects the increased costs involved in the continuation of the programme of improved dining halls and billets in pursuance of the policy of improving amenities for soldiers living in barracks.</P>
    <P>The increase for Post Office Services &mdash;£33,200&mdash;is something over which we had no control; it reflects the increased cost of postage, telegrams and telephones.  The increased provision of £10,410 in Subhead DD&mdash; Lands&mdash;arises from the proposed acquisition of premises for a Civil Defence Regional Headquarters.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Subheads G&mdash; Civil Defence, J&mdash;Mechanical Transport and 02&mdash;Helicopters are very much reduced.  Civil Defence equipment and stores have been built up very much over a number of years so that, even with the increased training requirements of the expanding organisation, the expenditure in the coming year will be substantially less. As to mechanical transport, large purchases had to be made last year to replace vehicles written off in the Congo, and their replacement is nearing completion.  Most of the heavier type vehicles being purchased are powered by diesel engines, which follows current commercial practice.  In the coming year there will be no capital expenditure on helicopters, and that explains the reduction in the Subhead.</P>
    <P>A provision of £22,000 by way of grant-in-aid to Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann is included under Subhead BB.  This includes a sum of £3,000 for the Emergency Relief Fund.  In the past year assistance amounting to over £2,000 has been given from the Fund to distressed areas in South Korea, Pakistan, the Yemen, South Vietnam, Tunisia and Morocco.  An Cumann continues to maintain the North China refugees at its home, Naomh Aindreas, in Dublin and a sum of £4,250 is provided for this worthy undertaking. Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann continues its excellent humanitarian work and I wish again to express my appreciation of its many and varied activities in the relief of suffering.  In <Col N="1282" /> addition to its other activities An Cumann is this year organising Old People's Year in order to focus the interest of the public on the problems of the old.  Specifically An Cumann, through its various committees throughout the country, expects this year to organise home helps, home nursing and visits to old people.  This undertaking is in keeping with the many humanitarian works on which An Cumann engages and I hope that it will be well supported by the public. Our thanks are due to Cumann Croise Deirge na hÉireann also for the magnificent work being done in the organisation of the country's Freedom from Hunger Campaign.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, arrangements have been made by the Government to provide An Cumann with a more suitable headquarters building. Suitable premises were purchased recently and it is expected that An Cumann will occupy the building this year.</P>
    <P>As regards the Estimate for Army Pensions, the provision is for the sum of £2,377,130, being an increase of £61,4311 over that for 1964/1965, as itself increased by £45,049 transferred from the Vote for Increases in Pensions in respect of the 1964 Budgetary increases.  These increases were 5 per cent on all pensions and allowances, except special allowances.  For special allowance purposes, all &ldquo;appropriate annual sums&rdquo; were increased by £4, which is approximately 5 per cent of the average special allowance.</P>
    <P>As to the Estimate itself, there is very little that I need say, as it follows the usual pattern.  The provisions for retired pay and pensions under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, Subhead E, and for special allowances, Subhead H, continue to increase substantially, while that for military service pensions, Subhead D, shows a further decline, naturally enough, although regrettable, with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>Up to now, budgetary increases in pensions and allowances had been the subject of amending legislation, the consideration of which has been burdensome for both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Arrangements are being <Col N="1283" /> made to deal with such increases, commencing with the 1964 increases, by way of orders or similar instruments which will only have to be laid before each House and which need not be debated unless objection is seen to them in any respect.</P>
    <P>I hope to be able to introduce, in the not too distant future, legislation to bring about some alterations which, I feel sure, will meet with the fullest approval of all Deputies.  The first is that the payment of married pensions and widows' and children's allowances will not depend on the date of marriage, as they do at present, and the second is that where a pensioner with a high degree of pensionable disability dies, his widow and children will be eligible for allowances, even if it is not clearly established that he died of his pensionable disability.</P>
    <P>These proposals will be incorporated in a Bill with some others not of the same importance&mdash;tidying-up provisions, so to speak&mdash;following which I hope that we can go ahead with the consolidation of the Army Pensions Acts, something that has been long desired.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Defence for the year 1964/1965 is for a net sum of £1,954,600 and, as Deputies will see from the details given, it arises almost entirely from increases in pay and allowances and the expenses of the Cyprus operation. The ninth round increases, which affected salaries, wages, pay and marriage allowance, came into operation as from 1st February, 1964, and as no provision had been made for them in the Vote for 1964/1965, this Supplementary Estimate now makes the necessary provision as regards the Defence Forces, the Civil Service staff of the Department of Defence and civilians employed with the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It also covers other substantial increases&mdash;particularly in children's allowances&mdash;which came into force during the year with retrospective effect.  Lastly, revised salary scales have been coming into operation for <Col N="1284" /> Civil Service grades for some time past with effect from 1st January, 1964, and revised scales are about to be introduced for the Defence Forces with effect from the same date.  The Supplementary Estimate also provides for the cost of these up to the end of the year 1964/1965.</P>
    <P>Deputies are already aware of the financial arrangements applying to the supply of Irish contingents to the United Nations Force in Cyprus.  As the Minister for External Affairs reminded the House recently, this country has declined to accept reimbursement of the customary United Nations allowances for our troops because the Cyprus operation is being financed from a voluntary fund rather than one contributed to by all the member States as part of their regular assessment.  Nevertheless, we regard our costs as a debt due to us by the United Nations and we intend to keep pressing for repayment.</P>
    <P>The two principal items of Cyprus expenditure for which the Supplementary Estimate provides are £337,826 overseas allowances and per diem allowances for members of our contingents and £257,500 for the purchase of equipment.  As to equipment, the main purchase consisted of 16 Panhard armoured cars, eight of which were acquired in 1963/1964 and the others during the present financial year, the total cost being in the region of £415,000.  Of this, the sum of £156,000 approximately was met from the Vote for 1963/1964 and this Supplementary Estimate now provides, at Subhead H, for the balance of £257,500.  It is our intention, of course, that these armoured cars will be brought back to Ireland when the Cyprus operation ends, and they will form a valuable addition to our defensive equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may say all he wants.  He should not take my advice, though, if he does not like to.  There is one point, of course, on which I must agree with the Minister. We are indeed proud of our troops who have served in the Congo and who are now serving in Cyprus.  They have rendered signal honour to themselves and to their country.  As far as I can ascertain, their personal conduct has been of a very high order and the number of reports of falls from grace are few.  For that we must be thankful.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, there is much one would like to say on the entire question.  The Minister mentioned at the end of his statement that we were not accepting a reimbursement from the United Nations because the payment was being made from a voluntary fund.  I do not see why we should take that line. We are not a wealthy country that should readily undertake such a heavy burden, especially in view of the fact that we have responsibilities at home which apparently cannot be met because of financial stringency in other directions.  We are told our troops may be required there for a considerable time, that though the UN mandate ends in March, they may be required for a longer period.  I subscribe to the view that if they are required, we must meet our obligations. When the Minister for Defence and the Minister for External Affairs tell us they will continue to regard the cost as a debt against the United Nations, I feel they are speaking tongue in cheek.  How they will make Russia and the rest of them pay up is something I cannot understand.  However, it is a good thing to have them so optimistic about getting payment.  The position is a difficult one, I admit, but we should not bear a burden out of proportion to our resources, and this burden is out of proportion to our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister and the Government have accepted the view that marriage allowances should be paid to widows and officers, NCOs and men, irrespective of the date of marriage. This is something near to my heart.  I am glad, too, that the principle is now being recognised and accepted that <Col N="1286" /> disability is a reasonable ground justifying the payment of an allowance to the widow of a pensioner.  That will create some difficulties not only for the present Government but for succeeding Governments but it is a principle that should have been accepted at all times. I am glad the Minister proposes to introduce legislation to remedy the present position.  There are, of course, cases where death took place some years ago.  Will those cases be covered or is it only cases in the future that will be covered?  In my opinion, all surviving widows should be covered in the legislation.  When we can be generous with the United Nations and spend money for prestige, we should admit our liability in this regard and accept liability in full.</P>
    <P>With regard to military service pensions, the position is not at all satisfactory. A person in receipt of a small pension gets an increase of £4 per annum.  Deputies are expected to defend that at a time when their own allowances have been increased by 50 per cent.  It is impossible to make a case for this paltry increase.  These certificates held by military service pensioners show clearly they were the people who helped to establish the State.  Now the Government make a grant of £4 and say it is an adequate increase.  It is a source of grave embarrassment to me and I am sure it is a source of grave embarrassment to many Deputies sitting behind the Government.  Why they tolerate it I do not know.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this represents approximately five per cent on the average.  Some of the awards made are ridiculous sums like £7. 10/- and £8 a year.  Add £4 to that.  It may mean a 55 or 60 per cent increase on the existing pension.  It all goes to show how very misleading percentages can be.  I should be glad to learn from the Minister if the Government have considered the matter and what the proposals are.  There is no reason why these pensions should not be increased by a reasonable amount.</P>
    <P>Special allowances and medals can be very disconcerting.  To give an example; an applicant applies for a medal; it is held the one he has was <Col N="1287" /> not duly awarded; his case is reinvestigated when practically every officer of his company is dead; it is then referred to battalion officers; at least 50 per cent of those battalion officers are also dead and the only officers in the area are people who became officers after 11th July.  They are taken as proper persons for service between 1st April, 1921, and 11th July, 1921.  The evidence of the section commander is rejected.</P>
    <P>In another case an applicant with a medal applies for a special allowance. The question of whether or not it is duly awarded is investigated.  This applicant was known by two different names.  Nobody knew him as John X but everybody knew him by a nickname. I saw him in action.  I know he was there when I was arrested.  He was on duty when I was leaving and he was there when I came back.  I was away from early March until August and I cannot certify that anybody was serving during that period, but it is common knowledge that certain people were.  Yet, my certificate is not acceptable for service between 1st April, 1921 and 11th July, 1921.  All I can say is that I believe the applicant was there, but that is not good enough.  When an officer who lives several miles away from that applicant is asked about the person, he does either of two things: he writes back and says he knows nothing about him, or he ignores it altogether.  One is as bad as the other. Then the evidence is inconclusive and he is rejected.</P>
    <P>I got a company captain's affidavit for this person, showing that he served in the new company to which he was transferred.  Yet he was rejected because, I can only assume, somebody made a statement to the contrary. Otherwise, I assume the company captain's evidence would be accepted. I should like to know the rank and appointment of that other person, but I cannot get it because these matters are confidential.  If I am asked for a certificate for the Minister for Defence and I want to denigrate the person concerned, all I have to do is to say I do not know anything about him.  The Minister has no opportunity of getting <Col N="1288" /> information as to who said that.  While these matters may be confidential, the time has come when the Minister should establish some machinery by which evidence could be taken verbally from people in a position to certify service and the applicant should have the right to call witnesses.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter.  It can deprive a person entitled to the medal or the special allowance, which ranges from as low as £25 or less to as much as £130 or £140 per year.  If I slander or libel somebody and do so much damage, I can be sued.  Here, apparently, I can say with impunity something to the detriment of the applicant. The Minister would be well advised to have this matter reexamined. I know how it all came about and I am aware of the difficulties. I know there were, and I suppose, will be, grave abuses.  There is no doubt about that whatever.  But I would prefer to have five per cent or ten per cent abuses in order to make sure that even one person entitled would succeed.  There is no reason why a person should be denied his rights for the purpose of catching out the five per cent or ten per cent guilty of abuses.</P>
    <P>I know how it came about, but I do not want to go into it.  There was, I regret to say, some political activity in it.  The present Minister was not involved in any way; neither was I myself, nor my colleague who was Minister for Defence at that time.  A situation arose in which people had got forms signed, and then they were given out blank.  That had to be guarded against.  I agree it is not easy. That led to the situation where medals which had been issued had to be reinvestigated. But that was 14 years ago and the circumstances have changed considerably since.  The roll call 14 years ago was much higher than it is today.  The Minister says very correctly that the bill for military service pensions is falling every day. That is true.  Time, the great reaper, is taking his toll.  In a few short years, there will be no more medal holders or special allowances.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to establish some machinery by which <Col N="1289" /> even late applicants for a medal will have the opportunity of bringing people to be examined on oath in support of their claim.  I do not see any other way out of it.  The Minister or the referee or adjudicating officer, such as in old age pension cases, could take the evidence of people who had a military service certificate, and were in a position to know who had served in a certain area, as substantiating the claim.  Equally, it would be legitimate for them to say to the Minister that they would not give evidence because the evidence they would give would be against the applicant.  The referee would then know that the evidence was not available.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant for a medal has applied for a military service certificate, under either the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act, and there is evidence on the file before the referee to show membership during the qualifying period, that should be sufficient to warrant the issue of the medal, even though the service was not of the nature and duration as would entitle him to a certificate of service.  Since the special allowance is for membership, it does establish the membership beyond yea or nay.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that these files are not available to him.  It is amazing that, if a file is to the disadvantage of a member of the IRA, it is available to the Attorney General or somebody to prosecute him; but it is not available if it is to his advantage.  I submit where that is available and where the name is on the list, there should be no question about it.  While the lists were being submitted from every area, there was a proviso that they were as accurate as they could be made at the time, but that omissions might have taken place.  There was always the proviso that there was sufficient evidence that the name should be put on the list.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the main Estimate, this expenditure is high but of course the main increase is for pay and allowances and it shows, with the cost of food and rations, and the increase for telephone services, just exactly how much the cost of living has increased. If you were to search any record, you <Col N="1290" /> could not get a better example than this.  It sets out the increases in rations, clothing, food and fuel and telegraph and postal services.  It is an amazing document, setting out in such detail just what the cost of living is in every section.</P>
    <P>There is a Supplementary Estimate for last year, that is, the year 1964/65. We are getting a reduction which will not be repeated apparently this year but it may, as the Minister says, if the Cyprus operation continues.  But it is a very large sum for 1,143 officers, 82 cadets and 7,000 other ranks, a large sum indeed.  I think there ought to be some revision of the whole question of services and how best we can have a defence force available to meet the nation's requirements.  Were it not for the F.C.A., and the Civil Defence forces, throughout the country, we would be in a poor enough condition. I want to join with the Minister in congratulating and thanking the members of the Civil Defence service for their patriotic work and the enduring and unselfish service they render.</P>
    <P>On the question of getting recruits or volunteers for the Congo or Cyprus, while it was encouraging to see the large numbers who volunteered, I am afraid there was a slight monetary consideration involved as well.  The benefits are fairly substantial.  I do not know that when these boys&mdash; officers, NCOs and men&mdash;return, after having enjoyed increased pay and allowances for a long period abroad, they will be agreeable to serve on at home for a much lesser figure and I think the Minister and the Government will be up against a certain problem, but I hope they will be able to get over it.</P>
    <P>These men, as I say, have rendered great service and have done honour to the country and it is too bad that in the rendering of services of that nature, we had to have our casualties and our dead and wounded.  It is only right and fitting that any person speaking on this Vote should extend the sympathy of not only the Party to which he belongs but also his own sympathy to the relatives and families of these officers, NCOs and men who gave their lives in this service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> I am glad to know, and I am sure the Minister would not say it if it were not true, that our Irish troops have shown that gift of patience to which he referred in their handling of the situation in Cyprus and in the Congo. It must have been exasperating at times and we all know patience is not one of our great virtues.  We can be very short-tempered and uncomplimentary to each other and it is something I am glad to know has been inculcated into that body of men who are serving abroad and who are doing that fine job of peacekeeping.</P>
    <P>I say the United Nations have a responsibility to meet their obligations in the matter, and I wish the Government success in pressing that payment be made for this debt for the fine work done.  It is a comfort and a consolation to know that a number of industrial firms and private individuals have contributed to the sending of gifts to the troops serving abroad.  While it is something for which we must be very grateful to these firms and individuals, and we are grateful to them for their generosity, I do not think it is fitting that we should have to do that.  If these men are serving the cause of peace for an international body such as the United Nations, surely it should be covered by ample pay, and arrangements should be made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations for their entertainment and the comforts that are being provided by firms and private individuals.</P>
    <P>I am glad the helicopter service has been a success.  Even though it may not have had a large number of spectacular rescues, the fact that it has even one successful rescue justifies the expenditure. I hope the helicopters will not be wanted, but it is a great thing to have them on hand if they are wanted. That is the all-important thing.</P>
    <P>On the question of the naval forces, the protection of our fisheries and patrol boats, I think the time has come when the Government must examine that whole matter, and take steps to get smaller, lighter and swifter patrol <Col N="1292" /> boats.  I believe there have been demonstrations of such craft which could be purchased at a reasonable figure and which could be manned by a small number of naval personnel, which would be very effective.  As we have extended the fisheries limit to 12 miles, it is ridiculous to expect one naval vessel to be able to patrol the whole coastline.  The British Navy was not able to do it.  While one is insufficient, I suppose ten would also be insufficient but at least they would be ten times better than one.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Minister and the Government to review the whole situation.  While there was a time when service in the Navy was enticing, the old saying &ldquo;Join the Navy and see the World&rdquo; does not apply to our type of service.  The essential thing is to have the inducement of higher pay.  There is no use comparing what they have in Britain or anywhere else with what we have. If we make the pay attractive enough we will get the volunteers.  As long as they can get service in foreign countries, that inducement will be too great for them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the training of pilots by our Air Corps is proceeding well.  This should be extended because I am informed that we still have to call on foreign personnel for some pilots for Aer Lingus.  The greater the number trained the greater will be our reserve and the better the service we will be able to give to Aer Lingus who have so much work to do.</P>
    <P>In regard to mechanics in the Air Corps, there is, I admit, a great difficulty. A boy enters the Air Corps and undertakes to serve his time, become a trained mechanic and give so many years service to the Corps, but when the pay is not as high as he can get outside, the enticement to leave is very great.  The only answer is to provide higher pay.  In this way we will get rid of wastage and build up recruitment, as shown by the Minister in his speech.  I have already referred to Civil Defence and the service being rendered by the personnel in that service.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Army School of <Col N="1293" /> Equitation is going well and it is satisfactory to learn that the mixed teams have had such success both at home and abroad, but I do not know exactly what the Minister means when he says that either a mixed team or an allArmy team will compete in Harrisburg, New York and Toronto.  He should be able at this stage to say which sort of team will compete.  I should also like to know how the Equitation School regard their horses. Are they satisfied with them?  Do they feel they are up to the required standard? Are they getting the necessary training?  I know that both the younger and older officers desire to give of their best and I have no complaint to make in that regard but I had experience of having excellent and dedicated officers but who lacked something.  We had to get the expert training for them.  The Minister may be faced with that problem also.  I have deliberately avoided making any inquiry about that because last year I did so and the Minister misunderstood my intention.  My inquiries were not intended as a criticism of anybody but were for the purpose of assisting. However, I did not inquire this year, nor do I intend to, but as I hope there will be a change of Government at some future date, somebody will be able to tell me if I am not able to inquire myself.</P>
    <P>The Red Cross, together with the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the Knights of Malta continue to play a very important part and render valuable service but I should like to say that these three organisations are not satellites of Fianna Fáil but are national organisations.  They are not to be taken over as if, from the President of each organisation down, they belonged to Fianna Fáil.  The actions of some people appear at times to sustain that idea.  I do not want them to be tinged in any way with that political brush.  The training centres are operating well and I hope people will realise that civil defence is for the nation's protection and welfare in case of the worst.  God forbid that that should happen but there is an old saying that God helps those who help themselves.  I am glad that the provision <Col N="1294" /> of halls throughout the country is being extended and perhaps these could be utilised for other purposes as well.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I am pleased with the conduct of the Army both at home and abroad.  The new uniform and beret appear to be an improvement but I am not sure that the cloth is superior to the old cloth in the matter of keeping out the cold.  I saw troops yesterday, both here in Dublin and in the country, and they certainly were cold.  Of course, I think they were kept too long standing in both places.  Somehow I got the impression, while the uniform looks smarter, it was not as warm and as comfortable as the old one at this time of the year. I do not know why I got that particular point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us the Estimate is being cut to the bone after all pay and allowances, under the various subheads, have been deducted.  The only large increase is in respect of clothing, equipment and naval stores.  It really strikes me as amazing that the increase under the naval subhead is due to the provision of £65,000 for two launches to maintain communications with Spike Island when the proposed bridge linking Haulbowline with the mainland is completed.  We have to buy two boats to maintain communications for ourselves because we are to build a bridge to suit Irish Steel.  I wonder have the Government looked into the economics of that?  Haulbowline may be the cheapest for ground rent and all that sort of thing and the factory is sited there&mdash;I suppose I should refer to this on the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote&mdash;but it is an amazing situation that we have to buy two launches to keep these communications with Spike Island.  We are building the bridge at Haulbowline, which as I say, is to facilitate Irish Steel Limited.  That is a matter which can be dealt with again at a later stage and I suppose we can get some particulars of it from the Minister for Industry and Commerce when his Vote comes up.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is that am glad the Government are continuing to build married quarters for their <Col N="1295" /> married Officers, NCOs and men, If, during the years gone by, any substantial sum was spent on building houses for our military and naval personnel, we would now have an asset, according to present day prices, of triple the value.  However, it is good to know even at this late stage there is to be an increase and an improvement in the building of houses for them.  The great difficulty is that in a town where the baracks is situated, the local authority do not wish to give military personnel the tenancy of a house.  It is equally hard, for some reason or another, for either the serving personnel or a member of the Forces who retires to get a house in local authority areas.  Even though you write and say this person has served in the Defence Forces and prior to this served in the IRA, and what not, it does not appear to get him a house.</P>
    <P>I shall finish on that point because I feel the housing of the troops, the barrack and billet services, their maintenance and the cooking arrangements are improving.  I should like to see them improving further because I suggest that with proper accommodation for personnel today, you have a contented army.  While I have no doubt they are contented they could be even more contented with suitable quarters. A suitable place for amusement would keep them out of the public house, to which, let me say, I have no objection. It is a great advantage to have these amenities within their own barrack gates.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker, I, too, would like to say we are all very proud of the way our troops have behaved abroad.  Of course, we expected them to behave that way. They simply carried on the proud tradition of the Irish soldier.  It was too bad that lives were lost but that is the fortune of war.  I am very glad there has been no casualty in Cyprus.  It is regrettable that one person has died, but apart from that, so far, we have had no casualties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the number of people who have served in  the Congo <Col N="1296" /> and Cyprus seems to be extraordinary, considering the strength of the Defence Forces here.  It makes one wonder whether the Minister considers there is any necessity for a standing force in this country.  Quite a substantial number of regular Army personnel have been abroad for the past few years.  I would suggest to him&mdash;it is a personal view&mdash;that the United Nations should now be asked to get some other country to do their share because I suggest we have done more than our share.</P>

      <P>The question of whether payment is to be made from the voluntary fund of the United Nations is a matter of principle.  I do not agree with Deputy MacEoin that it makes no difference how it is paid so long as it is paid.  I consider the Government are perfectly right in their attitude that the debt is owed by the United Nations and it would be unwise to accept payment from the voluntary fund which is being set up.  I also feel there is very little hope of getting this money from Russia or France, who have no intention of paying.  It will be a complete write-off.  That is all the more reason for saying at this stage we have done our share.  Nobody could blame this country for saying that now.</P>
      <P>I know quite a lot of our troops have volunteered for service abroad. Why have they done that?  First of all, they would like to see a bit of the world.  Secondly, they felt the onus was on them to volunteer when asked to do so.  Thirdly&mdash;this is the most important&mdash;they would get more money.  It is rather ridiculous that while we are prepared to give additional money to a substantial number who go abroad, we are not prepared to give a decent wage to those at home.  The Minister may say they got the ninth round.  How does the rate being paid to Irish soldiers at present compare with the rate paid in outside employment?  Is it not true there is no comparison at all?  Is it any wonder the young man in the country thinks twice or three times before he decides to join the Army and then usually decides he will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> I would particularly refer to the fact that the people in the Army are of the very best type.  The Minister should now do something&mdash;it was suggested many times before&mdash;to see that the district justices are told the Army is no place for young blackguards who come before them.  They are recommended to join the Army as part of their sentences.</P>

      <P>I know that, but I am <Col N="1298" /> making the point the district justices should not be allowed to continue to say that they will give them a suspended sentence if they join the Army. It gives the impression that the Army is the place where people can get a remission of sentence.</P>
