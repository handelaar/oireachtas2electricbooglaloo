      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 12, 4, 13&mdash;Votes 40 and 37. If not already reached, it is proposed to interrupt business between 1 and 2.30 to take No. 13&mdash;Vote 37&mdash;and to resume the order after questions taking No. 13&mdash;Vote 40&mdash;first.

      <P>I wonder would it be possible for the Taoiseach, even if it is not feasible, to announce at this stage, the programme for the rest of the session, at least to give an indication for a reasonable period ahead? I do not know whether the Taoiseach is aware that there is a sheaf of revised Estimates which, I imagine, arise out of changes in the Budget.  It is difficult at this stage to say whether or not these will require to be discussed again.</P>

      <P>The Industry and Commerce Estimate is certainly a revised one.  At present it is difficult to plan with any reasonable assurance on the basis of what will be taken from week to week.  Could the Taoiseach ensure that at least we could settle the business for possibly a fortnight or three weeks ahead and let the other business follow?</P>

    <Title>Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Bill, 1965 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The County Borough of Cork (Extension of Boundary) Order, 1965, provides for changes in the Cork city boundary for the purpose of taking into the city certain adjoining areas of the county.  The Order requires the confirmation of the Oireachtas.  The object of this Bill is to secure such confirmation. The Bill was before the House on Second Stage prior to the dissolution and has been restored to the Order Paper by Resolution of the House.  On the passing of the Bill the Provisional Order will become effective from a date to be determined by Order of the Minister.  The present objective is to make the extension effective on 1st July this year.</P>
      <P>In essence the case for a review of the existing boundary is that the city has outgrown its present administrative limits.  The question of extending those limits has been considered on and off for many years.  There was a minor extension in 1955 the chief effect of which was to take into the city land on which the corporation had already built houses.  Otherwise there has been no change since the boundary was established in 1840 despite the great growth in the built-up area since then. The extent of the suburban growth over the years is reflected in the fact that almost one-third of the population of the built-up area at present lives outside the city limits.  This growth is due in no small measure to slum clearance and re-housing operations by the corporation itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city and its suburbs are an urban unit and the administrative boundary should reasonably reflect this unity.  In practice the unity of the Cork built-up area has been recognised for a number of legal and administrative purposes including health services, planning, water supply and fire-fighting <Col N="2089" /> services and, to an extent, local elections. Indeed, most local government services are best and most efficiently administered on a unified basis in a large urban area.</P>
    <P>Most people who live in the suburbs are people who work in the city and their dependants.  They number about 35,000 in all.  Socially and economically these people are orientated towards the city rather than towards the county.  They enjoy the benefits of city living, including the specialist shopping, commercial, social and recreational facilities which are normally to be found in the central area. These people have a right to a say in city affairs.  The city has a right to expect them to contribute to the cost of the services it provides.</P>
    <P>The corporation has all the problems which particularly beset a local authority in a large urban area&mdash;the problems of housing, water and sewerage services, traffic circulation and carparking, public lighting and other amenities, health and social welfare services.  In addition, there are some special problems.  For example, the proportion of the population housed by the corporation is high and is likely to increase further as the housing programme develops.  The corporation maintain that because the built-up areas on the perimeter are outside their rating jurisdiction it is not possible for them to provide and maintain the full range of services which the people in a modern city expect the local authority to provide.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Provisional Order did not come into force on 1st April as was originally envisaged operates in favour of the county council.  In effect the proposed boundary extension will make no difference in the rating areas in the current financial year.  The county council will receive the rate revenue of the extension areas for the full year even though they will not have to provide services there once the extension becomes effective.  The corporation on the other hand will have to provide services in the extension areas from the date of the extension but will not have the benefit of the corresponding rate income.  No doubt the <Col N="2090" /> corporation will feel that this situation ought to be considered in due course in the financial settlement, but from the county council's point of view the position is that there will be no increased rate burden on the county ratepayers this year as a result of the extension. The county council will indeed make a considerable &ldquo;profit&rdquo; from the extension areas, in the current year. It follows also that the county council can rely on the rate revenue from the extension areas to meet the relevant part of the expenses of the Cork Health Authority in 1965-66 and that the problem which had previously arisen in this regard no longer exists.</P>
    <P>The county council are not in favour of the proposed extension because they do not like to see the rateable valuation of their area reduced.  There is also the point that the extension may mean an increased rate burden on the ratepayers in the rest of the county in future years.  To meet this point, and to enable arrangements to be made in regard to financial matters generally, there is provision in Article 6 of the Order for a financial adjustment between the county council and the corporation in any matter that requires to be adjusted between them in consequence of the boundary extension. Compensation will be paid to the council in respect of any increased rate burden thrown on the county ratepayers by the extension.  The compensation, which may amount to as much as ten times the annual amount of the increased rate burden, may be paid in one sum or in instalments.  Instalments would carry interest in respect of the deferred payments.  It has been suggested that the proposed provision for compensation for added rate burden is less favourable to the county than the treatment given to the Dublin county ratepayers when the Dublin city boundary was extended in 1953.  I would like to make it clear that this is not so. In the Dublin case in question the financial consequences of the extension were agreed between the two authorities concerned.  It was agreed that compensation for added rate burden would be paid to the county for each year for fifteen years, but there was no provision for payment of interest.  In the present <Col N="2091" /> case if compensation is paid in one sum it will be open to the county council to invest that amount and to earn interest on it.  Alternatively, a settlement payable in stages and based on ten times the annual increase in rate burden with interest in respect of the deferred payments, would be no less favourable and might be more favourable than a settlement based on fifteen times the annual increase in burden with no provision for interest.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the financial aspects of the proposed extension in a meeting with the Cork Senators and Deputies and, as a result, the county council and corporation agreed to open negotiations on the financial settlement.  It is my hope that a large measure of agreement on the financial matters will be reached through negotiations.  If an area of disagreement should remain the Order provides that a final settlement will be made by me on the application of either party.  If the matter should come before me in accordance with this procedure a decision will be taken with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>In the light of this situation I see no reason why, following the extension, the county ratepayers should have to meet any expenses which would not have arisen for them if there had been no boundary adjustment.</P>
    <P>The extension of the boundary was the subject of a petition by the corporation under section 25 of the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act, 1941.</P>
    <P>There was a protracted public inquiry locally into the corporation's petition at which the corporation and county council as well as other interested parties made detailed submissions. The extension proposed is, I think a reasonable compromise between the conflicting views expressed. The corporation sought to take in a total area of 9,590 acres of the county, exclusive of a large area which is subject to tidal cover.  The land which would be taken into the city under the Provisional Order is made up of three separate areas, a total of 6,278 acres apart from certain tidal areas.  They include on the east of the existing boundary the townlands of Ballina-mought <Col N="2092" /> East and Lotabeg and the land between the rivers Lee and Douglas; on the south the lands north of the Tramore and Glasheen rivers; on the west most of the townlands of Ballinaspig, Inchigaggin and Knocknaheeney, and on the north the townlands of Commons and Kilnap and portions of Kilbarry and Ballyvolane townlands.</P>
    <P>In general, areas which are developed, or on which building is likely to take place soon, will be taken in as well as a reasonable margin for further city expansion in the future. Areas such as Douglas and Donnybrook, which are built-up but which retain a certain social or historical identity, will not be taken in.  It is important that the city should be given room to expand within the administrative boundary.  This concerns the people in the city and in the suburbs, but it also concerns the whole county and region.  As the second largest city in the State, Cork is the centre of an area of substantial industrial, commercial and social growth.  If the city is to maintain its prominent position and to develop as a major centre of economic and social advancement in the region, it is important that the local authority should be in a position to plan for the development of the urban area as a whole and should have reasonable room for the accommodation of further expansion at the perimeter.</P>
    <P>This is not to suggest that an indiscriminate sprawl of the built-up area is to be encouraged.  The corporation will be expected to make proper use of the new powers conferred on them by the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to ensure that the future expansion of the city will be well planned and well balanced.  I have already brought to the attention of the corporation the wide scope and urgent need for tackling the problem of obsolete areas in the city and for promoting the renewal of such areas as provided for in the Act.  Only by full use of their new powers of positive planning in relation to development both in the central and the suburban areas of the city can the corporation hope to create civic and environmental <Col N="2093" /> standards befitting a city of the size and stature of Cork.</P>
    <P>There is at present a considerable margin between the rate level in the city and in the adjoining county area. It is recognised that it might involve hardship for some people in the proposed added areas if the rate in the £ there were adjusted to the level of the city rate immediately on the corporation becoming the rating authority for these areas in 1966-67.  I suggested to the corporation, therefore, that this adjustment should be spread over a number of years and the corporation have agreed to this.  The Order provides in Article 14 and the Second Schedule that the rates on property in the added areas will be scaled up to the level of the city rate gradually by annual increments over five years. Agricultural land brought into the city will no longer qualify for the agricultural grant.  Instead the valuation on such land will be reduced by 50 per cent and, in addition, the gradual adjustment process by which the gap between the city and county rates will be bridged over five years will apply to agricultural land also.</P>
    <P>The county council would like to see the site of the proposed new council offices excluded from the extension area.  This site is well within the proposed new boundary.  It is not practicable in a broad adjustment like this to fix a new boundary by reference to the effect on particular properties or sites, which for one reason or another it might be said should not be included in the city.  Any attempt to do this would give an inconsistent and irregular result.  The headquarters of both Dublin and Limerick county councils are situated in the adjoining county boroughs and it is true of county councils in general that their head offices are outside their rating jurisdiction being located in the county town.</P>
    <P>The Order contains a number of miscellaneous provisions arising from the proposed boundary extension. There is provision for the preparation by the Commissioner of Valuation of new city maps; for continuing in operation county council resolutions and orders where appropriate; for <Col N="2094" /> arrangements in regard to jurors books, registers of electors, employment and hours of trading regulations and polling districts.  The corporation will in future be paid the amount of the agricultural grant relevant to the added areas and the grant to the county council will be adjusted accordingly from 1966-67.  There is a saver from disqualification for county council members in the added areas for the duration of the present council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have to move the rejection of this Bill.  I do not do it lightly.  I had hoped that the hold-up during the past few months would have been availed of by the officials of the county council and the corporation and of the Department to carry out a factual investigation of the figures and arrive at an assessment of the loss of income to the county council.  However, though at my request the accountant, the manager and the officials of the county council met the corporation on several occasions in this matter, the attitude adopted by the corporation was exactly the attitude adopted previously, namely, no agreement.</P>
      <P>We had a very nice story from the Minister as to the reasons why this extension is necessary and why the area is being taken over.  The reasons are contained in a statement made by the City Manager on Friday, March 19th, and published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on Friday March 19th, 1965. Cork rate will go up by 7/- in the £ if the boundary is not extended in time.  That is the reason, and the main reason.  It is revenue for the city plutocrats at the expense of the unfortunate district they are taking in.  It is 7/- in the £, in addition to their own rates for the poor people of Cork city.</P>
      <P>As I stated, we endeavoured to get this matter cleared up and to get some agreement in the period left to us by the dissolution of the Dáil.  On 4th March, 1965, our manager wrote to the City Manager and in those proposals, Sir, he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the discussion which the Minister for Local Government had with members of the Oireachtas <Col N="2095" /> from the City and County a special meeting of the Council was held today at which it was unanimously agreed that as recommended by the Minister for Local Government the Corporation and County Officials should meet at the earliest possible date to consider the effect of the proposed extension of the borough boundary on the County in the financial year 1965/66.  The Council decided to request the Cork Corporation to agree to the following:</P>
    <P>1.  &ldquo;That the Cork Corporation pay immediately to the County Council a sum equivalent to the increased burden falling on the County Rates in the year 1965/66 as a result of the proposed extension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In support of this request members referred to the statement made by the Minister for Local Government during the discussion in the Senate on the Confirmation Bill, 1965, as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Corporation accepted in principle that they should compensate the County Council forthwith for the extra burden which would otherwise fall on the county ratepayers in 1965/66.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>2.  &ldquo;That the Cork Corporation pay to the County Council in each succeeding year a sum equivalent to the increase of burden falling on the ratepayers in the reduced County in the particular year as a result of the extension of the boundary.</P>
    <P>3.  &ldquo;That the sum indicated at (2) be paid each year for a period of 15 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was noted that the Minister at the discussion with the Members of the Oireachtas had indicated that he would amend the Provisional Order accordingly if the Corporation would agree. </P>
    <P>The Minister's statement in that respect was that when the extension of Dublin city came about, it was agreed that purchase of the burden should be a 15-year one, not a ten-year <Col N="2096" /> one.  The Minister said: &ldquo;If you can get agreement with the corporation on this everybody will be happy&rdquo;.  However, the Minister did not say whether the corporation would get agreement with the county council on the 15 years. I went to the trouble of looking up the reasons for this amazing fraternisation between the members of Dublin County Council and the city and I found that in 1953 the manager for Dublin city was also the Manager for Dublin county, and he agreed with himself.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that there are several reasons, very cogent reasons, why this Bill should not be introduced now.  I shall give them as briefly as I can, but I would suggest to the Minister that when the responsible man, the manager of both city and county, holds the scales of justice fairly as between the city and county decided that a 15-year purchase was a reasonable agreement, the same should be accepted in so far as the present proposals are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would further suggest to the Minister that a far stronger case can be made by the city of Dublin against a reduction in the purchase amount than can be made by Cork city, for, after all, Dublin city was revalued. Cork city was revalued 113 years ago. I would suggest that that is very definitely a further reason.  The Minister also stated: &ldquo;Oh, we did agree to ten years before&rdquo;.  Yes, we did. Cork Corporation built a number of houses outside the borough boundary of Cork.  Those unfortunate people were for a long number of years in the position you read about long ago in the old Bible story of the man who was driven outside the walls of the city.  Under special social services existing here, those unfortunate men who were driven outside the boundaries were classed as country boys and were not entitled to unemployment assistance from the month of May until the following November and the Cork City Manager sat inside quietly and enjoyed it, having driven them out.</P>
    <P>That matter was fixed up by me as Chairman of the South Cork Board of Assistance and I succeeded with the assistance of my rural colleagues, in <Col N="2097" /> making up the difference to them, over the county rates.  Then the application was made for the boundary to be extended to cover those houses that were built by the Corporation.  The case was a reasonable one and the county council unanimously agreed to it.  A change came then and they agreed to give reasonable compensation.  That compensation was assessed by our accountant and officers at £26,000. The following years were spent in question and answer in this House, and appealing to the Minister, because it had been referred to the Minister. After it had been lying in the musty files of the Department for six long years, some genius over there said: &ldquo;We will give them something,&rdquo; and out of the generosity of their hearts, we got £11,000 out of that £26,000, and the value of the £ was 12/6 as compared with what it was when the area was taken over.  That is the record of Cork Corporation up to the present in their dealings with Cork County Council, and that is why I am opposing this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have to ask you, Sir, to bear with me a little because I understand that the Government have briefed Deputy Barrett in this matter.  When I want to win a case, I always employ him myself.  The application for the boundary extension was made in March, 1960, and it was rather notable that the Department of Local Government who were the arbitrators in the previous compensation for boundary extension did not wake up and pay for the old job until the new one was applied for.</P>
    <P>The valuation of Cork city is £363,000, and back over the past 113 years it has been somewhere around the same valuation.  An inquiry was held in January, 1962, and a decision was given in August, 1964.  The valuation of Cork city did not increase. During the period from the application to the decision of the Department, the valuation of the area proposed to be taken in increased from £133,984 in 1961-62 to £152,763 in 1965-66, an increase in valuation of £18,779 in three years.  The valuation of the area proposed to be taken in was assessed <Col N="2098" /> under the modern valuation system by the Commissioners of Valuation over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>No one in his senses will say that the present day basis of valuation has any similarity with the basis of the Griffith valuation.  You have the anomaly of small shops in the area proposed to be taken over carrying a far higher valuation than the large shops in the principal streets of Cork city.  This area is now to pay rates on a common valuation basis with the city plutocrats.  I therefore consider that in mere justice to both parties, there should be an up-to-date revaluation of Cork city before the Provisional Order is passed by this House. Otherwise, this House will be doing something which, in my opinion, is repugnant to the Constitution of the State.</P>
    <P>We heard the Minister read out all the nice things they were going to get when they came in, but it is clearly stated here that the rate will go up by 7/- in the £ if the boundary is not extended. Our county council have done their duty by this area in generous grants for new houses and the reconstruction of old houses, and 100 per cent State grants.  In fact, direct grants from the county council for the building of new houses in that area have cost the ratepayers of the county, at a very conservative estimate, between £200,000 and £300,000.</P>
    <P>After careful examination, Cork County Council have lent some £5 million to people who are desirous of building their own homes, and we find that £4 million out of that £5 million has been lent to people in that particular district, whereas, if they came under the city, they would not get 5/-, because they have not got it.  They have no loans scheme.  I think Deputy Barrett told us in the past fortnight that they were abandoning their scheme of loans for housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>By the city manager for Cork.  He drew in his horns in regard to the loans.  That public statement is in the papers for anyone to read.  Therefore, if those people are to build any more houses, they will be left to the tender mercies of Cork Corporation.  Having lent £4 million to people desirous of building their homes in that area and having absorbed the loss in rates over the first seven or eight years, the Cork Corporation will come along and say: &ldquo;Come into my parlour and I will deal with you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mind you, when we hear of the Corporation leaning backwards in their anxiety about the rights of those people, we should examine carefully what they are prepared to do.  Let us see what their attitude has been towards those people and examine the whole question on that basis.  The Corporation met, and finding that through my activities in this House they could not collar the new area in time to levy rates on it, they got a new brainwave and said: &ldquo;Let us borrow £127,000 to reduce the rates in the city this year by 7/- in the £.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They did that and I had to ask the Minister for Local Government a question in connection with it a month ago.  I am glad to see he has not sanctioned it, yet, anyway.  What was the meaning of that?  Would anyone like to know?  I shall tell them pretty quickly.  Those people were leaning backwards to take into the fold the country fellows.  The principal and interest of that sum were to be repaid by the new city.  In plain language, the unfortunate people living in this area proposed to be added, with double and treble the valuations of the same property, houses and shops, in the city, would pay it.  They were to be made pay the principal and interest on the £127,000 the city was borrowing this year to relieve the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2100" /> That is an earnest of the treatment those unfortunate people will get when they go into the city if this Provisional Order passes through the House.  Let us get clear on what is happening, on the meaning behind every step being taken by Cork Corporation in this matter.  I am sure that, going on the legal advice of Deputy Barrett, they had the brainwave of borrowing the £100,000 odd and that the fools will be paying it back for the next ten years when they are brought into the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another serious matter which gravely concerns those of us interested in the housing of the working classes in this country.  In the area to be taken in there are roughly a thousand county council cottages and houses.  In fact, I had the honour a long time ago of proposing the first non-municipal scheme ever put into operation in the Republic.  That was the Dublin Hill scheme of 77 houses.  I had good help from the late Deputy McGrath who was responsible for a further large non-municipal scheme in the area of Beaumont, Blackrock and Glasheen, involving a total of 350 houses.  The late Deputy Desmond also worked strenuously in that area and succeeded in getting a very large number of houses built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will happen to those houses? There are more than 200 agricultural labourers' cottages there.  Those tenants surely have some rights?  Under legislation passed by the House the <Col N="2101" /> cottiers were entitled to purchase at a 50 per cent reduction in price.  The county council brought in very attractive proposals in respect of non-municipal tenants.  Under this proposed Provisional Order, the whole of that property would go into the Borough of Cork and the tenants would lose all the benefits they now enjoy under the Labourers Acts and the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.</P>
    <P>I gave the answer here in the House already.  After a sworn inquiry, two schemes of houses were built in Cobh, one of 24 houses by Cork County Council on one side of the road and the other of 52 houses built by the Cobh Urban District Council on the other side.  Both were occupied by the same class of tenant&mdash;workers in Irish Steel at Haulbowline.  Both schemes were built in the same year from the same plans and were let to the same class of tenant at the same rent, 11/- a week plus rates.  We brought in a purchase scheme for our 24 under which tenants could purchase and instead of paying 11/- a week rent, they paid 9/- a week annuity, a reduction of 2/-.  That was taking full advantage of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>When I came as a member of the Cobh Urban Council to examine the position of their comrades in the urban area, I found that the subsidy ceases on purchase and the best that could be done for those tenants was to give them the right to purchase at 32/- a week, as from 11/-.  I am not responsible for the anomalies brough into this House from time to time by geniuses here but certainly this is one anomaly.  What effect is that going to have on the 1,000 families who are now being dragged into the city by this Provisional Order? Where do they stand in regard to purchase if this House agrees to that Bill? Let us examine it from that point of view.  To give those tenants the same privileges as they enjoy at present would cost, as I have already proved at the inquiry, 6/- in the £ on the city rates.  Do you think that the gentlemen who tried to borrow £120,000 odd this year and to throw the burden on to those unfortunates are going to pay 6/- to bring those people into as good a <Col N="2102" /> position as if they were still in the county?</P>
    <P>I suppose I will be told that provision will be made but nothing can be done for them without legislation, legislation that I have looked for in vain for the past ten years.  If the House passes this Order, the gentlemen in the Corporation will sit down behind it and will say nothing and the people will get nothing.  But what is in the Provisional Order?  No steps are being taken in any way by the Department of Local Government about these unfortunate 1,000 families and it should be the Department's primary consideration to protect these people. There is no guarantee in the Order that the financial conditions of those unfortunate people will not be very gravely worsened.  The time to make provision is now in this Bill and not at any other time.  I suggest it is the Minister's bounden duty to see that those unfortunate families, ordinary workingclass families, are fully protected before he puts the Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>As I said, Sir, it is no pleasure to me to come up here and oppose this Bill.  I am doing this not alone as a Deputy but also as the chairman of Cork County Council and because of the duty entrusted to me by my colleagues and my duty to the ratepayers of the county.  I have been 30 years here and I have always put my constituents first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt Deputy Corry has a duty to the ratepayers of his county.  I say that discussions on this matter would better be confined to private discussions between Cork Corporation and Cork County Council where every co-operation will be forthcoming from both sides.  Anything that should be said here should not be said with a view to exacerbating any bad feeling that may exist between Cork County Council and Cork Corporation in regard to the extension of the boundary.  Speaking as a former Lord Mayor of the Cork Corporation, and in the presence of the present Lord Mayor of the Cork Corporation, I think I can say that there is no bad feeling of any description.  The extension of the borough boundary was as <Col N="2103" /> inevitable as the following of night by day.</P>
      <P>The city has grown.  There is no doubt in the world about that and due to the fact that the county council of which Deputy Corry speaks from time to time has not seen fit properly to cater for those people, who may be called commuters into the city, people living in suburbs such as Blackrock and Douglas, regarded themselves as a part of the city.  They worked in the city and made their living in the city. They shopped in the city because the county council of which Deputy Corry has the honour to be chairman, the county council which looks after the people, did not provide shopping centres.  The people came into the city and went to the vocational schools provided by Cork Corporation because the amenities provided by Deputy Corry and his colleagues were not always what the people wanted. They also came in for their entertainments because again there was no provision by the county council for areas in which they could entertain themselves. In every sense of the word, they were citizens of the city of Cork, in everything except name.</P>
      <P>It is a strange thing that the 1956 census of Dublin showed that there were 589,000 people in Dublin and 45,000 in the suburbs which showed that seven per cent of the combined city and urban areas lived outside the borough of Dublin.  In Cork the position was that 81,000 lived in the city and 34,000 odd lived in the suburbs, or 30 per cent living outside the borough, people who thought in terms of the city, but did not get the amenities they desired.  Their open spaces were neglected and are neglected to-day. Deputy Corry might not know that but it is a fact, and people living in the suburbs do find that their open spaces are neglected and they look forward to coming into the city because they believe they will get other amenities which the people enjoy, such as public parks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real reason Deputy Corry stated that he objects to this move is that in 1955 when a certain area in the county was added to the city there was some <Col N="2104" /> delay by the corporation in compensating the county council.  Deputy Corry has already been assured by the corporation&mdash;and I think I can assure him again on their behalf&mdash;that in regard to compensation we are ready to meet them as promptly and generously as possible.  We have already made a proposal to Cork County Council which will more than adequately meet any misgivings Deputy Corry might have.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to follow him down all the misleading avenues he opened up here today without making any investigation as to truth or falsehood. He did not mention the name of the place or give the facts when he said the new small shops in the county had double the valuation of the shops in the main streets in Cork.  I doubt that so gravely that I think I could say the Deputy said that without any proper investigation of the matter.  I doubt if he has material which would bear out what he said.</P>
    <P>He also said the city had not been revalued.  The Deputy is not a fool, as Deputies on both sides are well aware, the Taoiseach among them.  Deputy Corry knows that most of the big business houses in Cork, many of the small ones and many dwellings in the city have been revalued by valuation officers over the years and while there was no general revaluation, it is a fact that nearly every business premises in the main business centres has been revalued by the Valuation Commissioners. If you painted a window your premises were almost revalued.</P>
    <P>Typical of the misrepresentation we get from Deputy Corry was his insistence on calling the people who are coming in &ldquo;country boys&rdquo;.  Nobody will be less obliged to Deputy Corry for that description than those who are coming in.  They are people, as has already been pointed out, who are Cork city bred and are Cork citizens in thought, in mind and in deed.  The only anomaly I find about all this procedure and about the regularising of this Order is that the Minister brings all these people into the city and goes to great trouble to do so now but the same Minister not so long <Col N="2105" /> ago took great pains to get them out of it and put them into another constituency for political purposes.  The people who, as Deputy Corry would describe it, are now being dragged into the corporation area could have been said when the last Electoral Act was being passed to have been dragged out of the city area.</P>
    <P>I do not intend following Deputy Corry down these avenues of discussion. The Minister has made the case for the Bill that I would make.  It has been discussed by the corporation and the county council and minutely examined by the inspector sent down for the public inquiry which was held.  But there are certain aspects of the Provisional Order to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  At the risk of particularising in what should be a general debate, I want to say that there is no need for Article 15.  That could be taken as a general aspect of the Bill.  Article 15 was put in for such circumstances as obtained just before the general election.  It is a very objectionable proposal.  It seeks to cut down from five weeks to two the time a returning officer, a local authority or Deputy may have to propose an alteration.  If the Minister looks at the article, he will see there is no need for that now.  There could have been a need earlier if there had not been a dissolution of the Dáil.  Due to the fact that the Minister's officials who conducted the inquiry took so long to make thir findings, it might have been necessary to truncate these times.</P>
    <P>Even if it had to be done under emergency conditions, I would have opposed it because it is important that the rights of people such as Deputies should be maintained and should not be subordinated to the convenience of Departmental officials who failed to bring in their findings on a matter such as this inquiry into the borough boundary in time conveniently to provide for the holding of local elections if these elections were to be held this year.  The Minister will find that Article 15 was particularly introduced into the regulations for that purpose and that there is no need for it now. <Col N="2106" /> For that reason it should be dropped at this stage if possible.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when replying, to explain in more detail what is meant by Article 13 which leaves me, and I think everybody who reads it, guessing.  It simply says:</P>
    <P>In the register of electors for the County which came into force on the 15th day of April next before the commencement of this Order the various portions of the added area shall be shown separately in such manner as shall be directed by the Minister. </P>
    <P>The Minister should be able to tell the House the manner in which he intends to direct that to be done.  I think he should not ask us to acquiesce in passing this proposal without telling us what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>Another matter that will arise after the passing of this measure is the division of the new Cork Corporation area into wards.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind.  It is a very radical departure in regard to corporations since the foundation of the State. In the old days and under a very restricted franchise there were wards in the city of Cork and there were wards in Dublin but Dublin has over 500,000 of a population whereas in Cork under the new dispensation, if this Order is passed, there will be something like 111,000.  If the Minister sees fit to divide the city into wards I should like to know by whom it will be done.  Is it to be done by a Minister from Donegal or by backroom boys from Dublin or by the people who know best the needs, anxieties and necessities of the people of Cork?  I have asked that because Cork Corporation have made many representations to the Minister and the Minister, so far as I can see, sees fit to reject these representations.</P>
    <P>In February of this year I asked him if he would have discussions with the corporation on this matter and he said he felt there was no special discussion necessary with the corporation.  If the Minister is to effect a division into wards which is compatible with local desires, local topography and local needs, surely there is nobody else with whom he should discuss this.  We asked unanimously in Cork Corporation that <Col N="2107" /> he should not divide the city into wards but that if he had to divide it, he should divide it into two wards separated by the South Channel which is the natural division of the city.  In that way the city would be divided into two wards of about 35,000 each. That proposal was put to the Minister unanimously by the corporation which has a majority representation of the Minister's Party and includes the city's Lord Mayor and seven ex-Lord Mayors, all of them intimately aware of what the people of Cork need and what would make for the best administration of the city as a local government unit.</P>
    <P>Section 87 of the 1963 Electoral Act empowers the Minister to act without consultation but if there is any democracy living in this House, if there is any democracy living in our system, the Minister will have recourse to us and will listen to what we have to say and pay attention to what we say because, no matter what Deputy Corry may say, there is no body of persons on this earth more intimately concerned with or better informed on the question we are discussing.</P>
    <P>In an area of 70,000 to 80,000 people, we would have two wards of between 35,000 and 40,000 voters if the Minister agrees with our proposals. Contrast that with the wards in Dublin city.  In Dublin city in the No. 1 area, there are nearly 50,000 voters, in the No. 2 area, 31,000 voters, in the No. 3 area, 34,000 voters, in the No. 4 area, 33,000 voters, in the No. 5 area, nearly 40,000 voters, in the No. 6 area, 33,000 voters, in the No. 7 area, 43,000 voters &mdash;nearly 44,000; in the No. 8 area, 32,147 voters.  If the Minister divides Cork city into six wards, he will divide the people of six areas into areas of 12,000 voters each.  What prompts the Minister to do it, I do not know; what prompts the Minister to do it, very few, if any, members of his own Party in Cork Corporation know.  The Minister should tell us if he intends to do it and why he intends to do it.</P>
    <P>I believe that such a proposition is inimical to good local government.  It would break the corporation of 31 members into six groups, each of them sectional, each of them very sectional <Col N="2108" /> in a very small sense inasmuch as they would be catering for between 12,000 and 15,000 electors and all of them would naturally tend to pay more attention to their own areas than they would to the larger area if they were elected on a larger franchise.  In that way, in my opinion, lies the hope of bureaucrats who, by sectionalising interests in local government bodies such as Cork Corporation, will be able to entrench themselves through city managers, assistant city managers and officials who will not have all the guns of the corporation trained upon them on matters which are of general importance and interest to Cork Corporation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister at this stage, before the House passes this Bill, to make plain to the House and certainly to the Cork members of the House and more particularly to the members of this House who are members of Cork Corporation, his intentions in this regard and to tell us why he is doing it and give us one cogent argument as to why he is doing it.</P>
    <P>The proper and sensible approach to this is, if Cork is to be divided into wards at all, to divide it into two wards of between 35,000 and 40,000 voters each.  I know the Minister will tell us that on the last occasion there were 78 names on the ballot papers and that of course it was impossible for a voter to adjudicate upon the candidates when there were 78 candidates.  Seventy-eight candidates is a large number but is the Minister really telling us that citizens cannot give five minutes once every five years to scrutinising 78 names?  They go in with predetermined intentions as to the candidates they will support.  In that way you are giving the intelligent voter an advantage, which is a very good thing for the outcome of the election because if a man has not the intelligence to pick out five or even 20 or 21 names out of 78 I doubt very much if he has the right to claim as big an impact upon the composition of the corporation as the voter who has the intelligence to go in and look at 78 names and decide which 21 of them he will elect.</P>
    <P>There is no validity in the argument which the Minister might put to us, <Col N="2109" /> more particularly because if the electoral area is divided into two sections you are not likely to have a ballot paper of 78 names next time but I can assure the Minister that the average Cork man or woman is not going to be appalled by the prospect of being faced with a ballot paper containing 50 names, when one considers the electoral systems of other countries.  If you consider some of the ballot papers on which the American voter has to adjudicate, you will realise how lucky we are in this country that we have to adjudicate only on simple matters of separating in the case of, say, 50 candidates 15 or 16 of them and saying: &ldquo;We will elect these&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know I am talking for the majority of the members of Cork Corporation &mdash;and I say that because it is quite possible that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are also members of the Cork Corporation and simultaneously members of this House might find themselves embarrassed by having to say the same thing&mdash;but there is no doubt that, be they Deputies sitting behind the Minister or otherwise, as members of Cork Corporation, they unanimously subscribed to the idea and the suggestion, the very serious suggestion, reached after great thought, that the city should not be divided into more than two wards, and if the Minister divides it into more than two wards, he will have to tell us why and he will have to tell us where he got the advice because, this is quite certain, he did not, will not and cannot get it in Cork city, and we go back to the original question I asked: In matters like this are the decisions to be taken by a Minister from Donegal or some backroom boys in Dublin?</P>
    <P>I am taking this opportunity&mdash;it may not properly arise&mdash;to indicate to the Minister that if he does take the step that I am told he is going to take, of dividing the city into six wards, he will have to make a very good case for it and I do not believe he can do so.  If he does not make a very good case for it, then much of the validity of all this proposal to extend the city <Col N="2110" /> boundary will be lost upon the people who are anxious to have the boundary extended.  I believe it would make for proper local government if the Minister were to adopt the suggestion, not made in a sectional or in a political sense, put to him unanimously by the Cork Corporation.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why the Minister should not at this stage again discuss the matter with Cork Corporation.  I see no reason why the Minister should have replied to me on 11th February last, in a lordly, overbearing way, that it was not intended that there should be any further discussion with Cork Corporation on this matter.  Why not? With whom else should this matter be discussed?  Who else knows as well the intricacies of the problem as the members of Cork Corporation?  I am speaking for the citizens.  I consider it an affront to the citizens of Cork, and I know that they would so regard it, if they are to be told at some stage that, despite the unanimous wish of their local elected representatives, the Minister sees fit to do something which nobody has asked him to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Corry and my other colleagues on Cork County Council, I am gravely concerned because of the added burden which the passage of this Bill will impose, in the first instance, on the ratepayers of the area proposed to be brought into the borough of Cork and, in the second instance, on the ratepayers of the county as a whole and, like Deputy Corry, I feel that this Bill should not at this stage be introduced in the House.  What it proposes to do is, in fact, to infringe the constitutional rights of 250,000 people as represented by Cork County Council.  I think it will be generally agreed that local government and, indeed, all forms of government, have as a primary object or aim the promotion of the common good.  I cannot see how the common good can be said to be promoted or advanced when Cork Corporation representing 80,000 people can make a claim which results in very severe hardship on three times that number of people as represented by Cork County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> The residents of the proposed larger area did not at any time seek this extension, despite the fact that Deputy Barrett might imply that they actually want to be included in the borough.  They did not seek this extension. The extension was sought by Cork Corporation simply because this is a high rate-yielding area, making very few claims on the public purse. Cork Corporation had no case.  They told us that the inclusion of this area would enable them to raise on an equitable basis the amount required to be raised by the borough in order to provide at a reasonable cost the services which they were under an obligation to provide.  That is their chief explanation as to why this borough should be extended.  The net result is that these people, for the most part occupants of highly-rated new dwellings which have now reached or are about to reach full rates, will have to pay the extra poundage required by Cork Corporation and share the burden of the cost of the services of the city.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Second Schedule of this Bill indicates the proportionate valuations, and the full valuation is reached in the fifth year. This is inserted with a view to easing the immediate impact, but the impact is there already and it will be there in full measure after a period of five years.</P>
    <P>The method by which compensation is proposed to be paid in this Provisional Order is most unjust.  Subsection (4) (b) of section 6 of the Schedule, which deals with financial adjustments, reads :</P>
    <P>regard shall also be had to the length of time during which such increase of burden may be expected to continue;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say that the burden cannot be expected to continue longer than ten years.  I do not know who decided that after 10 years the county council would suffer no further loss. It will go on suffering loss into the future, and compensating Cork County Council on the basis of ten years is not adequate.  It is preposterous to suggest that the area itself should be <Col N="2112" /> required to compensate Cork County Council for its own loss.</P>
    <P>I think Mr. Cooke described that situation very accurately at the inquiry into this whole case in 1961 and 1962 when he said these people would be stuck for the cost of cutting their own throats.  Here are the reasons which the Corporation suggest as to why these people should be stuck for the cost of cutting their own throats.  First, it is said they derive their income from activities within the borough.  Cork County Council, in the case they presented to the inquiry, proved that three out of ten of those people had no connection whatever with the Cork borough but, even assuming that the other seven did have&mdash;and that was not established either&mdash;they are not the only people who have connections with the Cork borough.  People as far out as 20 or 30 miles derive their income from activities within the borough of Cork.  Also business people, traders and industrialists within the borough derive their income in no small measure from customers who are very far outside the borough.  Therefore, I do not think that argument should have been advanced, nor can it be justified.</P>
    <P>We are also told that these people enjoy the amenities of the city of Cork. Amenities of this nature are paid for anyway.  If these people enjoy such amenities, they pay for them, and there is no reason why they should be asked to pay on the double, through their rates and in the normal way, for the amenities of the city of Cork.  It is also said that the Corporation of Cork supply water to these people.  If the corporation supply water to these people, it is at the rate of 3/- in the £ on the rateable valuation and one can assume they make a profit on the transaction.  Therefore, these people are in no way indebted to the corporation for the fact that water is supplied to them.</P>
    <P>Another argument advanced was that Cork Corporation provide a fire brigade service to this area.  This can generally be accepted as a humane sort of service, one that knows no limitations or boundaries.  When a fire starts in Cork city, even fire brigades in areas under the jurisdiction of Cork County <Col N="2113" /> Council will rush to the scene.  That argument should not be advanced for claiming this area.</P>
    <P>The argument has also been made that Cork Corporation provide vocational education which is of a higher standard and which can be availed of by the people of the proposed added area.  These schools which are referred to as regional schools are paid a much higher grant and subsidised to a much greater extent than the county schools. For every £100, they receive a grant of £80, whereas in the county the grant is only £50.  Therefore the people of the county as a whole and the people of the country as a whole are subsidising vocational education in Cork city to a much greater extent than it is subsidised in the county.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all these arguments, the Minister has acceded to the request of Cork Corporation.  On the other hand, the Minister forgot to accede to the very simple request of Cork County Council, to discuss the matter prior to the coming into operation of the Provisional Order.  I would suggest now to the Minister that he have regard to the pattern set by his predecessor in 1948 when Limerick Corporation made a claim for the extension of their borough.  The Minister at that time stated that the financial considerations would not justify the extension they sought.  The financial considerations were almost identical with the financial considerations before us in this claim here today.  They were to the effect that the people of the area surrounding Limerick enjoyed its amenities, that the burden of local rates should be more equitably spread.  The Minister thought these considerations were not sufficient to justify the extension of the boundary.</P>
    <P>No case has been established for the imposing of this burden on the people affected.  I would not go as far as Deputy Corry, who made a tremendous case for the county council, in telling the people of the borough of Cork they should revalue their city, although I think he is quite right.  That is their own business but when they find themselves in financial difficulties, they should not seek to compensate themselves <Col N="2114" /> from the assets of Cork County Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse </NameTxt>
      <P>I have been amazed at the case made by Deputy Corry this morning.  The city members from Cork feel like villains; the poor people are being handed over to the villains of the Cork Corporation.  Cork is a growing and progressive city and, as such, greater demands are made on the local authority to provide housing, industrial sites and all the other amenities required for a city.  When we as public representatives speak of the city of Cork, we always naturally include the added area that is now in question, such places as Blackrock, Douglas, Ballinlough, Model Farm Road.  We always consider those areas as part of our city and the people living there consider them as part of the city. Therefore, I was amazed to hear what has been said here this morning about this extension.  We were not told, of course, that the great majority of the people in the area depend on the city for their livelihood.  They work in factories like Dunlops, Fords&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Take our national schools: 70 per cent of the children attending the schools come from the area that we are now asking should be added to the city of Cork.  Is it not a fact that quite a large number of the people mentioned by Deputy Corry avail of every possible facility afforded them in the city, such as the School of Art, the School of Music, and School of Commerce, the technical schools? Early in the morning anything from 5,000 to 6,000 motorists cross the borough boundary into Cork city where they are employed. <Col N="2115" /> We have not been told, of course, about the large number of people in the area in need of housing.  We might as well be truthful and face facts.  It is wrong that the citizens of Cork should be burdened year after year with heavy rates while practically 35,000 people availing of the facilities and amenities provided by the rates pay not one penny towards the cost of these amenities and facilities.  We know that a very exhaustive examination was carried out into this whole matter and any fairminded representative, be he city or county, must agree that there is urgent necessity to extend our borough boundary.  Despite the case made by Deputy Corry this morning, I know that in his own heart and soul he knows the need is there.  I think the matter has been summed up correctly by the Minister in the correspondence with the corporation.  This is a letter dated 31st August, 1964:</P>
      <P>The suburban areas with a population of approximately 35,000 people have not in themselves the facilities and amenities required by a population of this magnitude and it is manifestly more advantageous in economy and efficiency to utilise and develop the range of facilities and services available in the city than to provide the same facilities and services in the suburban area. While a certain measure of co-operation had been achieved between the two Authorities in some fields, such as vocational education, town planning, water supply services, the effectiveness of this co-operation is restricted by the division of ultimate responsibility between the two Authorities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in Cork Corporation, are at all times ready and willing to meet the Cork County Council and to discuss our problems with that body in an effort to find some solution acceptable to both authorities.  It was wrong for anyone to say here this morning that certain requests made to Cork Corporation had been refused.  As a member of Cork Corporation, I cannot agree with the statement made by Deputy Corry.  We are all the time waiting to meet the county council and <Col N="2116" /> discuss these problems with them. Hard words used in discussion here will not help to bring about the friendliness and co-operation essential to the solving of the problem confronting both authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose this Order as a rural Deputy and a member of Cork County Council.  I was rather intrigued by the Minister's opening speech.  One would imagine he was conferring a very big benefit on us by taking 5,600 acres from our county.  There is no justification at all for this Order.  As far back as the inquiry, it was proved that the proposed added area is not required for any local government purpose.  There was no demand for this extension from the people in the added area.  This idea was actually conceived in the mind of the corporation because, if successful, it would add considerably to their finances.  There is no doubt but that they had sinister motives in putting forward this demand and application. It can be described only as a financial grab from the county.  That is proved by the statement made by the City Manager, which was quoted this morning, to the effect that, since the Order was not made before 1st April, the rates would be up by 7/- in the £.  That is a clear admission that the real interest was in the financial side.  Added to that, they made an application to the Minister to borrow something like £127,000 in order to cushion the increase in rates this year.  That has not been finally dealt with yet.</P>

    <P>The Council are naturally keenly interested in and worried by the financial implications of this Order.  The area involved on 31st March of this year has a valuation of £147,639.  That represents 12 per cent of the county valuation and 22½ per cent of the South Cork area, actually nearly one quarter.  In 1960, when the inquiry was held, the valuation of the area claimed by the corporation was £140,942.  That was the original demand and £127,134 was included in the area now under discussion.  In the intervening period of five years the smaller area increased its valuation <Col N="2117" /> considerably.  Naturally it will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>Statements were made here by Deputy Barrett that the areas in the suburbs were neglected.  I can draw his attention to the fact that the heart of the city is very neglected.  I should think it would provide scope for a great deal of planning and work for the corporation as against grabbing this suburban area.  We have provided services in the area&mdash;sewerage schemes, public lighting, roads, scavenging&mdash;and as already stated by Deputy Mrs. Desmond, the corporation are selling water to us at 3/- in the £, thereby making quite a big profit.</P>
    <P>During the inquiry&mdash;the Minister referred to it afterwards&mdash;it was stated that the ribbon development of the city suburbs was unsightly and should not be allowed.  The corporation, at their own request, were the planning authority at that time and there was no objection.  Yet they criticised the council during the inquiry for allowing this ribbon development.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us here that the county council were not in favour of the proposed extension because they did not like to see the rateable valuation of their area reduced, and he added that &rdquo;there was also a point that the extension may mean an increased rates burden on the ratepayers in the rest of the county in the future.&rdquo; It was an extraordinary term to use, &ldquo;may mean&rdquo;.  It is well known that the extension is going to create an added burden on the remainder of the county because services, such as water and sewerage, which might have cost 1/- in the £ previously will undoubtedly cost from 1/3 to 1/6d.  It is well known that the rates will increase year after year and the rating revenue of the council will be very much reduced.</P>
    <P>Evidence was given at the inquiry on behalf of almost all the urban councils, who lodged objections, and all the rural associations, development associations, parish councils and so on. They all realised that the extension was going to create hardship for them, especially in the rural towns and villages, and that there would be no relief.  Ten years will not compensate <Col N="2118" /> anyone because this will go on forever. It is extraordinary, therefore, that the Minister should use such a word as &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Compensation is, of course, the important matter we are interested in now.  In preliminary talks the corporation told us they would lean over backwards to meet our wishes.  However, in a letter from the corporation to the secretary of the county council of 10th March, 1965, putting forward certain proposals, it is also stated:</P>
    <P>It must be clearly understood that these payments are to be without prejudice in any way to the final settlement of the claim for compensation. </P>
    <P>I think that is very significant.  Naturally, that would be the easiest way out of the difficulty.  But, if the county council were foolish enough to accept that statement, they would be tied hand and foot.  When the final settlement would come the corporation would have their own ideas about compensating the council fully.</P>
    <P>If adequate compensation is to be paid, it should leave the ratepayers in the remainder of the county in as good a position then as they are now.  The extensions in Limerick in 1951 and in Waterford in 1955 were based on the same compensation level, which was not very generous.  In those cases the extensions were required for local government purposes, but in Cork it was emphatically stated by the city manager that the extension was not required for local government purposes. That is the big difference.  The position has not changed since.</P>
    <P>Normally, the amount of local compensation is a capital sum, but such a payment would be useless to the county council unless it was sufficiently large that, if invested, it would approximate to the increasing burden of rates.  That might then be considered as compensation.  But we must remember that when the period expired in ten or fifteen years the council would be still faced with an increasing burden.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder we in the county council are highly suspicious of what <Col N="2119" /> might happen in this case because of the experience we had on the previous occasion.  At that time, it was a ten year purchase by agreement, the capital sum being £26,000.  After eight years we got £11,000.  In between, when regular inquiries were made to the council, it was even suggested by some of the probably not very responsible members that the corporation owed us nothing and we should not be wasting our time.  It worked out to be a four year purchase for something like 40 per cent.  If that is going to apply in this case, it cannot be called anything but highway robbery.</P>
    <P>In any business deal the contracting parties have an understanding and know where they stand.  The seller knows what he is getting before he puts his pen to paper, and rightly so. It is an extraordinary fact that when such extensions of borough boundaries are taking away a large slice of the county, they want us to agree to them first and ask us to see what we will get afterwards.  That would be a rather foolish attitude to adopt.  I am rather surprised that such regulations, whether they be Local Government, Finance or what have you, can be made.</P>
    <P>This represents, as I said before, a grab of 6,500 acres of the county with a valuation of £147,500 odd in 1964. Surely the council are entitled to know what is the final sum before the Order is made.  Each and every member is deeply concerned because, as I have already stated, we have a rather sad experience of the last occasion. Further, on that occasion, I would like to mention that when the council mentioned a figure of £11,000 and inquired how that was arrived at, we were told we would not get the information.  We asked for a breakdown of the amount and were refused the information.  That is very wrong and should not be applied on this occasion.  If, as it may happen in the pattern of things, we have been fobbed off with something like another four years in the purchase of 40 per cent of our demands, we are left holding the baby.  I appeal to the Minister not to allow a situation like this to be created and to hold the <Col N="2120" /> scales fairly, evenly and justly between the cities and the counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be concerned with the overall jobs.  Naturally, we are interested in the financial side of it but it would help if the matter were agreed or a decision arrived at by agreement, and if a substantial, generous sum of at least a 15-years purchase were given, we might go along with the corporation and wish them well.  While I do not want to create any bitterness or indulge in personalities, the provision in this Order for ten years will be unfair and unjust to the county council.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to have another look at this and at least make it 15 years purchase.  I believe 25 years would not even compensate us but at least 15 years would be just and would make us a little more happy than we are.</P>
    <P>I consider, in the event of nonagreement, that an independent outside arbitrator should be appointed. While you have good men and officers in the Department of Local Government, they are a little prejudiced when it comes to making a decision between one authority and another.  It would relieve the Minister of a great deal of controversy in future if, as an arbitrator&mdash;if it is necessary to appoint an arbitrator&mdash;an outside independent man were appointed and we would all abide by his decision.</P>

      <P>I wonder why this Bill was ordered for today because it is evident that the Minister is engaged on some other business.  He came along here, read his statement and then left the House immediately afterwards.  He has not come back since but he is represented by his Parliamentary Secretary.  I understood the Minister personally was dealing with this matter and if that is the case, he has treated the House with gross contempt in leaving as soon as he read his statement and not returning to hear the points mentioned by the various speakers on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an affront to Parliament and one that should be vehemently objected to by this House, that any Minister of State can make a statement <Col N="2121" /> on a particular Bill and then leave the House without troubling himself to listen to the points which Deputies have to make.  If that is the condition our Parliament is falling into, it is a disgrace.  If that is to be a headline for what is to take place in future, democracy will end in the not too distant future.  I want, as a member of this House, to protest against that type of action.  If a Minister is otherwise engaged, every one of us is more than willing to facilitate him.  This matter could have been adjourned to next week or the week after, if the Minister was otherwise engaged.</P>
    <P>It is the Government who order the business of the House and if the Minister who was to take this particular Bill had another engagement, then it could have been left over for a future date.  I want to protest in no uncertain terms against the procedure adopted by the responsible Minister dealing with this Bill of not being present. When Deputies make statements and express their points of view, they are entitled to be heard.  No notes of any kind have been made by the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary on the points that have been made.  This is not any reflection on the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have known him for a number of years in this House and I know he is a very efficient and capable Deputy but he has not been dealing with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I regret there has been a clash of opinion between Cork city and Cork county representatives on this question.  I feel the question at issue could have been dealt with by a committee or through discussion at a more local level and with better results than the discussion we have here to-day. We have had several discussions on this proposed extension for a protracted period now and many views have been expressed by many of my county colleagues on this question.  My views have not been in accord with some of those of my colleagues because I feel that the city should be administered as a unit.  This has been my feeling all the time.  I consider, first of all, it is a good thing that Cork city is expanding and has been expanding very much during the past 50 <Col N="2122" /> years.  I believe it is not big enough to be divided into two administrative districts. If you come into Cork from the Bandon side, you have to travel for a mile or a mile and a half through a built-up area before arriving at the city proper.  All this has happened during the past 50 years.  This area has been built up during the past 50 years and it is now highly developed.  The valuation is now more than £152,000.</P>
    <P>I have always advocated, so far as this particular measure is concerned, that it should be agreed, before any measure comes into the House, at local level, what compensation should be paid to the county council to offset the loss which the extension of the borough boundary will entail for the county ratepayers.  We should also ensure that the people resident within the area to be included in the city are assessed justly and fairly so far as the financial side of the business is concerned.</P>
    <P>We are told that the additional rate which the extension of the borough boundary will impose on the county is in the neighbourhood of 7/- in the £.  I believe that the corporation, getting this highly developed district, should pay in full such compensation as will ensure that there will be no loss to the county rates.  I believe that should be their first obligation.  I know that the county council have spent millions of pounds in developing every aspect of this area.  They have provided help for housing by way of loans, planning and so forth.  They have provided services all over this area and these services have cost a good deal of money.  By virtue of all that expenditure, this area is now, so far as revenue and income are concerned, the plum district in the county of Cork.  There is no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>This area which is to be included in the county borough of Cork is one from which a big revenue will be drawn by the corporation in the future with very little outlay by virtue of the fact that it is reasonably well developed as it leaves the county council. It is a highly profitable area: there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>What I am finding fault with is <Col N="2123" /> the compensation that has been offered for this district.  There is no justification in the wide world for basing compensation on a ten years purchase of rates and that is what the county council would get for this area.  Undoubtedly, there is no justification in the wide world for a ten years purchase in this case.  In any purchasing leases, and so on, the compensation is usually 20 years purchase.  I understand that quite recently the Leaseholds Commission set down 15 years; this was regarded as rather low.</P>
    <P>The county ratepayers should be adequately compensated.  That could have been done better before this Bill was brought into this House if we had had some closer discussion between the county and the corporation, with the Department lending a hand to bring about an amicable agreement. It would be much better for all concerned if this transfer of territory had been arranged and arrived at in an amicable fashion rather than by Deputies from Cork county and Cork city coming into this House and giving their divergent views today on this question.  We are all anxious for the development of Cork city and also for the development of Cork county.  This clash of opinion need not have arisen here today if this matter had been properly approached and we had had more private discussion, particularly discussion bearing on the adequacy of compensation because I think that is the big problem involved.</P>
    <P>Everybody in Cork likes to see Cork city expanding.  It is a good thing that, within the past 50 years, the population of Cork city has increased by more than 50 per cent.  A good deal of industry has been established in Cork and, for that reason, we have a big housing drive there and so on.  I do not like the viewpoint&mdash;I do not think he meant to give that interpretation of the position&mdash;expressed by Deputy Wyse when he spoke about cars crossing the boundary.  I think there is interdependence and that the city is depending on the county for many of its resources.  The Deputy mentioned 5,000 cars a day crossing the boundary into Cork city.  I am <Col N="2124" /> quite sure that the business people in the city would like to see 20,000 cars a day crossing the boundary to increase their business.  Part of the expansion has become necessary by virtue of the support the city is getting from the county.  The position in the county is that many people feel that more of our county residents should shop in their local towns and villages rather than travel to Cork city to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly it would be a good thing if that were to happen.  It is very bad to approach this matter on a sectional basis.  My view is that the county council undoubtedly have played a big part in the development of that part of Cork county which adjoins the city.  Over the years, they have given it special attention, as a result of which it has grown into a highly developed area. A personal viewpoint, because I do not think some of my colleagues in the county would share it, is that it is time to bring about an adjustment in the boundary of Cork city.  To my mind, the adjustment made is not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I agree that the city requires virgin land, as well, for further extension. Possibly, if they got a little more virgin land, it might not be any harm. I can see that the county council may not be too favourably disposed now towards developing the area just immediately outside the new boundary. What I have in mind is that there should be a further review of the compensation payable.  One need know very little about mathematics to realise that ten years purchase is not a fair or adequate compensation in this instance.  As Deputy Burton mentioned, in view of the cost of development, I believe it should be at least twice that amount&mdash;20 years purchase. If the approach earlier on had been to find a happy solution to this case, particularly on the vexed question of compensation, the position would be different from what it is today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have moved badly, as far as this is concerned, in every sense of the <Col N="2125" /> word.  We have made several blunders. We in the county council made one which was contributed to, to some extent, by the Department of Local Government and the corporation, in taking the county offices out of Cork city and building them two miles from the centre of the city when, were it not for the purpose of avoiding higher rates, as we then thought, they could have been built within 100 yards of the Courthouse.  There is space available within 100 yards of the Courthouse in Cork, which is in the centre of the city, for the building of the new county offices.  Just because someone thought it a good idea to avoid higher rates, the offices were removed further from the city.</P>
    <P>We decided to build the county offices in Cork to centralise administration and to make it easier for people who require information on health matters and any matters relative to public administration by having all these offices housed in one building. I always disagreed with changing the location to the perimeter of the city, to the site selected at the present time. Consider a person coming to those offices, particularly from the northern or eastern side of the city.  Consider a person coming to those offices from Charleville or Youghal, from north Cork or from east Cork.  Such a person must now go two miles out on the Bandon road if he or she wants to transact business at the council offices.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it very definite in his opening statement that he does not intend to establish another boundary and, indeed, personally I am not too favourably disposed towards too many boundaries.  I think we in Cork&mdash;this may not be a matter for the House&mdash;must have another look at the siting of the county offices.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal further with this matter.  As I say, I have availed of the opportunity to speak and give my personal views here and to express the belief that the extension of the boundary is justifiable, but that equally justifiable is the payment of adequate compensation.  Let us all hope that whoever will be here in 30 or 40 years' time will see a similar Bill in this <Col N="2126" /> House and that Cork will be again expanding and that further land for development will be required.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill is timely.  I have opposed it all along the line on the ground of compensation.  I am opposing it here today, and I shall support Deputy Corry, on that ground.  To my mind, ten years' compensation is completely out of proportion.  It would put an unjustifiable and intolerable burden on the county ratepayers and I believe if there is to be justice, the compensation must be stepped up sharply to meet the requirements of the county dwellers as well as the city dwellers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I must say I find myself in large measure in agreement with Deputy Murphy and I am glad he spoke because his moderate view is something we should welcome. The House has given a lot of time to the affairs of Cork today.  I do not think that time is unwarranted.  I think this is a measure entitled to claim the attention of the House.  I am in the peculiar position that I am a member of both the county council and the corporation.  I am also in the position that I sought election to the county council on the platform for an extension of the city into the suburban area and on that platform.  I was elected.  I hold the same view practically as Deputy Murphy&mdash;the city must expand.  It is not the first city, thanks be to God, that has expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold, with Deputy Murphy, that fair and adequate compensation should be paid.  Up to now, no figure has been mentioned.  A period of ten years has been mentioned but I think the Minister made it clear to every-body's mind that the way he means it should be paid in ten years makes it a little bit more than would be paid in 15 years, if it were paid otherwise. I take it the Cork Corporation would pay ten instalments but when they pay one, they owe the other nine and would have to pay interest on those each year.  In that way the accumulated amount would be more than if they paid 15 fixed instalments over the 15 years.  Also, the value of money will continue to depreciate which, to <Col N="2127" /> my mind, means that the sooner the county council get the money the better, so that they can use it in a profitable way.</P>
    <P>I also deplore any attempt or words that would cause friction between the people of Cork city and county.  That is not a desirable thing.  We are absolutely dependent on each other.  The city depends for its prosperity on the hinterland of the county around and the county in large measure depends on the facilities of the city.  The only thing I am sorry for is, and I am sure Deputy Murphy is sorry for it, too, that when the City Hall was built in 1934 on the site of the building that was burned by the Black and Tans, the county and city offices were not included in the one building.  I am sorry that councillors at that time did not think it wise to follow that course and have the city and county offices together. In that way we would be in the same building and would work with more harmony and understanding.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion, and I entirely dissociate myself from any such suggestion, that the people coming in from the suburban area will be in any way unfairly treated or will be in any way worse off than they are now.  We have welcomed people from Deputy Corry's constituency into the city as workers.  They have come in and lived among us in the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy also made the point that our population has expanded.  It has not.  The population of the city has been static for the past 100 years. I think the Minister had to bring in a Bill like this.  I am not trying to be unfair to either side.  I have experience in the county council and the corporation and I think it would not be easy for them to come together and negotiate unless they had an outside arbitrator. That is the answer.  Certainly an extension of the city boundary of Cork has been spoken about by people who have lived there for well over 50 years.  This is the first time a native Government have the power to do it and the interest in doing it.  As has been said before, it is in the interests of both the city and the county in the <Col N="2128" /> end and certainly I think that if the compensation is as Deputy Murphy would wish, as I would wish, and, as I am sure, the Corporation would wish, fair and just, nobody will suffer.</P>
    <P>There is one item I should like to correct.  Reference was made this morning to compensation that was paid eventually by the corporation for some lands given to them previously.  It has not been made clear that when the arbitrator decided the amount, the corporation passed the amount at its next meeting and the cheque was paid to the county council within a month of finding out the arbitrator's wishes in the matter.  Therefore, there was no reluctance on the part of the corporation to pay the amount that was just and I can say without fear of contradiction that there would not be the slightest hesitation on the corporation's part to pay the full and just amount agreed upon, whether by the arbitrator or among ourselves.</P>

      <P>The matters which have been raised here are not new to me.  I have been hearing them in various ways for a considerable time.  Among some of the matters raised by Deputy Corry is the specific question of the tenants of labourers' cottages who, he says, will lose their right to purchase their cottages on being transferred to the city.  I want to assure the Deputy, and the House, that, in fact, they will not lose that right.  They will continue to have it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to put it into the Bill since there is no necessity for it.  These people will continue to have the right under the purchase scheme for 12 months, by virtue of section 22 of the Housing Act of 1950.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett asked about the meaning of Article 13.  This article is necessary to ensure that the electors in the added area will be separate from those in the rest of the county and will be deemed to be on the city register. That is the sole purpose of Article 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also talked in regard to Article 15 which he said was not necessary now.  It is true that, if these <Col N="2129" /> local elections do not arise in 1965, as they will not, the Article will be ineffective.  The fact is, by leaving it there and not holding the elections, the Article does not operate.  So, whether it is really necessary or not, it does not take away from the fact that it could have been necessary.  It is in the Order as it is now and I propose to leave it there.  Since we are not having these elections in 1965, it is not operating, and it will have the same effect as if it were not put in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burton also spoke on a matter which I think would be more appropriately dealt with at a later stage, on another Bill which will be coming before the House, that is, the number of wards in the city.  I do not propose at this juncture to deal with this matter, as it will be very fully dealt with at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The matter raised by Deputy Burton was naturally raised by Deputy Corry even more forcefully at an earlier stage, that is, the question of compensation. Deputy Burton and Deputy Corry are seeking to have 15 years purchase put in the Bill.  This matter will be very fully discussed on Committee Stage, but, at the same time, it is only fair to reiterate what I have said, that the ten years purchase provided in the Bill is, in fact, as good from a financial standpoint as would be the 15 years which is being sought by these two Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is calculated by Deputy Corry's method of calculation, or the Department of Local Government method of calculation, the final figure in both cases must be the same.  If we take a figure of £100,000, purely for the purpose of administration, and carrying no other weight, as the increase in the burden&mdash;again I say taking that figure purely for illustrative purpose and not necessarily having any bearing on what the actual figure may be&mdash;then we can start looking at how it can be calculated for the overall total payment of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the county council were treated in the same manner as Dublin in 1953, <Col N="2130" /> and taking this figure of £100,000 over a 15 year period, they would get a total of £1½ million, but if they were to get ten times the increase in burden with interest, and if that amount were paid over 15 years, as it may be, they would get a figure of £103,600 a year or a total of £1,555,000 with interest calculated at 6¼ per cent, which percentage is not unrealistic in these days.  If we take those two figures on their own merits, I cannot see for the life of me why there should be such a demand for this change in the Bill to bring about 15 years repayments comparable with the settlement in Dublin in 1953 as against what is now proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should also remark that it is all very well for Deputy Corry to be facetious about the whole matter and to talk about the manner in which agreement was reached in Dublin by a manager agreeing with himself.  We must all realise that this is a matter on which I believe an amicable settlement can be reached, and will be reached, by the people of Cork city and county. They do not need, and will not require, a common manager to agree with himself. I believe they can and will reach a friendly and amicable solution, and I believe that the situation as presented here today by those who oppose the Bill, and the Order as it now stands, is not a true reflection of the overall outlook of the people of Cork county and city.  I believe that Cork city is as dear to the people of Cork county as to the people of Cork city.  All I can say is God help anyone from outside Cork city or county who comes between a Cork county man and a Cork city man.</P>

      <P>Incidentally, while all that was developing between Cork city and county, I was thinking I might leave it to them.  That brings me to another point.  I was criticised and described as discourteous to the people of Cork, and Cork Deputies, for not being present during the entire discussion. In fact, it is due to my courtesy to Cork Deputies that this matter was brought before the House today rather than on an earlier date.  I had entered into previous commitments for this morning and no discourtesy whatsoever was intended&mdash;and I hope no offence has been taken on that score&mdash; by my absence from the House for the period in which I was forced to be absent this morning.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Murphy wants to be &ldquo;narky&rdquo; about the matter, he may.  As I have said, this Bill would have been dealt with before this, were it not for the fact that I was trying to accommodate the Cork Deputies to whom Deputy Murphy alleges I have now been discourteous because I could not be here for the entire discussion this morning.  I am sorry it should be taken that way but it was not my fault. I have no apology to make except to say that I was left in a position in which I was engaged doubly this morning on very important business as well as the business of the House.  I could not help it and I am sorry it happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore in regard to the matter of the ten years purchase, that is the <Col N="2132" /> recognised term of years, with the one exception that has been mentioned. That was an exception to the general rule of ten years.  I think the House will appreciate that trotting out that exception and the circumstances of the agreement between Dublin city and county is not a true parallel with what has taken place in regard to the extension of the Cork boundary.  I do not believe there is any Deputy, whether from Cork county or city, or any part of the country, once he realises the facts of the situation in regard to the growth of Cork and the boundary restriction at the moment, who would claim that no boundary extension should take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Haughey) </NameTxt>
      <P>I move :</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £558,400 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1966, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The development of our sea and inland fisheries during 1964 along the lines set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has been encouraging and shows an improvement on the results of the previous year.  The following facts will help to give a picture of the expansion which has been achieved and which, I hope, will continue at an increasing tempo in the years ahead:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the total value of landings of sea-fish and shellfish in 1964 showed an increase of £91,000 or 6.4 per cent as compared with 1963;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> demersal landings, i.e. whiting, plaice, cod, etc., in terms of quantity and value, were the highest on record;</P>
    <P>the value of shellfish landings in 1964 also reached a record total, being 19 per cent in excess of that for previous year;</P>
    <P>the total value of all fish exports (including salmon, trout and eels) at £1,949,000 was over 13 per cent higher than the figure for 1963 which itself had constituted a record;</P>
    <P>the estimated income from angling tourism increased by £1,385,000 during the year to the total of £3,145,000;</P>
    <P>thus exports, both visible and invisible, arising from our fisheries were worth over £5,000,000 in 1964. </P>
    <P>Following reorganisation in 1963 of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara that body is now playing a more vital role in the overall development programme, particularly through the media of its advisory and marketing services.  Demonstrations of new techniques and gear have been given at various centres and the engagement of an expert Danish skipper on a full-time basis for this purpose has had very good results.  The organisation of fish marketing on a regional basis by means of an effective link-up between the trade and the main supply ports in their area has achieved a more rational distribution of landings and this policy, backed by an intensive campaign for improved quality, handling and presentation, is steadily raising the level of home consumption.  In other fields, particularly training of fishermen personnel, harbour development and research, the Fisheries Division are continuing to press ahead with the planned programme and in this connection, we received during the year the report of the American survey team making recommendations for the improvement of our sea fisheries.</P>
    <P>Landings of sea-fish, excluding shellfish which are recorded partly by weight and partly by numbers, amounted in 1964 to 488,000 cwt. representing a rise of over 88,000 cwt. on the figure for 1963.  While the <Col N="2134" /> largest single increase was in sprats, which is a low-priced species, there was an appreciable expansion in landings of most of the demersal varieties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Whips, I understood this Estimate was ordered for 1.30.  I do not wish to be discourteous to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey </NameTxt>
      <P>My clear understanding was that it was ordered for 1 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman </NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right now. All is saved.  I am told there was a misunderstanding between the Whips or, to be more correct, by the Acting Whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey </NameTxt>
      <P>The total value of the landings, including shellfish, came to £1,505,000 made up of £877,000 for demersal fish (plaice, whiting, cod et cetera), £208,000 for pelagic fish (herrings, mackerel etc.) and £420,000 for shellfish.</P>
      <P>The ten species, which contributed most to fishermen's earnings were plaice, whiting, lobsters, herrings, cod, ray/skate, haddock, Dublin Bay prawns, crawfish and soles in that order.  The most significant increase was in the value of the shellfish catch which was over £66,000 in excess of that for 1963.  This increase was reflected in the appreciable expansion of shellfish exports during the year, the value being £590,000 as compared with £476,000 in the previous year.</P>
      <P>While the figures of landings for 1964 were generally satisfactory I must, I confess, express disappointment with the herring catch particularly that from the Dunmore East fishery.  When in 1962 the Government decision was taken to construct a major fishery harbour at Dunmore East landings of herring at the port were of the order of 250,000 cwt. for the season.  Unfortunately owing to a dispute which has arisen the number of boats working into Dunmore has dropped from approximately 100 to 25 in 1964-65 when landings amounted to about 60,000 cwt.  This decrease in the catch is reducing the status of Dunmore East as a major herring port and results in a decline of interest by foreign buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> Promotional activities, aimed at achieving a greater home consumption of fish, were intensified during the year.  The National Fish Cookery Competition, sponsored by the Fishing Industry Development Committee, for secondary and vocational school students increased in popularity and attracted some 20,000 competitors.  A similar competition confined to members of the Irish Countrywomen's Association was again held in 1964 with expanding interest being shown at all stages.  In addition, an intensive programme of public fish cookery demonstrations at various centres throughout the country was undertaken in co-operation with fish processors, wholesalers, retailers, hotels and institutions.  Further promotional activities included fish exhibitions and fish-weeks in Dublin and main provincial centres.  To supplement all these undertakings television, radio and newspaper advertising was availed of throughout the year and specially designed display material was placed at the disposal of the trade in order to carry the national advertising theme to the point of sale.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the expansion of the home market, the promotion of export sales of fish and fishery products is being encouraged and assisted and the results of this policy in 1964, when the total value of all fish exports (including salmon, trout and eels) was almost £2,000,000, have been encouraging.</P>
    <P>There is a further increase to £290,000 in the grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara&mdash;£211,000 for current operations and £79,000 for capital purposes.  The main capital items are as usual grants of 25 per cent of the cost of new boats, new engines and new winches.  Repayable advances from the Central Fund of up to £281,000 have also been authorised, chiefly for financing the purchase of boats and gear.  Nineteen new boats ranging from 26 to 56 feet in length were issued by the Board to hire purchasers during 1964.  The Board also helped to finance the purchase of three <Col N="2136" /> second hand boats from abroad of 63', 65' and 85'.</P>
    <P>The Board are continuing production in their factories at Killybegs and Galway in co-operation with members of the fish trade.  As Deputies will be aware it has been necessary to permit the import of fish from externally registered boats in order to maintain production when home landings are not available.  These landings are to supplement not to supplant local catches and as it is a condition of any licence granted that suitable home landings are to be given priority over imported fish, sales of the Irish fishermen's catches are not in any way affected.</P>
    <P>The object of granting these licences is to ensure that the factories can continue to retain their staffs in employment so that when our own fishermen land large catches the factories will be able to handle them.  I am convinced that for the more rapid development of the sea-fishing industry on rational lines, the processing sector will have to occupy a front line position in our national economy.  As a corollary, existing processing factories and others that may be established will have to be assured of regular and adequate supplies for economic working.</P>
    <P>I am hoping to promote contractual arrangements between Irish fishermen and factories to ensure that at least basic factory needs are met.  I have explicit faith that Irish fishermen will in time and with improved State aid and encouragement be well capable of playing their full part in this aspect of the industry.  I think that the majority of Irish fishermen now realise that these imports do not constitute a threat to their livelihood but in fact will in the long term be to their advantage.</P>
    <P>The reorganised Board continued during the past year to extend their development functions, embracing, <i>inter alia</i>, fleet maintenance scheme, expansion of markets at home and abroad, encouragement of increased fish processing and the imparting of general advice to fishermen with particular reference to the employment of new fishing techniques.  Good progress <Col N="2137" /> was made in 1964 in the introduction of improved fishing methods and in the promotion of co-operation among fishermen.</P>
    <P>I must now refer to a new Subhead D.2 showing a provision of £217,600 for repayment to the Central Fund of advances made under the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952 for the provision of boats and gear where repayment by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has been waived under the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall that in 1961-62 a similar write off was necessary in the case of the Board's predecessor, the former Sea Fisheries Association. Advances of the order of £2 million were made to the Board between 24th April, 1952 and 31st March last for the provision of boats and gear. Neither the Association nor the Board has been able to recover all payments due for boats issued to hire purchasers&mdash;some of whom unfortunately have failed to meet their commitments. In the worst cases it has been necessary to resume possession of the boats and re-issue them or sell them at a loss.  Also provided for are capital losses of £68,370 incurred on the sale of the three offshore fishing vessels in 1960.  While these losses have been accumulating over the years the Board have continued to remit the annuities as they fell due.  Had the liability to the Exchequer been reduced as each loss occurred, the total amount to be written off would be much smaller than the figure of £217,600 which is inflated by the inclusion of interest of more than £35,000 which has been accruing over the years.</P>
    <P>While it is inevitable that such losses will continue to some degree, I hope that the improved hire purchase facilities by way of grants and subsidised interest rate together with the fleet maintenance and advisory services schemes operated by the Board will help to keep losses to a minimum.</P>
    <P>One of the major aims of fishery policy is the provision of trained personnel at all levels.  The scheme for the training of boys as fishermen is making steady progress.  During 1964 54 boys were admitted to training and <Col N="2138" /> 50 boys have now completed residential shore courses at the Naval Base, Haulbowline and Cobh vocational schools.  I would like to take the opportunity to convey my appreciation to all who have contributed to the success of these shore courses and also to the skippers who have provided facilities for the practical training of boys on their boats.  Further applications from boys of not less than 16 years of age were invited recently and interviews at convenient centres will be held in due course.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme for training experienced fishermen as skippers 11 fishermen qualified in 1964 for certificates of competency under the Merchant Shipping Acts bringing to 51 the total number who have obtained such certificates since the introduction of the scheme in 1958.  A further nine fishermen are at present attending a course at Galway under the scheme. Three experienced fishing skippers also completed a special course of eight weeks' instruction in navigation at the Irish Nautical College, Dún Laoghaire. In the long term the training scheme will provide a nucleus of skilled men who will be able to hold their own with fishermen anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Work is progressing satisfactorily on the development of major fishery harbours at Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dunmore East; final decisions have yet to be reached on revised proposals for Howth and Galway.  Legislation is being drafted to confer powers for the compulsory acquisition of property required for these projects and to provide for the control and management of the major fishery harbours when completed.  Improvement schemes to be partly financed by State grants were approved during the past year for the harbours at Kilmore Quay, County Wexford, Cahirciveen and Renard Point, County Kerry, as well as for some smaller landing places around our coast.  Proposals for other landing places are being considered.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Estimate for extended scientific investigation of the species of fish in our waters with particular reference to shellfish.  Continued collaboration between the <Col N="2139" /> scientific team of the Fisheries Division and their counterparts in other countries is also proposed.  Recommendations by the American survey team in this field are particularly relevant.  The work is going ahead on the construction of a second research vessel which is expected to be commissioned during the year.  An alternative site is being sought for the fisheries research station at Galway; final steps in this matter are being pressed ahead and arrangements for the design of the building are in hands.</P>
    <P>Arising from the recent extension of the exclusive fishery limits under the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act, 1964, more scope will be provided for the operations of Irish fishermen.  While in accordance with international agreement certain concessions are being granted to fishermen from countries which have habitually fished our waters, foreign vessels will only be allowed to fish in the belt between three and six miles to the end of 1965 in areas where the limits are measured from the coastline, and to the end of 1966 elsewhere.  In the belt between six and twelve miles only fishermen from countries, the fishing vessels of which have habitually fished in that area in the ten year period before the end of 1962, will be permitted to fish.</P>
    <P>On the inland side I am glad to report that the high salmon catches of the previous two years were exceeded in 1964.  The total catch of salmon by all fishing methods was 3,012,664 lbs. in 1964 compared with 2,836,640 lbs. in 1963 which in itself was a record; thus for three successive years a high catch of salmon had been maintained due to very good runs of grilse.  In general the runs of spring fish were better than in the previous year but the small summer fish which formed the mainstay of the salmon runs in May and early June and the grilse run later in the year were really responsible for the increase.  Grilse continued to run up to October in many areas.</P>
    <P>Although the catch was higher in 1964 the quantity of salmon exported was slightly lower than in 1963, that <Col N="2140" /> is 22,900 cwts. as compared with 23,700 cwts. in 1963.  The prices obtained, however, were somewhat higher with the result that the value of exports in 1964 reached the record figure of £933,500.  The 1963 exports were valued at £857,000.  There were two factors which helped to maintain the high prices in 1964 that is the storing of large quantities of grilse taken late in the season for export at the beginning of the succeeding year and the smoking of suitable fish for export.  In accordance with long established practice officers of Fisheries Division paid visits to some of the main marketing centres for salmon in Great Britain to keep a check on the standards of Irish salmon as exported.</P>
    <P>Conditions for angling were reasonably good throughout most of the country last year and there were good escapements of fish into fresh waters. The spawning season was reported to be exceedingly good in most districts. A sharp rise in the number of rod licences issued took place in 1964 when a total of 11,600 licences were issued as compared with 9,700 in 1963 and just over 9,000 in 1962.  The weight of salmon taken by rod and line was 390,000 lbs. in 1964, an increase of 48,500 lbs. over 1963.</P>
    <P>These successful runs of salmon are in a big measure a tribute to the work of Boards of Conservators.  I may refer in support of this statement to the problem of keeping poachers under control.  The sale of salmon is a fairly lucrative trade and many people are tempted to take this fish illegally and dispose of it by irregular methods.  The law requires that anyone taking salmon should have a licence and there are heavy penalties for infringements, including loss of gear and even of boats and vehicles used in the illegal fishing. The outlets for salmon are likewise strictly supervised and anyone possessing a salmon by way of trade is liable to be required to account for it.  Even though the law against taking or having salmon illegally is quite stringent, the staffs of Boards are in many cases overtaxed in their efforts at protection. These Boards have to contend also with other forces which threaten the stocks such as dangers from pollution <Col N="2141" /> by sewage, peat silt and discharges from industrial concerns and also from agricultural by-products.</P>
    <P>As well as the protection of stocks, Boards are expected to take in hand projects of development by river improvement measures, such as by increasing and improving spawning areas, providing easier access for fish to upper waters and other works beneficial to the stocks.  Most of these are relatively small jobs which the Boards' staffs, sometimes in conjunction with angling associations, can tackle by themselves under suitable direction.  My Department is able to give adequate grants towards the cost in each case.  In addition to these lesser projects, there are others of a more elaborate nature which require expert planning and oversight; they usually are in the nature of overcoming formidable barriers in rivers to fish movements which prevent them ascending to higher waters where they would provide more sport for anglers and at the same time have access to additional spawning areas.  The engineers of my Department give every assistance in the planning and execution of schemes like this.  Details of other improvement works undertaken by the bodies concerned may be found in the report of the Foyle Fisheries Commission and of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>The State grant to the Salmon Conservancy Fund has been raised to £33,000 partly because the expenses of boards of conservators are unavoidably rising and partly in view of an intended scheme for reorganisation of key protection staffs of boards.  It will mean increased pay and pensionability for the men concerned.  The framework of the legislation necessary towards this end is at present being prepared.  One of the major projects financed out of the Fund was the salmon hatchery and rearing station at Cong, County Mayo which was completed last year and was officially opened in January of this year.  It went into operation on a limited scale and the output of ova during the 1964-65 spawning season was 210,000 ova.  The capacity is 1,600,000 ova and 270,000 under-year-lings <Col N="2142" /> and it is hoped to have it in full production during next season.</P>
    <P>I referred before to large-scale river improvement projects.  One of these was the fish passes at Ennistymon on the River Inagh which had been completed in 1963.  They were tested by means of an electronic fish counter and it was found that considerable numbers of salmon went upstream to spawn.  Positive evidence of spawning was found in the upper reaches of the river.  Investigations on other rivers have been undertaken and it is hoped that other major projects in this line may be put in hand shortly.</P>
    <P>Among the investigations in hands by the professional staff of the Fisheries Division is the application of electricity to fishery management and development. An experimental station has been set up at Glenties salmon hatchery, County Donegal where various aspects of the practical application of electricity to fishery investigations, management and exploitation are being studied.</P>
    <P>Outbreaks of disease in different areas were investigated during the past year; that at Waterville, County Kerry has given rise to the greatest concern. In the Cummeragh River at Waterville, heavy mortality was experienced in salmon and sea trout and special efforts were put in train to ascertain the nature of the disease.  Specimens of diseased fish were sent for bacteriological examination to the Veterinary College in Dublin where cultures were produced in an attempt to isolate and identify the organisms and, at the same time, specialists abroad were supplied with specimens and cultures in an all out attempt to solve the problem. So far the findings have been negative.</P>
    <P>Under the ordinary programme of investigation work was carried out in a wide variety of fields of activity all of which are of significant practical importance and as usual the staff of the Department continued to read scales and identify fish sent for identification.</P>
    <P>Rehabilitation of the salmon stocks of the River Lee continued to engage attention.  The programme of work <Col N="2143" /> comprises the following main heads:</P>
    <P> (i) assisting adult fish to move upstream past the hydro-electric dams to the upper spawning grounds and procuring the escapement of smolts downstream,</P>
    <P>(ii)  reduction of predators so as to secure the maximum survival of smolts. </P>
    <P>The assistance of university students has been enlisted by the award of bursaries for this and other projects.</P>
    <P>Investigations designed to encourage development of eel fishing and improved methods of fishing are also continuing.  Exports of eels during 1964 amounted to 6,512 cwt. valued at £91,776 compared with 3,125 cwt. valued at £45,313 in 1963.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government last year to increase its investment in the development of angling waters in the interest of home and visiting anglers has, I am glad to say, been fully justified. Estimated income from angling tourism rose to over £3 million in 1964 as compared with £1,760,000 in 1963, but as part of this increase is accounted for by the fact that estimated expenditure per head is now being calculated on a revised basis a more realistic basis of comparison is the increase in the number of visiting anglers, which at 89,612 showed a rise of almost 20 per cent over the 1963 figure of 74,924.</P>
    <P>These figures underline the importance of the angling development work being carried out by the Inland Fisheries Trust, Bord Fáilte and the various local development groups.  I am confident that there is still plenty of scope for further development and I would appeal for a continuance and extension of the spirit of co-operation which has contributed so largely to the success achieved to date.</P>
    <P>The State contribution to the Salmon Research Trust has been raised to a maximum of £2,000 in the present year representing roughly one-third of the running costs of that body.  The balance is, as Deputies are doubtless <Col N="2144" /> aware, paid by Arthur Guinness Son &amp; Co. Ltd., which also bears a large share of the capital cost of installations, equipment, etc. at the research centre at Newport, County Mayo.  I feel that it is only right that I should pay public tribute to the generous manner in which the company has contributed in the field of fishery research.</P>
    <P>Exports of rainbow trout continued to rise and in 1964 reached 3,092 cwt. valued at £60,921 as against 1,362 cwt. valued at £25,739 in 1963.  Three commercial scale fish farms are now in operation in addition to five smaller units.</P>
    <P>The provision for compensation under The Fisheries Act, 1939 is largely a tidying up one and is in respect of interest and costs in a small number of cases now in the process of final clearance.</P>
    <P>A research fellowship is being offered for award in connection with a project of research into the water purity conditions in certain rivers and streams with particular reference to their fishery productivity.  Irish rivers are, to a great extent, free from the damaging effects of industrialisation. However, to satisfy the requirements of the developing economy, the use of Irish water resources for industrial and domestic purposes is increasing.  The need, therefore, of some fundamental research into the effects of pollution has been recognised in order to provide information on which to base future policy for dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made again this year for three studentships in fishery science relating to sea and inland fishery matters, valued at £400 per annum each, which will be offered for competition to University graduates.  The studentship projects will be carried out in co-operation with the university authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, 14 bursaries in fishery science, at a total value of approximately £1,650, are being offered by the Department, Electricity Supply Board, Foyle Fisheries Commission and the Salmon Research Trust, for award to undergraduates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2145" /> As already mentioned the drafting of a Bill to deal with the Major Fishery Harbours Development Scheme is in hands and I hope that it will be possible to introduce it soon.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a new Fisheries (Amendment) Bill are also under consideration in my Department at present. This Bill will provide for a number of miscellaneous amendments to the existing fisheries law, including improved conditions for key staff of boards of conservators, superannuation scheme etc.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I feel that Deputies will agree that satisfactory progress has been made during the past year in the development of our sea and inland fisheries.  I trust that with the full co-operation of all sectors of the industry this progress will continue at an increasing tempo during the coming years.  Accordingly, I confidently recommend this Fisheries Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time the present Minister had an opportunity of introducing this Estimate and I should like to wish him every success in the Fisheries Section.  We should like to know if he proposes to continue the procedure whereby his predecessors in charge of Fisheries allocated that particular section to their Parliamentary Secretaries.  I think Deputies and the fishing industry generally would like to know that. We appreciate that the Minister will personally remain responsible but would like to know whether it is his Parliamentary Secretary we should contact on matters related to the fishing industry.  Perhaps when he replies to the debate, he will give some information on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishery industry is the second largest industry we have.  It comes after agriculture and, in my opinion, before tourism.  It is unfortunate that the House generally does not display the interest in it that is displayed in other industries.  One finds that only Deputies who reside in maritime counties and have some connection with the industry take part in the debate. We should like to see Deputies representing the consumers and the <Col N="2146" /> distributive branch of the industry taking some interest in the Estimate and making suggestions which I am sure would be welcomed by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the extension of our fishery limits.  I am inclined to be sceptical about the advantages of the limited territorial gains we have made.  We have not gone far enough.  We are aware that our territorial waters remain the same at the three mile limit but our fishery limits have been extended, as the Minister pointed out; but in the case of the west of Ireland our limit should be from a base line drawn from headland to headland and not from the headlands or points from which these base lines are now drawn.  I know it is not the Minister's function to deal with these matters : it is rather the function of the Department of External Affairs as they handled the matter at the Geneva and London conferences.  I think we made a mistake and that we should have done as some other countries did, that is, insist on our own fishery limits and say that we would protect them.  Countries who did that got away with it and gained considerably by so doing.</P>
    <P>The Icelandic Government, as we know, has extended Iceland's fishery limits and these are now internationally recognised.  I should like to see the independent attitude of Iceland taken up by our Government.  Genetics and economics compel us to go further to sea at the moment, to go right out to the Atlantic shelf.  As we know, on the west coast we cannot go more than 14 or 15 miles before we meet the Atlantic shelf, which is absolutely unfishable. I think we should have brought in all fishing waters right up to that shelf and prevent them being overfished by the foreigners with whom we must now share the fishing grounds out there.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 3 of the American survey team which visited this country made such a suggestion and said that positive steps should be taken to stimulate fishing on off-shore banks of the Irish continental shelf by Irish fishing vessels.  That, of course, <Col N="2147" /> refers to the Atlantic shelf but we must now share those waters with foreign Governments.  I think that is a pity.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is for a sum of £558,400.  Down through the years, we have made a serious mistake in associating our fisheries with our congested districts.  In the old days before the establishment of the State when fisheries were first organised, it was done by the old Congested Districts Board to cater for the poorer counties off the coasts of which we have the best fishing grounds.  I refer particularly to Counties Donegal.  Mayo, Galway, Kerry.  There are good fishing grounds off the coasts of Cork, Waterford and possibly the east coast, which have been completely fished out, but, there is still a lot of virgin ground off the west coast and it is a tragedy that we are still inclined to associate the ideals and ideas of the old Congested Districts Board with our fisheries and are inclined to look upon any grants in aid which we give to fishermen as social amenities rather than for the development of a serious industry.</P>
    <P>I always thought it a pity that Bord Iascaigh Mhara were not given the same power as, say, the Irish Sugar Company and the ESB have.  If a quasi-State body such as Bord na Móna or the ESB were set up to deal with our fisheries, we would be much better off.  When we did set up Irish Sea Fisheries and its successor Bord Iascaigh Mhara, we confined the financial aid which we gave them to very limited sums, but if such an independent body were set up and permitted to float a Government-guaranteed loan&mdash;because it is only by means of money that we are ever going to develop fisheries&mdash;we could make some progress towards building up this industry to what it should be.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that in dealing with our fisheries the old Congested Districts Board, the British Government and the Government of the State in its earlier years confined their activities entirely to pelagic fish.  Demersal fish were never regarded as a commercial proposition at all until 25 to 30 years ago.  Shellfish and pelagic <Col N="2148" /> fish were the only fish considered as being of any worthwhile commercial value.  Then we discovered and we now know that there is greater financial gain to be procured from demersal fish than there was in the days of the Congested Districts Board and the Minister's predecessors and all Governments within the past 20 years have done their best to improve demersal fishing and the methods of demersal fishing on our coastline, but unfortunately, at the same time, as the Minister has pointed out, our pelagic fishing has decreased.  He points out that last year there was a considerable decrease in pelagic fish, particularly herrings. I do not see any mention of mackerel at all in the Minister's speech but herrings certainly decreased and particularly on the south coast and off Dunmore, and the Minister gave reasons for it.</P>
    <P>I should like to inform the Minister that no later than three days ago I saw a telegram from Tory Island to say the coastline off Donegal is teeming with prime matje herrings, that there are no boats from which to catch them and no market for them.  As the Minister and his advisers know matje herring are rich in oil and require very careful handling, indeed, and up to date methods would require ice instead of the traditional method of salt. There is no ice in the vicinity of the north coast of Donegal and gear is not made available to the fishermen&mdash; special gear is required for matje herring&mdash;and no effort is made to procure a market, despite the fact that there is a scarcity of herrings throughout Europe at the moment.  It is a pity that some effort has not been made to improve pelagic fishing just as we are endeavouring to improve demersal fishing.</P>
    <P>We must proceed to procure large boats to go right out to the limits of the Atlantic shelf to fish.  I know it will be said that I was very much against the procurement by the Minister's predecessor of three large German trawlers for our fishing industry away back in the early fifties.  I definitely was.  I thought they were premature at that stage.  Now that we <Col N="2149" /> have the trained personnel, now that we have a fishing fleet manned by Irish fishermen, we must go in for and build bigger boats of anything up to 100 and 110 feet.  It was only quite recently that we had a seizure in Killybegs and saw some of the Spanish fishing trawlers landed there. Certainly, we have no boats or gear on our coast to touch what the Spaniards have for the purpose of deep-sea fishing.</P>
    <P>All this will require money.  It is for that reason that the Minister and the Government should seriously consider the setting-up of an independent body to man our fisheries, to float a loan to ensure that once and for all money will not be any object in the advancement of this most important industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the improvement of harbours.  That is a very good thing because harbours are an essential amenity to all fishermen.  If we have not got harbours ideally located, our fishing fleets run the risk of loss at sea.  Harbours must be safe. They must not be dispersed at too great distances from each other.  When boats of our fleet find it necessary to seek the haven of a harbour they should have them readily available.</P>
    <P>I am glad, indeed, to hear the Minister say that it is proposed to develop the harbours he has mentioned.  There are a number of smaller harbours. Deputies from the east, south and possibly the west, will pardon me if I omit to refer to the harbours in their areas and refer to some in Donegal. Deputy Burke and other Deputies when they come to speak on this Estimate will refer to harbours in their own localities.  In Donegal, there is a demand for the improvement of smaller harbours.  The Minister and the Government are doing excellent work in Killybegs but it is a long distance from Killybegs to Lough Swilly and in between, God help any fishing fleet that is caught in a northwestern or north gale on that coast.</P>
    <P>Something must be done to improve the smaller harbours and to give a haven of rest and shelter to fishing fleets when at sea.  I particularly refer to Burtonport, Kincasslagh and, in a <Col N="2150" /> lesser way, Bunbeg.  At Burtonport, a survey has recently been carried out for the purpose of finding out the composition of the bottom of the channel and harbour.  The survey is completed and, I assume, under consideration by the Department but I would appeal to the Minister to endeavour to expedite through his own Department or the Office of Public Works some immediate repairs at Burtonport where there are nine seine net fishing boats all the year round engaged in seine net fishing and demersal fishing and during a certain part of the year in pelagic fishing.  Unfortunately, for threequarters of the time, these boats are beached high and dry and cannot come alongside.  By the extension of the existing pier and deepening and dredging of the harbour, these boats could find afloat berths at all stages of the tide.  At Kincasslagh, there is an excellent harbour where boats remain afloat during all stages of the tide and once the wind backs out north or north-west, these must clear out of the harbour.  A breakwater is very essential there.  These things cannot be done overnight but it would be no harm if, in long-term policy, these matters were seriously considered by the Government. Even now if only plans were laid for the carrying out of these projects at some future date, good work would be done.</P>
    <P>Bunbeg has a natural harbour which would require some deepening and, if possible, it should be seen to.  We have on our coast one of the finest fishing harbours in Ireland at Downings.  Unfortunately, it is no longer a fishing harbour and the tradition of fishing has completely gone from the locality. I wonder if the Minister could do something to revive the fishing industry there because these fishermen are the nearest base to the Tory Island fishing grounds.  If something could be done to build up that marvellous tradition which existed up to the last world war, it would be a very good thing indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor appointed a number of directors to Bord Iascaigh Mhara but unfortunately the fishermen are not represented on that Board. That is something the Minister should <Col N="2151" /> remedy and I would appeal to him to consult the various fishermen's organisations when he comes to reappoint the directors and ensure that the fishermen are properly represented on the directorate.  This is the first time, not only on this board but also on its predecessor, the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, that the fishermen's organisations have not had representation. I would appeal to the Minister to remedy that fault, or oversight, as it may be, in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us the figure for the landings of fish in this State during the past twelve months, and the total landings amount to £1,505,000, in round figures £1,500,000.  Yesterday I had a question down to the Minister in reply to which he informed me that the fish imports into the State for the year ended 28th February amounted to £1,051,000.  There is only £500,000 difference involved between the landings of our own fleet and the imports of fish into the State.  That is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>We have set up fishmeal plant to process the surplus fish landed.  We process it into fishmeal for animal consumption and at the same time we import £1,051,000 worth of fish for human consumption.  If there is a surplus of fish landed in the State and we know there is a lacuna period some time during the year at which time there is a scarcity of landings, surely by means of deep freeze holding plants, it should be possible to use the surplus fish to provide for the lacuna period and thus obviate the importation of £1 million worth of fish during the year.</P>
    <P>This fishmeal plant business is being overdone.  It has become expedient to send fish to the fishmeal factory that we could send to a deep freeze holding station so that it could be used at a later stage when there is a scarcity of fish.  There is no use in our saying that our fishery industry is improving when there is this large importation of fish for the year ended 28th February, 1965, when in the year 1962 we imported only £596,000 &mdash; call it £600,000&mdash;worth of fish.  We imported £400,000 worth of fish more in 1965 <Col N="2152" /> than we imported in 1962, and that is no matter for complacency.  It is a matter which deserves the serious thought of all interested in our fishing industry.  I recommend to the Minister that he should consider very carefully the reasons for this large increase in fish imports while, at the same time, we are building in this State fishmeal factories for the processing of our surplus fish.</P>
    <P>We have got away from the original idea in the establishment of these fishmeal factories.  I understood that the reason fishmeal factories were first set up here was in order to process the offal, the bone, and possibly whatever surplus fish we could not hold in cold storage during a period of abundance. Now we appear to be catching fish for the pure purpose of processing it into fishmeal and, what is more, we are catching immature fish and doing considerable damage to our fishery stocks of the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the fish landings amounted to so many cwts. during the year and that the value of the landings amounted to £1,500,000, but he did not break down that figure to tell us what was the value of fish landings here by foreign vessels fishing for our fishmeal plants.  If that is broken down and added to our imports, it will be found that the actual value of the landings by native boats is not as high as the Minister states and would possibly only equate the amount of fish imported plus the amount caught by foreign vessels.  The Minister should examine that matter.</P>
    <P>There are on our coasts a number of boatyards and some two years ago Bord Iascaigh Mhara set up a maintenance gang&mdash;I will use that description for want of a better word&mdash;who were mobile and who moved from port to port.  These men surveyed and examined periodically the boats of the board and the fishing vessels of private individuals.  At the same time when urgent repairs were required to be carried out, this mobile gang did the job on the spot, charged for the labour and for the spare parts.  This was an excellent scheme.  The personnel of <Col N="2153" /> this gang were recruited from garages and other such concerns.</P>
    <P>I understand it is proposed by the board to abolish this maintenance gang and that will be very serious indeed because if a boat breaks down in Schull or any of the other ports where there is no boatyard, it will be necessary to have that boat towed to a boatyard and the repairs carried out there.  That will be to the disadvantage of the boat owner, and I would appeal to the Minister to impress on the board the absolute necessity of retaining this maintenance gang to carry out the surveys and urgent repairs to all boats fishing from our ports.  They were known as a mobile team of fitters and they did a considerable amount of work.</P>
    <P>This maintenance gang should be maintained at all costs&mdash;if necessary, subsidised&mdash;so that they will be on the spot to ensure that our boats are seaworthy. After all, the bulk of our fishing fleet is still the property of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and it should be their concern to ensure the boats are kept seaworthy and capable of going to sea at all times.  It would be a tragedy and a retrograde step to abolish the maintenance mobile unit and that should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara have now decided to divest themselves of some of the functions for which they were established.  They are no longer concerned with the marketing of fish. They have established co-operative societies in various ports.  There is also the National Fishermen's Co-operative here in Dublin.  That is duplication and I think it is a bad thing.  I am all in favour of co-operative societies but we should have just the one society for the entire State. If we are handing over to these the functions of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara then we should hand them over completely. All the fishermen are actually being asked to do is market the fish themselves.  The Board are retaining unto themselves what might be described as the profit-making branch of their activities.  If the Board are denuding themselves of the function of <Col N="2154" /> selling fish, then they should also hand over the factories to the co-operative societies.  I should like to know what is happening in these factories.  I refer now to the one at Killybegs and the one at Galway.  I know the Board buy and process fish in these factories but I should like to know to whom do they sell the fish that they process.  I should like to know what happens to any profits made on the processing and sale of fish.  I should like to know whether anybody receives any commission on the sale of this fish.  I should like to know why these factories were not handed over to the co-operative societies so that they could process the fish, make any profit to be made in processing, and thereby ensure they are not at the mercy of the fishmonger.  The Minister should look into this and ensure that, if co-operatives are set up, they get the advantages as well as the disadvantages of taking over from the Board what the Board had originally as their functions.</P>
    <P>On the question of distribution, I understand that the co-operative societies, other than the NFC, have nothing whatever to do with distribution.  The societies merely sell their fish at the various ports at which they are landed. What is being done at the moment about the distribution of fish throughout the State?  At the Spring Show this year Bord Iascaigh Mhara had a magnificent display.  It was really excellent. What a pity that there are not similar displays throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>For many years now I have been advocating the setting up of a frozen slab in each village and town in the State to preserve fish.  I remember advocating years ago the purchase of deep freeze vans for distribution purposes. In the early days of the first inter-Party Government, we insisted on Bord Iascaigh Mhara, or else the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, buying frigidaire vans.  For some reason the vans were left lying in their yards and eventually they were sold secondhand.  That is something I have never been able to understand.  Neither could I ever get any satisfactory explanation as to what became of these vans.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy agrees with <Col N="2155" /> me that there would be a greater consumption of fish throughout the State if there were continuity of supply.  With frigidaire vans and frozen slabs we could guarantee continuity of supply throughout the 12 months.  There is an onus on the Board to make available to fishmongers all over the country frozen slabs on which to display fish in a fresh condition.  These slabs could be let at a yearly rental.  In a very short time fishmongers would recoup their initial capital outlay, to say nothing of continuity of fresh fish supplies being guaranteed throughout the 12 months. That is what I should like to see happening.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister replies, he might find out from Bord Iascaigh Mhara what became of the vans which were purchased but never put into use.  At what loss were they sold?  If what I suggest is done we will cut out the middleman and make fresh fish available at a lower cost to the consumer. At the same time, we will give the fisherman a greater profit, a profit which is now being channelled through the middleman.  There is no reason why co-operative societies, provided they have the capital&mdash;this is something they could get by means of a loan&mdash;should not be able to distribute fish direct to the consumer, thereby reducing the cost and, at the same time, improving the price paid to the fisherman.</P>

      <P>I do not think that would help him in any way.  The Minister referred to our shellfish.  I shall be pardoned if I bring up once more my hardy annual, the berry lobster. Each year when I put down a question about lobster landings I am told they have gone up.  The value of our landings has gone up&mdash;there is no doubt whatever about that&mdash;but the weight of our lobster catch has gone down. I remember pre-1939 the price of lobsters in my locality was 9/- per dozen.  Today they are £5-10-0 per dozen.  But whereas then on a Saturday we had up to 40,000 dozen landed, today we are very lucky if we have between 6,000 to 8,000 dozen landed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numerical catch of our lobsters has gone down.  Why is this happening? The Minister's predecessor made a bye-law prohibiting the catching of lobsters under a certain size&mdash;I think, nine inches.  The trouble is there is no person to enforce that rule.  I have asked fishermen if any person examined their fish and they told me no.  I asked two civic guards what was the minimum size of lobster it was permissible to catch and they admitted to me they knew damn all about it. If we banned the catching of berry fish, any person could see whether a fish had spawn or not.  They have done so in England, Scotland and most countries of Europe.  I cannot understand why we do not do it.  We cannot <Col N="2157" /> export our berry lobster to Britain. The big market today is France and we are permitted to export them there. The Minister should have a serious look at this.  I cannot understand why we do not introduce a bye-law banning the catch and export of the berry lobster.</P>
    <P>What is being done about our shellfish, apart from the lobster?  We know some effort is being made to extend the fishing areas for the oyster.  Very little is being done about escallops. Around our coast there are abundant supplies of cockles, mussels and clam. We know the attraction of clam chowder to the American.  We know that most Irishmen do not know what it is because we do not commercially fish our clams.  If you buy a bottle of cockles and examine it, you will find they have been bottled in Boston, Mass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They bottle there in a small way.  It is something that could be encouraged and enlarged.  It is only in recent years they are doing it there.  The east coast is not the ideal coast for shellfish apart from lobster. The south and west coasts are ideal because the water is unpolluted.  We know in the Irish Sea we have pollution from both sides of the Channel. Something could be done, such as Deputy Donegan says is being done in Omeath, to improve the cockle industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago at the request of one of the Minister's predecessors I brought a bag of clams to one of the fish merchants in Dublin.  He was delighted to get them.  They were produced in one of the best-known restaurants in town.  Clam chowder was advertised and there was considerable demand for it.  Unfortunately, that man and Bord Iascaigh Mhara depended on my means of transport to bring these clams to Dublin.  I certainly could not guarantee them without some purification beds for them.  I thought I had done sufficient to prove, first, that there were clams available and, secondly, that there was a demand for them.  I thought An Bord Iascaigh Mhara <Col N="2158" /> might have followed that up.  I hope, if the Minister would make such a suggestion to them, it might yet be followed up.  There is an abundance of clams on our west coast.  They are used for bait for fishing lobster and longline fishing, whereas they could be used very much for human consumption.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest drawbacks in the distribution of fish is the cost of transport. In the old days when fish were transported whole, that is, unfilleted, one paid for the transport of the offal, the head and the bone and it added up to the cost.  With the location of these fishmeal factories the offal, the head and the bone are utilised there and only the edible portion is transported. Yet the charges for the transportation of the fish are really outrageous.  They are what is killing the industry and one of the things putting up the cost to the consumer.  There should be some method of subsidisation of the transport of fresh fish.  I particularly refer to fresh fish.</P>

      <P>The trouble about that, as I explained earlier, is this.  They are merely concerned with the sale of fish at the place of landing. They have nothing whatever to do with distribution.  If they had the distribution of fish, to where are they to convey them?  They cannot afford these various outlets in the villages and towns to which I referred.  If capital was made available to them, not only could they establish these retail shops but they could have their own transport for delivery to them at a much cheaper rate.  I am in full agreement with what the Deputy says.</P>

      <P>We have a number of private lorries transporting their own fish.  I am referring to the new co-operatives such as we have at Galway and Killybegs.  All they are concerned with is the sale of fish.  They have no share in the profit from the retail sales at all.  A lot of this could be done by co-operatives, such as Deputy Corish suggested, if we had many more of them.  We should have one co-operative for the entire industry. That would be much better than a number of co-operatives, such as we have at present.</P>
      <P>What the Minister says about all these advertisements, all these demonstrations, all these encouragements and enticements to consume fish and to cook fish is very good, but we would want to be careful how we go about these matters.  Recently, there was a fish cookery competition.  One of the dishes was the cooking of herring.  I wonder where did those herring come from?  No full herring are caught in this country at the moment other than matje herring, and it was illegal to catch them at the time.  They could not have been full herring so they must have been spent herring, which are not fit for human consumption. We should be careful that our technical advisers advise these people before they utilise some of these products to be certain they are edible, and that spent or inedible fish are not used.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the <i>Cú Feasa.</i>I consider it, or a similar ship, could do a great amount of good in the matter of research.  I do not consider the <i>Cú Feasa</i> is an ideal vessel but I consider it or a similar ship could be used to explore the fishing grounds or the external fishing grounds.  They could find out the size and source of the matje herrings off the Donegal coast.  They thrived away back around the year 1910.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to our drift net fishing.  I want to refer to our main driftnet fishing, salmon.  This is a very precarious life for these men.  I do not know what happens in most places but on the coast of my county they operate <Col N="2160" /> ten, 15 or 20 miles off the coast.  They are limited to five nights a week but nature will not give them five nights. If the night is too calm, there is no use in going out and if the night is too stormy, they cannot go to sea. It is a very precarious existence as I say, and I would appeal to the Minister to allow the net salmon boats to fish outside the three-mile territorial limit.  They should be permitted to land fish on Sunday night or early Monday morning.  That would mean, in other words, that only one night weekly was allowed for fishing during the two months in which they fished.</P>
    <P>I certainly would not permit the fishermen to fish within the three-mile territorial limit but if they fish outside that limit, they should be permitted to land on Saturday night.  They certainly will not fish the five nights a week and they cannot do a great deal of damage if they are permitted to fish six nights a week.  I put a question to the Minister to appeal to Radio Éireann to broadcast a weather report every night before these fishermen go out.  I feel the Minister did something about this because such a broadcast will now be given to the fishermen.  This will ensure that before they go out, they will know whether conditions are good, and if they go out and the weather gets bad, they will be able to get back.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question, may I say a few words about the Foyle Fisheries?  As we all know, the Foyle Fisheries are operated by the two Governments who have appointed a joint committee to operate them.  While I am not in a position to criticise their workings constructively or otherwise, I know for a fact that by limiting the number of licences which they are issuing to net fishermen, they are driving a number of men outside the country.  The other day I was approached by a man called Kenneth Weir.  He is a married man with five children.  He was a part-time fisherman and lives on 26 statute acres of a mountain farm.  His eldest child is six years of age and the youngest is nine months.  Up to the 1962 season he had fished as a crew member of a boat. He has procured his own engine, boat and gear in order to obtain a licence. <Col N="2161" /> Unfortunately, a licence will not be granted to him.  That is a very bad principle to set up.  Actually, in 1963, this man was able to borrow or lease a licence issued to another man.  That man has now taken his own licence again and this other man can no longer fish with it.  He is unable to procure a licence, despite the fact that there has been a decrease of four licences in the locality.  This young qualified part-time fisherman has been refused a new licence.  The Minister, and possibly his counterpart in the North, should look into the issuing of these licences and ensure that justice and equity is done not only to existing fishermen but also prospective fishermen in order to encourage them to remain on the land and take up this livelihood of fishing.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the boards of conservators and the good work which they are doing.  I admit they are doing very good work but there is one aspect of their activities to which I should like to refer, that is, attendance at the bi-monthly meetings.  They are not paid travelling expenses when they attend those meetings.  If we wish to have the fishermen representatives attend these meetings and if we wish to have the poorer section of the industry represented on them, the least they should be granted is travelling expenses.  The Minister should ensure that travelling expenses are paid to all members of boards of conservators.  I would appeal further to him to sanction increases in the amount paid by these boards of conservators to their waterkeepers.  Their waterkeepers have a very unpleasant, if I may use the expression, duty to do.  We know that not all of us have great respect for them but they are an essential part of the machinery of conserving our fishing stocks and they must be paid a reasonable wage.  It is ridiculous to offer £6 a half-year to a waterkeeper.  Actually he is only part-time but £6 for three months work is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>They have employed a mobile waterkeeper in my own board of conservators. I wonder if that is the ideal thing?  It would be much better if we employed local keepers and paid them a living wage.  Remember the boards have funds but they are not permitted <Col N="2162" /> to use them.  They must keep a reserve of at least £1,000 a year.  Although the boards have funds, they are not permitted to use the moneys which are collected by them in licences, rates and all the other methods of raising funds.</P>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust is certainly doing a very good job.  I am not very much in favour of these rainbow trout farms which have been set up. I am afraid they are creating a very bad impression abroad of the nature of the fish which we export.  The other day I happened to recommend rainbow trout as a dish to a man I met. He said he would not touch them.  He said he purchased them on the market in Dublin and they were soft, sloppy and tasteless.  When I made inquiries I found these were the particular fish which were raised on these rainbow trout farms.</P>

      <P>It might not be a bad thing at all.  While I am on the subject, what about kippers?  You can go into any hotel in the city and you will not see them on the menu. The Minister referred to the Dáil Restaurant and we should often see them on the menu there.  They are a very tasty dish.  When visitors from all over England go to the Isle of Man they buy a supply of kippers, pay for them in advance and they are then sent to them by mail throughout the entire year to the consignees. I think that the &ldquo;get-up&rdquo; now <Col N="2163" /> used for kippers for the market is ideal but, unfortunately, we are not seeing enough of it.  The marketing of kippers in cellophane packets is ideal. I am not too enamoured of the boning of the kipper as I think it takes away from the flavour, which can be so delicious.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister every success in his Department as Minister for Fisheries.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy P. O'Donnell, I wish the Minister a successful career in charge of the Department of Fisheries.  I must repeat what I said here on previous occasions on the Fisheries Estimate, when we had a change of personnel in charge of the Department, that it is remarkable that no man from a coastal area has been appointed to this portfolio during my term in this House and I think for some time previously.  I think it would be advisable if the Government appointed a person from a coastal area who has experience of fishermen, of fishing and of the many problems attendant on that industry.  The Government Party in particular have a large number of Deputies from coastal areas some of whom must be intimately associated with fishing.  It is a pity that some such person was not appointed to this portfolio&mdash;and when I say that, it was not a reflection on the Minister: I had the same thing to say when Deputy O. J. Flanagan, for example, was appointed to that office. I feel that a person from a coastal area would have a better knowledge of the <Col N="2164" /> difficulties confronting fishermen than a person from an inland area.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new or exciting in this Estimate.  It is just a repetition of what we had last year.  Deputy P. O'Donnell made a very comprehensive survey of our fisheries.  It amazed me that he should start off by telling us that this is the second most important industry in the State.  He should have said that it should be our second most important industry.  In its present state, fishing is not by any means an important industry in this country and that is evidenced by what the Minister had to say in his opening statement.</P>
      <P>We do not know the numbers employed in fishing.  We were not given that information.  However, we know the income derived from it.  Having regard to the income derived from it, I think the amount demanded by the Minister in respect of this Estimate is exceptionally high.  We have made no progress during the past year or in recent years; that is not the fault of the present Minister.  In his concluding remarks he says that Deputies will agree that satisfactory progress has been made during the past year in the development of our inland fisheries and that he trusts that that progress will continue.  Such progress could be improved upon if we had some new methods from those who are directing this industry.  With our thousands of miles of coastline, our intake of fish and our income from fishing should be much higher.</P>
      <P>During the present year, the income from sea-fishing, was £1,504,000.  Surely that is not a substantial figure in view of our very long coastline?  The return from our sea fisheries yielded only £1½ million.  I regret that that is a very small figure.  Away back in 1960, when money was much more valuable than it is today, our sea fishing yielded £1,612,000, according to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>

      <P>Having regard to the declining value of money, the position is not improving.  We must <Col N="2165" /> review the position and alter the regulations governing this industry.</P>
      <P>I should like a comprehensive account of the workings of Bord Iascaigh Mhara which is mainly in charge of our fishing industry. I should like to know what qualifications are taken into account in selecting fishermen for boats.  I should also like to know how it is that despite the close, careful, diligent consideration that is supposed to be given to all applications for boats a number of successful applicants fail to honour their obligations and to meet their commitments. The main reason why I am making that case is that I feel that people who are fully qualified and who applied did not get the consideration they were entitled to.  On the other hand, we know from page 3 of this report that, over a number of years, boats were given by Bord Iascaigh Mhara to people who were not qualified to manage or administer them the result being that they were unable to meet their obligations.</P>

      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the national agreement concluded in May, 1964, by the ESB and the trade unions regarding wages and main conditions of employment of manual workers in the board's service, which provides for procedures to be followed in dealing with disputes prior to reference to the Statutory Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recruitment to offices of a clerical or semi-clerical nature in the local authority service is a matter for each local authority subject to prescribed conditions as to qualifications, public advertisement and open competition.  A standard condition is that a candidate must be free from any defect or disease which would render him unsuitable to hold office and must be in a state of health such as would indicate a reasonable prospect of ability to render regular and efficient service.  Subject to compliance with that condition there is no restriction which would prevent the appointment of a person because of physical disability, provided he possesses the necessary qualifications for appointment.  In the case of employments other than offices, no standard conditions of recruitment are prescribed and local authorities have complete discretion in the matter.  It would not, therefore be appropriate for me to make a recommendation on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a recent question, the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill to extend the social insurance scheme to include provision for compensation for disablement or loss of life following occupational injury has reached an advanced stage and the introduction of an interim measure would accordingly not be warranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <P>The claimant concerned in the Deputy's question became incapable of work on 22nd February, 1965, and his illness terminated on 7th March, 1965, but he failed to notify his illness until 23rd March, 1965, that is, two weeks after he had resumed work.  The explanation given for the delay in notifying the illness was that the relative documents, that is certificates and claim form, had been mislaid.

I have said that this land is being kept under continuous review by the Land Commission.  No doubt the Deputy is aware of the unusual personal circumstances of the owner of this estate.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the State has provided valuable facilities and incentives to encourage the <Col N="2180" /> establishment and development of industries in all areas.  The initiation of industrial projects, however, is primarily a matter for private enterprise. The decision as to the most suitable location for any such project rests ultimately with the promoters and those proposing to invest their capital in it.  Local interests, however, have done and can do much to encourage industrialists to set up industries in their own districts.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> I am aware of the decision of Holdens (Ireland) Ltd. to close down. As the company has indicated in a published statement that the decision was taken after considering the present and future trading position and in the light of the demand here for the company's services, I cannot see that I could usefully intervene in the matter.</P>
    <P>In so far as the decision to close may have been influenced by the earlier take-over of a spinning mill, the prospect is that the overall effects of that development will be to facilitate adaptation to conditions of freer trade.</P>
    <P>I understand that the question of alternative wool scouring facilities is being examined by the wool trade. Any proposals which may be submitted to me in that regard will be fully considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my constant concern, and it is Government policy, to help to provide new industries because there will have to be alternative employment opportunities provided, especially in the context of freer trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Must the workers emigrate in the meantime or will the same thing happen in the case of Holdens (Ireland) Ltd. as happened in the case of the factory of Salts (Ireland) Ltd. with Sunbeam Wolsey? Will the same situation arise-that there will be a transfer to Cork, with consequent unemployment at Walkinstown? Will the Minister allow that situation to develop?  Will he allow monopoly acquisitions to cause unemployment with consequent emigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises that demand for the type of product manufactured had dropped, due to the <Col N="2183" /> increased use of other types of fibre and there was a resulting over-capacity in the industry as a whole.  The transfer to Cork made the Cork firm viable and economic.  It did just that. There was over-capacity in the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A national scheme for redundancy compensation does not yet exist.  When introducing the Estimate for my Department recently, I explained that it is the aim of the Government to create a situation in which workers who become redundant will be eligible for redundancy compensation and for retraining, if found to have the necessary aptitude.  As a compulsory scheme of redundancy compensation and retraining facilities is not yet in operation, I have no power to order that redundancy compensation or retraining facilities be made available to the workers mentioned by the Deputy.  The fact that a national scheme is not yet in operation does not, of course, rule out the operation of schemes on a voluntary basis by any individual firm or group of firms in an industry, as is, indeed, already done in some industries.</P>
      <P>I regret very much the position in which the workers in question have found themselves.  As the Deputy is aware, the creation of employment opportunities is an integral part of the Government's policy of industrialisation and is being vigorously pressed forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider, in view of the remarks made about the problem of redundancy in conditions of freer trade and its magnitude in the future, taking steps, pending the introduction of a comprehensive scheme, to provide a modified scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complicated matter and there are points in the Deputy's supplementary question which may or may not be valid. This is not a matter for Government action but mainly for employer action. In regard to this particular firm, there is some hope from the announcement made by the Board that the firm will effect some form of compensation because they said arrangements are being made for consideration to be given to employees in recognition of <Col N="2185" /> their service.  It is of course a matter for the firm but there appeared to be some hope. On the broad question, the position here and indeed in several other countries, is that the nature of the compensation payable has not yet been determined.  The situation in this country is rather different from that in other countries so that it would not be possible at this stage to take <i>ad hoc</i> measures with regard to this situation, unfortunate though it may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is connected with the anticipation of freer trade and many of these take-over arrangements and redundancies occur as a result of the employers' policy in relation to freer trade.  We must prepare <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements at present because there are people suffering as a result of the anticipation of freer trade.  Is it the position that we must wait for a full compensation scheme, although workers may be suffering in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be all that long before we are able to announce the general heads of our redundancy scheme.  I should hope in fact that we would be able to make an announcement in regard to the general aims inside the next few weeks. In the meantime, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Minister's statement in regard to this matter, that it is not routine redundancy, that it is due to a change in the market rather than anything to do with freer trade.  I should like to add that we have very much in mind the fact that this is happening and are treating proposals for the scheme as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The Irish Association of Master Bakers by letter dated the 16th November, 1961, gave notice of intention to increase the price of bread by ½d. per 2 lb. loaf on and from 20th November, 1961.  This increase and a subsequent increase of ¼d. per 2 lb. loaf which came into effect on and from 15th January, 1962, was investigated by my Department and, as a result, the then Minister replying to a question in Dáil Éireann on 15th February, 1962, said &ldquo;The investigations which I have made have satisfied me that the recent increases in the price of bread were accounted for by increases in costs, particularly the cost of labour&rdquo;&mdash;Dáil Debates, Volume 193, No. 2, Column 313.</P>

    <P>The Irish Association of Master Bakers and the Guild of Irish Bakers were informed by letters dated 22nd April, 1965, that I would not object to an increase of ½d. per 2 lb. loaf.  This decision was taken only on completion of a Departmental investigation into bread prices initiated in March, 1964, during the course of which two proposals to increase bread prices&mdash;the first on 9th July, 1964, and the second on 6th April, 1965&mdash;were received.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of my visit to the Continent was to attend the Berlin &ldquo;Green Week&rdquo;.  In the course of my visit I had the opportunity of having informal talks with members of the Commission of the European Economic Community and with a number of European Ministers of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The bulk of EEC agricultural imports is now subject to the Common Market organisation.  As a result, most agricultural exports from Ireland are free to enter the six countries concerned subject to the import levy system which has generally replaced quantitative and other import restrictions, and there is, therefore, no longer any question of negotiating markets or quotas for such exports.  I might add that the value of our exports of cattle and beef to EEC countries increased from £3.3 million in 1963 to £12.7 million in 1964.  Of the Irish agricultural exports which are not subject to Community regulations lamb is the most important.  This goes mainly to France which operates a minimum import price regime and our exports were maintained at around the £1 million mark in 1963 and 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards EFTA, the main agricultural market is, of course, Britain and, as already announced, the possibility <Col N="2190" /> of improving the permanent trading arrangements between Ireland and Britain is at present being examined by the two Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>The general rule is that if an application falls into one of the approved priority categories, arrangements are made immediately for provision of service.  If priority is not warranted the application is deferred pending the next general clearance in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present some exceptions to this rule.  In certain districts the work position is sufficiently advanced to enable service to be given on demand to all applicants.  On the other hand, there are a few areas where cases which would ordinarily be given priority are subject to some delay because of temporary shortages in local equipment.

    <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to a question by Deputy Treacy on 27th April last&mdash;Dáil Debates, Vol. 215, Col. 45&mdash;when I said that a comprehensive review is being made of the entire health services.  The matters mentioned in the Deputy's questions will be covered <Col N="2196" /> in this review.  As the introduction of free choice of doctor for general practitioner care would involve a radical revision of the district medical officer system, I have asked health authorities to refrain for the present from forwarding statutory requests to the Local Appointments Commissioners for the filling of such posts on a permanent basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>My Department contributes towards the cost of the conveyance of children to national schools in the following circumstances:&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) as an alternative to the grant of aid to a new school or the continuance of aid to an existing school;</P>
      <P>(b) to facilitate the attendance of handicapped children at special schools;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2199" /> (c) to provide educational facilities in Dublin City for children from certain areas pending the provision of adequate school accommodation in those areas;</P>
    <P>(d) to enable Protestant children for whom no suitable school is readily available to attend a school under Protestant management;</P>
    <P>(e) to enable children on small islands to be conveyed by boat to schools on the mainland. </P>
    <P>In the case of each such transport service my Department insists that a local contribution towards the expenses involved should be forthcoming. Each application for a transport service to a national school is considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>So far as post-primary schools are concerned, Vocational Education Committees may, subject to certain conditions, provide scholarships to assist in the defraying of travel expenses of pupils who live at a considerable distance from a vocational school.  A number of committees have such a scheme in operation.</P>
    <P>Roinn na Gaeltachta operates a scheme under which transport services for the conveyance of children in Gaeltacht areas to secondary and vocational schools may be established. Subject to certain conditions, that Department may pay up to 80 per cent of the cost of such services.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future provision of transport facilities to post-primary schools, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 73 of Wednesday, 19th May, 1965.</P>

      <P>Deputies will have before them now a revised Estimate for 1965-66 for my Department, the net effect of which is to reduce by £500,000 the amount originally asked for.  This follows on the specific Capital Budget reduction made in the Estimate for my Department relating to the grant for Foras Tionscal.  The revised Estimate of £7,044,000 for the year 1965-66 now compares with the sum of £7,778,330 <Col N="2209" /> in 1964-65, including Supplementary Estimates of £20 and £10 and shows a net decrease of £34,330.  I, accordingly, wish to withdraw the resolution and introduce a revised Estimate.  I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,044,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On that new motion I want to repeat exactly what I said. I do not mind whether the Minister misunderstands it or not.  The facts are quite simple.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce on 6th May came in and produced to this House Estimate No. 40 of the Estimates Book as being the policy of the Government and the Estimate which the Government wanted the Dáil to pass.  There were two explanations, as I said, for the approach in relation to that: one was that between 6th May and 14th May, Budget day, the Government in a panic changed the Estimate and reduced it.  With regard to printing, I do not believe the question of printing comes into it at all.  I believe what happened was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce came into this House and, as an untruth, told the House that the Estimate the Government wanted was the Estimate he introduced and moved that day.  Perhaps the Minister, in a mistaken belief that he was tied by budgetary secrecy, proceeded to do that but, in fact, the Budget programme was published on the Friday and he made his speech in this House on the previous day, Thursday, 6th May.  The Capital Budget which had the printed word in it was published the following evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in relation to the Financial Resolution, Parliament as Parliament cannot possibly carry on if Ministers do not come in and truthfully explain the purpose of the moneys for which they are asking.  It would have been perfectly <Col N="2210" /> easy for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he had wanted to do so on that occasion, to inform the House that he was moving the original printed Estimate but that there would be revisions in relation to it.  I believe that at that stage he knew there were going to be revisions.  I believe he agreed to the revisions.  But he did not tell the House and that is why I say the Minister did not tell the House the truth.</P>
    <P>I want to be quite clear on it.  I do not think the Minister can deny that he was himself aware on 6th May that the Estimate had, in fact, been revised by the Government.  If he says that he was not aware when he spoke on 6th May that the Government had, in fact, revised the Estimate, then I will of course accept his word that the Government did it behind his back.</P>
    <P>This Estimate, as I say, has been reduced, and reduced in the way I have described.  I venture to suggest that the revised Estimate in this form has been produced to the House only because of the row created here.  There is no doubt whatever that the Government hope to get away with this.  I will tell the House why.  The reason for this is that the Government did not want to make the gap between what is being provided by way of current income and capital expenditure appear too big.  That is why this Estimate was reduced in the way in which it was.</P>
    <P>All Estimates, when they are prepared in the December prior to the commencement of the financial year, are varied as the months pass.  That is why we have allowances for overestimation in the Budget because, as time goes on, the people in the Departments know that the full amounts they had originally thought in the previous December were likely to be expended will not in fact be expended.  The process is continuous during the whole year right up to the very end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>In this case there was a revision purely for the purpose of window dressing in the Capital Budget and my complaint against the Minister is not in relation to that window-dressing but in relation to the fact that he came in <Col N="2211" /> here on 6th May and did not tell the House that he had, in fact, already agreed to a revision of the Estimate. It is a revision of some consequence because the original Estimate provided for an increase of £465,000 over last year.  The revised Estimate provides for a decreased amount in the total Estimate of £35,000 this year as compared with last year.  That is a pretty substantial change in an Estimate, from an increase of £465,000 in the total to a decrease of £35,000. That was a material change which should have been put before the House on 6th May.</P>
    <P>As I said when speaking on the Financial Resolution, I was not going to be too hard on the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, if the Minister had come in here to-day and said he was sorry, that he had made a mistake, that would have been quite understandable in relation to a Minister going into a new Department, though, it was, of course, a mistake that should not have been made.  The fact is the Minister lent himself to a window-dressing performance by the Minister for Finance and, in so doing, did not tell the House the truth.  He did not tell the House a lie and I have never suggested he did, but he did not tell the House the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says I told an untruth but I did not tell a lie.  I did not know there was a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the Minister told a lie.  He told the House an untruth because he did not disclose the whole truth.  To tell a lie is to say something that is deliberately false. The Minister did not tell the whole truth and, in so doing, he told the House an untruth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This figure he is asking for now by way of reduced Estimate is in respect of the grant to Foras Tionscal.  That enables the House now to discuss these grants and I want to discuss certain aspects of them.  Since this debate was initiated, there has been a most disturbing situation in respect of one such grant.  Let me say at once that I accept that you cannot possibly avoid having <Col N="2212" /> mistakes and I agree that, if you are going to work on the basis of always playing too safe, you will not get anywhere.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the grants made by Foras Tionscal fall into two different categories: one, the grant for the building and the other, the grant for plant and equipment.  In relation to both, the same consideration applies, namely, that one should consider the amount of the grant that is being given in comparison with the amount of their own money the people themselves are putting up.  In relation to a building, I do not take the view that there should be as high a proportion of the owner's capital put into it as there should be in relation to the plant and equipment.  Any factory building that is put up will be there as a permanency and will be of some use to the community, even if the industry it was hoped to house in the building is unable to carry on.  Irrespective of whether the factory may be too large or otherwise, it can be divided up, and there is always the possibility of using the building.  As I understand it, the fact that the building remained was the governing factor in regard to the initial grants being given.</P>
    <P>The position is not quite the same in relation to plant and equipment.  Plant and equipment are virtually useful only for the industry or the particular purpose in mind at the time of initiation. It obviously, therefore, calls for a very much higher proportion of the owner's own money to ensure that the application has a substantial chance of success.</P>
    <P>Having made it quite clear that I support the principle of taking a chance in relation to factory building, I cannot understand why more care is not taken in certain respects.  How, for example, it is possible to give a grant for a factory building for a particular purpose and for the organisations giving the grant not to provide that town planning approval will be forthcoming before the grant is given, beats me.  I should have thought the discharge of cyanide effluent was something that was obvious to everybody to be a dangerous thing.  It seems to me therefore that when a grant is <Col N="2213" /> given, there should be proper inquiry about that aspect of the situation and that planning approval would be properly forthcoming before the grant is paid.  After all, we all know the Minister for Local Government will not pay a housing grant until the applicant is able to produce his town planning certificate.  If that is so, why is town planning approval not insisted on in all cases for a grant by Foras Tionscal? It seems to me an elementary precaution that should be taken and failure to do so shows a lack of planning somewhere.</P>
    <P>We have never been told&mdash;I asked the Minister for information the other day by way of supplementary question but, understandably, he had not got it with him&mdash;in relation to these cases that have come under discussion what the proportion of private money to public money is.  Perhaps it should be to the Minister for Finance as the shareholder and manager, so to speak, of Taiscí Stáit I should address inquiries in that respect?  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes that point, there will be an opportunity on the Estimate for the Minister for Finance of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>While there should be a forward policy, which must inevitably mean mistakes will be made from time to time and certain hopes will not come off, the benefit to be gained, if they do come off, is such that one has to adopt a wider policy.  At the same time, there are certain things which should be done.  One is to ensure that all proper precautions are taken to see that the planning is in order.</P>
    <P>In this House we work on the principle that the Minister is responsible for the acts of his officials.  That is the method on which parliamentary procedure works.  It is perhaps bad luck on a new Minister going into a new Department that he was landed with a baby on his table, as he was in this revised Estimate, when he came in here on 6th May and told the House an untruth but not a lie.  That is unfortunate. Certain of his colleagues who remained in the same offices and were carrying on in the same offices have not got that alibi.  When the <Col N="2214" /> Minister for Finance was speaking in the Budget debate, he was very careful to defend himself.  I make no charge against the Minister for Finance.  It was the individual Ministers who were wrong.  The Minister for Finance was right.  He published the full truth in the Capital Budget tables.  It would have been far better if the House when discussing the Estimates had also been told the truth and the whole truth at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke already on the previous occasion.  I understand what we are discussing now is mainly a procedural dispute as to whether the Minister should be compelled to bring in a revised Estimate because of a change in the Budget figures.  I do not wish to attribute to the Minister any ulterior motive in presenting the reduced sum now in the Estimate, a figure £500,000 less.  I do not know what reasons to adduce for it.  At the same time, the House expects the figures in Ministers' briefs to be true and correct in every sense.  It is a pity this omission occurred because it gives rise to suspicion and very likely will bring Government Departments into disrepute in the minds of the people. Whether or not it was the intervention of a general election that gave rise to these changed figures, I do not know. Certainly the Minister ought to tell us what the real reasons were.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to repeat what I have already said on this Estimate, I have to express the concern of my Party that the Estimate is so considerably less than that originally introduced.  At a time when we were supposed to be conforming to a programme of economic expansion, when we needed to accelerate the slow-moving wheels of industry and do something practical to increase agricultural output, at a time when we needed above all more employment opportunities for our people because redundancy was rearing its ugly head in so many important industries, one would have expected that the Estimate for this important Department on this occasion would have been increased out of all proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have other opportunities of <Col N="2215" /> raising these matters.  Suffice it to say that on the question of redundancy, the Labour Party have introduced a Bill which has been on the Order Paper for some time past.  We are looking forward with enthusiasm to the Taoiseach and the Government giving permission for this long overdue measure to be introduced, a measure which will give some people security and some form of reasonable recompense to workers who are disemployed after long years of service in many sectors of our economy.  These have had no gratitude shown to them by their employers and have been given no recompense of any kind.  They have been thrown out on the unemployment scrapheap as discarded products of industry with no regard for their responsibilities to themselves, their wives or families.  No gratitude is shown for their years of service well and truly given.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to say to the Minister, who is new to his office in Industry and Commerce, and whom I came to know best as Minister for Education, that I do not wish, nor do my Party wish, to be associated with any insinuations of ulterior motive on his part on the subject of the omission which has taken place.  However, we expect that he will give this House an explanation of what really transpired and we express the hope that such an omission will not occur again.</P>
    <P>We discussed the very many important aspects of the Department of Industry and Commerce on the last occasion and I do not think the House itself was prepared for a rehash of all the salient points of view.  There was, I feel, an understanding to facilitate the speedy dispatch of these Estimates and at the same time ensure reasonable scope for debate on them. It is not my intention to hold up the Estimate any further.  I would again ask the Minister to give the House a more detailed explanation as to how it came about that there is now some £500,000 less provided in his Estimate than there was in the original one.</P>
    <P>When the Minister came into the <Col N="2216" /> House with a revised Estimate, and it was regarded in all the circumstances that that situation should be challenged, I agree that it was appropriate that an explanation should be called for.  It is distressing and worrying in the extreme that we could have, to use a vulgarism, attempts made by any Government Department to cook the books or seek to present to the country the appearance of an Estimate which was on the face of it much in excess of the amount it actually transpired to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say is that I think the Minister personally underestimates the great depth of friendship there is for him on these benches.  During the retorts across the House, the Minister felt some aspersions were being cast on his personal character, but I think that tonight or tomorrow he will realise he was quite wrong.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy is quite correct, and I agree with him, that these matters must be examined but he is quite wrong when he says this is just nothing more than a matter of procedure. When we come here to debate Estimates, we do so on the information given to us in the Minister's brief and on the amounts of money set out for the various items in the Book of Estimates.  These are the first things a Deputy must look into and listen to if he is to contribute to the debate.  If any one sentence in the Dáil Debates is wrong in its approach, because wrong information was given, then the whole structure of Parliament falls down.  The position then is the Government become all powerful and Parliament is merely a rubber stamp.</P>
      <P>I believe it is absolutely necessary that the rigid interpretation of relations between Parliament and the Government should be preserved, and particularly that the interpretation which says that those who are Ministers should bring here the figures for the exact amount of money which they propose to spend and, if they spend more they should bring in a Supplementary Estimate during the year for one which should be so and so, should be followed to the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2217" /> As far as I can see, in relation to the revision of the Estimate, the things I said on the original debate, or the greater portion of that speech, still hold good.  If there had been the reductions then that there are now, I would, perhaps, have been in the position I am now in, of saying that the employment and industry is not what they tried to tell us it was.  In fact, there is some extensive slowing down. There is some extension of a deflationary aspect in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce which has been introduced by the machinations of the Budget, after the debate.</P>
    <P>I will introduce another aspect of this matter by saying that I think the Government never intended the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce to come before this House on the date on which it did.  I believe, in certain circumstances, the Minister for Agriculture is guilty that it came before the House on that date. There are times when it suits to be a slick chick and there are times when the slicker you are the more you catch yourself out.  I believe the behaviour of the Minister for Agriculture, in relation to his Estimate, which is something we cannot debate at this stage, resulted in the Minister for Industry and Commerce coming before the House and finding himself in this embarrassing position.  This is a case where the slick chick not only catches himself out but his friends as well.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are quite adamant, whatever personal friendly feelings we have for any individual Minister, that his business in this House will be examined clinically and in every detail.  That is not only our prerogative but our duty. I believe the Minister will probably agree with me when he thinks over this matter this evening or tomorrow morning. It is almost impertinent to suggest that the Minister is responsible not only to us but to the people who elected us. He is also responsible to the people of Ireland as well as to his colleagues and to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, with the exception that there seems to be a <Col N="2218" /> slowing down in capital expenditure, the remarks I made previously still hold good.  It seems that this slowing down will be extended in the next year and if that happens, there will be a lessening of grants.  I hope there will be no lessening of these grants and that this is the last occasion on which we will have remarks across the floor of the House about Ministers bringing in Estimates which, in fact, were not correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Deputy Sweetman dealt with one problem, perhaps a rather big one, the question of grants.  He adverted to some recent misfortunes which we have been sustaining in respect of one of our industrial undertakings, a certain industrial undertaking to which a grant of £750,000 was made.  I appreciate that in any industrial development venture there is always a calculated risk but it is reasonable to press upon the Minister the importance of trying to secure that the risk be kept as small as possible. I understand, for instance, that in the case of any grant over £250,000 special arrangements are made with the recipients. I should like to know if these special arrangements are arrived at individually in each case or on general terms.  I should like also to have a reassurance that, when special large grants are given, rigorous investigation is undertaken to try to foresee if the issue of the grants is a justifiable venture.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what advisory services Foras Tionscal have available to them outside their own resources. I am sure that in matters of very large capital grants it would be quite possible to get first-class industrial brokers, industrial advisory companies, in Great Britain, the Continent and elsewhere and I should like to know if we have listed any such bodies in our advisory services.  I do not think the entire responsibility should be thrown upon the limited resources of Foras Tionscal in the matter of a very large grant and if they require advisory services outside their own offices I should like to know if these services are available to them and if they are ready to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister's predecessor <Col N="2219" /> on one occasion to give us a list of industries which received grants or loans from the State and subsequently shut down.  I was told in reply to my parliamentary question that this information was not available.  I suppose it is bad propaganda to list one's mistakes.  However, we have a function here to be the watchdogs of the taxpayers' money and when we ask a question to find out how many fly-by-night gentlemen get money and then disappear we are entitled to get the round figure.</P>
    <P>The matter about which I primarily rose to speak is partly local and partly of a general nature.  On 25th May, 1965, I put down this parliamentary question:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is in a position to make a statement regarding the Cahir Flour Mill, County Tipperary; whether it is about to change hands involving considerable redundancy owing to a projected close down by the flour milling section of the factory; and if he has any proposals to make on the employment situation which may arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied as follows:</P>
    <P>I am not aware that the Cahir Flour Mill is about to change hands.</P>
    <P>It is possible, however, that the flour mill may close under the rationalisation scheme which was introduced by the Irish Flour Millers' Association to deal with the longstanding problem of excess capacity in the industry.  The Deputy will appreciate that, while I have certain statutory functions in relation to the flour milling industry, I am not in a position to require mills to remain in operation. </P>
    <P>The flour mill in Cahir is partly a flour mill.  It is also, I understand, classified as a Grade A mill and gives employment I am told to about 90 or 100 persons.  It has been represented to me that a change-over will involve the redundancy of half or more, probably two-thirds, of the employees and that the remaining one-third will be down-graded.  By that I <Col N="2220" /> mean that at the present time they are classified as flour mills but, under the new arrangement, they will be classified as compounding mills which means, I am told, lower wages and longer hours.  The position of the workers will adversely be affected but the position of those who will lose their employment will be very grave, indeed.  They feel there is nothing open to them except the emigrant ship. The town of Cahir is like any small Irish town.  There is no alternative employment that I know of locally and, therefore, from the point of view of these people, from a humanitarian point of view, it is a grave problem, indeed.</P>
    <P>Take a man about 45 or 50 years and ask him to emigrate with his family and start into some new form of employment.  Deputies will appreciate that it is almost an impossible task.  In many cases, it will mean the breaking-up of homes.  I can appreciate the Minister's attitude in this matter up to a certain point.  We hear these words &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;integration&rdquo;, &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo;, &ldquo;based upon excess capacity&rdquo;.  They are applied now to many of our industries and, with a view to efficiency and up to a point, I say it is a defensible situation. But a stage can be reached and I fear is being reached in this particular industry where we pass what might be called reasonable rationalisation, reasonable integration, into the more questionable and dangerous field of monopoly.</P>
    <P>The Irish Flour Millers' Association have been given power, apparently unfettered, to proceed with this process of integration which can only culminate in a monopoly by Rank and Odlum.  Six flour mills closed down two or three years ago and in Clare one mill closed down recently.  I would ask the Minister to tell the House at what stage he intervenes in a process of this nature and what powers of interference he has.  I understand that a grant was given a few years ago to this particular mill.  This brings me back again to the question of grants. Is sufficient thought given to the issue of grants from the point of view of <Col N="2221" /> what may happen in the future?  Will this House, through Foras Tionscal, give a grant to a company only to find it taken over in a year or two in the form of a take-over bid, with the industry to which the grant was given being closed down in the interests, we are told, of rationalisation and integration?</P>
    <P>I, therefore, make the plea to the Minister that there is a very grave danger in this of a rush towards making ourselves competitive for the Common Market and a rush towards adaptation and rationalisation, and of these practices being used as a cover to establish monopoly conditions.  I should like the Minister, if he can, to give me greater assurance than he gave me in reply to a parliamentary question on this, and I should like to know if in point of fact he will be prepared to receive a deputation from those workers whose employment is now so seriously threatened.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed today when I heard the reply on the question of redundancy pay and re-training facilities. The Parliamentary Secretary told us that a national scheme for redundancy compensation and re-training facilities was not for those, mind you, with suitable aptitude.  Apparently it was not to be universal, and the scheme was not yet in operation except in so far as what might be there on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>We are talking about going into the EEC since I came into the Dáil in 1961 and we are talking about adaptation procedures and we have CIO reports.  These adaptation councils have been in operation for the past few years.  Any form of adaptation or integration of industrial efforts will in itself carry redundancy.  Surely we, <i>pari passu</i> with these adaptation schemes being set up, will have a scheme for redundancy and re-training established practically simultaneously.  Now, after two years we were told in the House today that no national scheme has as yet been set up.  Probably tomorrow or afterwards, or after I have spoken and after we on this side of the House have kicked up a row, some activity will be shown by the Government <Col N="2222" /> as regards a scheme for redundancy compensation and re-training facilities.  I think it is a very negligent attitude on the part of the Government to proceed willynilly to a nation-wide industrial integration and at the same time make no provision simultaneously for the establishment of a national scheme for redundancy compensation and re-training facilities.</P>
    <P>I do not say that these schemes should be established on the same day but I do say that a time lag of two to three years between the time we started preparing for the Common Market and May 1965 is quite indefensible and shows complete negligence on the part of the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is a problem which has arisen in Cahir and in other industries elsewhere and a problem which will arise in other industries in the future.  That is inevitable.  I am not being over pessimistic, but just being realistic.  Now, I would urge upon the Minister to use his good offices to see that this national scheme for redundancy compensation and re-training is set up immediately. That is the only answer I can give to people who come to me and ask me what I can do for them.  It is pointless for me to produce this hazy, factitious answer which the Minister provided in reply to a parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>What use is that for a man who wonders where he will get a few pounds to buy the necessaries of life?  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to state specifically in his reply at what stage he will interfere, or does he intend to interfere, or what interference is he capable of executing, as regards the comprehensive integration of the flour milling industry.  Even allowing for a fall in the consumption of bread, even allowing for a fall in the amount of flour produced, surely there is some stage at which the Minister will intervene, rather than allow the flour milling industry and the baking industry to fall into the hands of a single monopoly. I do not think that ever can be good.  I do not think it is safe and if it is allowed to progress, as I fear it will, we will, perhaps, one day regret it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to state in <Col N="2223" /> his reply whether he would see a deputation from the workers at Cahir, if they wish to come and see him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I have one problem to deal with, if it can be done and that is, the question of an attempt by the Government to mislead the House. I have already explained that the Minister for Finance told the House that what happened this year is something which could happen any year in which Estimates are made early with a closer Estimate made possibly as a result of delayed publication of certain Government statutory documents.  These closer Estimates were given this year.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I took Deputy Sweetman too seriously.  He seems to separate me from the Government indicating that I was trying to hide something which the Minister for Finance had fully exposed and completely itemised. The Government do not work in sections.  The Estimates were originally published by the Minister for Finance early in the year.  The Budget came later and my Estimate draft was prepared on the basis of the first Estimate. A revision of the Estimate came about and was announced by the Minister in volume 215, No. 13 of the Official Report for Thursday, 20th May, 1965. I quote, if I may repeat, what the Minister said at column 1833:</P>
      <P>To prove that there was no attempt at non-disclosure of any reductions, the figures to which I refer were published in the &ldquo;Capital Budget&rdquo; which accompanied the pre-budgetary documents generally issued.  At page 4, paragraph 7, I stated clearly:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Estimates Volume was published, the actual detailed figures for last year's capital expenditure became available and it was possible, in the light of these figures and other up-to-date information, to arrive at closer estimates of the amounts needed to carry out this year's programme.  The relevant amendments of the figures published in the Volume are indicated in <Col N="2224" /> Table 6 which sets out the Voted Capital Services in detail. </P>
    <P>There is a detailed statement of the reductions provided for in Table </P>
    <P>At column 1834 he also said:</P>
    <P>There was no attempt at non-disclosure by me.  It was all fully set out in the &ldquo;Capital Budget&rdquo;&mdash; not only that but it was fully itemised as well.</P>
    <P>How the House could feel that one Minister was speaking about publishing and itemising changes and, at the same time, feel that another Minister was hiding all these things that were spoken about, published and itemised, I cannot see.  I should certainly like to point out that this was not an exercise in window-dressing.  It was a revised Estimate based on later information.  I should also like to say to the House that if it turns out that the expenditure requirements of Foras Tionscal within this year are greater than anticipated at present, I will ask the House for further sums by way of Supplementary Estimate.  Indeed, I have taken this first opportunity of introducing the revised Estimate to the House for discussion.  It will be the pleasure of individual Deputies to decide whether or not there has been an attempt to mislead them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to indicate whether the revision had taken place before or after 6th May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite honestly, I have not got the dates in my mind, but there was certainly no attempt to mislead. If there had been an attempt to mislead, there would have been a much better combined effort.  Another Minister would not be speaking about it, publishing and itemising it, if I were trying to hide it.  That would be very bad team work which you would not get from a single Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grants paid to Foras Tionscal last year amounted to £3¼ million.  The revised estimate for 1965/66 makes an additional £¼ million available, as compared with the actual expenditure in the previous year.  It is felt at the <Col N="2225" /> moment in the light of last year's expenditure that this revised provision is adequate.  As I say, it may be necessary for me to come back and seek further money later in the year, and certainly if Foras Tionscal need further finance, I will be back to ask the House for it.</P>
    <P>This has happened in other years.  I do not think there is any substantial difference between this and the ordinary allowance for over-estimation.  In view of the fact that there has been no attempt at non-disclosure as explained by another Minister, I regard it&mdash;and I think Deputies will accept it&mdash;as a technicality that a revised Estimate has to be introduced.  There is no slowing down in the tempo of grant sanctioning. Sanction has not been reduced and the Estimate now before the House is one relating to the amount of cash that will be taken up against grants approved.</P>
    <P>About a fortnight ago, I dealt with some points in terms of industrial development.  I think I said the whole basis of industrial development, and the success of our manufacturing industries and of our marketing drives, was to give employment at home for our people.  I should like to start now by saying that industrial expansion, expansion of employment and increased exports, are not blessings that descend miraculously from the sky, nor can we afford to regard them as a question of being lucky.  As I said on the last occasion, there is a great deal to be done by our industrialists and the Government have a very important part to play.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the first question I should now answer relates to grants given by Foras Tionscal to private enterprise setting up industry, because that matter was raised a few times.  Some Deputies raised the point that foreign capital was accepted uncritically, and that foreign industrialists were encouraged to do work for which Irish capital was available. I explained to the House before that all industrial proposals from foreigners, and from everyone, are very carefully examined by Foras Tionscal and the IDA.  If an Irish interest with capital is anxious to engage in industry, <Col N="2226" /> the same grants are available as are available to foreigners.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggested that there should be a review of grant-aided industries, and since bouquets are being passed across the House, I agree with him, too.  In 1961, it was my predecessor's intention that there should be a survey of the Industrial Grants Acts and it was his intention that Foras Tionscal would make a review of the grant-aided industries. However, in that year the possibility of our entrance into the European Economic Community became imminent, and Foras Tionscal were very busy looking for schemes for enlargement and adaptation grants to assist industry to meet the competition of free trade.  The new work placed a heavy strain on the staff, and this survey was placed in abeyance.  I want to say now that the survey will be done. It will be initiated at the end of this year, and it will be well worth while doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on the last occasion that ordinary competition and the movement of markets make it very difficult for any firm to predict its future. Indeed, in other countries, too, many large firms have to face sudden changes in their markets which make it difficult for them to survive.  So far as they could, the Government have been helping our industries.  They have been encouraging the formation, within <Col N="2227" /> separate industries or sectors, of adaptation associations and councils, and giving adaptation grants.  I am sure the House will be interested to know that yesterday a new adaptation council was formed at a meeting held in the Department of Industry and Commerce in the fruit and vegetable processing industry.  This included representatives from both the public and private sectors of industry and it was agreed that an adaptation council would be established.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley suggested that the grants available for adaptation would be far more widely used if parties were aware of their existence.  Much has been done already by the CIO in this respect.  They issued a publication <i>Preparations for Conditions of Freer Trade,</i> and in that were included details of special loans and adaptation grants. The Industrial Reorganisation Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce prepared a booklet, <i>A Guide to Principal Forms of State Aid and Services for Irish Industry,</i> which gave information on all sources of aid for industry, giving names, addresses, telephone numbers of the various organisations, making it easier to facilitate contact.</P>
    <P>This booklet was issued to 3,500 firms and subsequently 2,500 others received it through contact with the Industrial Reorganisation Branch. There has been a continued demand for this guide and a revised and up-to-date edition will issue shortly.  Outside interests took up this matter and one of the leading banks issued a brochure modelled on it.  An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Credit Company issued leaflets about grants and loans and their availability.  The facilities have been mentioned regularly by members of the Government in public statements. The Industrial Reorganisation Branch are continuing to emphasise the importance of the question.</P>
    <P>The picture painted of the use being made of these grants is not as bad as Deputies thought.  The number of grants and loans approved represent a capital expenditure of just £28 million. In addition, applications for these <Col N="2228" /> grants and loans under examination at the moment represent a further £6 million. As measured by applications for adaptation grants and loans from the 26 industries surveyed by the CIO, almost 50 per cent have re-equipped themselves.  The picture, of course, varies from one industry to another.  In some it is as high as 90 per cent and in others as low as 20 per cent or less. Apart from a few black spots, the overall picture is one of widespread capital investment which should leave industry in a strong position, as far as the economics of production are concerned, when the grants cease in March of 1966.  In the meantime, it is intended to draw public attention to the industries which have been lagging behind in this respect.</P>
    <P>A big number of individual questions by Deputies would, perhaps, take a long time to answer but the question of what the regulations are under which grants are made I can deal with. A firm applying for a special grant should be able to establish that it would be adversely affected by freer trade and that the proposed adaptation measures would enable it to withstand the competition freer trade would entail.  There have not been any grants for bakeries.  Presumably it is not felt they would be adversely affected by freer trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the position in regard to bakeries was that An Foras Tionscal had indicated that where bakeries were near the border they could not be expected to survive in an atmosphere of freer trade as easily as others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a further point to be established by a firm seeking a grant.  The first point is that a firm would be adversely affected and the second is that the adaptation measures they proposed with the help of the grant would enable them to survive. Absence of one of these would rule out a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be prepared to consider applications from bakeries for grants?  My information <Col N="2229" /> is that bakeries were not entitled to grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter for An Foras Tionscal to decide that. They certainly have not made any such grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have refused them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably because they felt one or other of the two rules was not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I make this point in the most serious way.  I cite the case of a bakery employing 200 workers who have been told that in conditions of freer trade they could not survive if they sold bread made from flour from different sources across the border. They were told that for that reason they would not get a grant.  Consider the position of the employees there.  I am asking the Minister to look at it very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at it.  A Cheann Comhairle, I do not think we should have this up and down business. Deputy O'Leary suggested&mdash;I do not think he meant to make an assertion&mdash;that the trade union advisory councils should not have any obstacles put in their way in the matter of receiving full information.  I have been unable to unearth any instances where obstacles have been put in the way of trade union advisory bodies.  It may be that contact between adaptation councils and these bodies could be closer.  Some of the councils are not long established and have been busy within themselves working out their programmes and mode of action.  My Department encourage contact between the trade union advisory bodies and the adaptation councils and have advised the councils of the necessity for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee on Industrial Organisation, in dealing with the creation of adaptation councils, stated it would be essential that the councils would consult with the trade unions in matters of training of personnel and of redundancy. They recommended the union bodies should be consulted.  I do not <Col N="2230" /> think Deputy O'Leary meant to assert that there were, in fact, obstacles put in the way of the trade unions but rather that he hoped there would be better co-operation.</P>
    <P>Having geared themselves for the difficulties of freer trade, our industrialists will have to find markets.  It is a matter of producing an article of good quality at the cheapest possible price and having it delivered.  Deputies spoke about the prospects of wider markets.  I think there have been a fair number of statements from other members of the Government, from the Taoiseach in particular, on the question of our external trading arrangements. Our relations with the UN Conference on Trade Development was raised and the Minister for External Affairs dealt with it on his Estimate. Some Deputies spoke of industrial relations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing from grants, would the Minister say why An Foras Tionscal do not insist on town planning permission as do the local authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <P>Concluding the second time under great difficulty.  I should tell the House I am very conscious of <Col N="2231" /> the need for an overhaul, and the possible modernisation, where necessary, of our industrial relations machinery. I have been talking about export markets and of our industries competing with the developed industry of other countries.  Time and again stress has been laid on the importance of these export markets for the future of this country.  This will affect the whole industrial and social life of our country. In developing these markets, we are up against the keenest of competitors and the time has come to ask ourselves honestly whether we can afford to carry a severe handicap in the form of haphazard wage negotiations accompanied by disruptive strikes or threats of strikes.  We as a community must expect problems of industrial relations to become wider in extent and more varied in character and as a community we must find a solution to these problems or as a community we will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>An incomes policy perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Wage Agreement of 1964 gave some promise of orderly progress and we should all be not alone prepared but anxious to go a long way in our efforts to maintain that progress.  Industrial relations are complex and I am sure all Deputies would agree that in launching into a study of the field, and in our efforts to bring about peaceful progress in it, we should start our efforts by consulting both sides of industry. My predecessor took the initiative here and met the representatives of employers and workers who are now considering outline proposals which he put to them.  Since I took up office, I have indicated my anxiety for an early resumption of these discussions.  It is not necessary for me to say that the existence of industrial relations machinery is not in itself a guarantee of stable industrial peace; we will have to look for a willingness on the part of everybody concerned to use that machinery with patience and goodwill and to work for the common good rather than for sectional interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of industrial relations <Col N="2232" /> is quite distinct from the question of a manpower policy.  The question of manpower is one of the availability of a pool of workers and the availability of posts and jobs for these workers.  It is a matter of skilled workers of various types and therefore basically it will have to be a matter of forecasting the availability of labour and the needs of our industries for the various types of skilled or unskilled labour.  Training for these special skills for industry is required and also a policy will be required in relation to the redundancy which is bound to occur in parts of the structure of employment and redundancy will have to be met by replacement which might in turn often require retraining where the worker has the aptitude. It will require also redundancy payment. This, as I say, is a problem all in itself.  It requires urgent study and in fact my predecessor had already prepared the draft heads of a Bill to deal with the new concept of industrial training.  It is hoped to bring that Bill before the House at the earliest possible date.  In the meantime, we have made arrangements for the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Seán Flanagan, to give special attention to this matter of manpower.</P>
    <P>The reference I made in introducing the first Estimate for this year was intended not as a policy but rather as an indication to workers that the human problems were first in our minds.  It is not easy, for instance, to get the staff of the forecasting team, which is a highly specialised staff. It is not easy to forecast.  That has been found in other countries.  We are dealing with a new problem and other countries are dealing with it as a new problem.  It is an urgent problem but it cannot be dealt with quickly but it will be dealt with as energetically as possible.  As I said, my anxiety when introducing the Estimate was to allay any fears in the minds of workers who may feel themselves vulnerable in the period of changing patterns of employment which must arise in the future.  They have already arisen, as they must, as a normal part of the life of any industrial country, but they will arise in the future.  The attitude to manpower, <Col N="2233" /> while we set out to deal with the human problems first, will be that there will be more jobs available than will be extinguished and our problem will be to train to the necessary skill and to retrain people with the necessary skill to fulfil the needs of industry and get adequate employment.</P>
