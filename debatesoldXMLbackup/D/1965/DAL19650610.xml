    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2 to delete article 2 and to substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" />&ldquo;2.  This Order shall not come into effect until such time as the full amount of the yearly burden which will be thrown on the ratepayers of the County of Cork by this Order is duly ascertained either by agreement between the County Council and the Corporation or on appeal to the High Court by either or both of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My reasons for moving this amendment are fairly strong.  I have to take the House back to an agreed extension of the borough boundary made in 1953. Full consent to that extension was given by the county council in January 1954 and compensation was applied for.  It took from then until 1961, when the present proposals were before the Department of Local Government, for a decision to be come to on the amount of compensation.  The amount applied for was £26,000.  At the end of the period they gave us, in the goodness of their hearts, £11,000 as the final settlement.</P>
    <P>That is my first reason for moving this amendment.  I do not think anybody could say I am a lover of members of the legal fraternity.  I am not in favour of appeals to court.  On the occasion I mention the arbitrator was sent down to make a final decision.  If it took him six and a half years to decide on £26,000, how long will it take him to decide on £5,250,000, which is the amount involved in this Bill?  The Minister is anxious to fix 1st July as the date.  I do not know what is behind this.  Seeing that the rate for the area has now been struck, there should be no hurry until 31st March, unless an endeavour is made by some disappointed gentleman to further bedevil the position in regard to the compensation.  There is no justification for any rush in this matter before the 31st March next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very reasonable amendment in all the circumstances. The Minister cannot blame us for being very suspicious about what can happen in the future in view of our experience in the past, not alone in Cork where the pattern was something like a four years purchase <Col N="661" /> or 40 per cent of the added burden, but also in Limerick and Waterford. The county council are highly suspicious that on this occasion the same pattern may be followed.  There is no undue haste, or there should not be, in making this Order until such time as the matter has been financially settled between the council and the corporation.</P>
      <P>I know it has been said, and will be said again, by the corporation, that they are prepared to meet all our demands but once the Order has been made, it will be very easy to have further discussions when it can be said that they were not committed to meet our demand.  I suggest, in all fairness, that the Minister should consider this amendment and give the council and the corporation an opportunity of arriving at a final settlement before the Order is made.  The council should not be put in the position of lumping it or liking it, that we have no other choice.  It is the Minister's responsibility to see that there is fair play in this matter.  This is a matter that in all probability will come up, I suppose, in the future in relation to other places.  It would be well to set a proper pattern now for determining the compensation.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Second Reading of this Bill was being debated, I expressed the viewpoint that I was in favour of Cork being administered as a unit and that the boundary should be extended.  I am well aware of the large sums of money put into the development of that part of Cork city which is at present in County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the compensation offered was entirely inadequate and, consequently, I agree with the terms of Deputy Corry's amendment.  I believe there was no justification for the hasty manner in which this Bill was introduced. Before the Bill was brought in for public discussion in the House a committee should have been established by the council and the corporation to determine fair compensation for the extension of the <Col N="662" /> city boundary.  That has not been done.  It should be done before the Bill is given effect to.</P>
    <P>Any person who owns property, whether it be public or private, will not sell that property or part with it until he knows what the price for it will be.  I do not see why the local authority should allow their property to be taken away from them without knowing what the exact price for it will be.  It is quite unfair and unjust to ask Cork County Council to hand over this highly developed part of their county.  As I stated here on the last occasion the Bill was being discussed, this is the plum part of the county so far as the county council are concerned. It is quite unfair to ask them to hand this over to the corporation without first being told what compensation they will obtain for it.  That matter should have been settled beforehand by discussion. The question of compensation should be determined before this measure is given effect to.</P>
    <P>As I stated during the discussion the county council had with the Minister, this Bill should be deferred until 1st April, 1966.  In the meantime, every effort should be made to hammer out an amicable arrangement between Cork County Council and Cork Corporation as to a fair assessment of compensation.  The closest possible co-operation should exist between Cork city and county because one is dependent on the other.  I like to see Cork city develop in the way it has been developing.  I hope it will grow further and that within a number of years they will look for a further extension.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister's advisers were not fair to us in Cork in pushing through this Bill without first giving the people of Cork an opportunity of settling their differences amicably.  If Cork Corporation and Cork County Council had been given that opportunity they would have settled this matter in an amicable manner.  Agreement would have been reached in regard to compensation without Party members having to vote against each other on the Bill.  That position has been brought about by the hasty manner in which the Bill is being rushed <Col N="663" /> through the House.  The Minister would be well advised to defer discussion of the remaining Stages so that an amicable arrangement, so far as compensation is concerned, may be arrived at.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry mentioned that we were terribly disappointed on the last occasion that Cork Corporation got land from the county council because there was a delay of some years in the payment of compensation.  When the compensation was paid, it was eleven twenty-sixths of what we thought it should be.  We expected to get £26,000 but when we received the compensation, after waiting a number of years, it was £11,000.  We got no details whatsoever as to how that figure was arrived at.  We just got a bald statement that the compensation in respect of the extension was £11,000.  There were no details whatsoever given as to how that sum was determined.  If a cattle exporter sends a hundred cattle to England and receives a statement that the price is £20,000, without any further details, he will not be satisfied.  I consider that we in Cork could not be expected to be satisfied with the figure in the absence of any further statement.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to defer further discussion of this Bill.  He has an opportunity of doing that now.  The Report and other Stages will be coming on later.  I am reasonably satisfied that if the Minister gives the people of Cork an opportunity of settling their differences so far as compensation is concerned, which is the main issue at present in the Bill, the House will be saved a great deal of trouble because there will be no delay in regard to the remaining Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want briefly to add my voice to those of Deputies Corry, Burton and M.P. Murphy in appealing to the Minister to defer the implementation of the Bill and to agree to what Deputy Corry asked for in the amendment.  The Minister will recall that prior to the general election, he met a joint deputation of Cork Corporation and Cork County <Col N="664" /> Council.  What I said in the privacy of the room I will say in public now. It was my view then and still is my view that Cork Corporation were and are entitled to an extension.  On that day, the Minister agreed with us, the same Minister for Local Government then as we now have in this 18th Dáil. He agreed that we had that problem. We agreed with them and we agreed with our fellow-members on Cork Corporation that the only problem to be resolved was this problem of compensation, the amount and how it was to be paid.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Murphy has said, it is quite true to say that we who are members of Cork County Council have no anxiety or desire to come into this House, face members of Cork Corporation and start arguing with them about a problem which, in my opinion, could easily be solved in a businesslike and commonsense way.  I am now appealing to the Minister to allow us to resolve that problem ourselves.</P>
      <P>We who are members of Cork County Council represent the ratepayers in the council and speak for them here this morning.  They are sensible people.  They see the problem as we see it and they want fair play and justice.  I think the matter can best be resolved by leaving this problem over, and if we cannot resolve our difficulties, the Minister has another way out.  I am appealing to him to let the fixing of compensation be decided upon first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points have been covered by other speakers. Very briefly, I want to add my voice to what has been said.  Unlike some of my colleagues, I do not agree that the extension of the borough boundary is something which Cork Corporation were entitled to have.  I feel there is no case for this extension but, now that it is about to be perpetrated upon us, the least we can expect is immediate and fair compensation.  I have in mind in particular that the southern area of Cork County Council will certainly be an impoverished area as a result of this boundary extension.  In fairness to that area, I appeal to the <Col N="665" /> Minister to ensure, before this Bill becomes law, that compensation will be made to Cork County Council and that no increased burden of rates will be placed on the shoulders of people in the Cork County Council area affected by it.</P>
      <P>I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Corry's amendment on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion here of putting back the proceedings in order that Cork Corporation and Cork County Council can get together to decide the price, as it were, of the boundary extension was pretty aptly paralleled by Deputy Murphy when he instanced the situation of the cattle going to England. I wonder if the expectation is that the money will be sent across here before a man sends over his cattle? This really is the parallel I would draw with the situation proposed here, namely to decide on the amount of the money and then to settle the boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boundary stands on its merits as an extension required and desired by people on both sides of the borough boundary of the present day.  That having been decided, I think it quite obvious that the follow-on should be an arrival at the amount to be paid. To do otherwise would, I feel, be very unsatisfactory.  Undoubtedly it would encourage protraction of the time of arrival at any agreement.  If agreement can be arrived at by postponing and reversing the order of things, there is no reason whatsoever, to my mind, why agreement cannot be got on the present Order, as proposed.  There is no reason why the two groups should not get together and arrive at their figures of compensation and I would merely have to give my approval to what would have been agreed to between the two bodies.  I cannot see that there is any reason why that is not possible.  It is my hope that that is the way in which the matter will work out and that neither I nor any arbitrator will have to intervene at any stage to determine a dispute between the two Cork councils.  I feel that they will <Col N="666" /> come together and arrive at a fair and just solution which is satisfactory to both parties.  That is my belief and I hold that it can follow in the order proposed, that is, the borough boundary extension decided and known and the calculation of the compensation to be paid then to be something on which I hope the two councils will agree.  This I think is the obvious way to deal with the matter and it is the way in which it is proposed in this Bill it shall be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a last appeal to the Minister on this.  I am not one to oppose this Bill lightly. Neither am I one who considers that the result of the previous extension was satisfactory.  I have a responsibility as Chairman of Cork County Council to look after the interests of the ratepayers of that county in this House. I now appeal to the Minister to let this amendment through or, if not, to postpone the matter.  We are prepared to get three members of Cork County Council to meet three members of Cork Corporation, with the managers of both councils&mdash;either the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary acting as Chairman&mdash;to hammer out a friendly agreement.</P>
      <P>As one who has been practically in co-operation with Cork city all my lifetime, I can say that it is no pleasure for me to raise a matter such as this in this House.  I raise it in the bitter knowledge of what happened the last time when, after eight years, a sum of £11,000 was awarded when the £ was worth 12/6.  Again, I appeal to the Minister.  Being a reasonable man, I am sure he will agree with the amendment.  Let the whole thing stand over and let us see if we cannot hammer out an agreement between the two councils with the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary presiding over the proceedings.  Harder and tougher matters than this were hammered out before.  Surely this iron-mailed fist with which this is being shoved through here is not the way to meet anything in this country today?  I make that last appeal now to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may repeat myself on this matter, the issue <Col N="667" /> is very simple.  What Cork County Council want to know is what compensation they are to get before parting with their territory.  That is the simple issue.  I cannot see any justifiable reason why the Department should not agree to that.  Every person selling property knows the price before he parts with it.  Cork County Council are, according to the tenets of this measure, parting with this territory without knowing what price they are to get for it, or without knowing what compensation they are to get for the extension.  I think that as the present boundary has existed for several years, to defer this extension until 1st April, 1966 will not impose any hardship.  In the meantime, the compensation to be paid could be determined fairly and squarely.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to cattle being exported to England and how prices are determined.  If the Minister as a farmer were to go to a fair in Donegal, would he part with a cow and say: &ldquo;Take the cow and we will talk about the price afterwards&rdquo;?  He would not, but that is what he wants Cork County Council to do, to hand over their property, very valuable property so far as income is concerned and a highly developed part of the county where large income from rates is collected to the Corporation and say: &ldquo;Look, we will talk about the price afterwards.&rdquo;  Surely that is nonsensical.</P>
      <P>Whatever way the voting will go on this matter, I as a Deputy from Cork, although I have agreed to the extension of the city boundary, am opposed to the methods adopted for the assessment of compensation.  Compensation should be assessed before the boundary is extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that between now and the next Stage the very sensible suggestion made by Deputy Corry might be put into operation.  The <Col N="668" /> six Cork people, without the assistance of the Minister, might get together, as suggested by Deputy Corry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be when the Committee Stage has been passed and when the manacles are on the hands of the county council.  The Minister says they can come in now and agree, but that is not the attitude the Minister should adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall not talk about attitudes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>£300,000 of the ratepayers' money was given in grants to build the property there.  In addition to that, £4 million is guaranteed by the county council.  We hear a lot today about people looking for housing grants, but we have no trouble about that.  As far as we in Cork County Council are concerned we have given these people in the area now being taken into the city loans to the extent of £4 million to build houses.  This money is being repaid each year without fail.  That is why I want agreement now, friendly agreement, if possible, on this matter of compensation.  Otherwise, I should like to see a man from that area coming in tomorrow, or even from what we call the scorched-out area outside a three mile radius of the city, to the county council looking for a loan to build a house.  There is nowhere else they can get the money because these fellows have not five bob.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the corporation are concerned, they are withdrawing their loans because the Minister refuses to pay the interest on the money.  Let us be clear on what is happening now.  I am making a last appeal to the Minister on this and let us get this thing over with.  Do not have us coming in here with manacles on our hands and feet, tied up ready for delivery to the slaughterhouse.  That is what I am trying to prevent here.  I am asking the Minister, therefore, in this last appeal to agree to the amendment, or else let the Bill stand over and take up the proposal I have put before him, namely, that three members of the county council and three members of the corporation under the chairmanship <Col N="669" /> of himself or his Parliamentary Secretary hammer out an agreement on it.</P>

      <P>What I want to do now is make this final appeal in a most sincere and sensible way to the Minister, who I believe to be a sensible man.  I cannot for the life of me see what harm will be done by the delay in the confirming of this Order for some months.  If the Minister adopts the attitude now that we as Corkmen will in our own time make every effort to resolve this problem in an amicable way, he will be doing a good day's work in not pressing for a division. Deputy Corry will be doing a good day's work by not talking about manacles.  I am making a final appeal to the Minister to let the Corkmen resolve this problem, and give them a few months in which to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the question of the council being manacled if this amendment is not accepted.  The fact is there are no manacles whatever.  Even when this Bill is put through the House, I will not have then made the Order.  Until I do make the Order, there is no final commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not personal matters.  As far as I am concerned, I am merely doing this as part of my job.  I believe it is the proper way to do it.  Last March I asked the Corkmen to get together and really pursue this matter.  From what I have heard here today, very little headway has been made and I do not see what <Col N="670" /> purpose would be served by continuing to draw out the time within which these proceedings should be dealt with. I do not see how much nearer it will get us to a conclusion on the extension of the boundary which was sought by the Cork Corporation in 1960.</P>
      <P>Again, as I say, nobody's hands will be tied merely by the passing of this Bill.  Nothing is tied until the Minister for Local Government, consequent on the passing of the Bill, makes the actual Order confirming the whole proceedings.</P>

      <P>By way of coming to a conclusion, will the Minister call the Cork people together?  I plead strongly with him to defer consideration of this matter for some months, until such time as we can meet and try to arrange an amicable settlement of the dispute.  I feel strongly about keeping this from the House until that has been done.  Had the Minister agreed, we might have reached a satisfactory settlement.  To say the least of it, the Minister's attitude is dictatorial and we do not like dictation in this matter.  We do not like bulldozing methods.  We want things done democratically.  The system adopted by the Minister and his Department, if I may use the term, of pushing this Bill through is not a democratic system.  We do not like that.  We do not like bulldozing or dictatorship, and as a result we will divide on this issue and make our protest as vehement as we possibly can.</P>

      <P>I remember these things. I am certain that I am putting forward a solution to this matter which will at least leave friendly relations between the corporation and the county council. We are all in the one county, and whether we like it or not, we have to live together.  I do not want to be put in the position of having to build outside that area a shopping centre in <Col N="672" /> which the county ratepayers can deal, but if I am forced to it, I will do it. I can foresee the result of what is happening here today on the ratepayers in the county and city.  Would the Minister agree even to act as chairman of the joint committee I suggested, or would he have his Parliamentary Secretary act as chairman?  Can we get an answer on that point from the Minister?  I want to make it clear that I do not want an official.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>A nice team of rural Deputies.  I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4 to delete sub-article (4) of article 6 and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a)  A sum shall be paid by the Corporation to the County Council for a period of fifteen years of the annual increase (if any) of the burden which will fall on the ratepayers of the County as a consequence of the extension of the boundary of the City by this Order.</P>
      <P>(b)  The following matters shall be determined by agreement between the Corporation and the County Council:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the amount of such sum and the period or periods by reference to which the annual increase of burden shall be calculated;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the method and times of payment of such sum.</P>
      <P>(c)  If the Corporation and the County Council fail to agree upon the matters specified in the preceding sub-article, the High Court shall, upon the request of either the Corporation or the County Council, fix the amount of such sum and the method and times of payment of such sum.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In doing so, I should like to point out that in the matter of the previous period considered, when we agreed to ten years with the corporation, it was purely a question of corporation property being brought into the city and nothing else.  No further area was involved. In this case there is involved an area that has been built up out of county council grants, loans and facilities&mdash;water, sewerage and so forth.  It is an entirely different position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, by some famous financial juggling, told us the other day that a ten-year period was better than a 15-year period.  I suggest to him that he points that out to representatives of ground rent landlords and see the answer he will get from them. When Dublin was being extended, the manager in the case was manager for both county and city and in such a position he had to hold the scales <Col N="674" /> evenly between both sides.  He decided on a 15-year purchase period.  Therefore, I can see no justification for opposition to this.</P>
    <P>A joint deputation of Deputies and Senators for the county and city of Cork met the Minister on that point. I pointed out that the 15-year period had been agreed on for Dublin and he said: &ldquo;Oh, yes; but there was agreement. If you can get the city to agree with you, I am prepared to allow 15 years&rdquo;.  At the same time, he did not say he was fixing a 15-year period. In plain language, there is in all Departments of State a city bias, an attitude that rural communities do not count.  That is the attitude adopted by every Department of State I have dealt with particularly the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I am moving that the full 15-year purchase be given in this case and that the burden which will fall on the ratepayers of the county on account of this shall be assessed each year and not in the ten-year period.  For example, as between the application for the extension of this boundary and the sworn inquiry the rate demand in Cork county increased by some 20/- in the £ and as between the date of the sworn inquiry and the present date valuations outside the city have gone up by £18,700, while the valuations inside the city have remained static for a long number of years.  The Minister stated the other day that he had no information about that.  There is none so blind as he who will not see and I suggest that it is a case of will not see with the Minister in these matters.  I can give him examples of at least 25 small shops in the Cork suburbs, outside the present city boundary, which are carrying a higher valuation than large drapery shops in Patrick Street, the principal street in Cork.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring to get fair compensation for the property being taken from us.  I have already pointed out, in regard to the £300,000 grants for housing given by the Minister's Department in that area, that the Cork County Council have equalled these grants pound for pound.  If we got a £300 grant for a new house, we immediately met that with a £300 <Col N="675" /> grant from the ratepayers and a sum of £300,000 has been given by the ratepayers in that fashion.  Instead of looking, as the Minister is looking today, to this little body and that little body for loans for housing, we in Cork County Council prepared our own loan scheme.  Under that scheme we have given to people wishing to build new houses in Cork county £5 million and of that sum £4 million is on loan to the area now being taken over by Cork city.  What further advances are to be made there? Remember, Sir, we advanced that at a period when our rates returns were at a very low ebb.  Now there is practically a full return of rates; the seven-year period is up and they will be getting the full return from those people.  This is the time Cork Corporation have stepped in to grab this area. If the spirit of co-operation which we offered this morning had been accepted by the Minister, we might have been prepared to continue loans to them.  Where is the man who wants to build a new house to-morrow to obtain a loan now?  The corporation have ceased lending.</P>
    <P>Again, I say that the amount of such sum and the period shall be ascertained and the times of payment shall be calculated and I also state that if the county council and the corporation &ldquo;fail to agree upon the matters specified in the preceding sub-article, then the High Court shall, upon the request of either the corporation or the county council, fix the amount of such sum and the method and times of payment of such sum.&rdquo;  I am putting that in instead of what the Minister has, an appeal to the Minister. I am doing that in view of past performances, in view of the six and a half year period during which the previous application for compensation was lying on the dusty shelves of the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Let us have an end to this.  The compensation claim has been practically agreed upon by both the corporation and the county council for the 1965-66 period and the amount of compensation due for those 12 months would be £350,000.  Therefore, at its worst <Col N="676" /> the difference between the ten- and 15-years purchase is the difference between £3½ million and £5¼ million. I claim that having borne the brunt of it, having paid one year's compensation out in grants to the people now being taken from us and of having had the trouble of finding £4 million in loans for people desiring to build private houses, we are entitled to get at least 15-years purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister has not got a more open mind on this matter, because if he had, this discussion could be much more fruitful.  It is obvious that he has his mind made up.  Possibly he feels bored with this discussion and hopes it will be over as soon as possible. Nevertheless there is an obligation on us to address ourselves to this question.  I do not entirely agree with Deputy Corry's second amendment because he is much too modest in his demand for a payment period of 15 years.  My view is that this should be at least 20 years.  That is the least period that would be in any way adequate, having regard to all the factors in this question.  However, I accept the 15-year period proposed by Deputy Corry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our bounden duty here as representatives of County Cork to ensure that the rates assessment that will be placed on them as a result of the extension of the boundary will be fair and just and that adequate compensation will be forthcoming from the corporation.  I am sure the Minister is not so blind as not to see the agitation that is arising all over the country regarding rates.  In Cork county the average rate in the towns is over £3.  At present people are finding it difficult to meet their obligations. We have been advised by the county manager and other senior officials of the council that the repayment which the corporation propose to make would place an unfair burden on us and it is our duty to seek in this House justice and fair play for the county and also for the city, and we stress the desirability of making amicable arrangements, but the Minister instead of being impartial, has shown by his contribution <Col N="677" /> here that he has gone over entirely to the city.  The points of view expressed by the corporation are the points he has in mind and it seems he is not open to change them.</P>
    <P>Rates are a big question.  I hope the present trend is temporary but we find that many people, including public bodies, cannot now get money from sources from which it was quite easy to get it heretofore.  We read of the difficulties of Dublin people in getting money to build houses and as a result there is a slump in the building trade in the Dublin area.  We hear of Carlow County Committee of Agriculture, in what I think is the most fertile county in the country, not being able to get £16,000 to build central offices even though the buildings have been approved by the Department.  If the Government had changed as a result of the last election, we would have had big headlines in the papers now in view of the trend of events. The Government paper would have had scare headlines across its main page.  We know what happened in 1956 and 1957.  We would be told that the Government had changed and house-building was slowing up, that public bodies could not get money to meet their requirements and to provide for desirable buildings, and that people could not meet their rates commitments.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should appreciate that they have a most tolerant Opposition that is neither unfair nor unjust but very constructive and one that is not criticising the present trend which we hope is a temporary one; but there is no doubt that many people in County Cork, and I am sure the same applies in Cork city and elsewhere in Ireland, find it difficult to meet their commitments to local authorities in respect of rates.</P>
    <P>We have been told in Cork County Council that the rates burden spread over the different divisions of the county varies from 5/3d. to 7/3d. as a result of the extension of the boundary and that urban authorities will average about 3/6d.  Those of us from the county say that we must have adequate <Col N="678" /> compensation.  That is what we have been trying to impress on the Minister and the Department since this question arose.  We stressed the desirability of meeting and discussing the matter; we pleaded with the Minister but he had his mind made up. We know the views expressed in the county council and whether the members were Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Farmers or Independents, they were unanimous on the question of compensation. It must be conceded to Deputy Corry that he is the only member of his Party to have come into the House and upheld the views of Cork County Council on this question.</P>
    <P>We were unanimous in feeling that there was an obligation on us to get fair compensation, even though differences of opinion existed as to whether this Bill should go through or not.  I believe the 15-year period is the least possible period and I think Deputy Corry is very modest in that demand.  It will serve no great purpose to labour this point much further because it is obvious that the Minister has made up his mind.  That is undesirable particularly in the case of a Bill such as this.  We feel an obligation to ensure that county ratepayers will not bear an unfair burden so far as we can prevent it.  That is why we are taking up the time of the House this morning.</P>
    <P>The part of the county to be taken into Cork is miles from me but I have taken part in discussions at county council level, at private meetings and in this House, and I have pleaded that the people concerned should be safeguarded.  Many of them objected to this extension originally and some may still object, but I say, as one miles away from them, that their position deserves close examination and whatever arrangement is made in regard to the rates burden placed on them requires close and diligent consideration so that they will not be unfairly treated.  We were trying to get justice and fair play for those going into the city and for those remaining in the county, but due to the dictatorial attitude adopted by the Department in this matter, we were unable to arrive at <Col N="679" /> the friendly and close relationship and the friendly agreement we had hoped for.</P>
    <P>It is a sad thing that Cork Deputies should be trotting out in the Dáil differences between themselves and differences between themselves and the Department.  I believe there was enough common sense on the part of the Cork people to realise that if they discussed this matter in a peaceful and amicable way, an amicable decision could be reached which would be to the general advancement of county and city.</P>
    <P>In that part of the county which is contiguous to the present city boundary it may be found there will be reluctance on the part of the county council to make available loans for building in the area, bearing in mind that it may be taken into the city in a few years time.  There may be obstacles to giving public sanitary services, water supplies, sewerage schemes and so on to which, of course, the people would be entitled.  It is regrettable that this kind of disagreement arose in determining the compensation.  If we had a different approach by the Minister and the Department, I believe the difficulty could be overcome to the benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, while I do not agree for a moment that 15 years is adequate.  I expressed the opinion before that at least 20 or possibly 25 years would be a fair and equitable period to fix in relation to compensation.  Like Deputy Murphy, I regret that it is necessary for the Cork members to be arguing here, taking up the time of the House, but they have responsibilities and it is to be regretted that all the county councillors who are members of the House do not seem to accept their responsibilities in the same way as others.  I do not think it was necessary that the Government should have a Whip on this matter at all.  Surely county councillors from Cork county who have the honour to be members of the Dáil should be entitled to express their views and act according to <Col N="680" /> their conscience?  Seemingly, they are not getting the opportunity.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is treating this matter too lightly, taking away 12 per cent of the county valuation and 22½ per cent of the South Cork area and taking in a highly developed area of increasing revenue every year.  It should be taken into account that there is a great portion of Cork county as yet undeveloped, not fully developed as to amenities, if I may put it that way, and, unfortunately, the people in that portion had to pay their share to develop the area that is now being grabbed by the city for no other purpose than finance.</P>
      <P>As I said before, and say again, it was not necessary for any local government purpose.  One half-acre of it was not required for any local government purpose.  Still, they seem to have got the ear of the Minister and the Department now, so that no matter what they do it will be sanctioned.  That is a very unfair outlook and attitude on the part of any Department.  As has been said already, there is an indecent haste and urgency about trying to put through this measure.  As one who attended a conference with the Minister prior to the introduction of the measure, I understood that we were to be given an opportunity of arriving at an understanding and agreement before the measure would be introduced to either the upper or lower House.  To our amazement, during a busy period, we were informed that the measure was introduced.  That was very unfair.  I cannot see the necessity for the urgency.</P>
      <P>While I know we are wasting our time here, it is our responsibility as conscientious members of the county council, representing rural areas, to focus attention on the injustice that is being done to the remainder of the county&mdash;it cannot be described as anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting to Deputy Corry's amendment, while I again express the view that 15 years is not at all adequate, I would support the amendment in preference to the ten years mentioned in the Bill.  While it is mentioned there, <Col N="681" /> we know what we may get in the finish.  While I appreciate what Deputy Corry is doing here as chairman of Cork County Council, I have come to the conclusion that we are wasting our time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to add my voice to the voices of other speakers in support of the amendment proposed by Deputy Corry.  It does appear obvious now, as has been mentioned by Deputy Burton, that we will get little satisfaction as a result of any debate on this matter but we feel in conscience bound to raise our voices here on behalf of that big section of the people in Cork county whom we represent as councillors and are privileged to represent also in this House.  I should like to ask the Minister at this stage does he agree with it or does he accept the statement of the Cork County Manager that extension of the borough boundary in the ways proposed will have the effect of increasing the rates on the ratepayers in Cork County by anything from 5/- to 6/- in the £?  I wonder if at this stage the Minister would like to answer that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the only thing we can do is to tell the Minister, as the Chairman of Cork County Council will tell him, that we have examined these figures in conjunction with the manager and senior officials in Cork and reluctantly had to accept them as being true.  If that is so and if we accept them, it is placing an intolerable burden on the ratepayers of Cork county and any Minister for Local Government cannot accept that position lightly.  It is for that reason that we are asking here that at least a 15-year period be allowed for the payment of the annual increase.</P>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the absence of Cork Corporation members this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is acting for the Corporation.  There is no need for their presence.  In fairness to Deputy Wyse, he has been present <Col N="682" /> during all this discussion.  That should be recorded, because he has been most attentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, I remember distinctly occasions when members of Cork Corporation went to great rounds to explain that as far as they were concerned they were quite prepared to give adequate and full compensation. I think the members of Cork Corporation and the Cork City Manager will agree with us if they want to put that into effect, they must agree that a 15-year period is the least term of years that could be accepted in justice and in honesty.</P>
      <P>I am appealing to the Minister at this stage to agree to change the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; in the Bill to &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and at least give the rate-paying people of Cork county some indication that he sees the seriousness of their plight as a result of this borough boundary extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a song and dance being made about this 15 years versus ten years.  When it has been discussed for a little while, those who are not for the ten are not even for the 15 but would accept the 15 rather than the ten.  The precedent quoted for this is Dublin and the skit about the manager agreeing with himself has been retold.  I have heard that until it has worn rather thin.  It does not impress me in the slightest.  I should like to tell Deputy Murphy and others that I am not here on behalf of Cork Corporation.  I am endeavouring not to be prejudiced by the manner in which the case for one side only is being put against all the arguments and all the odds that have been there, reasonable and known, in the past.  They are still being twisted around, up-ended and used merely for the sake of argument, and I am still, as I say, endeavouring to keep an even balance about this and not to allow myself to be prejudiced by the case being over-exaggerated from one side, and one only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely expressing what I feel about what I have heard and I am free to do that also. The provisions of this Order follow, not just one isolated incident such as the Cork agreement on the 15 years of some years ago, but rather does it follow the well-established principle laid down in the Dublin Act of 1930 and followed since then in Limerick and Waterford and, indeed, in the much discussed extension of Cork in 1955.  These were ten-year periods and I would say again that the ten-year period with interest has got the edge slightly on the 15-year period as arranged and agreed in the Dublin case.</P>
      <P>As I say, the precedent is there, well established, in the many cases dealt with in this way.  The one exception scarcely proves the case that the change should be made and, as I have already observed, the change to 15 years on the basis of the Dublin settlement would not be to the advantage of Cork County Council.</P>
      <P>Many other matters have been raised here that have no relevance whatsoever to what is under discussion and I do not intend to comment on them.  I shall not go further than refer to the question asked by Deputy Barry, if I agreed with something a manager said in some circumstances in Cork some time ago.  Without intending to give him a short answer, I certainly would need notice of all the circumstances and of the context in which it was said before I could even hazard a guess as to whether the 5/- or 6/- increase in the rates has any substance in relation to this matter.  I shall not comment on it in any way, lest it might be ministerpreted at a later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was, but we are not discussing the Limerick payment at the moment.  Is the Deputy suggesting that if an agreement is made someone will welch on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the utmost amusement, I shall listen to the terms of purchase under the Ground Rents Bill when it is introduced and whether a ten-year purchase or a 15-year purchase will be offered to the grabbers who are drawing millions of pounds in ground rents from this country.  The Minister has only one instance where the one person was both city and county manager, where the one man had to decide on justice as between the ratepayers in the county and the ratepayers in the city, and he decided that the 15-year purchase was just as between ratepayers of the city and the ratepayers of the county in Dublin. That was the only case.  I do not mind what was done in Limerick where, as Deputy Burton said, they broke every agreement they made.  I suppose they do the same thing in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I would warn rural Deputies that what is our case today may be their case tomorrow, and I am amazed by the lack of support for these amendments. I noticed what happened this morning.  Deputy Barrett came in here with a watching brief under his arm. There was a whisper between the boys and it was decided that the Minister would very well take charge of the city bias in this matter and uphold the city standards.  Deputies who represent rural constituencies are not blind and this extension agreed upon today and the amount given for it will be reflected in every urban town within the next two years.  Then we shall see rural Deputies fighting their corner here and they can be thinking of the period when they left rural Cork to fight a lone battle here.  It is amusing that Deputy Barrett is absent and that the Lord Mayor is absent from the other side.</P>

If we were to come in here armed with as <Col N="686" /> many figures and facts as we could get and as we had at the county council meetings, we could keep this House in session for a week.  However, I have never made a habit of introducing quotations here or making long drawnout statements and imposing upon your patience or the patience of the House in putting our case forward.  We thought the justice of our case was obvious to all.  I never like to comment on the freedom of voting here. I recognise that a Government must put on Whips.  Otherwise it might be difficult to get business done or to pass Bills.  Irrespective of what Government are in power, Bills will not always find favour with all but, in relation to a particular Bill like this, there should be freedom of choice.  Fianna Fáil do not believe in that freedom.</P>

      <P>You will, Sir, agree that this is relevant: the Minister has seemingly made up his mind in the matter.  Earlier I deplored the fact that he did not come into the House from the opposite end of the country, from Cork instead of from Donegal, with an open mind.  He said this morning that Deputies contributing to the discussion are putting up one side of the case without listening to the corporation side.  We have not precluded the corporation members or other interested parties from expressing their views.  They have the same rights and entitlements as we have here, but they are not interested apparently.</P>

      <P>The calculations we have got lead us to believe that 15 years is not enough from the point of view of fair compensation.  I have expressed the view that the period should be 20 years at least but we <Col N="688" /> have agreed to support Deputy Corry's amendment even though we think it is too modest.  Again, for the benefit of Deputy Barrett and others like him, Deputy Corry asks that, if a dispute arises, the matter should go to the High Court.  A big sum of money is involved and, whilst I dislike dragging in the courts, because the sum involved is so big it might be no harm to let their learned lordships determine the issue.  We would expect them to be impartial and to view the matter from a different angle from that taken by the Minister.  Hundreds of thousands are involved and it might be no harm to let the courts decide.  I am not now in favour of sending cases to the courts but, since the issue is so big, it might be no harm to let the courts decide.  A tribunal constituted preferably of High Court judges should determine in private session what would be fair and reasonable compensation. That would be far better than a repetition of what has happened here. The Minister made his own regulations behind closed doors.  Justice must not only be done but it must be seen to be done and referring this matter to the High Court to determine in private session would not be a bad way out of the difficulty in which we find ourselves.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, article 6, to add a new sub-article as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The tenants of county council cottages and housing estates in the area proposed to be taken into the city by the Provisional Order shall not be subject to rent increases and shall be entitled to all the privileges of tenant purchase etc. for five years after this Order comes into force as if they were still tenants of the Cork County Council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving the amendment I am only looking for protection for the ordinary tenants of county council and non-municipal houses who entered into those houses under agreements with Cork County Council on definite terms of both rental and purchase.  The county council have a rather proud history in this regard because when Cork city failed in their duty of building houses for the workers, the county stepped in.  Under the late Deputy Pa McGrath, the late Deputy Desmond, Lord rest his soul, and I succeeded in getting some 1,000 houses built outside the borough of Cork, by the county and the county ratepayers. Those houses, under the peculiar geniuses that exist in the Local Government Department&mdash;the financial experts we have there&mdash;are in a rather peculiar position.  If you build a house in an urban area or in a city and ever dare to tell the resident or tenant that he has a God-given right to own his own house by purchase, the benevolent Government step in and take back the subsidy.</P>
      <P>The issue is different in relation to houses built in the rural areas.  I have already indicated several times in this House the manner in which this matter was brought very definitely to my notice.  I am a member of the urban council of Cobh as well as being a member of the county council. We brought in very favourable purchase arrangements as far as the county was concerned.  There were two schemes of houses built in the one year.  They were built by the same contractor and were the same houses in every respect.  One scheme was built by the county council on one side of the road and the other by the urban authorities on the other side.  Both types of houses were occupied by the same class of tenant.  The people of Cobh were lucky in this respect because the big industry in Cobh, Irish Steel, is situated in Haulbowline Island which is in the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers in Irish Steel were entitled to county houses and to be housed by the county ratepayers.  The same class of individual in every respect occupied both sets of houses. When the houses were built and the rents fixed by the urban authorities on the one hand and the county council on the other, a rent of 11/- per week for each house, plus rates, was fixed.  We brought in a purchase scheme and under that scheme those tenants <Col N="691" /> were entitled to purchase their houses at 9/- a week instead of 11/- a week. I said that would be a very good thing for all the other houses but I found, to my amazement, that when we bring in a purchase scheme for those houses, the Government immediately collars the subsidy. Those tenants, instead of having their rents reduced from 11/- to 9/-, find they are raised to 32/- a week.  That is the best scheme the Local Government Department will sanction on account of the loss of subsidy.</P>
    <P>That is present legislation.  It would be much better if the Department of Local Government got rid of that anomaly instead of doing what they are endeavouring to enforce here today.  As I stated, some 1,000 houses built here by the county council and looked after by the county council are being taken into the city of Cork. Those tenants are entitled to protection. I am endeavouring, in this amendment, to protect them in the best way, by giving them a five-year period in which their rents will not be doubled or trebled by the city fathers. They will thus get an opportunity of being owners of their own homes.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter here on the Second Reading and the Minister said something about 12 months.  There is nothing about this in the Bill and no protection for those tenants in the Bill. I know the attitude that will be adopted by both the Government and the corporation in this matter.  I know the Government will be looking for their pound of flesh, namely, the subsidy, and the corporation will be looking for the money out of those unfortunate tenants' pockets.  The cost to the city ratepayers would be 6/- in the £ to give those tenants, once they became absorbed into the city, the same privileges of purchase as they are at present enjoying.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will give them 12 months but there is nothing about that in the Bill.  I suggest to him that the present manner in which the legal profession have increased their costs will put a very great burden on those people.  I have seen labourers' cottages <Col N="692" /> which were purchased and when the father died and the son looked for tenancy he had to take out administration. The cost of getting across the house from father to son cost as high as £60 when the gentleman with the wig got after it.  That is the reason why I want an extension period here.  I want it so that in cases where the old people are there the son will get an opportunity to purchase, without being looted by the legal profession.  I, therefore, move this amendment.  I recommend it to the House.  I would ask the Minister to accept it in justice to the unfortunate people concerned.  These are the class of people who are unable to build their own houses despite the grants and loans available and who have to throw themselves on the mercy of the local authorities to build houses for them.  They represent the poorest section of our community and are at least entitled to all the protection we can give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is no need to delay the House by adding to what Deputy Corry has stated. Apart from a few remarks with which I do not agree, I think some safeguard should be given to the tenants mentioned in this amendment and I support the inclusion in the Bill of some safeguard for such people.  In the past, when we were told that certain things would be done and that it was unnecessary to include them in a Bill as the Minister would make regulations or give advice to have them put into operation, we found that such assurances were not honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, as an example, the Transport and Power measure of 1958.  Assurances given to the House by the then Minister were ignored and treated with contempt.  I trust the Minister will not expect the House to accept assurances now in view of our experience on other occasions after accepting assurances that safeguards would be provided.  We have found that assurances are valueless. We must get it in black and white.  When the city manager comes to deal with this matter, he will say, in effect: &ldquo;What is in the Bill is all I am interested in.  I do not mind what assertions or assurances were made or <Col N="693" /> given by the Minister.  All I am interested in is what is in the Bill.&rdquo; Therefore, I support Deputy Corry's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to give any undertakings or promises in this case.  Tenants will have the right for twelve months after to purchase, at reduced annuity, their own cottages. That is in section 52 of the 1950 Act. That is in the law and that is the right under that law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Another obligation that rests on the local authority is that they are obliged to inform the tenants of their right to opt to purchase within the 12 months in question.  Furthermore, in opting to purchase, it is merely a matter of informing their council within that period that they intend to purchase.  A more protracted time may or may not be justified.  I do not see the particular necessity for it in this case any more than in any other case to which the law of 1950 is intended to apply.  If such change were to be made, it would be appropriate to the Act of 1950 rather than to what we are discussing at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the number of council houses involved is around 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that they will apply for repairs before availing of this purchase.  Is that not so?  Surely they will apply for repairs to their council houses?  We know that protracted discussions and delays can arise on such applications.  Consequently, it seems to me that 12 months is entirely inadequate.  Could this position arise?  A tenant states his house <Col N="694" /> is now unsatisfactory for purchase but that at the same time he will purchase it when satisfactory repairs are carried out by the council and then the council says that the house is all right and does not need repair.  Obviously, there can be delays.  The 12 month period might pass and the time would then lapse when application for purchase could be made.  Could such a situation arise?</P>
      <P>To safeguard all this, I think that the five years mentioned by Deputy Corry is not unreasonable.  Possibly, if we could compromise and say three years it might be the better way out.  I think we would want at least three years in view of possible differences of opinion about repairs which are bound to arise from time to time between the authority and the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at present endeavouring to go through a number of replies I received from the Minister's Department in connection with one purchase in which it is alleged on one side that the inspector from the Department of Local Government went down and sanctioned the repairs while the Department of Local Government say they did not go down at all.  In that case, the application to purchase was made 5½ years ago.  It has taken 5½ years, up to now, and apparently the inspector from the Department of Local Government did not go down and state whether or not the house is properly repaired.  Will it be accepted that tenants may make application to purchase and that when they apply for purchase it will be accepted as a purchase agreement?</P>
      <P>What is the position as regards tenants of labourers' cottages in the area who are entitled on purchase to a 50 per cent reduction?  What is their position, on purchase?  Is it all going to bog down beneath this hard crust of local government here?  Will or will not the ordinary application for purchase from all of those tenants act as a protection?  Let the Minister tell us that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in so far as the 12-month period is concerned.  Once <Col N="695" /> the tenants opt to purchase within the 12 months specified, and subsequent to being notified by the local authority, as it is obliged to notify them, that they come within the new boundary, that option stands regardless of what time it may take, regardless of repairs, delays, and so on.  Once the tenant has opted within the 12 months specified, then the right to purchase continues until the house or cottage is vested in him.  This equally applies so far as labourers' cottages and the 50 per cent are concerned.  In fact, it is the same Act and the same section.  It covers all of this and this right continues for the 12 months at the terms that would be available, as of now, to those tenants of labourers' cottages.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The principal and interest of the sum borrowed by the Cork Corporation to relieve the city ratepayers of portion of the rates burden for 1965-1966 shall be repaid in full by the ratepayers of the present City <Col N="696" /> Borough and no portion thereof shall fall to be levied or paid by the area brought into the Borough by the Provisional Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was informed yesterday in reply to a question that the Minister was not aware of these things at all.  I presume the Minister reads the public press and that he communicates with his local authority sometimes.  I have the <i>Cork Examiner</i> dated Friday, March 19th, 1965, which states: &ldquo;Cork Rates Up 7/- In The £ If The Boundary Not Passed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The manager in his statement says:</P>
    <P>If the Cork borough boundary extension comes into effect in time, the municipal rate for the coming financial year will be 65/10d. in the £ as compared with the current figure of 65/- in the £.  If the boundary extension is not effected in time the city rates will soar to 72/- in the £.</P>
    <P>It also states:</P>
    <P>The effective rate which would be required to meet the city estimates for the coming year would be 72/-in the £.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Friday, March 19th, 1965.  That is three months ago and the Minister had not heard it yesterday. Cork Corporation then struck the rate at 65/10d and borrowed £100,000 odd, to fill the gap between the yield from a rate of 72/- and the yield from the rate of 65/10d.  That money, principal and interest, was to be repaid over the next ten years by, I presume, the citizens of Cork city as it then was.  The valuation of Cork city at present is £335,000.  The valuation of the area being brought in has gone up, as I said previously today, by £18,000, and is now £152,700.</P>
    <P>The people have to pay on the basis I have stated.  They are getting no benefits this year from that rate.  I am sure the Minister will admit that.  The 7/- in the £ is for the city plutocrat. <Col N="697" /> He will be relieved and the unfortunate people who have been brought in have to pay £1 in principal and interest on the £100,000 odd being borrowed.  It is the biggest piece of gangsterism that I have ever seen put through and it is evidently being put through with the collusion and assistance of a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I can see no justification whatever for this.  The only thing I can do here, Sir, is endeavour to protect those people by coming in and putting down this amendment.  Fancy, Sir, asking the tenants of one or two labourers' cottages to come in and pay the rates for Henry Ford and Dunlops.  The plutocrats of Cork are to be relieved to the extent of 7/- in the £ this year with the collusion of the Minister for Local Government, who denied any knowledge of it in the House yesterday.  They are to be relieved of that and the unfortunate people who are to be brought in under this Provisional Order will have to pay next year, and for the next 20 years, their share of principal and interest on the £100,000 that will this year relieve the city ratepayers.</P>
    <P>It is the most brazen piece of banditry I have ever seen.  I cannot describe it in any other way.  Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves are only trotting after these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know the position was as stated in the amendment here until I read it.  I understood the ratepayers in that portion of the area which covers the new extension would not have to pay any contribution to the corporation for the year 1965-66, or for some years in order to compensate the county council.  Though neither Deputy Corry nor I represent the area concerned, I have always advocated, as I mentioned earlier, that the new area must be treated fairly and justly.  I hope that will be done and I think we should have a detailed statement from the Minister on the position of the people there.  We owe that to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the position is at present.  Possibly there is not much change, but in the early stages the vast majority of the people were anxious to remain in the county. <Col N="698" /> Indeed, at that time, the county council was looking after them fairly well by way of development services, roads, houses, and so on.  We should have a detailed statement from the Minister on this question, as we owe it to the people who are leaving the county.  If this measure becomes law, we must see that the people get justice. All we are looking for is justice, and I think the Minister should give us a statement on the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>The only thing I should like to say is that if this goes through, the people who are brought in will not be affected at all, and for the next five years they will get the remissions as set out in the Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a straight question: Will those people who are being brought into the city have to pay any portion of the £100,000 now being borrowed to relieve the city ratepayers?  Can we get an answer to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been borrowed yet, and it will not be borrowed until this matter has been dealt with.  Furthermore, I should like to say that the occasion of its being borrowed rather than provided for in the rates arises from the fact that this measure was delayed and put back to this date, and the corporation were unable to make the provision they would have made if this measure had been adopted last March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made the rather extraordinary statement that the money has not been borrowed. Does he mean that the city manager has struck a rate of 65/10d after stating the effective rate would be 72/- without having anything to fill the gap?  Let us know where we are, because my ratepayers in Cork county <Col N="699" /> would be very grateful if I could do the same thing for them.  The manager has said that he has borrowed over £100,000.  Does the Minister say the manager is a liar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for the money which it is proposed to borrow does not arise unless and until this measure has been passed by the House and has become operative by the making of the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this clear with the Minister.  The manager has stated publicly&mdash;and it was published in the public press&mdash;that he has borrowed over £100,000 to relieve the city ratepayers of 7/- in the £ this year, and that he proposes to repay the principal and interest over the next ten years.  That money is to be repaid by the ratepayers of Cork city, not Cork city as it now is, but Cork city as it will be under this Provisional Order.  I can see no justification whatever for compelling the unfortunate rural ratepayers who are paying their full rates in the county this year, to repay over the next ten years this money which is in relief of the city ratepayers this year.  That is the protection I am seeking in this amendment. This is supposed to be a democratic body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a decision of the House on it because I think I would be justified in going out openly and ordering these people to pay no rates if that is the situation which the Minister is bringing about.  If a legal rate is to be struck on those people for the next ten years to repay money that has been borrowed to relieve the plutocrats in Cork city this year, the Minister is going beyond the law and he will be met beyond the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The wildly exaggerated <Col N="700" /> claims and allegations made here are difficult to understand.  Possibly the Cork people who are making them understand them, but I do not.  I certainly do not understand or appreciate the heat and exaggeration Deputy Corry has brought into the discussion of this amendment.  Nor do I understand his condemnation of the Minister because he does not officially know what is published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>.  What is published in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> or any other paper I may read and I may understand, or I may not.  I may believe it or I may not.  In so far as my functions as Minister are concerned, if that is the only notification I have of happenings in Cork or anywhere else, I do not know what is happening just by reading about them in a paper.  I do not take that as official information. I am not officially aware of the information sought by the Deputy by way of Parliamentary Question and otherwise.  I have no official intimation in regard to the question of sanction for the borrowing of this £101,000; so any suggestion that we are officially aware of them is completely wrong. We may see them in the papers but we are not officially aware of them. What I read in the papers is one thing, and what I am officially aware of by way of an official communication from Cork Corporation or Cork County Council is another matter.</P>

The Minister says he does not take account of that, <Col N="701" /> but the Minister for Social Welfare came into this House last week or the week before, and said he must take notice of an anonymous communication sent to his Department for malicious motives.</P>

      <P>In page 11, line 35, to add &ldquo;and shall thereupon order the person, if in custody, to be released&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am moving these two amendments as a result of the suggestion by Deputy O'Higgins on Committee Stage that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 35, which gives the Minister for Justice a general power to release persons who are in custody under the extradition procedure provided for by this Part.  The effect of the amendment is to make it mandatory on the Minister for Justice, once he has refused extradition, to order thereupon the person claimed, if in custody, to be released.  In such a case, it seemed to be preferable to spell out clearly the mandatory character of the Minister's function and in this respect I agree with Deputy O'Higgins's suggestion on Committee Stage and, to accord with that view, I have incorporated these two amendments in the section.</P>

      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 1 to 7 and substitute:</P>
      <P>(1)  Transit through the State of a person being conveyed from one country to another on his surrender pursuant to an agreement in the nature of an extradition agreement may, subject to any relevant extradition provisions and to such conditions, if any, as the Minister thinks proper, be granted by the Minister upon a request to that effect by the country to which he is being conveyed.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may arrange for the supervision of such transit by the Garda Síochána and the person concerned shall be deemed to be in the custody of any member of the Garda Síochána accompanying him pursuant to such arrangement.</P>
      <P>This amendment, which substitutes a new section for the existing section 40, is designed to meet points made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins in Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Provision is made by subsection (2) for the Minister for Justice arranging for the supervision by a member of the Garda Síochána of the transit through the State of an extradited person and for deeming that person to be in the custody of the garda concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of incorporating in the section the provisions of Article 21 of the European Convention on Extradition, I think that I should make it clear that these provisions will have the force of law here once we ratify the Convention and the Government apply the provisions of Part II to the countries who have also ratified it.  This is set out in section 8, subsection (5).  Article 21, of course, will only be binding as between the parties to the Convention.  These provisions are, however, rather stringent and might unduly hamper the Government in having transit arrangements <Col N="708" /> with some countries, such as Britain, which attach little or no significance to allowing transit of extradited persons through or over their territory or other countries with whom we are making arrangements apart from the European Convention.  I prefer, therefore, the more flexible provisions in subsection (1) of the existing section 40, though I have made it clear in the revised draft that the Minister for Justice may attach any conditions he considers proper to granting requests for transit.</P>
    <P>This is a completely new section, as I have stated, and is designed to meet the point made both by Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Higgins that there was an undue limitation of sovereignty in the provision as it stood.  We now have it spelled out in subsection (2) of the amending section that the Minister for Justice can arrange for the supervision by the Garda Síochána of any person who may be in transit here from one country to another under an extradition arrangement and that while that person is in transit he should be deemed to be in the custody of a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I think this meets the matter that was worrying both Deputies on the last occasion, that the section as it stood might imply a situation where people in the custody of another police force might be on our territory and yet not amenable to or under the control of the forces of our country.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has, in fact, met the point raised by Deputy Dillon and myself very fairly in this amendment whereby he substitutes a new section for section 40.  I am glad the Minister has accepted that because I feel the point raised was of substantial importance and situations could have arisen which might very possibly have led to unpleasantness. I think the Minister has met the point very fairly and the amendment is, to my mind in any event, a very big improvement on the section as it originally stood.  I appreciate what the Minister says, and of course he is right with regard to the application of the Convention to <Col N="709" /> the contracting parties and, consequently, I think his judgment is correct in deciding that it is not necessary to recite fully the entire of Article 21 of the Convention in relation to this question of transit.  I do think that the new section which is now being proposed is a big improvement and meets the point fully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some information, if it is possible, from the Minister in regard to a matter which has been receiving a great deal of publicity, international publicity, indeed, of late, that is, the allegation that this country is being used by wanted English criminals as a kind of holiday camp for some considerable time.  This may, of course, be entirely a matter of sensation-mongering by certain newspapers. I read in the <i>Evening Press</i> of last Monday a statement&mdash;not a report of a statement&mdash;but a statement obviously emanating from the <i>Evening Press</i> itself to the effect that there are in this country over 80 wanted men, men who are wanted by the British authorities or other authorities for offences.  This is something which merits investigation, to say the least of it.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister as to whether there is any foundation for this statement and, if there is, what is the nature of the offences for which these men are wanted.  Is it a fact, as has been reported in some responsible cross-Channel Sunday papers &mdash;and they are very few&mdash;that some of the almost semi-romantic figures as they are being made out to be, such as the escapee Wilson, and people of that ilk, are now in residence here?  If that is so, it is a matter which is of public concern and upon which the public should be enlightened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are in our midst people of that type we should know about them. <Col N="710" /> For obvious reasons, it is well that we should know if such people are here in order that the ordinary citizen may so comport himself as to facilitate his own protection.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate, of course, that a situation which permits of the creation of a sanctuary in this country should ever have been allowed to develop and it is indicative of certain negligence on the part of those charged with seeing to such matters from the time the State was founded.  As we know, in a court case of some time ago laws were found in our extradition procedure that were deemed to be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, in spite of the fact that this type of procedure in relation to removing people from this jurisdiction to the jurisdiction of other countries had been in progress over a long number of years.  Apparently, that situation has created a vacuum which we are now trying to fill, admittedly, with the Extradition Bill going through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I should like to know, then, is there within the Minister's knowledge any truth in the allegation that we have in our midst a large number of people who are wanted for serious criminal offences.  If there is, how soon does the Minister consider this Bill will effectively remove these people from our shores?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I would just like to ask the Minister if he can give some indication to the House as to how quickly it will be possible to put in hands the task of making extradition treaties.  As far as the first Part of the Bill is concerned, it is dependent on treaties being made with other authorities.  As far as Part III is concerned, I think I am right in saying it will come into operation as soon as the day appointed by the Minister may be and I take it it will be as soon as the corresponding British legislation has been finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the answer to the problem that Deputy Dunne has raised is the fact that this Bill has not been in operation before this.  If it had been in operation previously any such situation as that mentioned by Deputy Dunne as having been reported in the <Col N="711" /> newspapers could hardly have arisen. If it did arise all that would be necessary under this Bill would be that the British warrants in the case of wanted people from Britain who are in this country should be backed by the Irish authorities.  If it is a question of nationals from any other country seeking sanctuary here when they are wanted in their own country, the solution of that problem must still be postponed until an extradition treaty is made with the other country.  I assume it is the intention of the Minister to proceed &mdash; let me use a phrase that appears from time to time&mdash;as soon as may be to conclude extradition treaties and arrangements with other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is right in his conclusion that Part III will be brought into operation as soon as may be after it has passed through the Seanad, and at the same time as the corresponding British measure, which is now at the Committee Stage in the House of Commons, having been through the House of Lords where it was initiated.  That should not take too long.  We shall then proceed with the ratification of the European Convention and seek to negotiate extradition arrangements with the other countries outside the scope of the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing very extraordinary about what has appeared in the newspapers or in what Deputy Dunne has just stated.  The whole purpose of the exercise in passing this measure is to deal with the precise situation that arose last year both here and in Britain when the courts in both countries, in cases which had no connection, declared that the extradition arrangements which had existed for a number of years between our two countries were faulty.  These extradition arrangements had been in existence since the last century and had worked well since the formation of the State.  Following these decisions of the courts, the two Governments have cooperated in introducing appropriate extradition procedures.  Undoubtedly in the period since last July criminals have come here from Britain.  There <Col N="712" /> is nothing extraordinary about the figure&mdash;about 80, I think&mdash;mentioned in the newspapers.  Over the years the number of British warrants executed here varied between 50 and 100 per year.  Normally a hundred or so British warrants were executed here annually in respect of criminals who had come here to escape justice in Britain.  Therefore, it is not too far from the mark to assume that something in the region of 70 or 80 such criminals would be here now.</P>

      <P>I cannot go into details and mention names in this regard. This is a matter for the police and they are best left to deal with these cases.  By passing this legislation we are taking an important step in regard to these criminals.  I hope the Seanad will deal with the Bill as expeditiously as this House has done, and I am sure the House of Commons in London will do the same.  When this measure comes into force we shall have extradition arrangements which will enable British warrants here to be backed and our warrants to be backed also.  It comes down to this, that the quicker this measure passes through the Oireachtas the quicker this situation will be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Party for which I speak in the House has a deep regard and, I might say, a respect for the many State bodies under the Minister's control.  We value highly the intrinsic worth of those State bodies: the ESB, Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, CIE, the airlines, and many others.  We have always advocated an extension of the public sector of industries of this kind and it is pleasing to us to know that these industries under the Minister's care are efficient and flourishing and are supplying the most essential services to our people.  We would wish to see an extension of these semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is gratifying to see an extension of Irish Shipping.  We now hold a very large number of shares in the Palgrave Murphy enterprise and the State has taken sole control of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company.  We have reason to realise the worth of our Irish shipping concerns because of the disadvantages we experienced during the last war when supplies of essential goods and commodities were very much restricted and we suffered acute shortages by reason of not having a shipping line of our own.  I want to congratulate the Minister and his Department on their initiative and on the daring of this venture in taking control of all these essential shipping lines for our country.  I trust he will develop them in the most modern way.  For some time past I have felt that the Minister was, perhaps, too air-minded and we have had many complaints to make here for a number of years now because of the very bad conditions prevailing, particularly where passengers were concerned, on our cross-Channel boats.  Now that <Col N="714" /> these ships are under the control of an Irish Government we expect to see the desired improvements in facilities and we hope we will not have any more complaints from our returning emigrants or from those who are forced, when going abroad, to travel in abominably overcrowded conditions and without proper amenities.</P>
    <P>I am glad Bord na Móna is doing so well.  There does, however, seem to be room for vast improvement in one aspect.  We would all like to see a greater extension of turf development. There are still too many unexploited bogs.  I appreciate that the weather has a great deal to do with this but it is disconcerting, to say the least of it, to hear people complaining about difficulties in getting supplies from Bord na Móna.  I refer in particular to what seems to be an acute shortage of turf briquettes.  I had occasion to complain to the Minister's Department that fuel suppliers in my constituency are unable to get their full requirements of these briquettes.  They can get all the coal they want but, in respect of this native product which has become very popular, there is a shortage of supplies.  It also seems that the agents who control supplies of briquettes may not be acting in a very fair or equitable manner from the point of view of distribution.  There are allegations that some fuel merchants can get all their requirements whilst others experience considerable difficulty.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the production of briquettes, for which there is considerable sale, be accelerated and, in time of shortage, devise some system whereby we shall have a fair and equitable distribution of any supplies of briquettes that may be available.</P>
    <P>My primary purpose in speaking on this Estimate was to advert once more to a matter I have raised on many occasions over the past few months. I refer to the serious redundancy in our coal mines.  The Minister has been made aware of the serious problem that exists by way of Parliamentary Questions from me and other Deputies over the past few months. He knew before this that the anthracite <Col N="715" /> miners were experiencing difficulty in the disposal of their product.  He knew that redundancy was rearing its ugly head in most of our mines.  He knew that one of our biggest anthracite mines had been forced to close. He knew that three others were also closed and that the owners and miners in certain other collieries are gravely perturbed about their future.  In adverting to this serious situation yesterday it is just not good enough that the Minister should give us the same answer as he gave a few days earlier, namely, that he was investigating the possibility of assistance.  He said, in his opening speech yesterday, that:</P>
    <P>The producers' difficulties appear to arise from an increase in home production and from a falling off in public demand due to competition from other fuels and to a lesser extent to the comparatively mild weather last winter.  The Buy Irish Committee has been examining the marketing problem in co-operation with the producers and have, I understand, made certain suggestions to the producers with a view to improving the competitiveness of Irish anthracite.</P>
    <P>The best the Minister could tell us yesterday in relation to this serious industrial problem is that the matter has been discussed jointly by his Department and the Buy Irish Committee and the representatives of the principal Dublin coal importers.</P>
    <P>The investigation of the remedial measures which may be feasible is being actively pursued and the possibility of some reduction in imports is being explored in the context of the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister the urgency of dealing expeditiously with this problem.  Too many miners have already lost their jobs and their way of livelihood in the Wolfhill colliery in Laois and in the many collieries in Castlecomer, and there are fears for the future on the part of owners and miners at Ballingarry, Thurles, in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>It is no good the Minister saying <Col N="716" /> talks are going on and that he is taking a look at the possibility of curtailing imports within the context of the Trade Agreement.  If there were formidable difficulties involved we would have expected the Minister to say so, but it seems to me possible for the Minister to act, and act speedily, in this matter by placing, if necessary, an embargo on the importation of foreign fuel thereby giving these mine owners and miners a chance of operating again on favourable terms here.  We must have regard to the shocking tragedy involved in the loss of livelihood to both miners and their families.  These men have given the best years of their lives in this most arduous and most dangerous employment.  They stood us in good stead during the war years. The situation has become so serious at Wolfhill that the people directly concerned, with the support of their clergymen, having called upon the Minister unsuccessfully for urgent aid, are now saying that, since the mines are of such importance to the local community and to the nation at large, they should be taken under State control.</P>
    <P>If the position is such that the mine owners are unable or unwilling to operate these mines effectively and economically, the Minister must now seriously consider, in the interests of the nation, whether it is not time for the State to take over the operation of certain of these mines, especially where there has been a request by the local people and clergy.  It would be a great tragedy if through lack of Government interest and support, these mines were to cease operation, the machinery to become idle and we were to suffer in addition the loss of the mine workers' skills.  Because of the arduous nature of their work, these men commanded good wages.  I know some of them got £20 or £30 a week. They were used to a pretty decent standard of living.  They have now been dragged down to a subsistence level on unemployment benefit.  They cannot be expected to suffer that kind of social disadvantage for very long. They will be forced to emigrate, and we will lose their coalmining skills and genius.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> I would ask the Minister to realise that we do not raise this question lightly in the House.  We had to raise it by way of questioning on many occasions in the past few months.  It is worrying in the extreme that the Minister has, as yet, failed to act in an effective way in grappling with this problem. I would ask him to indicate in his concluding remarks what steps he proposes to take.  I would ask him to have regard to the anthracite mine owners' views on this matter and to the sufferings of the workers and their families.  The whole matter raises a serious question about the future of anthracite mining here.  I would appeal to the Minister, if only as an interim measure, to impose an embargo on the importation of foreign anthracite and give the mine owners a chance of accelerating production and competing effectively on the home market.</P>
    <P>It is tragic to think that at a time when our own mines are going out of existence, foreign anthracite is coming into this country in very large quantities. It has been responsible for the dislocation of one of our finest industries&mdash;coal mining.  It is disquieting that in respect of the heating of homes in a major housing scheme in this city, it was determined only a short time ago by Irish engineers, architects and Government officials that the method of heating should be oil.  I regret to say that the oil to be used will not even come through the refinery at Cork. What a boon it would be to the miners, on whose behalf I have the honour to speak, if anthracite were used for heating of these homes at present under construction in Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to bring this about instead of using foreign fuel from which no one in the country benefits.  I think there is an obligation on the Government to ensure in respect of plans of this kind that not only are Irish materials used but that in respect of heating the source of energy should be some native fuel. If anthracite cannot be used, at least let us ensure that the oil used comes from our own refinery in Cork.</P>
    <P>One of the other important matters which prompted me to speak in this debate was the plight of the retired <Col N="718" /> CIE workers.  I do not know of any section of our community, certainly not in industry, who have been treated so badly by a Government Department as the CIE pensioners.  Down the years we have complained bitterly in this House at the kind of niggardly awards made to these men who have come to the end of their days as employees of CIE.  They have been offered parsimonious sums ranging from 7/- to 12/-and, possibly, £1 in fortunate cases.</P>
    <P>The kind of pension these people had bore no relation whatever to the cost of living at any given time.  One would expect a Minister of State to set an example in respect of industrial pensions and pension schemes of this kind.  One would expect him to treat the workers in this State body with the respect they deserve and to take steps to ensure that when they come to the end of their working years, they will not suffer, that in sickness and in infirmity, and particularly in old age, they will have behind them sufficient resources to maintain themselves in at least frugal comfort.  That could not be said of the CIE pensioners, who were given a miserable allowance of a few paltry shillings per week.  A very bad standard was set by a Minister of State in respect of pensions generally for retired workers.  The trade union movement and employers' organisations had a very bad headline set for them by the Minister in these paltry allowances.  I know there has been an improvement in these rates as a result of the establishment of the commission which was set up by CIE on pensions and sickness benefits in recent times.  I appreciate that these pensions have been improved somewhat. It was high time that this happened.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of this matter to which I take serious exception.  The attitude of mind of the Minister in this matter would seem to be that in reckoning pensions for CIE workers, he must always take into account benefits which these people would secure under the Social Welfare Acts.  He takes into account the old age pension or widow's pension, as the case may be, which these people would receive. It is particularly unfair that the Minister, <Col N="719" /> in arriving at a retiring pension for CIE workers, should include in that figure the pension which they would derive in any case as an insured contributor under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>These men, like any other workers, contribute weekly, over a lifetime of service, for certain social welfare benefits.  They include, at the end of their working life, a contributory pension by right.  Therefore, we question the right of the Minister to take that pension into account in reckoning the amount which his Department will contribute.  The Minister gives certain figures in respect of CIE pension rates at the present time, arising from the new scheme.  He says a male pensioner opting for the flat rate of pension will receive a combined pension and social welfare benefit&mdash;mark you, he says a combined pension&mdash; ranging from £6 2s. 6d. to £7 12s. 6d. at the age of 65 and rising to a maximum of £8 7s. 6d. at the age of 70 years.  In like manner, pensioners opting for the alternative rate of pensions, that is, a higher rate between 65 and 70 years will, at the age of 70 years, receive a pension of £8 1s. 0d. per week between the CIE pension and the social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that the Minister should include in these calculations the social welfare pension which these men are entitled to, with no thanks to the Minister.  They would have received this pension if they were never employees of CIE.  When you take into account the kind of contributory pension which will be available in a few months time and the kind of pension which CIE offers today, we find a man coming out on a pension of £6 2s. 6d. if you abate that amount by the amount of the old age contributory pension for himself and his wife, you find the kind of pension CIE are giving in those circumstances is not £6 2s. 6d. but rather £1 12s. 6d. per week.</P>
    <P>We must object to the method adopted by the Minister and his officials in arriving at this kind of pension scheme.  It is unfair, inequitable <Col N="720" /> and unjust when you realise that under the scheme of pensions set out in legislation passed in this House in respect of county council workers, the Superannuation Acts, they can retire on a pension, depending on years of service, of £6 or £7 a week.  They receive the old age pension on top of that.  They are regarded as two very distinct matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dragged down the CIE pension scheme to mere shillings by taking into account the old age pension to which these men would be entitled.  That is not normally done. It is an unfair way of computing pensions. It is not done in respect of county council workers.  They receive their pension under the Superannuation Acts to which I have referred.  They get their pension in respect of years of service and any emoluments over that are all perquisites in respect of the contributory old age pension and unemployment benefit if they happen to be under 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>The Minister will understand our reasons for being critical and carping about the attitude of mind which conceived this idea of purporting to convince this House that these men are getting a pension of £6, £7 or £8 a week when, in fact, the old age pension is being reckoned in that amount.  When you take away the contributory old age pension, plus allowance for the man's wife, you find that the CIE pension is only a matter of shillings.</P>
    <P>I object to some of the Minister's speech where his mind is actuated all the way through in the direction of foisting on every section of his Department, whether it be Irish Shipping, CIE, the ESB or Bord na Móna, the doctrines of these time and motion experts.  The Minister is a great believer in efficiency and we are with him in that regard, but, having regard to the kind of work which these men can do, we must say to him that while we are all for efficiency and believe in economy for economy's sake, one must have regard as well to the social consequences of the actions of these people. We know that the savings of these time and study experts, in the final analysis, are created at the expense of the worker.  Great savings have been <Col N="721" /> effected for CIE at the expense of tearing up hundreds of miles of rail and dismissing hundreds of workers.  Many of these workers have been retired in middle age.</P>
    <P>It is particularly demoralising to learn that a CIE worker in middle age, in the forties, is given a lump sum of money and retired, thrown on the unemployed scrapheap, rather than that a genuine effort is made to find alternative employment for him.  I know some of these men enjoy pretty good pensions but it would be far more appropriate if the Minister had retained them in some form of employment rather than take this demoralising step of retiring some of these rather young men.  This is the policy of these experts.  They are concerned with what might be seen to be economically wise but might not be socially prudent at times.</P>
    <P>I would warn the Minister against accepting the reports of these experts, without taking time to analyse the full repercussions of their reports from the social point of view.  This might well bring about dislocation of trade in a short time.  It might well bring about the dismissal of a large number of men without adequate steps being taken to provide alternative employment for them.  CIE, in particular, has the reputation of being unscrupulous in this regard and no appeal to the Minister regarding the social consequences of these recommendations, to which I have referred, will have any avail.  The Minister proceeded to close down railway stations and tear up hundreds of miles of railway lines. This created redundancy and dismissals involving hundreds of men, despite his responsibility for finding some alternative means of dealing with the problem which this question creates.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.  The desirability of providing a new school is recognised and a grant towards the cost of the work was sanctioned by the Department of Education in September 1964. A suitable site with an adequate water supply has been secured by the manager who has also undertaken to pay the local contribution.  The school is included in a group of twenty-one schools which are to be built under one contract for which tenders will be invited next week.  It is expected to have a contract placed towards the end of August and a period of twelve months will be allowed for the completion of all the schools included in the contract.  It is not considered that any advantage in terms of cost or time for completion would be secured by excluding this case from the proposed group contract and having tenders invited for it separately.</P>

One hundred and twenty-two of the tenants at Janesboro decided to purchase their houses under the scheme.  I understand that the reason for the delay in dealing with their applications is that an order of priority was fixed by the corporation for dealing with the sale of the houses in the various schemes on the basis of which the transfer of the Janesboro houses could not be put in train until recently.  I am informed, however, that the corporation now hope to transfer the houses in question to the tenants at the rate of about 20 a month.</P>

      <P>The short term housing needs of Dublin city have been estimated at 10,000 dwellings with the prospect of a continued high level of demand in the longer term to meet the further needs likely to arise from obsolescence and new family growth.  Dublin Corporation have contracts at present for 1,980 dwellings on an estimated 177 acres.  Development work is in progress on an estimated 80 acres.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state, having regard to the hazards to health of noise and the increasing amount of noise in modern times, what steps his Department have in mind for noise abatement and the education of the public in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This question relates to an environmental aspect of public health, for which I am the appropriate Minister.  Some steps have already been taken to reduce noise nuisance.  The road traffic regulations restrict the use of audible warning devices and loudspeakers on vehicles and require the fitting of efficient silencers.  They also provide as to the condition and maintenance of vehicles and prohibit the use of any vehicle so as to cause excessive noise.  Cork and Limerick have byelaws relating to musical instruments, loudspeakers, etc., and the St. Stephen's Green byelaws forbid the use of radio or other similar apparatus in the park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information obtained from the medical officers in our principal cities in 1963 indicates that the number of complaints about noise received from the public is small and that there is not yet any general problem.  Nevertheless, provision has been made in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to enable proceedings to be taken for abatement of excessive noise.  In addition, planning authorities now have adequate powers to ensure that development likely to be a source of excessive noise is located so as not to injure residential amenities and that buildings are constructed so as to prevent noise nuisance.  The <Col N="733" /> building regulations to be made under the Planning and Development Act will prescribe standards for the insulation of buildings to prevent transmission of noise.</P>
    <P>Control of noise is a complex problem involving special training for the professions concerned, standardisation of methods of measurement, and international agreement on maximum noise levels.  Through the participation of an officer of my Department in a study carried out by a team including medical specialists for the Council of Europe we are well informed of the measures under consideration or already taken in other European countries where the noise problem is more acute.  The Report, &ldquo;Noise Abatement&mdash;a Public Health Problem&rdquo;, may be obtained through the Stationery Office by any person interested. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.  This Report discusses very fully the possible effects of noise, such as insomnia and deafness, but much more research is required before it can be established that there is any serious hazard to health from the levels of noise commonly experienced. Generally noise is a nuisance rather than a source of illness.</P>
    <P>Further steps in regard to noise abatement in this country depend on (1) the extent to which the problem increases and (2) current work on various aspects by a number of international bodies such as the International Standards Organisation and the Economic Commission for Europe. This work has been taken into account by the Council of Europe Working Party which met in Dublin recently to complete a draft Convention.  I understand that the matters covered include education and training and that the Convention will ultimately be submitted to the Council of Ministers. It will then become available to my Department and the other Departments concerned for consideration.</P>

      <P>The matter was again taken up in connection with proposed reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain involving pensions, following the introduction of the old age (contributory) pension scheme here in 1961.

The matter was again pressed strongly as recently as February last when, however. the British authorities were still not in a position to make any proposals in this respect.</P>

      <P>In the case of countries <Col N="738" /> with which we have an adverse trade balance, the aim is to seek to improve the position by encouraging the expansion of exports.  It is recognised that special difficulties exist in regard to Communist countries and, with the object of providing the Government with powers to induce these countries to redress the balance by increasing purchases from us, the Restriction of Imports Act, 1962 was enacted.  Under the Act, the Government has power to restrict imports if that is considered necessary to correct an adverse trade balance.  So far, these powers have not been used but the development of trade with Communist countries is kept under constant review and the provisions of the 1962 Act can be invoked if the Government consider it necessary.</P>

In examining a request for approval of a particular site, I have regard to its suitability on the basis of economic and technical considerations, such as the most economical and efficient location in relation to the sources from which the milk supply to the factory will be obtained, the topography of the ground including drainage, access to roads, etc., the availability of a suitable water supply to the factory and satisfactory sewage disposal arrangements.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the course of an address I gave at University College, Cork, on 15th February, 1965, I would like to see our own creamery industry taking responsibility for new processing projects but we have to be practical in our approach to this problem of foreign participation.  Each case must be decided on its merits. For example, where a reputable foreign concern with considerable technical know-how and established export markets <Col N="747" /> is interested in establishing a processing industry with the support of local creameries, and the proposal is entirely acceptable on all other grounds, I do not think we should turn it down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of a statement made by the Chief Medical Officer of the Dublin Health Authority, at its meeting on 3rd June, regarding the presence of antibiotics in milk.</P>
      <P>I have ascertained from the Dublin Health Authority that, in the three months ending 31st May, 1965, the following results were obtained for milk samples from the Dublin area tested for antibiotics :&mdash;County Dublin &mdash;78 samples&mdash;11 contained antibiotics; Dublin City&mdash;40 samples&mdash; none contained antibiotics; Dún Laoghaire Borough&mdash;16 samples&mdash;4 contained antibiotics.</P>
      <P>The presence of antibiotic residues in milk is obviously undesirable and I am advised that the consumption of such milk may produce ill-effects by the development of resistant organisms, and may also give rise to reactions in a person who is hypersensitive to a particular antibiotic when he takes milk containing that antibiotic.</P>
      <P>The control of the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture.  My Department have been in correspondence with the Department of Agriculture on this subject and the matter is being reviewed by my Department in the light of the recent report of the Chief Medical Officer of the Dublin Health Authority.</P>

      <P>In the exceptional cases where drugs have to be obtained from the Central Pharmacy at St. Kevin's Hospital, they need not be collected there by the persons concerned, unless they wish to do so, as the items are delivered to the local dispensaries or to the patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The main item in the Minister's speech in which I am particularly interested is that dealing with Shannon Airport and the Shannon Development Company.  In view of the fact that a Bill will be coming before the House in the near future and in view of the fact that the Minister has not given many details about the work of the Shannon Development Company, I propose to await the Bill to discuss it fully.  However, there are a few matters relating to Shannon Airport mentioned in the Minister's speech which are worthy of comment.</P>
      <P>I was particularly glad to note the improvement in the past year in passenger traffic through Shannon Airport.  Passenger traffic is up by 14 per cent and this is the first increase since 1960.  It reflects great credit on the work of the Shannon Development Company and particularly on the tourist section of that company.  There is no doubt that over the past couple of years, since the Shannon Development Company entered the field of tourism, traffic through the airport has increased considerably.  Among the notable achievements of the company has been the introduction of the mediaeval tours and the development of Bunratty Castle.  These are paying very big dividends and I think they are mainly responsible for the increase of 14 per cent in passenger traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the terminal traffic is up by 30 per cent but the transit traffic is down six per cent.  Freight traffic is down by eight per cent but the terminal freight is up by 31 per cent. Am I to take it that terminal freight is freight originating from the <Col N="758" /> Industrial Estate at Shannon?  If that is so, and if there is an increase of 31 per cent in the terminal freight, it is also a very welcome development. There has also been an increase of 20 per cent in sales and catering at the airport and of course that is a logical and natural increase from the increase in the passenger traffic.  There was some doubt during the early part of this year in regard to the restrictions being imposed on American tourists in respect of the amount of money they could spend.  We were worried lest this might have an adverse affect on the sales of the duty-free shop.  I should like the Minister to clear the air in this regard and to say whether or not there have been any developments since he replied to a question which I tabled last February regarding the amount of money which could be spent by American tourists, and whether or not there is a limit on the quantity of goods they can bring back when returning from their holidays here.</P>
    <P>Another big factor which has contributed to the increase in passenger traffic in the past year was the inauguration of the Shannon-London service by BEA.  This was something which we had been seeking for a long time and obviously there was a demand for a quicker service between Shannon and Britain.  The business done since the inauguration of that service has justified its introduction.  There is also, of course, the Aer Lingus-Manchester service and the Aer Lingus service to Paris.  All that indicates that the future of Shannon as an airport lies mainly in the further promotion of tourism in the west and south-west.  The introduction of the Holidays Scheme by CIE, package holiday deals, has also been very successful and these have also contributed to the increase in passenger traffic at Shannon.  Considerable progress has been made in the development of tourism in the Limerick and Clare areas, the areas closest to the airport, but much more remains to be done.  I hope that with the establishment of the regional tourist company, covering Limerick and Clare, other places that have tourist potential in these counties will be developed and <Col N="759" /> that this will lead to further traffic through Shannon.</P>
    <P>I shall not review the work of the Development Company in regard to the industrial estate and the provision of houses because I presume that will be dealt with more fully in the Shannon Airport Bill that will come before the House shortly.  There have been certain improvements in the airport itself in the past year.  The terminal building has been improved.  I saw it the other day and there were certainly very welcome improvements in regard to catering and baggage handling facilities. There have been two interesting developments which may escape public notice which are very significant in the whole development of aviation and particularly in regard to Ireland's place in the field of international aviation. One is the development of what is called Eurocontrol of which we are now members and which leads to better safety regulations and so on; to better control of aircraft within the European area.  There is also the fact that new arrangements have been made for what is known as the Shanwick area, the area on this half of the Atlantic, for better control of the upper air lanes. The fact that Ireland and Britain have negotiated this new arrangement leading to better co-ordination of services and therefore better safety arrangements is another welcome and desirable development.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at length with Aer Lingus.  He reported that they continue to make very good progress and have the highest load ratio of all the Atlantic carriers.  I note that they have decided to sell their Friendship aircraft and that it is intended to purchase Viscounts from KLM.  I am somewhat perturbed about this as I presume the Viscounts they are purchasing are secondhand.  So far as I know up to this Aer Lingus has always for the most part obtained new aircraft and I think that policy of purchasing the latest type of aircraft has been a very significant factor in their success.  I am not happy about purchasing second-hand aircraft from KLM.  Perhaps the Minister would give some assurances when he replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> It is pretty obvious from what has been said about Aer Lingus and its work in the past 12 months that the company has now reached the stage where shortage of aircraft is hampering further development.  I note they have had to charter aircraft from other companies on several occasions in the past year.  This is something also that must be looked into.  If the extra business is there I should be in favour of pushing ahead and putting into service the latest type of aircraft rather than chartering planes from other companies or purchasing second-hand planes.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of this Estimate is tourism.  Progress has undoubtedly been made in the development of tourism but that is no ground for complacency.  Personally, I am not satisfied with the progress made in regard to tourist promotion in Britain. We have gone to the limit now and should go no further in attracting the type of tourist who looks for luxury hotel accommodation.  I believe there is a tremendous potential in Britain and that we have not tackled this market as we should have tackled it.  I also regret that due to some mix-up the Irish Tourist Board had to leave its offices in Regent Street and is now operating from temporary buildings in Cambodia Street.  I know that some unforeseen circumstances arose particularly in regard to the alternative accommodation which was to have been provided in New Bond Street, in the New Ireland House, but it now transpires that the New Bond Street premises will not be available until September while the Board had to get out of Regent Street on May 15 and right through the peak season will be operating from an upper storey in Cambodia Street off Oxford Street.  There is also no manager in the Glasgow office.  I should like to know why and also why eight vacancies for salesmen for Great Britain advertised several months ago were not filled. I should like to know whether it is intended to appoint these people.  The incidents I have mentioned have convinced me that the British tourist market is not being looked upon in the proper light.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> I spoke on last year's Estimate about tourist promotion in Britain by the Irish Tourist Board and suggested that not enough emphasis was being placed on attracting angling tourists to this country.  A certain amount of good work has been done.  A survey was sponsored by the <i>Angling Times</i> and carried out by Market Research Limited, a leading UK Market research company, and that survey showed that there are 2.6 million anglers in Great Britain.  More interesting still, it showed that 70 per cent of them were coarse fishermen, 20 per cent were sea fishermen and only ten per cent were interested in game fishing.  I notice from a recent Bord Fáilte report that Bord Fáilte seem to think that the be-all and end-all of angling tourism is game fishing.  On the statistics I have seen as a result of a survey carried out by the <i>Angling Times</i>, the great potential is the 1,500,000 coarse fishermen in Great Britain, who could be attracted to spend their holidays fishing on the numerous lakes and rivers that we have and which abound in coarse fish and provide excellent sport.</P>
    <P>I feel that Bord Fáilte are not serious in their approach to this question of angling tourism because in the entire of Great Britain, where this great potential is, there is only one man engaged in the promotion of angling tourism in Ireland and that man has to fly to and fro several times a year and, in addition to advertising our fishing facilities in Great Britain and encouraging English fishermen to come here, he has to hop over here several times a year to advise local angling centres on various aspects of development.  Surely that is beyond the bounds of human possibility.  It is not possible for one man to cope efficiently with this type of tourist promotion.</P>
    <P>I stated on the occasion of the debate on the Estimate for Transport and Power on a former occasion that I believe we need to have at least four men in Great Britain who would be engaged wholetime in advertising our angling facilities and organising and encouraging groups to come here and that we need to have at least four others in this country specialising exclusively <Col N="762" /> in the development of angling centres.</P>
    <P>Having studied the angling tourist market in Great Britain and having been engaged in an effort to develop one or two local centres in my own constituency I am aware that there is a lack of a proper advisory service.  When a centre sets about doing something to develop its facilities a local committee is formed and there is considerable difficulty once a committee is formed in getting expert advice on the production of brochures, the improvement of facilities, amenities, and so on.  This is a very serious matter particularly in view of the fact that there is a potential market of 2.6 million anglers in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that over the next 12 months Bord Fáilte will have regard to the British market in a much more serious manner, that the vast potential there will be recognised and that a proper effort will be made to attract the maximum number of English visitors, not merely fishermen, but others, to spend their holidays here.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other items. Deputy Treacy referred at length to the question of CIE pensions.  I want again to refer to the whole approach to this question.  I note from the Minister's speech that certain improvements have been made and, in particular, that the Minister said:</P>
    <P>A very good feature of the new pension rates is that when the pension and social insurance benefits are combined, married pensioners opting for the alternative rate of pension will no longer be subject to a reduction of income at the age of 70 years.</P>
    <P>With Deputy Treacy, I too believe that this idea of trying to amalgamate, if you like, the social payments with the CIE pension is a bad one and that, as Deputy Treacy said, a man who reaches the age of 70 is entitled to the contributory old age pension as of right and it was very unfair that his CIE pension should have been reduced.  But, there is one question that I should like to ask the Minister.  While the Minister <Col N="763" /> did give us a reasonably detailed account of the new pension scheme for 14,000 CIE employees, I should like to know what is the position regarding the unfortunate CIE pensioners about whom I tabled a motion in this House one and a half years ago.  These are the people who have retired in the last ten years.  What about the people who are receiving £1 a week now?  Admittedly, they got an increase of 8/- in the last 12 months and now have £1. Others have £1 2s. 6d. and those under 70 have £2 11s. 3d.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when replying, to go into greater detail regarding these three categories of pensioners and if they are not included in this particular scheme I sincerely hope that the Minister has not completely forgotten them and that he does not accept as adequate the miserable increase of 8/-, bringing their pension from 12/- to £1.  I do not think that these persons are included in this scheme and I should like to know from the Minister what he proposes to do about them.</P>
    <P>Of course, the unfortunate and tragic thing about these pensioners is the fact that they are getting on in years and their life expectancy is at most a few years.  If we look at the figures for the last three or four years we find that each year there is a considerable reduction in their number.  I would appeal, therefore, to the Minister, to see to it at this stage that these CIE pensioners will get some measure of justice in the last years of their lives.</P>
    <P>One final matter to which I should like to refer is the question of harbours. A certain amount of money has been allocated for the development of a number of harbours but I am surprised to note that there is no mention of the Port of Limerick.  I understand that certain proposals have been put forward and perhaps the Minister would be good enough, when replying to the debate, to say what has become of those proposals or whether it is intended to proceed with the development of the Port of Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that it is extremely difficult for Deputies, as it must have <Col N="764" /> been for the Minister, to assimilate the amount of information contained in the very big brief which he used yesterday and which we have been trying to go through since.  However, there are a number of points to which I should like to refer and while my remarks may seem to the Minister rather disjointed, I am sure he will understand the points I am trying to make.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Treacy, I wish to refer to this question of CIE pensions and the basis on which the new pensions structure is being set up.  I am rather disappointed that this system has again reared its ugly head in a Transport and Power Estimate.  Some years ago the Minister set a headline, a very bad headline, when he introduced a Bord na Móna pensions scheme into this House which I and my colleagues unsuccessfully tried to have voted down, one which, for the first time, introduced the element of social welfare benefit as a supposed subsidy to a contributory pension.  At that time I pointed out that in order to get any kind of decent pension, the Bord na Móna employee would have to live to the year 2003, and the Minister agreed with me.  It appears that the CIE pensioners are to be treated in the same way.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain to me why it is that he of all the Government Ministers, and his Department, of all the Government Departments should have this bee in their bonnet that social welfare benefits can be counted as a supplement to a contributory pension.  It is most unfair and while it may be all right to say that officials who retire and who do not stamp cards get only the pension to which they are entitled for their service, the manual employee who does stamp a card and thereby qualifies on his insurance for a pension is now having that pension counted for the purpose of cutting down what he should be entitled to by way of a CIE pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has made a mistake or whether I am misreading the brief but he does refer to what they will get at the age of 65. The Minister is aware that the old age pension is not payable until the age of 70.  How can he say that at the age of <Col N="765" /> 65 a CIE pensioner can count on a supplement from social welfare unless he goes to the local labour exchange and signs on for unemployment benefit until he is 70?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  He can get unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard everything now.  It is suggested that the man who retires at 65, which is considered by CIE to be the retiral age, should sign at the labour exchange until he is 70.  I am sure the Minister or whoever prepared the brief had a long look at the pension in order to find out in what way it could be made look a little respectable, because, on its own, without the supplement from the Department of Social Welfare, it would appear what it is, a very miserly sum.</P>
      <P>That is for the people who are still working.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the people who have already left, the unfortunate who retired some years ago and who apparently now is nobody's responsibility.  Even the trade union who were acting for him during his employment do not appear to have taken the interest they should have taken in his welfare.  Apart from the few shillings which CIE gave him recently, he has nothing to which to look forward and he will be left until he dies in a very bad state.  I thought I should bring this to the notice of the Minister because he, of all the Ministers of State, seems to have got the idea that social welfare benefit can be used in this way.  It is not used by any other Minister or any other Department, and I wish the Minister would decide that he will not use it any more where his Department is concerned.</P>
      <P>There is a reference in the Minister's speech to port development which I should like to quote:</P>
      <P>The principal current improvement schemes are those for Galway, Wicklow and Arklow for which grants totalling nearly £500,000 have been approved.  Grants of £15,000 and £17,000 have been approved for Sligo and Ballina respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> And here comes the gem:</P>
    <P>Progress on works at Drogheda, for which a grant of £175,000 was approved, has been suspended pending the carrying out of the necessary technical investigations.</P>
    <P>There are a few questions I should like to put to the Minister and to which I hope he will be able to give the answers when he is replying.  When was this proposed development started? When were the investigations started and what have they cost to date?  It appears that there is a great deal of bungling on somebody's part in Drogheda port.  I live about six miles from the port.  It is true that due to bad handling by somebody, the tonnage going into and out of the port is dropping.  In fact every few months it happens that ships going into the port with loads are going out empty.</P>
    <P>If any of the local people who live along the river are asked what is happening there, they can answer very easily, Some years ago some bright boy decided to go to Holland, I think, and buy a particular type of dredger which can suck sand but will not remove mud. The result is that the bed of the river is very badly blocked up.  The mistake was made and a lot of money was paid for that dredger.  The mistake should be admitted before the port of Drogheda is ruined.  It has reached the stage now where many of the local merchants who would normally take in their produce through Drogheda port are now finding it more economical to take it in through Dublin port.  I suggest that the Minister should take a personal interest in this matter before it gets completely out of hand.  It is all right saying that investigations have to be carried out.  I am aware of the investigations that have been carried out. Plans have been proposed and scrapped, and again plans have been proposed and scrapped, and somebody is paying for it all.  Unless the Minister does something, the entire grant will have been expended and the work will not have been started.</P>
    <P>I believe this is one of the reasons why certain industries which were to be developed on the banks of the Boyne have not been proceeded with.  Nobody wants to be involved in starting an industry if there is a doubt about the <Col N="767" /> future of the port.  The Minister is aware that one industry was started halfway down the river on the Meath side.  He and a retinue of officials went along there about 18 months ago to an official opening.  The factory lasted less than 18 months, employed two men and then closed down.  I am not blaming the Minister for that but he should take an interest in what is happening there because nobody else seems to be too worried about it.  The easy way out is to avoid talking about these things because it might hurt somebody's feelings. I do not mind whose feelings are hurt in this connection.  It is a matter which must be attended to and I would suggest the Minister is the man who can do it, if he so desires.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to agree that tourism has been developing.  The income from tourism seems to be growing but I am not prepared to accept the figures produced by certain persons who take a sample of the passengers coming in, ask them how much money they have, how much they propose to spend, and try to assess, on the basis of air travel or sea travel, the amount of money spent in the country by tourists.</P>
    <P>One thing in which the Minister and his Department might interest themselves is the question of excessive charges.  I believe a great deal of harm is being done to the tourist industry by the racket that goes on. If one goes into a town or village and does not speak with the local accent, one is immediately regarded as a tourist and the sky is the limit.  The Minister might very well take an interest in that.  Before going to the country, however, he might start checking on prices here in this city. We have reached the stage now when prices are going sky high.  If the ninth round of wage increases is, as is alleged, reflected in the prices charged in hotels and cafes in this city all I can say is that if the workers got the full increase reflected in the prices of meals, they should be the best paid workers in the world. I am quite sure they did not get even a fraction of these increases.</P>
    <P>It is high time someone took an <Col N="768" /> interest in this bit of racketeering. Good meals may leave a pleasant taste but the prices charged leave a very bad taste.  It is no use someone coming along tomorrow or the next day and saying that this is not true of his hotel or cafe.  There are some hotels which try to keep prices to the bare minimum and give good value and service but there are far too many which take advantage of the tourist season, or something else, for the purpose of boosting their takings.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourists, the Minister and I have disagreed before and I presume we will disagree again: I do not agree that someone who comes home on holiday from England is a tourist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not had time probably to read the brief. We give the percentage of real tourists: 73 per cent of the income comes from what the Deputy regards as tourists so it is not so bad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not read that bit of the brief.  I am not prepared to accept the check system used to distinguish between a real tourist and someone coming home on holidays. I do not think the system adopted reflects the true position.  I do not know if the Minister has ever travelled tourist in a boat, but anybody who has knows the system used, and the one used in certain hotels. Even on planes a check is occasionally made.  But that does not reflect the true position and there is no way I know of in which the actual figures can be obtained.  I do not think it fair to say that only 25 per cent of the people who come here during the season are people coming on holiday to relatives and friends because, as far as I know, and I meet very many of them, the vast majority&mdash;we might as <Col N="769" /> well face it&mdash;are those who were born and bred in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is income, not numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is income, then I disagree even more profoundly with the Minister because the people who spend money are the working class people who come home with a few pounds in their pockets and who want to have a good time.  So far as the so-called upper classes are concerned, they come here on a package deal and spend as little as possible.  It is for these people we are building the big hotels.  I notice some hotels have not been proceeded with, and I am not surprised.  If we really want to encourage tourists, we will have to provide more facilities at a much lower level than the Intercontinental.  The people who come here want reasonable accommodation at reasonable prices and they should get it.</P>
      <P>That brings me to another point. The Tourist Board, for some extraordinary reason, seem to have the idea that the only resorts worth fostering are the really big ones.  They spend money on these.  There are beautiful resorts for which nothing is ever done.  I live in the village of Laytown. The Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington strand cannot be beaten.  How much will the Tourist Board spend on the improvement of that strand?  After a great number of years, when the Meath County Council attempted to have a public park developed, the Tourist Board promised me and the chairman of the county council that they would give a substantial grant towards a park costing about £15,000. The actual offer made by the Board was £680 and before they would give that grant, they insisted on so many changes in the original plan that I have grave doubts now as to whether or not we are losing or gaining money by having anything at all to do with the Tourist Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts should be made in places such as I have mentioned along the sea coast to give encouragement to local councils to bring tourists into these areas.  Some type of suitable <Col N="770" /> housing accommodation should be erected for this particular type of tourist, let it be subsidised small hotels, guesthouses or what-have-you. Money spent in that way would be a better investment than giving £750,000 for the building of a hotel to house millionaires who, when they come here, are not too anxious to part with their millions.</P>
    <P>CIE are doing an excellent job with their bus tours.  The only snag is that some of the roads the tours would like to take are not open to them because of their condition or because of too low railway bridges or too narrow road bridges.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the number of passengers carried by plane, both cross-channel and transatlantic.  I have travelled quite a bit and I believe Aer Lingus and Aerlínte are supplying a service one does not get on any other airline by which I have travelled. I was amused last night to hear a radio announcement that the airlines had made a working profit.  That is a very nice euphemism.  We would all love to be able to carry on by declaring any income we got a working profit with someone in the background to subsidise our capital charges.  The Minister would be better advised to point out that the working profit of over £1 million does not contain any element of repayment of the original money advanced or of the interest charges.  This particular reference always amuses me.  The general idea of the Government seems to be that rail and road transport must pay their way and we must not lose money on the operations of CIE but it is apparently all right to lose money on the operation of our air services. However, that is something we will have to live with.</P>
    <P>In regard to mining, I am very glad one of the companies which came here some years ago&mdash;and I am happy to say I played a substantial part in introducing it here&mdash;to carry out a search for copper has succeeded in at least establishing that there is ore in this country and that they will be able to make a paying proposition out of it. <Col N="771" /> I am referring to the people who came in originally as the Can-Erin Mine and are now connected with the Northgate Exploration Company.  In the early years, and later, they found they were not getting the co-operation they should have got from the Department. I am not blaming the Minister for that.  It was his predecessors and the people under them who were difficult to deal with.  The company may not have struck oil, but they have struck silver and seem to be doing very well. I understand they expect it to be a paying proposition by September or October of this year.  I am glad of that and I hope it will bring big revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department were right, even though it was a sudden decision, to purchase the B &amp; I Company.  I hope, having purchased it, they will now attempt to give the service on that line which we always felt the people who formerly owned it should have given.  Over the years we have had all sorts of complaints.  The Minister was asked to make representations to the people across the water to improve the service.  The number of boats at particular periods and the type of accommodation they were offering were condemned by practically everybody in the House.  Now that the State owns the service, an effort should be made to see that the proper type of service and accommodation is given to our returning emigrants whether we call them tourists or simply natives coming home for a short holiday.</P>
    <P>I consider Bord na Móna are doing an excellent job.  From time to time we may have had differences with them from the trade union point of view.  However, we have very good relations with them.  The group of unions representing the employees seem to be able to handle the difficulties as they arise.  They dealt very effectively with an unofficial strike last year when an attempt was made to close the briquette factories to bring out a certain point of view.  The unions refused to allow this to happen.  That is possibly the reason why relations <Col N="772" /> between the unions and the company are so good.</P>
    <P>I am glad Bord na Móna production is so high.  Nobody likes to see some of the changes made.  They have speeded up some of the machines with the result that people have to work a lot harder for less money.  I suppose we will get over that, too.  I am glad the briquettes are doing so well. Apparently, we will soon need more briquette factories.  There seems to be a great demand, even an export demand, for briquettes.  I was interested to note&mdash;I am sure the Minister will be, too&mdash;that when the discussions on the ESB strike were taking place, one of the companies that got instructions to close down all machines using over 100 KW was Bórd na Móna. The ESB must have known that these machines included those servicing the stations supplying the national grid.  If that is not a stupid approach, I should like to know what is.</P>
    <P>Brief reference was made to angling facilities.  It is true that coarse fishing seems to have caught on here.  It is also true that quite a number of old country houses considered to be going out of date are now being converted into guesthouses for the accommodation of people who come here on angling holidays.  There is a matter in which the Minister might be able to help.  Some of those houses were in very bad repair and the owners found it necessary to try to put them into proper condition before they could take in paying guests.  When they applied to the Department of Local Government for a grant, the Department sent down an inspector who pointed out that, as they had not carried out repairs to the entire house, they were not eligible for some of the grants.  The Minister might be able to help in that matter.  I believe any accommodation made available under that heading will be taken up and used and will have a good effect on the country.</P>
    <P>The ESB have been refusing service to quite a number of people in the country.  This is a matter I have been discussing here with the Minister under various headings over the years.</P>

      <P>If I can, I will defer it.  I also wanted to refer to the loss of power in particular areas, including the one I live in myself.  This occurs at certain hours of the day and night, particularly on Sunday morning after first Mass when it seems to be twice as hard to cook as normally.  The same thing happens at certain times in the evening.  Even the television sets seem to suffer.  A contracting black rim appears on the screen and you cannot even see the hurlers.  This matter has been raised with the ESB who have promised to put in extra substations.  However, that does not seem to have been done and months afterwards, we are still in the same position.  I would like to know if something can be done about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister is considering setting up a nuclear energy board.  While he says it may be ten years before we reach the stage where we can use nuclear energy for power, we should not wait until such power is actually needed.  If the necessary arrangements are made in time, we will not have the usual complaint that the Board were set up at the last <Col N="774" /> minute and we have to wait five or six years before they produce results. I wish the Minister the best of luck with that.  It will be difficult, even if there is cross-Border co-operation as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of transport and power is, in a small nation, so important that nobody could begrudge the time given to a debate on it in all its aspects.  When it is taken away from private enterprise and when the State enters more or less into the provision of these two facilities and the various other things allied with them, I feel that some criticism is always necessary if the public are to get the service which they are entitled to.</P>
      <P>It appears over the years that it has been found economically necessary to close the branch lines.  As I come here from the west of the country, I have always disagreed with this for the reason that it has never been found possible to provide an alternative service which is as good or as cheap to the public as the railway line is.  Even though it has been promised from time to time that the people would get as good a service at the same cost, I have never seen that happen.  CIE are doing a reasonably good job.  The trains are comparatively good; the people who work on them are courteous and they give good service.  I have had very few complaints from tourists and others about the way in which those people carry out their duties, the way in which the lines are run and the accommodation provided.  If you have a Minister and a Ministry for Transport and Power more or less responsible for those things, it is a shame that in some cases they do not provide certain facilities for loading and unloading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wayside stations are still open and in many cases this causes trouble, loss and inconvenience to people who have to use the particular services at certain stations.  I mention in particular the station at Ballyhaunis, the town from which I come.  There is a small wayside station there and it has a little crane on the platform capable of loading about two tons.  There is a meat factory in the town and the meat has <Col N="775" /> to be transported in containers from that factory by CIE rail.  It has to be taken on CIE lorries and brought 12 miles west of the station to the railway line which is actually within a couple hundred yards of the factory.  It has to be brought 12 miles west and it comes back by the factory the following day.</P>
    <P>Refrigerated containers are able to keep their products free from deterioration for only a certain limited time and any delays between the point at which they are loaded and the point at which they arrive will cause deterioration, with resultant loss to the person exporting the products.  I see no reason in the world why a proper crane cannot be provided at wayside stations. It would not involve the Minister, the State or the taxpayer in an enormous amount of money to provide a crane capable of taking a container from the body of a truck and putting it on a railway car.  There are many wayside stations where this service could be provided at no great cost to the community. It would be of great benefit to the people in the area, particularly industrialists.</P>
    <P>I know, at this stage, it appears that the railways will contract more and more.  That appears to be the modern conception.  Supposing that does happen, the whole weight of the goods taken from the railway will have to be carried by road.  Most of our main roads and county roads were built at a time when they had not to carry heavy loads.  They had not to carry the same tonnage as they have to carry now by reason of the modern vehicles which are designed to take up to 30 tons with a trailer behind them. The maintenance of those roads will fall on the county rates.  It was promised that money would be made available for making roads and reconstructing existing roads which will take the traffic diverted from the closing of railway lines but that has never happened.  Sufficient money has not been provided to do this particular job and the maintenance of the roads has, at all times, fallen on the rates of the county.  The rates in the west, and particularly in Mayo, are so high at the moment that it is impossible <Col N="776" /> to provide more money for the maintenance of these roads.  The amount of money necessary, not alone for the construction of new roads but for the reconstruction of existing roads should be provided from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>I come now to the ESB.  I think the Minister said to a previous speaker that the Bill dealing with this matter was about to be brought before the House.  I am new to the House and I am not too familiar with the procedure but I would like to make this point to the Minister with regard to ESB charges.  We have gone to considerable expense to provide electricity service to more than 80 per cent of the homes in the country but we are not yet able to compete with gas and other facilities.  This should not be so.  Some incentive should be given to people in rural areas and indeed in all areas to turn completely to the ESB.  If the charges were lowered, it would encourage everybody to make use of the national grid.  After all, a good deal of it is produced from our rivers and our turf which do not involve imports. We have a refinery at Whitegate but the oils and other things which go into bottled gas have to be imported.  Everything should be done to ensure that the ESB current is used, as far as possible, for everything in the country.  The only way you can do that is by giving it at a reasonable charge to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about turf.  During the past few weeks we have been told that the price of turf is to be increased by about 7/- a ton. This is being done just before we go into the new production season.  I see no justification at all for raising the price of home-produced turf.  Turf is bought by the poorer sections of the community and they will be the hardest hit if there is a rise in price. Every effort should be made to keep turf supplies at the lowest possible cost to the consumer.  This would be good policy and it can be done without subsidisation or anything like that. The people who live in cottages and <Col N="777" /> in small towns have to buy Bord na Móna turf because, due to a number of conditions, they cannot find readily available hand-won turf.  That hand-won turf is fairly costly.  Bórd na Móna, with their huge organisation, should be able to produce it at a lower rate than even the small farmer and his family can produce it.  It is unfortunate that the price of turf should have to be raised at this particular time.</P>
    <P>Probably every aspect of the Department of Transport and Power was covered by other speakers.  I am not familiar enough with the tourist end of it to say much about it but I should like to stress, as far as tourism is concerned, that, as mentioned by Deputy Tully, a big field of operation lies not amongst the type of tourist known as the upper class tourist&mdash;the huntin', shootin', fishin' type&mdash;but amongst the people who left our shores and went to Britain, America and other places and who would like to come home and spend a month or two, or even a week or two, in summer among their friends in Ireland. We are not doing quite enough to encourage them.  Definitely, however, they have better conditions of travel between Britain and Ireland than they had some few years ago but it still leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I have seen people with families of four or five children who have had to travel for 36 hours on trains and boats between London and the west of Ireland and who arrived there jaded and absolutely worn out.  Such a state of affairs is a shame but nobody seems to bother very much about it.  I suppose that, in future, things will improve in that respect with the car ferries and the fact that we have taken over the B &amp; I line and can now do something ourselves for those people.  I should like to see a decided improvement in the travel conditions of such people in the future.</P>
    <P>When they come here, lots of those people do not want to go into a high-class hotel.  They love to go down into the country, to live in a country house and to eat our famous bacon and cabbage than which, they will tell you, <Col N="778" /> there is nothing better in the world. Everything should be done to provide suitable facilities for them.  I know the Minister has no function in the provision of grants for water and sewerage facilities in country houses but he might mention the matter to his colleague in Government for priority in areas with lakes suitable for development&mdash; of coarse fishing, in particular.  Any money the Minister might spend in that respect would be money well spent. I compliment the Minister on things that have been done and I trust that the Department of Transport and Power will go ahead to provide better services in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this discussion at all but I had a brief look through the Minister's statement last evening and I noticed that there was no mention of a couple of matters which I think are not unimportant. One is canals and the other is a branch of tourism.  Certainly it has a connection with the attraction of tourists.  I refer to the Tidy Towns Competitions which have been organised and promoted by the Minister's Department in the past few years.</P>
      <P>I think there is a lack of liaison between the Minister's Department and the Department of Local Government and I refer, in particular, to the county councils.  I have been a member of a county council since 1955.  I feel that a great deal could be done if somebody in the Minister's Department had a sort of roving commission to go around any county and to consider ways and means by which seaside resorts could be improved and various tourist attractions and amenities could be provided through the Department of Local Government, with the co-operation of the local authority.  He should take advantage of that position to come along occasionally or to send somebody along occasionally to make suggestions directly to the members of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been present at a number of meetings in relation to the Tidy Towns Competitions.  I have listened to the very useful advice given by people from the tourist organisation and noted the help and encouragement <Col N="779" /> offered and I have seen what all that has led to.  It is important to make our towns and villages attractive.  It is hard to define what exactly brings people to a country and what makes their visit and their holiday pleasant for them.  However, the appearance of our towns and villages is extremely important and this is work which has been encouraged although no reference was made to it by the Minister yesterday.</P>
    <P>With more direct contact between the local people, the tourist organisation and the Department of Local Government, that is the county councils, a lot could be achieved in this direction.</P>
    <P>I referred to canals.  Yesterday evening, I heard some Deputy refer to the improvement in the boating holidays on the Shannon.  I am aware that quite a lot of people now go out as far as the 12th lock, which is fairly near Lucan, to lower their boats at that point and to go from that point. There is a short distance of canal bank there.  I am not exaggerating when I say that there are potholes 18 inches deep at that point and no facilities whatsoever for lowering boats into or taking boats out of the canal.  Many people are anxious to bring their boats out that distance because they are immediately in the countryside: I think that that is what they want.  I have made an effort to get the local authority to take charge of this small section of the bank.  The advice of the engineer and of the legal adviser to the council was that it was not of sufficient public utility, though how exactly they arrive at what is or is not public utility, I cannot say.</P>
    <P>Some effort should be made to make such places attractive, to make them look well and to make it easy for people to get their boats into and out of the canal.  Everything possible should be done to encourage boating and that type of holiday and to improve that type of amenity but it is very difficult to get anything done.</P>
    <P>Further in relation to canal banks and canals, I have been in trouble <Col N="780" /> over the years, as a public representative, in relation to the taking in charge of the canal banks which are badly kept roads, in many cases leading to a good many people's houses. I remember some years ago we agreed to take one of these banks in charge and we had extreme difficulty with CIE in getting permission to take it. The form of agreement presented to us in Dublin County Council could not possibly be accepted by any responsible local authority.  Considerable discussion was necessary on the part of the deputation who went to discuss with officials in CIE afterwards in an effort to get a reasonable agreement whereby a bank could be taken over and improved by the local authority.</P>
    <P>These are roadways leading to many people's houses and in the past they were kept in a reasonable condition by the authorities who then owned them. Now they are in a shocking condition and are nobody's property.  CIE have more or less abandoned them but they are still in their ownership and I think something more definite should be done about them.  A greater interest should be taken in canals generally, if we hope to maintain and develop them as a tourist attraction here.  I believe they can be used for that purpose and that they can lead towards the Shannon boating arrangement, which has developed very well indeed in recent years.</P>
    <P>Another point that caught my attention in looking at the Minister's statement was the recent surveys that have been made of traffic in various areas in the Dublin district.  These surveys showed that 500 extra bus seats were required in the Ballyfermot area.  I am aware that agitation for extra buses in the Ballyfermot area has been going on for years and that for some unknown reason little or nothing has been done about it.  It had to go on for a long period before positive action was taken.  The proof is there and it was most remiss of CIE to have this agitation going on for so long without making any attempt to supply the needs.  The fact that 500 seats were required as an extra is proof positive that there was neglect there.</P>
    <P>In other areas as well&mdash;Crumlin, <Col N="781" /> Walkinstown, and so on&mdash;the survey produced evidence to indicate that extra buses were required at certain times in the morning and in the evening. This sort of thing should be continuously under observation because the movement and the growth of population in the various areas in County Dublin is fantastic at the present time. Unless this is kept constantly under review, the services will not be kept up to anything like what they should be.</P>
    <P>Side by side with this there is the position that there are areas where buses travel practically empty for a considerable portion of the journey. That, too, is not kept under sufficient observation and perhaps certain economies could be effected, or a better service provided, by altering the time of one bus and not having two buses running together with both of them half empty.  I have constantly seen that happen.  It may be that farther on on the journey passengers are picked up and that, on the whole, it is a service that must be kept running for reasons not easily seen by the casual observer.</P>
    <P>There are areas, too, where it is not just good enough for a public transport company to say:-&ldquo;We cannot give you a service because it would not be economic.&rdquo;  A public transport organisation that has a monopoly should, where necessary, provide a service, even though it happens to be uneconomic initially.  One of the reasons why it might be uneconomic at the outset is that people have been trying other ways and means of getting to their destinations.  If a bus service were provided, it might not be economic at the start, but as time went on, it would. It is lack of amenities of that sort that keeps people from living distances more remote from the city.</P>
    <P>We get some measurement of the need for transport in the area of Ballyfermot when we find that the result of the survey indicated a need for 500 extra seats.  It would be interesting to know the total number of people transported from Ballyfermot into the city each day.  It must be a fantastic figure.  I am aware that most of these people were moved out, not by their own choice, a considerable distance <Col N="782" /> from the city centre.  Quite a large number of them are employed as far down as the East Wall.  I remember when the last bus strike took place, the extreme hardship those people suffered, and the distances they had to walk were unbelievable.</P>
    <P>This is a part of my constituency and I meet these people frequently and I know their anxiety about the possibility of a bus strike taking place at the end of this week.  We all hope the strike will be averted and I sincerely hope it will.  Nobody wants it.  I would ask the Minister to consider as a priority places such as Ballyfermot where we have a working-class population.  There is a population of 33,000 in Ballyfermot at the moment and the bulk of those have to come into the city to work because there are practically no local opportunities for employment in that area. There are practically no opportunities for vocational education either.  For many other reasons as well, the people have to come into the city, whether they like it or not.  Transport is as important to them as bread.  They are not in the class of citizen who can afford alternative transport.  I sincerely hope the Minister will have emergency transport put on for those people in the event of a bus strike. But, as I say, we all hope it will not arise.</P>

      <P>First of all I should like to say that, with the exception of about two Deputies, this debate has been on a very high level of constructive criticism, and helpful suggestions and advice were given.  There were very welcome compliments in regard to the activities of the various State companies and in some cases in regard to my own Department.  In fact, it has been an excellent example of constructive discussion on an important phase of Government.</P>

    <P>I do not know whether I need to repeat again, for the third year, a statement on the question of the control of the State companies and the answering of Questions in the Dáil. Perhaps for the sake of the record, I <Col N="783" /> should remind the few Deputies who spoke about this what the position actually is.  First of all, my Department exercises a general directive upon all State companies in connection with the Second Programme for Economic Expansion.  We have continuous discussions with them.  Matters of policy are discussed in relation to their presentation to us of capital demands and in relation to discussion on their annual reports.  I meet the boards of all these State companies at reasonably frequent intervals and I continuously meet the managers, chairmen and managing directors of these companies.</P>
    <P>Deputies have very adequate opportunities here for discussing all matters relating to my Department on the occasion of the Estimate, and on the occasion of the frequent Bills which either organisational changes, or capital changes, or a combination of both, make necessary.  In that connection, as an illustration, there will be ample opportunity for discussing the four State companies this year: the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the Electricity Supply Board, the Air Companies, and later on Bórd Fáilte in connection with some legislation which is anticipated.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, if Deputies feel there is some important matter of interest in relation to a particular State company there can be a resolution to discuss the annual report of the company. In addition as I have already made clear, I take note of all the observations made during the course of the Estimate discussion, and discussions on other occasions.  In order to ensure that there are no repetitive complaints of various kinds we make a very careful examination of all the complaints that come to the Department from Deputies, and from the general public, and if they appear to be repetitive they are discussed with the Board concerned.  If they raise questions of policy, again they are discussed with the Board concerned. This is a continuous process that is going on the whole time.</P>
    <P>This procedure is quite different <Col N="784" /> from the perpetual asking of questions on day to day matters of administration. In my view, and in the view of many other Ministers in the same office as myself in other countries, this would submit the State companies to impossible pressure.  If for example it were the custom to ask questions in the Dáil about every bus service in the country, it would be impossible to avoid the type of political pressure that would result from Deputies acting locally, and making observations on these matters, and it would be quite impossible for CIE to conduct their business properly.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is quite possible for me to watch the general picture of bus transport in this country, and to analyse the complaints made about the deficiencies in the bus services.  The full statement prepared in the Pacemaker Report shows the tremendous degree to which CIE are running a social service, exemplified by the very high proportion of bus services that lose money, and the very small proportion which mercifully make a surplus which results in the whole bus operation being remunerative to a very modest degree.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the freight service.  Discussions are held with the National Farmers Association, and with the National Livestock Federation, on occasion in relation to the transport of cattle and agricultural produce.  In that way we are able to get a fair picture by which we can judge the efficiency of the State enterprise, without at the same time coming under the day to day political pressure, which would inevitably result in the most undesirable form of political control and eventual inefficiency.  I believe most members of the House accept that general principle.</P>
    <P>As I said before, emotionally I would dearly love to answer every question put to me because I have an intense personal desire to know absolutely everything that goes on in all the State companies, which incidentally would be intellectually and physically impossible for me, or for anyone else in my position.  If all the questions asked were allowed I would <Col N="785" /> be driven into an impossible position. To put it another way, it is annoying for me to have to refuse, in the public interest, to answer questions on day to day administration, which would eventually result in the wrong kind of pressure being brought to bear on the State companies, so I have to go through the much less pleasant process &mdash;although it is an interesting one&mdash;of analysing complaints and replying in great detail to discussions on Estimates and on Bills, and doing my utmost to give the right kind of information which shows the general trend in regard to the actions taken by all the State companies, their efficiency, their policy, and the general directives we give them.</P>
    <P>I propose on this occasion to take the time of the House to give in fair detail replies to all the questions that have been raised by Deputies.  It will take me some time, but I am doing it because last night I looked through the ambit of all the questions asked and I realised that I should answer nearly all of the questions to relieve the minds of some Deputies who think there is some kind of secrecy attaching to the operations of the State companies, and the minds of Deputies who have now had an opportunity of ventilating their grievances.  I propose to take some time giving a detailed reply on all those matters.</P>
    <P>First of all I think I should say in connection with the presentation of the annual report of CIE that I do not think I was entirely fair to the company when I referred to the fact that the loss was greater in 1964-65 than in 1963-64 because of the effect in the previous year of the bus strike.  I think I should make it clear that the saving of £525,000 on subsidy required a tremendous effort on the part of the whole staff.  I do not think I emphasised sufficiently that that effort was required because wages and salaries and depreciation increases exceeded to a considerable extent the effect of the fare increases which were an inevitable result of the ninth round increase in wages and salaries.  In order to do that, a tremendous effort had to be made to gain more traffic, to indulge <Col N="786" /> in still greater productivity exercises, and to provide better and better services.</P>
    <P>Having read the Pacemaker Report, and having analysed the financial position of CIE during the past five years, it is my view that but for all the reorganisation work undertaken, the impetus towards a sales policy, and the development of a sales organisation within CIE, and all the other steps taken to increase output, the loss would be between £3¼ million and £4 million, which would be a further impost on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the improvement in the Ballyfermot bus service and said this improvement was overdue.  In my view an examination of bus service requirements must be undertaken scientifically.  In that connection the need for the extra buses might not have arisen but for the fact that there was a worsening of the bus service due to bunching in Dublin slowing up the whole operation.  After the quite obvious growth of congestion of traffic in Dublin, CIE undertook a modern scientific survey using computers to analyse the origin and destination of all tickets which resulted in this improvement in the service. May I add that I understand this new type of operation is capable of being applied at reasonable intervals, and Deputies need have no fear that CIE will lose touch with the general bus passenger requirement position in the future.  Now that they have this new technique, they will be even more rapid in making the necessary changes in the bus services.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that if Deputy Clinton reads the Second Reading debate on the 1964 Transport Act, he will find full particulars of the very large number of Dublin bus services that lose money and he will find that again, luckily, there are certain bus services extremely profitable, though the fare basis is exactly the same, which helps to make up for the losses on the services which, as he says, are run for social reasons&mdash;the fact that people must be transported from their homes to their places of work and for other reasons.  At a <Col N="787" /> recent date the total profit on the Dublin bus services was the equivalent of one-seventh of a penny per passenger journey.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Lyons raised the question of whether any other branch lines are likely to close.  Of course, the answer is that, again if the Pacemaker Report is studied, it will be found there are few routes where there could be a marginal decision one way or another, that the main closures have already been effected as far as the general ambit of CIE operations under the present act is concerned.</P>
    <P>I might add in that connection that where a bus service replaced a rail service and freight services on the railway were replaced by a lorry service, in quite a number of areas the actual traffic increased.  That is particularly noticeable in parts of west Cork where the amount of the traffic increased, where the time taken to transport the goods was reduced and the actual ambit of the services improved. I would say that in general I have had very few complaints of poor substitute services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Casey made a rather sensational speech and I do not propose to follow him along the lines on which he travelled when making his speech except to say to him that I utterly refute the charges he made in regard to political discrimination on the question of redundancy on CIE.  If he has such very serious charges to make, he should make them to me directly and I shall have them investigated.  All the arrangements for the carrying out of redundancy provisions under the Transport Act were made under an agreement between the unions and the executive of CIE and I have not had any suggestions during the whole period that there had been discrimination. If there had been, the Deputy can be certain I would have been the first to hear it and I am glad the Deputy accepted my word that I had no hand, act or part, directly or indirectly, in any political discrimination in respect of those who were declared redundant and in respect of those retained in the CIE service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> Deputy Casey suggested that the numbers of the executive staff of CIE had increased and that when this was compared with those rendered redundant it could be seen the executive staff were being taken care of, that extra jobs were being provided and so forth. In 1958 the executive staff of CIE amounted to 1.3 per cent of the total CIE staff and by 1965 the executive staff amounted to 1.6 per cent of the total, having increased by 14 per cent from 281 persons to 332 persons.  The extra number appointed were mainly concerned with efforts to increase the productivity of the CIE traffic sector, with sales organisation and with the type of change in method of working of CIE which inevitably involved closer attention to costs accountancy and high productivity.  Nobody could say that represents a change through which the staff of CIE in the lower wage grades were discriminated against by the appointment of increased numbers of executive staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Casey said he understood the whole of the road freight services of CIE were now under examination and implied drastic changes might take place without the Dáil hearing about it or even myself hearing about it.  Every branch of CIE has been under examination for quite a number of years and the road freight sector came under examination recently, as I indicated in my opening speech; but anything that involved changes in the whole position of the national transport services for road freight would naturally have to come to me for approval and would indeed possibly involve legislation.</P>
    <P>All these matters would be examined. CIE have a social obligation to provide road freight services as far as possible all through the country.  The majority of these services already lose money but nevertheless there is an obligation on CIE to provide them, if there is a case for making marginal changes and syphoning off some portions of the services and liberalising them when the total services could still be as good as they were in the past that would be a matter for examination. The suggestion by Deputy <Col N="789" /> Casey that the whole of the road freight services of CIE might be abandoned without consideration of the effect on public needs is completely without foundation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy raised the question of some differentiation in fares as between Dublin to Galway and Galway to Dublin.  This might be due to the fact that there were different kinds of excursion rates offered at either end but I am quite certain there was no prejudice against Galway.  If he would like to give me the particulars I shall have the matter examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara raised the question of the closing of Foxford station and made the allegation that it had been operating at a profit.  If he reads the Pacemaker Report, he will see how the profits and losses of CIE lines were carefully examined, that examination was made of receipts and expenditure over particular sections of line and that the proportion of overhead expenses and fixed charges was applied to every sector of line in order to determine its profitability.  He can be <Col N="790" /> assured that CIE do not close any line or station that makes a profit after all factors are taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara mentioned some goods that were rotting as a result of poor service by CIE.  I should be glad if he gave me particulars of that when I shall ask CIE for a report.  He raised the question of why passengers who left Ballina for Dublin by the combined bus and rail services were not able to purchase through tickets.  That is a good point and I shall take up with CIE why people cannot purchase through tickets where a bus service is specifically linked with an arterial service and, indeed, particularly where, during some parts of the day, there are actually rail services in operation. There is a rail service the whole way from Ballina to Dublin and also a service from Claremorris to Dublin with a bus connection from Ballina. I shall ask CIE about that matter.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 15th June, 1965.</P>
