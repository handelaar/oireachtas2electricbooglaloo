      <P>Last night when we adjourned, I was speaking on the development and planning of our roads and saying that in the next ten to 15 years we foresee the completion of these highways.  I see them as a natural addition to the planning and development that has already taken place in the industrial field.  They will be an aid to our ever-growing tourist industry. Indeed, I look upon them as highways to the future for this country and for its development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we enter homes today, as against years ago, we hear water flowing in taps, the quiet hum of refrigerators and washing machines and in many cases we find central heating in these homes.  This, then, is the planning and progress we on this side of the House see for the future. Having listened to the Minister's speech, I am satisfied that he has all of these plans well in hand, but we must, however, be on our guard that we neither over-plan nor under-plan but that we plan in accordance with <Col N="341" /> the financial resources of the nation and indeed the development of our gross national product, so that we shall build up and maintain a steady development rather than have a stop and start economy.  This is the first Estimate presented to this 18th Dáil and I am pleased to know that it is in the hands of a competent Minister who has the foresight and the planning behind him to ensure that the social needs of his Department will be well and truly met.  This being the case, we can look forward to the next four or five years as years of progress and development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many aspects of local government to which I should like to refer but I shall confine myself to just a few points. One matter is the question of traffic in the city of Dublin.  New regulations were brought in in the past few months and motorists have quite a nice time going fast more or less nowhere.  You can fly around St. Stephen's Green at a good pace but if you want to get to the bottom of Grafton Street, it is not so easy to get there as it used to be. You get a great impression of speed from the new regulations and on the whole they are good, but one does waste quite a lot of time and petrol going places that one does not want to go to at all.  One of the obvious defects of this new system which we are installing is that it is having an adverse effect on certain traders.  Some streets are now cut off from the benefit of the flow of traffic and shopkeepers in whole areas are finding that the cash trade they once did is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things seem to be partly inevitable but I should like the Minister and his Department to consider very carefully how they can help the business community in the various cities, especially in Dublin.  We must have better parking facilities; we must have buildings erected, probably multi-storey buildings, to house motor cars. Wherever possible, parking places must be made available.  The city of Dublin will have to face the spending of large sums of money on facilitating traffic, on facilitating motorists, and <Col N="342" /> thereby the whole trade of the city.</P>
    <P>If we do not do that in Dublin, we shall find that we have deliberately created outside the city area large shopping centres which will be of no benefit to the city.  That will happen inevitably if we do not put up buildings because even open spaces are not enough to contain the motor cars.  It is not now a question of cars being luxury objects for the well-to-do to use.  Increasingly, everybody is using cars in some form or other.  We are only at the beginning of the development of the internal combustion engine and the reduction of its production costs and the layers of society it will reach.</P>
    <P>Anybody going into Dublin between 8 and 8.30 a.m. meets a continuous flow of motor traffic from the city and in those cars are not businessmen and well-to-do people.  You will find they are building operatives going to building sites in the outer suburbs.  It is a grand thing to see these facilities spreading throughout the whole of our society.  We have all seen that already very great numbers of the public are using cars and it is good to find the building operatives and many others are no exception.  That tendency will continue and I suggest to the Minister that he should urge local authorities to provide parking facilities for cars. Otherwise, we shall eventually be compelled to spend millions in moving property and houses out of the city.  This problem has hit Dublin and, I presume, to a lesser extent, Cork, Limerick and Waterford already but I am primarily concerned with Dublin.  If we do not provide these facilities, the trade of Dublin and its employment will suffer much and we shall be left with expensive movements of population on our hands.</P>
    <P>The cheapest way we can handle the situation is to put up these big buildings in the centre of the city.  They will cost money but we shall have to face that in the same way as we now provide other amenities out of the rates and/or from central funds.  In that connection I suggest that Dublin Corporation has done a wonderful job in building.  Let nobody say that it has <Col N="343" /> not done a great deal for its poorer inhabitants.  We know it has not done enough yet but I think it has had a task in housing and rehousing its population which was not equalled in any other capital city in Western Europe. I think I am correct in saying that at present up to almost 40 per cent of the population of Dublin is housed by the Corporation and that has taken place in the past 40 or 50 years.  That is a fine achievement for any local body.  In the last few years we have not given it the attention it deserved as a Government.  The building programme fell in Dublin and I am glad that steps are being taken, perhaps as a result of what some of us have said here and elsewhere, to remedy that position.</P>
    <P>I think that not only in places like Ballymun but in the city proper we shall have to go up higher and install lifts in our flats.  That will help to remedy the traffic problem which is a very serious one for Dublin.  The business community hardly realises yet what it may mean but it can mean vast expenditure and terrible dislocation and unemployment unless the problem can be tackled very quickly and firmly.</P>
    <P>I have been on Dublin Corporation for the past 22 years and I found it a most interesting and, on the whole, a very fine body but I have constantly been aware that it suffers from a lack of councillors with business experience. We have lived through an intensely political period and very few business people have had the time or the will&mdash;I was about to say the ability &mdash;to identify themselves with the purely political aspects of local government which was so necessary if a man wanted to be successful in standing for a body like Dublin Corporation.  Most business people cannot do that.  There used be a restricted franchise whereby business people through various organisations like the chamber of commerce had the right to elect a certain number of people in a manner similar to that operating in the Port and Docks Board with very great success.  I would urge the Minister and the Government <Col N="344" /> to consider very seriously the defects which arise in Dublin Corporation, in the council, through the lack of adequate business representation.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see the body overwhelmed by business but while various sections are represented there, we do feel the loss of representation of the business community.  I trust the Minister will give the matter serious thought because it is all tied up with what I have been saying about traffic and parking facilities and knowledge of what will happen to the city.  The business community is not, and cannot be, in as close touch with the planners and what is going on as they should be.  I hope the Minister will look into that and perhaps if the elections are delayed until 1966, there will be time to produce a scheme which will benefit that section of the community. Although I cannot speak for them, I feel that our friends on the Labour benches would have no objection to that because what helps the business community in the main can help those employed in the various manufacturing firms and businesses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Estimate for Local Government affords an opportunity to those of us who are members of public bodies to air the views of local authorities in the House and to get the ear of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, housing is the primary responsibility of local authorities.  I can definitely state that over the last nine years since the present Government came into office, speaking for Kilkenny specifically, and for the country in general, practically no progress has been made in the matter of housing. The White Paper issued by the Minister showed that in 1962 the number of houses built represented only one-third of the number built in 1952.  So that over the ten years there was a policy to reduce the number of houses built.  I understand that statements were made in the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to the effect that there was no further necessity for social investment in housing, that the demand had been met.  It is noticeable <Col N="345" /> in this debate the manner in which the policy of the Government has been put forward and the necessity for housing played down.  The case has been put up that there was a tremendous number of houses vacant in Dublin city in 1958/59 and that that was one of the reasons why the housing programme was cut down.  That is merely an excuse.  If the Government were anxious to promote housing they would have continued with it.  Apparently, the Government believe that housing is of secondary consideration to productive investment. We on this side of the House believe that housing should come first, that the people must be given decent houses in which to rear their families, if we want to make them reasonable citizens.</P>
    <P>There are various ways by which a Government can hold up progress in housing.  There is no need for the Government to state that house building will be discontinued.  The Government had not the courage to rescind the Local Government (Works) Act but they provided no money to implement it.  That was a way of killing it without rescinding it.  In the same way with housing, the Government did not say that they would discontinue housing but they had ways and means of holding up progress in the Department.  I remember deputation after deputation coming to the Minister seeking a full subsidy on houses in cases where we had provided new houses for persons who were in overcrowded dwellings. We felt we were fully entitled to the two-thirds subsidy.  We were put off all the time.  When we saw that the Minister was not inclined to be reasonable with us then we could not see our way to go ahead with building for fear we would not get the full subsidy.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister has relaxed somewhat as a result of the crisis created in Dublin by the fact that houses were falling down.  It was the panic created by that situation that stimulated interest in housing.  The Minister has relaxed to the extent that he is now allowing local authorities in rural areas to rehouse persons out of county council cottages and will give the full subsidy in cases of overcrowding.  That relaxation has not yet been extended <Col N="346" /> to towns or to cities like Kilkenny.  I would appeal to the Minister to make that extension.  In the city of Kilkenny, conditions are worse than they are in Africa.  In Africa, people have shacks in which to maintain their families.  In Kilkenny, the people have not separate rooms in which to maintain their families.  The Minister should relax the regulations in respect of cities as he has already done in the rural areas.  What is the point of providing improved health services if we do not provide good housing conditions for those people who come out of hospital?</P>
    <P>The case of a family in Kilkenny was brought to my notice.  This family live in a damp, dark house.  The husband, who is a very industrious man, is sick occasionally.  One of the seven children is in hospital constantly.  Consider the cost to the country.  Would it not be much better if that family had a decent airy house in which to live, in which case they would not require this constant hospital treatment?</P>
    <P>At the meeting of Kilkenny Corporation on Monday night, we were told that one small insignificant housing scheme of about six houses had been submitted and had been with the Department eight weeks and no decision had been taken.  We find that happening all the time.  One way of delaying progress in housing is to withhold decisions, when plans are submitted, to send them back to the local authority after about three months asking them to re-draft some portion or to review some other portion and when that is done, to repeat the performance.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister called in officials of Dublin Corporation to the Custom House with a view to having co-operation between the Corporation and the departmental officials so that there would not be continuous delays in respect of housing schemes.  If that type of co-operation were extended to other local authorities, the local authority members would have more confidence in themselves.  In the past nine years, only one scheme of houses has been built in Kilkenny.  The site for that scheme was sanctioned by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy P. <Col N="347" /> O'Donnell.  It took two or three years of hard work to force the Minister's hand in order that those houses might be built.  If the fact that houses have fallen down in Dublin has brought about a change in the outlook of the Government in the matter of housing, it will have done some good.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister realises more than anyone that costs of housing have increased over the past number of years.  Yet, there has been no increase in the amount of grants and the upper income limits for qualification for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act have not been raised.</P>
    <P>We want to encourage people to build their own houses.  It is a good thing that people should have a stake in the country rather than that the local authority should build houses for them in certain cases.  A weekly income of £20 to £25 is not a wonderfully high income at the present time having regard to the high cost of living.  What chance would a person on that income have of building his own house?  He cannot get a loan from the local authority under the Small Dwellings Act.  The Minister should be realistic.  He should increase the grants and raise the upper limit for loans.</P>
    <P>In certain cases when persons reconstruct their houses, they must cut their cloth according to their measure. They have only a certain amount of money and can do only a certain amount of reconstruction.  In a few years' time a person may have been able to have saved sufficient money to enable him to do further necessary reconstruction.  Simply because he has already received a grant in respect of the first reconstruction, he is debarred from receiving a second reconstruction grant in respect of the same house. The reason why the person had not completed the job in the first instance was lack of capital.  He may get a grant in respect of a roof or some such work.  Otherwise, he will not get a second grant.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from a person complaining that work to her house needed <Col N="348" /> to be carried out and she had not the capital to put in the various windows which were falling out.  She went to the local authority who said : &ldquo;You will certainly get a grant for that,&rdquo; and she had the work carried out.  I was in contact with the Minister's Department last week and I was told that there was no hope of her getting a grant.  She would get a grant for plastering the house in order to preserve it but surely putting in windows is preserving a house.  I would ask the Minister to be a little more reasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor yesterday asked the Minister to move around through the local authorities in order to speed up housing.  There is no necessity for the Minister to do that.  If the Minister does his duty in the Department, the local authorities will be only too anxious to do their part in housing the people.  However, it is Government policy apparently that social investment and investment in housing should be cut down, as it has been cut down by the various means already mentioned.</P>
    <P>In regard to roads, we were very much surprised at our county council meeting in Kilkenny on Monday to find that there is practically no increase in the county road grant.  In 1962/63 the Kilkenny County Council were allocated £61,000 county road grant. In line with all the other counties, we had a five-year plan for the improvement of county roads.  During the Emergency, nothing could be done with the county roads.  We put aside 2/- in the £ each year for that purpose and that has been put aside up to date, with the result that we were making great headway with our county roads. However, in 1963/64 there was a complete change of Government policy and they closed down on the five-year plan. They switched the money over to arterial roads and allocated a lesser amount to main roads.  There was a 33? per cent reduction in the county road improvement grant in 1962/63, in the following year and the year after that.  This year there is an increase of only £790, two per cent, whereas the main road improvement grant has increased by ten per cent and the arterial <Col N="349" /> road grant by 20 per cent.  Therefore, the total amount of the grants has been increased by £24,600 but the county road grant has been increased by only £790 and has actually been reduced by £22,000 since 1962/63.  A mere £16,000 is being spent on county roads as against £107,000 for arterial roads and £66,000 for main roads.  It is grand to have roads like racetracks throughout the country and none of us objects to the improvement of main and arterial roads.  I like to drive on a good road but the two things could have been taken together.</P>
    <P>The county road grant was under discussion at Kilkenny County Council and every member there protested against its reduction, irrespective of his Party affiliation.  One member there who was a member of the House up to a short time ago stated that the Fianna Fáil Party had raised this matter in higher quarters which, I take it, is their own Party meeting.  He said they got nowhere with it and what he felt was that whatever Government were in office, these county road improvement grants would be cut.  I disagree with that point of view, the point of view of Deputy Geoghegan and Deputy O'Connor, as expressed here yesterday. They maintain that the officials have the final say as to where the money should go, whether to county roads, main roads or arterial roads.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to take away the blame and the responsibility in that matter from where it belongs.  The Minister and the Government have the responsibility for forming policy.  It is ridiculous to state, as the member from Kilkenny stated, that whatever Government were in office there would be no change in the county road grant.  There must be some significance in the fact that Deputy O'Connor and Deputy Geoghegan appealed to the Minister here yesterday to review the allocation of county road improvement grants.</P>
    <P>When the five-year plan was in operation, we went so far as to provide £90,000 over a period of three years for the improvement of lanes and <i>culs-de-sac</i>.  The result is that we shall have our lanes and <i>culs-de-sac</i> completed in a few years' time but we shall not have our county roads completed. <Col N="350" /> With the policy of this Government, we are losing people from the land every day.  If we do not provide roads so that they will have reasonable means of communication, then the young people will refuse to stay in these backward places, going through water and mud to reach their homes in the wintertime. I appeal to the Minister to give a reasonable grant for the improvement of county roads.  The protest made by the Kilkenny County Council in relation to this matter was unanimous. The Minister was a member of a local authority and he should appreciate the position.  If he is being forced by the Government of which he is a member to have a Dublin outlook, to be city-minded, and to disregard the county roads, then he should be man enough, remembering his own experience, to insist on getting more money for the improvement of county roads.</P>
    <P>With regard to town planning, we are all very confused indeed.  Several references have been made to it here already.  There is one point I should like to make.  We are supposed to have a plan within three years of last October.  Now no local authority knows what grants will be available or how they will be financed.  No qualified personnel can be found.  I believe the Minister is rather rushing the whole thing.  Planning is necessary; planning is much better than haphazard building here, there and everywhere.  We set up the skeleton organisation for planning in our particular local authority only last Monday.  We were awaiting a direction from the Minister and his Department with regard to the contribution to be made towards the cost.  The rates are already very high.  There are no qualified personnel but, apparently, qualified personnel are not now necessary. Any civil engineer will do to fill the post.  The Minister is putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>I mentioned rates.  Rates are increasing out of all reason.  I have been a member of a local authority for quite some time and I can remember when everybody would be thunderstruck if there was an increase of 6d on the rates.  An increase of 1/- in the £ would bring an outcry.  Last year our <Col N="351" /> rates went up by 8/6 or 9/-.  This year they have gone up by another 8/6 or 9/-.  They are now 67/3d in the £. Consider what that burden means to some people.  Take the case of a man who built a house with the aid of an SDA loan.  The house was valued at, perhaps, £16 per year.  With the rates as they are at the moment he must pay the Corporation £54 per year plus the repayment of his original loan.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder so many of these houses are coming on the market? People just cannot afford to repay the loan and pay the high rates as well. Deputy O'Connor commented on the increase in Kerry to £4 in the £.  Land in Kerry may be valued fairly low and that may have something to do with the situation there.  A man may have a very big acreage with a small valuation. People living in the city of Kilkenny in houses built with the aid of an SDA loan&mdash;these are not very big houses&mdash;find it impossible to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to look into this matter.  Some alternative method of financing these services&mdash; health services, roads and so on&mdash; must be found.  Roads should be financed completely out of the Road Fund with, if necessary, a subvention from central funds.  The rates should be relieved of the burden of health services.  If the present position continues every small shop will have to close.  The Government will have to review the situation to discover if there are other ways of financing local services other than through the rates. Town planning is now falling on the rates and that means another increase. That is one of the reasons why we delayed appointing staff to deal with planning.  When the farmers marched in protest the Government promptly increased the grants so that farmers would have a greater relief of rates. Apparently the townspeople are not protesting.  They are not organised. They have no organisation like the farmers have.  The result is that the townspeople are slowly disappearing. They are stealing away in the night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate <Col N="352" /> the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy P. Brennan, and the Department on what they have done in regard to housing, piped water, town planning and swimming pools.  I shall confine my remarks to roads because other Deputies have dealt with other aspects of local government.  As far as Galway is concerned, I have no complaint to make about arterial roads, main roads and county roads. There is a problem, however, in regard to link roads and <i>culs-de-sac</i>.  We have a great number of these yet to be done in Galway.  There are only two methods of doing them and, until recently, there was only one method. Now, under a new regulation made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Works in 1962, if a road is done under a rural improvement scheme&mdash;this applies, so far as I know, all over the country&mdash;and that road serves three or four houses, it can be taken over and maintained by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other method we have of doing these roads in Galway is out of the rates.  I have been a member of Galway County Council for quite some time; if I live, please God, until 29th June, next, I shall have completed 20 years as a county councillor.  Now the second method is that each councillor is allocated a certain sum of money each year for his own particular area. It was £100 or £120 but, with the rising costs, it went up to £300 and last year we allocated £500 per councillor. With 31 councillors, that comes to a figure of £16,500.  That is a heavy impost on the ratepayers of County Galway. Some of these roads connect county roads and are used by the general public.  Several miles of these will have to be done.  A road a mile or two long serving 14 or 15 houses will cost £2,000 or £3,000 to put into proper repair.  There will be widening of the road.  Corners will have to be removed.  Fencing will have to be done. Sometimes land must be acquired.  Five or six councillors may have to come together in order to reach agreement on how to allocate their money to put this road into proper repair so that the council would take it over and the <Col N="353" /> Department would be satisfied it should be maintained for all time as a county road.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister and his new Parliamentary Secretary to come to the aid of councils such as mine.  If the Government are sincere in their interest for the West, they should allocate out of the Road Fund a special grant for counties such as Galway which have several miles of these roads yet to be done and not have an extra impost of 4d. in the £ on the ratepayers year after year&mdash;and it will be years before we can solve this problem.</P>
    <P>Up to ten families are living on some of these roads.  Out of those ten families you might have six or seven cars and two or three tractors paying tax to the county council.  In addition to paying their rent and rates, they are paying tax on the cars and tractors. They are paying into the Road Fund but they get no benefit whatever from it until they go out on the main roads. These pothole-filled roads are used by the priest going out on sick calls or to the village station, by the doctor visiting the sick at all hours of day and night, and by the children going out to school.  Sometimes their parents have to carry them out over the potholes and water.  We have creameries starting in the West now.  I know the milk lorries have refused to go into some of these roads.  The people have to carry out the milk cans on wheel barrows for half a mile to the main roads.</P>
    <P>We have some great roads in County Galway.  If we bring up this matter at the county council, the county manager will say that the council are not responsible until these link roads and <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads are declared county roads.  We cannot declare them county roads until they are put into proper repair.  I drive over 100 miles to Dublin.  I see millions of pounds being spent on the arterial roads.  Why not take a little slice off that and spend it on these roads I am speaking of?  There are 31 councillors in Galway County Council.  If we got £1,000 grant for each councillor, in addition to what <Col N="354" /> we get from the rates, for the next five years, this problem would be solved. I am appealing to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to do something on these lines.  Let us go ahead with the work and take these people out of the misery and drudgery they have been in for years.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that this Estimate should be the first one to come before the new Dáil because it focuses attention on what is without doubt our most serious national problem&mdash;the problem of providing adequate housing for our people.  There was some indication in the Minister's speech of new thinking with regard to housing.  However, there was very little to indicate that we are now anywhere nearer a practicable solution to this problem.  The situation has become so bad that nothing short of a crash programme can hope to alleviate the situation. Housing has come up for discussion on numerous occasions during the last Dáil.  The Minister has been fully informed of the serious housing shortage, not alone in Dublin but in Cork, Limerick and other parts as well.</P>
      <P>This situation should never have arisen.  It is simply due to the fact that since 1957 there has been a substantial reduction in house building.  In fact, I believe there was a deliberate cutting down by the Government.  Statistics have been quoted during the course of the debate to prove this point.  I am not going to bandy about any further statistics now.  The figures for house output since 1957 are well known.  The comparison between house building in the period from 1957 to the present and that of the inter-Party period from 1954 to 1957 is also well known. Suffice it to say that the situation has now become so serious that much more than the little bit of evidence of new thinking contained in the Minister's speech will be necessary.  I look forward with some hope to the new Housing Bill to be presented in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a constituency where, in the city of Limerick, we have the worst and most serious housing situation in Ireland.  Therefore, it is only <Col N="355" /> natural that I should refer again to the appalling conditions under which over 1,000 families there are compelled to live.  A housing survey conducted a year and a half ago by Limerick Corporation indicated that about 1,350 families were in urgent need of rehousing. There were two financial years since 1957 during which not even one single house was built in Limerick city.  One was, I think, 1959-60 and the other was 1961-62.</P>
    <P>Over the past three and a half years I have seen some of the conditions under which these families are compelled to live.  During the recent general election campaign I visited hundreds of those unfortunate people.  I was horrified and shocked at what I saw.  I saw three families crowded into a small two-bedroomed house.  I saw a husband, wife and seven young children in a small single room where they live, eat and sleep.  I saw families broken up, the wife going back to her parents, the husband to his, some of the children with the father, more of them with the mother.  There are newly-married couples living in attics four floors up in single rooms for which they are paying exorbitant rents.  It would be difficult to exaggerate the appalling conditions of well over 1,000 families in the city of Limerick.  The reason for it is, simply and solely, that there has been a drastic decline in the number of houses built in Limerick since 1957.</P>
    <P>A peculiar thing about the Limerick housing situation is this.  There has been a lot of discussion, particularly by Limerick Corporation.  Over the last year or so the tendency has been for the Corporation to blame the Department, while the Minister seems to blame the Corporation.  I recall that about a year ago I tabled a question in the House to the Minister asking him if he was satisfied with the progress being made by Limerick Corporation towards solving the housing situation. The Minister said he was not satisfied.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we had the then Parliamentary Secretary, now Minister for Health, attacking Limerick Corporation <Col N="356" /> a few months ago.  He seemed to attribute to them most, if not all, of the blame for the housing situation in Limerick.  We have had proposals going up and down from Limerick to the Department regarding various housing schemes for Limerick.  That is the type of red tape with which we have to deal, and all the time these unfortunate people are waiting to be housed.</P>
    <P>I made this suggestion to the Minister before: if Limerick Corporation are to blame for this situation, then I would ask the Minister, as the man who has the final responsibility for the housing of our people, to get tough and to see that Limerick Corporation do their job.  On the other hand, if his Department are responsible, he should take action.  We in Limerick are so confused now that we cannot say who, in fact, is responsible, but we are concerned with cutting out the red tape, and with action being taken to get houses built.</P>
    <P>About two months ago the Minister was in Limerick and he put forward the suggestion that perhaps the best approach to solving the housing situation was by means of system building. Quite a lot of controversy followed that suggestion.  The trade unions are afraid that the introduction of this scheme of building might seriously jeopardise the livelihood of the building workers.  I have spoken about this matter, and I have given it serious thought.  I do not think there is any need for introducing any revolutionary or experimental type of house building system.  In fact, I have no doubt that if the departmental red tape, and a lot of the talk and discussions, were cut out, the traditional methods of the building industry could be geared to solve this atrocious housing situation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I sincerely hope the new Housing Bill which will be coming before the Dáil shortly will go a long way towards solving the situation. I sincerely hope that I will not have to go again into the details of the deplorable and desperate conditions in which so many families in Limerick are compelled to live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House very long on this Estimate.  Deputy Crotty referred to the reduction in the grants for county roads.  As a representative of the Tipperary County Council, I know that we have far fewer county roads to maintain now, and we can do a better job because we have less mileage to maintain.  I think some counties are to blame if they have bad roads.  If you want to have roads and services, you must increase the rates, and no one likes to see that happening.  About a week ago we had discussions in our county council and a county councillor, who is also a member of the urban council, said that the people in his town were blaming the county council for increasing the rates.  I do not think that statement is correct, because we contribute to roads and services.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker spoke about the shocking housing conditions in Limerick.  I can say that in my own county we have three or four important towns, and we have built as many houses over the past two years as ever, and we are still building.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot have good services and keep down the rates. Farmers get grants and relief of rates, but we must take into account that the farmer must spend about £500 or £600 on seeds and manures in the spring and he has to wait for a long time before he gets his money back.</P>
      <P>As regards sanction for the building of cottages, there are applicants in my own area who have been waiting for six or seven years.  They are living in bad and unsuitable conditions.  The council say to them: &ldquo;Can you get a site?&rdquo;  I do not think that should be the case.  I think it is the duty of the officials to go out and select a site.  A man living beside a farmer does not want to get on bad terms with his neighbour, although farmers do not begrudge giving sites because they get good payment for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also heard people talking about delays, not so much in regard to new house grants but reconstruction grants. Deputy Crotty referred to the fact that if there is a small defect, the man will not get the grant, but I think it would <Col N="358" /> be better if some small reduction were made.  Deputy Crotty also referred to small farmers getting reconstruction grants and trying to carry out the work themselves.</P>
    <P>The Town Planning Act was also discussed and there was some criticism of it.  In my own county houses were built a few years ago and when the question of road widening and development came up later they had to be demolished and new building erected. That should not happen.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the voters list.  I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister the case of the father of a family who had a vote for years, but his name was off the register for the last election and the names of his two sons were on it.  In another case the name of the wife was on the register and the name of the husband was off it.  I do not think that should happen.  This is something that needs tidying up and the rate collectors, or whoever are responsible for the job, should do their work.  They are paid for it as far as I know.  It may be thought they are not getting enough but they should at least do their job.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House much longer except to mention the big increase in the rates arising out of the Health Act.  If there is such an increase, it is not going to the people. I, as a member of a mental hospital committee in Clonmel, found this year that we had an increase of £23,000 for wages and salaries.  At any rate that sum was settled and nobody objected to it.  It was sanctioned because it had to be sanctioned.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government on his appointment because I think this is one Department where a Parliamentary Secretary was badly needed.  Thousands of letters come in every day and they all have to go before the Minister. Therefore, if there was a need at all for a Parliamentary Secretary, it was in this Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am, in general, disappointed with the Minister's speech.  I cannot say I see anything in it portending any radical departure or breakthrough in the <Col N="359" /> housing problem confronting us all over the country.  We are all aware that under the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> it was accepted Government policy to slow down social investment, and that applied to housing. Down through the years, every local authority has experienced difficulty in getting housing schemes under way.  First of all, there was a question of assessment of means.  This was applied in the most rigid fashion. There is an indication in the Minister's speech&mdash;and we shall wait with interest to see how it works out&mdash;of a certain amount of relaxation and rethinking on that matter.  One really had to be in the most appalling conditions before being put on a waiting list for houses. The list was drawn up and the people came to the local council office month after month and year after year until inevitably that list became out of date and a new one was prepared because some of the original applicants moved away.  The answer on all occasions was that there could not be too much building in case there would be unoccupied houses.  It must always be recognised that there will be houses unoccupied.  That is a risk which will always obtain.  But the big difficulty which confronted every local authority is the rigidity in the assessment of housing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second difficulty which confronted every local authority was that of red tape.  A kind of shuttlecock operation came into being, once a project scheme was mentioned.  Plans, letters and correspondence passed between the local authority and the Custom House.  There some minor difficulty was found and the application was sent back from the Custom House and the whole thing had to be reinvestigated locally.  Everybody became worn out and eventually nobody knew what was happening.  Then the most active councillor got tired asking interminable questions about the scheme. All this was not accidental; it was a deliberate delaying tactic.  The Minister and the Department did not say that they did not want houses built at the moment&mdash;that  be bad political <Col N="360" /> tactics&mdash;but there was another way of doing it, this red tape method of delaying the initiation of housing schemes.</P>
    <P>The third difficulty is a question of grants.  Not alone were grants inadequate but in many cases there was delay and frustration as regards the payment of these grants.  Again, one could not help feeling that this was a deliberate policy to slow down social investment in housing.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there was a final technique adopted liberally by the present Minister. It was adopted by him in his speech yesterday: blame the local authority.  There is one Minister who has achieved fame by his invariable reply to parliamentary questions: &ldquo;I have no function in the matter.&rdquo;  Our present Minister for Local Government has achieved fame by saying: &ldquo;This is a function of the local authority.&rdquo;  I would say of local authorities that, by and large, they are not to blame for the present housing dilemma in which we find ourselves.  Nor do I believe for one moment that the blame lies on the shoulders of the officials in the Custom House.  If they are positively told to do a thing, they will do it for any Minister.</P>
    <P>The position in my particular constituency as regards housing is bad.  In all our towns throughout the county there is an amount of bad and substandard housing.  Anybody who drives through this State and who perhaps drives on a holiday through England will at once appreciate the tremendous difference between the nice English villages and the poor dilapidated villages in this country.  I cannot say our villages have improved very much in the past 20 years.  In one village in my constituency, Mullinahone, there has not been a house built since the foundation of the State.  I went into one of the houses there during the election campaign.  It was a house of two rooms in which 19 people lived, a father and mother and a family whose ages ranged from six months to 19 years.  The eldest son was in the Army, serving in Cyprus, and he was due to return home the following day.  Probably he was sent off from this country with a <Col N="361" /> flourish of trumpets.  We all thought he was a wonderful chap.  Ministers were out being photographed with this Irish soldier going out to Cyprus to uphold international honour and to raise our country's prestige.  When he returned, he had to go back to this miserable hovel of two rooms with 18 other people.</P>
    <P>In the town of Tipperary on the road from Cahir to Tipperary&mdash;a road some of the Deputies may have occasion to pass along&mdash;a whole street of houses is unfit for human habitation. I could go on and on listing the appalling conditions in this fertile county in the lush plains of Tipperary.  This is the position we have arrived at after 40 years of native Government.  It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign, probably from political rather than humanitarian reasons, there seemed to be a change of heart on the part of the Taoiseach when he mentioned it might be undesirable that social investment was not proceeding <i>pari passu</i> with economic development.  There is a certain relaxation here by the Minister on the part of housing.  That may be a reflection on the Taoiseach's speech but, in general, trying to read between the lines of the Minister's speech, there has been no fundamental change on the part of the Government. I believe what they term capital investment or productive investment plays a predominant part in their minds and their hearts.  I agree that, perhaps, certain desirable emphasis must be placed on productive investment but we do not live by bank books alone.  We are dealing with human affairs affecting the lives and welfare of our people.  It is no great satisfaction to badly housed families to know that our financial index in the stock exchange went up so many points or to hear of a very nice banking report.  These people are not concerned with that.  They are concerned with living conditions.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying to the people that everything will be all right in 1970 or that we must live in the conditions we are now living in until that time when all will be well.  I believe we have gone too far in cutting <Col N="362" /> down on social investment.  We should step up that investment as every other country is doing.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to the question of county roads and roads in general. We have the usual grievance in South Tipperary which every rural Deputy has, that there has been a curtailment in our county road grant.  Our county road grant has been progressively reduced over the past few years on the basis that we have a high percentage of our county roads dust free.  I do not begrudge the other counties who are so lucky.  I know there are many counties, where the roads are not dust free, which have got a ten per cent increase, according to the Minister's statement.  That is all right for them but the people in South Tipperary, who have expended their own money to make their county roads dust free, are now being penalised for having a good county council.</P>
    <P>The second grievance I have as regards my own constituency, South Tipperary, is that we have never received a tourist road grant, however small.  I put a question down to the Minister to be answered next week&mdash; I am sure I will get a negative reply&mdash; asking him to give South Tipperary a tourist road grant.  I cannot claim South Tipperary is a tourist county in the same sense as County Kerry but we have our tourist amenities and I consider we are entitled to an appropriate grant on that basis.</P>
    <P>We are in the initial stages of town planning.  Preliminary plans are being prepared.  My particular worry here is the question of financing some of these planning schemes, when they eventually come to fruition.  Cashel town, where I live, has a very low valuation &mdash;the second lowest in the country.  It is a very old town and it will be desirable to do a considerable amount of work there as regards renewal work.  A penny gives an extra £22 in the rates.  The preliminary plan shown to us by the town planners envisages an extraordinary expenditure.  It amounts to knocking down the entire centre of the town.  I would ask the Minister how that will be financed.</P>
    <P>How will our very small urban <Col N="363" /> council finance the very expensive scheme which this Town Planning Act will eventually produce?  It is quite impossible for us in Cashel, where we cannot even finance a sewerage scheme, to implement the preliminary plans already shown to us by the town planner and which we already knew, before he produced them, would be inevitable.  I would ask the Minister, specifically, if he knows how these plans will be financed by the poorer urban bodies.  The major urban bodies can look after themselves but there are many poorer ones all over the country and the plans will be quite beyond their financial means.  So far the Minister has remained completely silent on this question.  I should like to hear how it is to be done, if he knows himself.</P>
    <P>There is another point I wish to mention&mdash;this should have received attention before now&mdash;and that is the question of an annual report from our county managers.  The expenditure in every county is increasing year by year.  The services given by every local authority are extending.  Surely it is not inappropriate that we should now ask that the Minister would direct our county managers to prepare an annual report, not alone for the public, but for the various Departments of State for their own convenience.  It is quite a simple thing to do.  It would be a relatively simple matter for the Minister's Department to formulate a standard form of report to which each county manager could subscribe and which would give in a concise form, year by year, the financial and administrative activities of each county.  When you consider £1½ million to £2½ million of public money is being spent, surely it is not unreasonable to ask that an annual report should be formulated so that the public might see how their money is being spent?</P>
    <P>The question of rates is mentioned perennially here.  Everybody deplores rising rates.  I deplore it also not so much, although that is a factor, because of the enormity of the figure as because it is, as a taxation system, inequitable. Rates, by their very nature as a taxation method, are not based upon <Col N="364" /> income and in that regard they are basically inequitable.  When rates are small, the injustice is small, but, as rates get bigger and bigger, that injustice becomes more flagrant, more intolerable and merits attention.</P>
    <P>The time has now arrived when rating as a system of taxation to the increased amount that is demanded from the ratepaying public can no longer be regarded as a just system.  I would suggest to the Minister that services of a predominantly national character should suitably be integrated and made a national charge.  I would mention particularly health and roads. As regards health, I would mention particularly institutional services which would benefit, from a functional point of view, by a closer integration and which, by the very nature of things, would lend themselves more appropriately to be a national charge.  As regards roads, I would mention particularly the arterial roads system.  It may be possible to devise some method by which arterial roads would become a national charge and smaller roads and county roads would still remain a county council charge.</P>
    <P>One small point in conclusion is the question of water supplies.  We were the pioneers in South Tipperary of the question of regional water schemes. One of the first schemes in the country, the Galtee Regional Water Scheme, was proposed by me at the Tipperary South Riding County Council some years ago.  Since then, we have inaugurated a number of very worthwhile water schemes.  Deputies will appreciate that where any scheme is laid down there are demands immediately from the public all over for branch extensions. Sometimes these demands go outside the geographical limitations of the scheme drawn up by the officials. All Deputies who have regional schemes in their counties will have experienced that.  Up to the present, in my constituency, a fairly reasonable attitude has been adopted by the officials.  If they are pressed for a branch extension outside the boundaries of a particular scheme they do their best to meet the wishes of the local councils and of the people who <Col N="365" /> come in deputations for that purpose. But, lately, there seems to be a tightening-up in this matter and they are inclined to adhere more rigidly to the boundaries laid down by the scheme.  I can appreciate that with inadequacy of supply and interminable extensions, the efficiency of the scheme might be curtailed.  Unfortunately, there is always a cleavage between the nice, tight, compact way the official mind works and the position of the unfortunate person who is pulled and dragged by the public to get a branch here and a branch there.</P>
    <P>In Tipperary, I was personally interested in one small extension from a supply scheme and the county council agreed to this.  However, the officials decided, at this stage, that they would have to put some limit to these extensions and they took legal opinion.  We now find ourselves in the position, if this legal opinion is correct, that we have been rather constrained to adhere to a rigid boundary.  It seems, on the face of it, that at times it can be very unfair.  Suppose a water scheme passes by a bunch of houses perhaps 100 yards away and the people are anxiously looking for a branch extension. They would be happy to take it even for limited periods.  The alternative is to wait perhaps 10 years for another regional scheme to supply them.  They would get it in 10 years even for limited periods.  The alternative is to wait perhaps 10 years for but in the meantime, the unfortunate local representative has to live 10 years of torment from the people looking for that extension.  I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the position of local representatives who have to try to bridge the gap between the rigidity of officialdom and the demands of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the housing situation and the plans which the Minister has proposed.  As a new Deputy, I was inundated with requests from the people in Dublin for houses.  In one week, I have had 237 requests.  These are from people in the constituency of Dublin South-West.  It is typical of what occurs throughout the city.  Most of these families are living in small <Col N="366" /> rooms, by the good grace of relatives. The situation is deplorable in Dublin city and it is no use explaining to such people that the situation will be resolved in 1970.</P>
      <P>The point is that we have overcrowding. Families of four are living in one room.  I remember one case I visited as a doctor where I had to squeeze my way in between a cot and a bed and a woman was trying to wash nappies. There was sickness in the house, infectious jaundice and upper respiratory infections.  There is no use in telling such a woman that the plans proposed by the Minister will solve her difficulties in 1970.  She wants something constructive done now.  The plans in the Minister's paper do not indicate any effort at solving the problem radically and soon.</P>
      <P>There are literally thousands of cases where husbands and wives are living apart.  I have seen them, as a doctor, and, just lately, I have seen them as a Deputy.  As a doctor, I must visit the house where the mother is and then report on the health of the children to the father who may be living on the other side of the city.  That is not good enough for a Christian country.  Couples planning marriage are deterred from entering matrimony because there are no prospects offered to them by Dublin Corporation.  Many of them have managed to save up the deposit only to see that the price of the house has gone up and consequently that the amount of the deposit has gone up and they must start again to try to save up enough to achieve the new deposit figure.  At the rate the prices of houses are going up, they can never hope to achieve the deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that the building societies are doing a very good job.  They are charging colossal interest.  The interest is not as they say.  There are extra charges&mdash; charges in respect of insurances on the houses, pass book charges&mdash;which all mount up.  They mount up so that the ordinary working man can never hope to avail of the building society because the repayments would take away almost half of his wages.  The <Col N="367" /> societies are not catering for the working man and the working man is the major person in this country.</P>
    <P>The question of the health of the people enters into this.  In many places the people's health is gravely imperilled. There is danger of chronic bronchitis, recurrent bronchitis among children, infectious jaundice, upper respiratory infection, resulting from large families living in one room.  The Minister has not offered any proper proposals for dealing with this.  His proposals would not bring help to those people by 1970.  They should be helped now, within the next year, by proper proposals.  The Minister's proposals are not specific.  They are too vague, but the situation is critical. The measures which are needed should be critical measures</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies by their speeches have inferred that conditions regarding housing in Dublin are good. I honestly believe their speeches have been prepared for them, by the Minister, I think, because I know the particular Fianna Fáil Deputies are themselves trying to deal with the numerous cases that come before them and that they are not able to do so. In all honesty they could not say the situation in Dublin is good.  They themselves know it is bad because they are trying to provide houses for the people.</P>
    <P>The moral aspect must also be taken into consideration.  In thousands of houses in Dublin you have men and women living in one room, men and women who are not of the one family, compelled to live in one room due to circumstances in regard to Dublin Corporation housing.  This is one of the most important aspects we have to face up to if we are to achieve anything with regard to housing in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The Department of Local Government is one whose policy and activity, or inactivity, affects in a very intimate way the lives and the enjoyment of life of practically every citizen in the State. It is therefore very important that the thinking of the Department and the skills of the Department should move <Col N="368" /> with the times, that they should in fact keep right up to date.  I feel that in many respects the thinking of the Department of Local Government and indeed their policy in several matters lag very far behind.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are responsible for local taxation.  The rates at the present time have reached a stage and a figure when they are a terrible burden on the occupiers of property throughout the country.  In 1898 it might have been all very well to raise the necessary finance to run local services by a levy of rates on occupiers of property because then, by and large, it was only people who owned property who boasted wealth. Times have changed and changed considerably and I think the system of local taxation is in bad need of revision immediately.</P>
      <P>The fact that certain things such as health and main roads are still the liability of the local authorities makes it utterly impossible for local authorities to finance properly such things as housing, by-roads and lanes which could be properly described as being within their sphere of activity. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister as a matter of urgency to use his influence to have the present system of local taxation changed.  In particular, this affects householders and shopkeepers in small urban areas where at the present time a man with a valuation of £20 may be called on to pay £60 to £80 a year in rates without any relief whatever.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are also responsible for housing.  I think the record of the Minister and his Department during a number of years past in this respect is far from satisfactory. Dublin Deputies have dealt very adequately with the position in Dublin City and I do not propose to labour that argument or to repeat it. Throughout the country the housing problem is far from solved.  In every town in Ireland there are people badly housed, inadequately housed or not housed at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the urban district in which I live 80 houses were built or completed by the local authority between 1948 and <Col N="369" /> 1952.  Since 1952 there has not been a solitary house built by the local authority in that urban area, notwithstanding the fact that there is an urgent need for houses.  The Minister may say that is a matter for the local authority.  I do not agree with that.  There is not sufficient co-operation from the Minister and his Department.  The Minister and his Department do not say specifically: &ldquo;You are not to build any more houses&rdquo;, but they in fact attain that situation there by saying sites are unsatisfactory, by returning the plans for modification and alteration, by saying tenders are too high, by asking the local authority to readvertise.</P>
    <P>Surely it should be apparent that if tenders are high this year they will be higher next year.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister, again as a matter of urgency, to cut out this red tape and allow the local authorities to get on with whatever building they want to do.  If it was not for the amount of private building which has gone on over recent years I hate to think what the housing situation would really be like.  However, I am afraid that private building has reached its peak and if something is not done about it it will soon come to a halt. There are not sufficient incentives being given to individuals to build their own houses, particularly to individuals in receipt of modest incomes.  I am speaking of the middle income group, the white collar workers and such types of people.</P>
    <P>The grant for a new house payable at present to that type of person is £300 and it has been £300 for several years, notwithstanding that in the meantime the cost of building has increased, I would say by 100 per cent, and the purchase price of houses has certainly gone up by about 100 per cent also.  A grant that remains at what it was several years ago is not an encouragement to build your own house now. There can be no doubt that we are in the middle of a credit squeeze as far as finance for house building by private individuals is concerned.  We were told yesterday by the Minister for Local Government in reply to a question that it was normal practice for building <Col N="370" /> societies to ease off for a few months now and again.  I am afraid that I cannot accept that it is normal practice, or that it has been normal practice for building societies to suspend operations for six months in any year.  I never heard of it until this year.  The fact that the managing director of one of the largest building societies has appeared on television within the last few months to announce that his society is not prepared to entertain any further loans for several months is adequate evidence that it is something new.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann regarded it as news; if it was an annual happening, nothing would be heard about it&mdash;it would pass unnoticed.  The fact of the matter is that it is unique and the fact of the matter is that this same gentleman said on television that what was required was more encouragement for people to invest their money with his society so that they could lend it.  I think those were his own words.  He referred to the necessity for less taxation so that people could invest more.  On the last occasion this gentleman appeared on television the Minister for Local Government, the very same day, announced that there was no curtailing or cutting down in lending by building societies.  But that same day this gentleman announced that his society, which as far as I know is one of the largest in the country, was suspending operations. If something is not done about this it will affect building contractors adversely, create unemployment and affect young people who have planned to get married and are waiting to have houses built.  This is something on which the Minister must act and act quickly.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the next most important item after housing in rural Ireland is access to houses.  I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Kitt and with the other Deputies who appealed for some action to improve byroads and laneways. Government Ministers tell us from time to time that the flight from the land is not peculiar to this country but that it is taking place all over the world.  I think it is being greatly accelerated in this country by the fact <Col N="371" /> that young people, and, indeed, people who are not so young, are not prepared to continue travelling over lanes which are full of potholes, water and mud for a distance of, perhaps, a mile. That is not an exaggeration.  Within the past twelve months most Deputies have had an opportunity of inspecting lanes in various constituencies from East Galway to Cork.  It cannot be denied that they are in a deplorable condition.  Nothing has been or is being done about them.</P>
    <P>When you raise this point, you will be told two things.  You will be told that these&mdash;I am speaking now about lanes&mdash;can be repaired by a rural improvement grant.  I know that a rural improvement grant is not the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government, but the difficulty about such a grant is that there may be several people living in this lane and three may be prepared to make the necessary local contribution but the other four for some reason or other, they may be on bad terms with their neighbours, are not prepared to do anything.  Therefore, the grant as at present operated provides no answer to the problem.  When a rural improvement grant is sanctioned for the improvement of a lane, subject to a local contribution, the local contribution should be raised by the local authority by levying a rate on all the people living in that lane.  That would not be unreasonable and it would get over this dog in the manager attitude of people who will not act.</P>
    <P>Again, when you complain about the conditions of these lanes you will be told it is a matter for the local authority, that the local authority can raise money to repair these lanes, but the difficulty is that the local authority is struggling under an impossible burden at present because it must find money for health charges over which it has no control and because it must apply the major portion of the road grants to the main roads.  When it comes to striking an annual rate the only items on which the county councillors can effect a saving are on by roads and lanes or things like house repairs.  That demonstrates the urgent necessity for a change <Col N="372" /> in this system.  It cannot be denied that these lanes are impassable and I can find no language which is too strong, and no adjectives which are adequate, to describe the conditions under which these people have to travel.  I would appeal to the Minister to take up this matter with the local authorities and to co-operate with them in having these lanes repaired.</P>
    <P>Finally, on this point, when these lanes are repaired in 1965, they should be tarred and not merely steamrolled so that in a couple of years they will be cut up and useless.  It is really a waste of money in 1965 if, when the roads are attended to at all, they are not tarred so as to make a lasting job.</P>
    <P>I want to refer generally to the Town Planning Act, which is also the Minister's responsibility.  Everybody agrees that planning is necessary in this age but I urge the Minister to see that local authorities and county managers operate this Act in a reasonable way and do not use it to harass owners of property who want to erect or improve buildings.  There is a danger that that will happen and I fear in some places it is happening.  Perhaps, it is that the officials have newly received these powers, but if a circular has not already gone out it should go out immediately to say this Act should be operated in a sensible and moderate way.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for the important business of conducting elections, local, general and presidential. For the first time, I think, at the last general election polling booths were provided in mental hospitals and patients were registered as in the mental hospitals.  That is unfortunate because it is not good enough that these unfortunate people should be subject, on polling day and before it, to pressure from any side to vote for any side. These people are mentally ill; if not, they would not be confined in mental hospitals.  They are not allowed to transact their own legal business except under the strictest supervision, practically under doctors' certificates. Yet we know that at the last general election these people were pressurised into going to vote for certain candidates. <Col N="373" /> That is not good enough.  With transport as we have it today, these people should still be registered as at their home addresses.  If they are able to go to vote and want to do so, they should return to their home booths to exercise the franchise.</P>
    <P>I am told that under the present system the stage is reached where in some towns the inhabitants of the local mental hospitals will be able to elect a considerable number of the members of the local authority.  If that is so, it speaks for itself.  A Deputy on the opposite side dealt with the fact that people who have been on the register for years suddenly found they were cut off.  We all had experience of that in the recent election, of cases of people in middle age who had not changed their residence and had been on the register for several years finding that this year they had been dropped off.  I do not know whether that is the fault of the rate collectors or the office staff but it is obviously something that should not happen, something that causes irritation both to politicians and electors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between what is the reality of the housing situation and what officially we would like to think is indicated in the actual figures given in the material supplied by the Minister where he said that for last year the actual number of houses built was in the region of fewer than 2,500.  Yet, we are told in the White Paper that we will need over the next few years, if we are to make any progress towards solving the problem, between 12,000 and 14,000 new dwellings per year.  That indicates the difference between the actual building position and what the official reports would have us believe.  There is an idea current and apparently in the main among those who support the Government&mdash;it is also becoming more or less the practice throughout the country&mdash;that if you write enough reports and make sufficient surveys about any problem that problem will, in the course of events, disappear and no longer trouble our conscience.  We have had a White Paper on housing; this brief from the Minister is a notice of good intentions but the housing <Col N="374" /> problem is still with us and very much so.</P>
      <P>The material we have from the Minister is well intentioned, I think, but it is very vague, as we have pointed out from these benches.  I know all the obvious nails have been driven home in this debate over the past few days but I think the problem is severe enough to continue to trouble our conscience and upset our composure so that we must continue to try to get beneath the thick skin which appears to cover the official mind on this matter.  The Minister's report appears more or less to approach the overall housing situation in the country in the light that it is good: the building societies are doing a fine job; building costs have gone up unfortunately, due to an unfortunate labour dispute last year in which obviously the culprits were the trade unionists.</P>
      <P>If the Minister or the people responsible for drawing up this report were to read the speech made by the Director General of the Allied Contractors of Ireland last week, they would find he admitted that the contractors could have paid the cost of the building dispute, could have met the just demands of the workers, but that their idea of the National Wage Agreement precluded them from doing so.  In other words, he tells us they could have met any extra cost involved and it would not have put them out of business; they were well equipped to meet it but, unfortunately, they believed that in meeting this demand they would be harming the National Wage Agreement. That was their conception of the agreement but at least it does get rid of the bogey that the increases in building costs are the result of the workers' demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in this brief, refers to the traditional methods of building and stresses the new building methods, the new industrial sites idea.  In fact, this will never solve the building problem unless the Minister and all his enthusiastic planners who are ready to plan anything predictable, realise that the real problem as regards housing in Dublin or in any other large centre in the country is inflated land values.  If <Col N="375" /> the law of supply and demand is allowed to operate in the case of land purchases in the city of Dublin or any other city, we can say goodbye to a solution of the housing problem in those areas.  We can produce White Papers year after year; we can have surveys year after year; we can have specialists from the United Nations to tell us what to do; but, unless we have the courage and good sense to realise what is the main factor contributing to the housing problem, there will be no solution.  If we do not compulsorily acquire land, if we do not make sure that the law of supply and demand will not operate to increase prices of land, housing costs will soar and we will not be able to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have been lucky in years past in that they have been able to buy land and to reserve it in advance of need.  On the periphery of the city at the moment there are farsighted people buying up land right, left and centre.  They will be able to sell this land at an enhanced price to the Corporation when they require this land in the future.  They will be able to buy land at the expense of ordinary people who need houses.  Unless land for the provision of houses is removed from the ordinary laws of the market place we will not solve the problem in the main city areas.  We can play around with landscaping and these ideas but unless we can get down to the main factor contributing to the cost of building in Dublin and other centres the problem will not be solved.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the density of population in the centre of Dublin is higher than in cities in Europe.  If these European cities are to be taken as a guide line, they have allowed speculators to take over the centres of the cities.  The trend is already commencing in Dublin where there are office blocks in the centre of the city which are empty at week-ends.  Our idea in the Labour Party of the planning of a city is that it should be a mixture of residential, factory and industrial places, that a city should not become as silent as a morgue at week-ends, that a city is for the convenience or all <Col N="376" /> the public.  This is our attitude to city planning.</P>
    <P>In his brief, the Minister says that if we are to provide the cash for future expansion in housing we will have to have a rational rents policy.  Again, we are going to have a rational rents policy for people already burdened under heavy rents.  At present so keen is our sense of what people should pay in matters of rent that there is a differential rents system in operation in Dublin under which old age pensioners are asked to contribute.  Yet, during the election campaign we heard that all these people are due for early attention in the Government's social programme. Members of all Parties know that the social welfare payments available to these people are extremely low. None of us need make political capital out of that situation.</P>
    <P>The fact is that these people, under the differential rents system, must, in fact, pay towards their rent.  Yet these people and the others&mdash;the 20,000 people in Dublin&mdash;are the very people to be told that the financing of housing in future depends on them.  The people in the background, building speculators, speculators in land, are vindicated by the Minister and we are told that building societies and all the other elements involved in house purchasing are doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>It is of a kind with the rest of Fianna Fáil economic planning, which is sounder in advertising than in content. It is of a kind with the rest of the programme which says that what is of its nature good and must forever remain so.  The kernel of Fianna Fáil planning in local government and other spheres is: &ldquo;We predict what is predictable.  We do not try to change.&rdquo; Our attitude in the Labour Party is that we look at the priorities and plan on that basis.</P>
    <P>Since June, 1963, 1,000 buildings in Dublin have been demolished.  In his brief, the Minister refers to a survey which he started in 1960.  I wonder to what extent the White Paper and the rest of the official concern about the situation in Dublin and elsewhere are due to the Fenian Street tragedy and <Col N="377" /> the fact that houses fell in Dublin during rainstorms and so on.  Before that occurred, Government Ministers had gone on record as saying that the housing problem of this country had been solved.  Now we know that it has not been solved and there is a flurry of White Papers and reports stating what will happen in future.</P>
    <P>If, last year, the total number of houses built in the entire country was less than 2,500 and if we are now to provide the number indicated in the White Paper, that is, 12,000 to 14,000 new houses per year, I do not see how the problem will be solved.  Tinkering with traditional methods and adopting streamlined methods will not make that much difference unless costs can be reduced.  I have indicated a way in which costs can be reduced.  The question of land values cannot be avoided.</P>
    <P>There is no control at the moment in Dublin or other cities of rents charged by private landlords.  These are subject to no control.  We in the Labour benches have made reference in the last few days to the question of exorbitant rents.  In my constituency, Dublin North Central, I have come across a young married couple living with a young family in one room, paying £3 10s. per week.  They have no relatives anywhere.  One wonders if the Minister or other planners involved could do something about bringing in some form of control on the actual payment of rents.  On Tuesday of this week I was present at an eviction in my constituency in Mountjoy Square.  I know that that eviction took place because the building was condemned but you cannot tell the people involved in an eviction that the building has been condemned and that an all-wise official in Dublin Corporation has investigated the needs of the persons and has declared that they are now ready to take the road to Finglas or some other point west or north.</P>
    <P>The fact is these people grow attached to their neighbourhoods.  We must avoid the temptation to consider them as mere ciphers in a book to be transferred wherever the Dublin Corporation official thinks they should go.  I know that these officials are <Col N="378" /> over-worked.  Use will have to be made of the social welfare committee. There is one attached to Dublin Corporation and more attention should be paid to their advice when people are being transferred from one house to another.  I hope there will be some provision to that effect in the new housing legislation.</P>
    <P>We all know the history of eviction in this country.  It is a difficult thing to tell people that they are being evicted for humanitarian reasons.  In the case I have in mind, there was one couple, a man of 38 years of age and a woman of 35 years of age.  No accommodation was provided for these.  Neither of them had a relative with whom they could live.  We cannot have evictions going on unless suitable alternative accommodation is provided.  It is no excuse for failure to provide suitable alternative accommodation to say that the persons concerned refused a house which was unsuitable to the man, perhaps, because it was too far from his job or for some other reason.  We can all appreciate the inconvenience it must be to be removed from one's house to another house a couple of miles away. This matter must be considered more fully.  Regard must be had to the problems of the individual.  Alternatives must be provided.</P>
    <P>There are many priorities in the social programme which Fianna Fáil now tell us they will take up.  There is to be a social as well as an economic programme in connection with the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  I would suggest to the Minister that he has the most important job of all in trying to ensure that in any social programme priority is given to the matter of housing, that there can be no talk of industrial progress unless people have decent living accommodation.</P>
    <P>Unless we rescue housing from being a source of profit to some people, unless we make it an essential matter that suitable housing be provided for all citizens, unless we make this the first priority in the Eighteenth Dáil, I cannot see how the Minister or any other member of the Government can go with any integrity to the electorate in <Col N="379" /> the next election and say they have advanced with a social programme. Housing is the most important matter before us and if the Government are serious about their intentions in the social field then I would say this is the point they should attack first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of talk from many Deputies about housing and the first thing I should do is to put it into proper perspective.  The initiative and responsibility in respect of local authority housing, by its very name, rests with the local authority.  As far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned his main duty in regard to housing is to provide the facilities to the local authorities and help the local authorities in every way to reach their goal in relation to their needs.</P>
      <P>I shall not go back on the history of housing for the past ten years but just go back a little way to the point where as Minister I have had to depart radically from what has been the normal role of the Minister for Local Government in relation to local authority housing.  Since 1960 I have endeavoured to get from the local authorities an assessment of their requirements.  In the majority of cases we have got returns but the greater part of these returns are merely pilot surveys and are not full surveys in any sense.  Despite the fact that each local authority is obliged by law to provide such a survey, down through the years it has failed to do it.  I have spent these years persuading and cajoling the local authorities to provide even an outline of what they want.  While it has not been provided to the degree of being fully reliable in all cases, we have, for the first time in the history of this House, got a general outline of the national requirements for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this assessment and survey is to enable the local authorities not only to know what they need but to plan how they will provide these houses over a short period as well as on a long-term basis.  Deputies who are members of local authorities and <Col N="380" /> who have been complaining here about how the Minister is holding up housing ought to go back to their local authority and find out how many times they have been asked what they want, never mind how they are to provide it.  The building industry, workers, contractors and all others involved, should have a projection into the future, even to three or five years, as to the demands that are likely to be made upon their industry so that they in turn can gear themselves for the work that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>I want to put it on record lest it might be overlooked, as it apparently has been by those who have been criticising here, that no Minister in this or any other Government over the past 40 years has gone into the local authority field of house building as I have done in order to have houses built, because I believed they were so badly needed.  I have now been responsible for a project in Dublin City which will add considerably to the efforts being made by the Dublin Corporation and which will help to liquidate at a much earlier date the requirements of the citizens here.  I have also over recent years offered to all local authorities my best efforts on their behalf, down to the point of offering to build houses for them either through the National Building Agency or some other agency, if I felt they were not capable of doing it themselves. That offer is being repeated here publicly today.  Deputy T. O'Donnell is on the same note as many others in the Opposition benches.  They tell us that the housing situation is deplorable and in the next breath that no radical changes in our approach to building are required in Limerick, that it would put the employees out of work.  Then the Minister for Local Government is blamed because the Limerick Corporation have not planned far enough in advance or positively enough to meet the people's needs. Like many others in the country, they want to blame somebody else and I will not accept it.  I have given them every possible encouragement and what more any Minister for Local Government can do I do not know.</P>
    <P>I want to kill straight away this <Col N="381" /> talk that has been reiterated parrot-like by several Fine Gael speakers that Fianna Fáil set out to depress building, to depress social spending, and that this was outlined in the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> seven years ago.  That is not so. The figures of the availability of money under Fianna Fáil are there on record to be seen.  The pronouncements are there to be read and nobody can deny that money has been available to all local authorities for their house building programme at all times during those years and that encouragement has been given to them on many occasions to get on more quickly with the job which we saw growing upon them but which they themselves did not seem to appreciate.</P>
    <P>The people on the Labour benches want to have it not both ways but three ways.  They want to have cheaper houses, more houses and more quickly. They want the people who are in houses and have large incomes to be subsidised by those who have smaller incomes either as taxpayers or ratepayers and, at the same time, to leave unhoused, as they left unhoused in this and every other city, quite a number of people who for many years were in hovels that could not be described as homes.  We were told that these people were offered houses and they would not change, but when the matter is pursued further, we discover that they did not take the houses because they could not afford to pay the rent.</P>
    <P>I want to say this about the rationalisation of rents.  The rents they are paying bear no relationship to the value of the houses they occupy.  These houses should carry a higher rent to enable the Dublin Corporation and other local authorities to provide homes at rents suited to their incomes for those still unhoused and those living in unfit dwellings or in overcrowded conditions.  Where necessary, houses should be provided for people at no rent at all.  If there is anything wrong with this from the point of view of Labour, or anybody else, I shall be delighted to hear it.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that our local authorities have been neglecting those who are in <Col N="382" /> the worse possible conditions from the point of view of housing.  They are neglected on the basis that the local authorities cannot afford further to subsidise the rents from the rates and they are apparently not prepared to take the unpopular step of charging those who are well able to pay more a proper economic rent for what they have so that those who have not got houses at rents they can afford, or at no rent at all, if that be necessary, can be accommodated.  There are too many of these in the country and too many will remain until we reach the point at which local authorities will be prepared to do the unpopular as well as the popular thing.</P>
    <P>There is no point in Labour Deputies, or any other public representatives, saying that rents must not be disturbed and that they must not be increased. At the moment houses are rented at ridiculously low figures to families with ridiculously high incomes. If local authorities are not prepared to increase rents, then they will have to add sufficient to the rates to carry those who cannot afford to pay even the minimum rent at the moment. I do not mind which choice local authorities make, but they will have to make a choice, if we are to bring the housing programme to a final conclusion by housing those who have had to refuse houses in the past because they could not afford to pay even the minimum rents.</P>
    <P>This is what I want to bring home in relation to a rational rents programme. It is not for the benefit of the Government.  It is not for the benefit of local authority finance that I wish to see a rational rents system.  It is because over the years this residue of the poorest of the poor in the worst of our worst houses still remains.  If we are not prepared to face up to solving the problem by increasing rates, then we must face up to it in the only sensible way that I can see, namely, by inducing those who do not now pay really economic rents for the accommodation they enjoy to pay some more, making it clear that nobody will be asked to pay more than what could be regarded as the economic rent of these houses. <Col N="383" /> If there are people who are already paying the full economic rent, then I suggest&mdash;this probably has occurred to these tenants themselves&mdash;that they should be encouraged to acquire their own homes and leave these houses for those who are less well off.</P>
    <P>So long as we continue to encourage the payment of ridiculously low rents, subsidised by both ratepayers and taxpayers, by people who are better off than the average ratepayer and taxpayer, so long will we have people occupying local authority houses who could well afford to provide houses for themselves.  That is the point I want local authorities to consider.  That is why I advocate a change, and not just for the sake of raising rents.  If local authorities are prepared to add the burden to the rates, then let them do so.  They have in the past shown that they are not prepared to do that.  If by increasing rents they can avoid a further increase in rates, then surely that would be much fairer, more just and more equitable than leaving the poorest of the poor in the very worst of our houses.  It is no excuse to say that these people were offered houses but would not take them.</P>
    <P>I should like to clear the air now in relation to the programme.  Deputy Jones, because of miscalculation on his part, stated that we would need 67,000 houses per year in order to implement the building programme and take up the obsolescence that will occur annually.  That figure should, of course, read 6,700.  That figure plus the calculated 1,500 additional new homes, together with the liquidation of the backlog, which from the returns furnished by local authorities, brings the figure to 12,000 or 14,000 houses as the target within the next four or five years.  The Deputy, who miscalculated the figure, said that there was little hope of reaching 14,000 or 15,000 houses in three, four or five years.  That does not take account, however, of the number of private houses.  The total figure for completions during the past year is 8,850 houses all told between private building and local authority building.  By far the greater part is <Col N="384" /> made up of private building.  Since we anticipate the programme of 14,000 to work out roughly about half local authority and half private building, one can readily see that private building is not far from the point we hope to reach under the projected plan.  The number of houses built by local authorities will have to be raised, of course, two or three times if we are to reach the figure of approximately 14,000.</P>
    <P>We need these houses urgently.  so far as I and my Department are concerned, we are ready, willing and waiting for proposals from the local authorities to get on with the job.  I am not the person who said at any stage, or can be found on record as having stated, that the housing problem was solved.  Not only have I not said that but I have said, and I am on record as saying, that the problem of providing houses will never be solved while the economy of the country continues viable.  So long as there is viability, the housing problem will not be solved.  It will not be possible to reach saturation point because obsolescence will mean that at least 6,700 houses will be needed every year, if only to keep numbers at the proper level.  We hope to have an increased need for houses as a result of increasing prosperity, as a result of earlier marriages, the earlier formation of families and the increase in the population.  This will add anything from 1,000 to 2,000 houses to that figure of 6,700.</P>
    <P>Our programme, therefore, will be a minimum of 10,000 houses, even if we wipe out the entire backlog in the morning.  I am putting that figure as the minimum we will be called upon to provide in the foreseeable future, even if the entire backlog were wiped out.  We will never solve the housing problem completely unless our economy reaches the point of stagnation it approached in 1956-57.  It would be true to say we had our housing problem solved then, but with what results?  We are planning for the future to ensure this never happens again.</P>
    <P>The Ballymun project has been talked of, critically and otherwise. <Col N="385" /> This is not alone a question of providing 3,000 dwellings; it is also a question of providing all the ancillary services necessary for a community of that kind.  We were not deputed by Dublin Corporation to do all this.  That was neither the fault of the Corporation nor of the Department.  We put the stress on what was most necessary, the dwellings.  However, the shopping centre, schools and other facilities have not been neglected.  In fact, we hope the agency now doing the houses and flats will also provide these other facilities, within the same period or shortly after the completion of the dwellings. The Corporation wishes us to pursue this and already a great deal of the preparatory work has been done.  We are looking forward to being commissioned by the Corporation to provide not only the 3,000 dwellings but all the other amenties for those who live there.</P>
    <P>This is not long-term planning.  The idea has been flaunted around that what is said in an Estimate speech is just a lot of pious resolutions and wishful thinking.  How much more positive does the House want the Minister to be?  Less than 12 months from the commissioning of this work on 3rd July last we have moved into the site and the factory for the production of the components is under way.  In the past the Minister never had to consider going out and doing work for a local authority, but we are doing that today.  That is not wishful thinking.  We are on the job.</P>
    <P>This project is going to cost around £9 million for the dwellings, plus the ancillary services.  The first house will be occupied this year.  I only wish the performance of those who talk here could match that.  If it did, we could look forward to the solution of our problem in the next couple of years. If those people had acted three or four years ago when urged to get on with the work, there would not be any back-log today.  Vagueness has never been the hallmark of my Department and will not be in the future.</P>
    <P>I have offered Limerick, Cork and the other towns generally every facility available to me.  I have gone so far as <Col N="386" /> to suggest that, if the combined needs of any of these local authorities exceed 2,000 dwellings as urgently required, which cannot be met by conventional means, I would be prepared to come in and, by agreement with the trade unions and building organisations, find a speedy solution to the problem, if necessary through system building.  I have discussed this in detail with Limerick Corporation. There are few people interested who are not fully aware of what I have offered to do.  They have only to pass a special resolution requesting me to act.  I have not the power to initiate these things, but I have taken every opportunity to encourage local authorities to ask me to do the job for them.  That offer is being repeated today.  I shall be only too happy to take on further work on their behalf if they pass a resolution requesting me to do so.</P>
    <P>There will be a provision in the new Housing Bill whereby the Minister for Local Government need not wait for a request from a local authority to do work.  If the Minister considers a local authority are not doing their job, either in respect of house building or otherwise, he will be empowered to go in and do it for them, with or without a resolution of the council.  I do not believe this power may ever be necessary, but it is necessary it should be there in order that its need should never arise.</P>
    <P>I should like to nail the assertion that group water schemes are not a success.  I do not believe this.  While I have no doubt that Deputy Jones who made the assertion was talking in all good faith, I do not agree that they have not been a success.  I admit that, as in the case of any worthwhile project, mistakes have been made at the start which only experience can teach us to avoid.  I believe that any mistakes made in regard to the inadequacy of supply are now being avoided.  Apart from a few such cases at the beginning, little or no trouble is now arising.  Indeed, generally the first cases that came to our notice have been rectified and proper sources of supply or supplementary sources obtained.  We are as enthusiastic about <Col N="387" /> these schemes today as we were five years ago, and we wish them to continue. There is scope for much more activity under this heading than has been in evidence.  We in the Department are looking at our own organisation to see if we can give further impetus to these group schemes throughout the country.  In many cases they are the ready answer to the problem of lack of water which obtains in far too many places throughout the country.  They are the obvious answer for an early easement of that situation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the isolated houses that cannot be served by a public scheme or a group scheme, then the private scheme also falls into line.  So we have a pattern of the background and the blueprint and the overall public schemes being constructed at the moment, or projected for the future. It is then that we would hope to infill it to a much greater degree to the more remote communities, and to make it possible for them to bring this service to their homes without any undue cost to the taxpayer or the ratepayer, and without any undue cost to the householders themselves.  In addition, there will be the odd houses&mdash;probably running into thousands&mdash;which neither the group schemes nor the public scheme can serve at anything like a reasonable cost.  In those cases the help of my Department is freely available by way of grant, guidance, assistance and encouragement.</P>
    <P>The service of a piped-water supply, particularly in the remoter areas, in the rural areas and on the farmsteads is something which people are really only beginning to appreciate.  As they do so, this growing demand will continue to arise for assistance by way of grant and a clamour to public authorities to give extensions to particular areas.  I do not disagree with the statement that there may be some faults and some flaws still in the whole system of the group schemes.  I should like to say to Deputy Jones and others that if they find such flaws I should be glad to have any suggestions from them to remedy those flaws and if we think what they suggest is an improvement we will be happy to implement it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> There is no doubt whatsoever that activities on the private housing side are running at a very high level.  In fact, our allocation grants in the 12 months up to 31st March last have reached an all-time record.  There were 7,800 odd allocations, and this continued to show an upward trend.  There was a record last year and this year, and I would say that the allocations in the present year will probably constitute a further record.  In so far as private house building is concerned, there is no doubt that while we would like to see more, it is running at a comparatively high rate, at a rate never before experienced on the private building side.  Naturally, we are all glad to see that, and to encourage it, in any way possible.</P>
    <P>In addition there is the new grant scale for land holders and small farmers. It may well be that there will be further building under this head because we must remember that a great deal of bad housing in rural Ireland is, in fact, on our farms and small holdings throughout the country.  Therefore, we can expect to see quite an upsurge on this side over and above that which has made itself evident during the past 12 months.  There has been some criticism of the fact that the £5 limit for the local authority special small farm house subsidy scheme does not apply to all of the country.  In fact, it does not apply in many counties.  Let me say that it does apply to a very considerable degree in the western counties where there exists today probably a higher percentage of bad housing in the farming category than in the country as a whole.  They have more than their proportion of these bad houses on small holdings of under £5 land valuation and the scheme is directed to those whose need is greatest, without adding an undue burden to the local rates.  It works out at the equivalent in loan charges of £100 in respect of each house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  In regard to the western seaboard I can understand that the Gaeltacht services apply, but there are quite a share of counties in which the <Col N="389" /> valuation of under £5 would not apply. Would the Minister consider raising the limit to £7 10s. in the new Housing Bill?  Even that would be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very special scheme for a class who are very badly housed at the moment, and it applies mainly to the counties on the western seaboard.  To add to it the normal housing arrangements would be too much.  For some reason it is obvious that there is some flaw in it because they have not done the building.  There is no question but that they have not been tackling this problem.  For the other counties there still remains the existing subsidy arrangements.</P>
      <P>We have also in operation what we call the specific instance housing scheme where a local authority build on a specific site on a small farmer's own land.  My own county is one of the western counties and our valuations are generally very low.  The actual valuation limit adopted by my county some years ago is £15.  They apply the specific instance procedure to farmers needing houses with a valuation of up to £15.  That accounts for over 90 per cent of all the farmers in my county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If other counties want to approach it in the same light and with due regard to the general average level of valuations, there is nothing to prevent them doing so, because the scheme adopted by my county council or any county council is up to themselves. While they submit their scheme to us we do not lay down any hard or fast rules, or stop them from going to £20 or, in some cases, as high as £25 land valuation.  This is a special scheme which we are trying to aim at those with the worst housing conditions and, at the same time, not add too heavy a burden to the local authority.  I think the House will agree that if £100 per house were the equivalent in land charges we could not charge the local authority any less.  Otherwise it could be said we were giving the houses entirely, and there would not be a great deal of sense in that since the house will be the property of the local authority until they have made arrangements for the smallholder to purchase it, as he <Col N="390" /> is entitled to do immediately after the house has been provided.</P>
    <P>Many electoral matters were raised. I suppose if there had not been an election so many would not have been raised.  All I can say, talking about the accuracy of the register, is that there are various people who enter into this in the country parts, the rate collector and the local gardaí.  I would say, from quite a number of years' experience, that our gardaí and rate collectors in my constituency do their job as well as anybody else. If it were not for the demands of the various political Parties in claiming, submitting and objecting, the register would be much worse than it is today. That is no reflection on those instructed to compile it.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has had experience of checking the register annually, as many do, cannot but realise that there is no one person, even in a small community, who can be sure by checking a register, or a long list, as we call it, even though he knows everybody personally and intimately, that somebody has been left off who should be on, or somebody included who should not be included. This is a human factor in the compilation of the register in the rural parts and the more it is checked the more accurate it will be.  The rate collector and the gardaí do their job as well as is possible for them, and political Parties who have undoubtedly quite an interest in it can add very substantially to the accuracy of the register.  Where they are active under this head, we have substantially correct registers at all times.</P>
    <P>It may be said that is not the job of people in politics but then how many jobs do all of us have to do, now that we are in politics, which truly are not jobs for politicians That is how it goes.  I am afraid I cannot do other than contact the local authorities and those now responsible for compiling a register and bring to their notice the many complaints which I know exist at the moment and urge them to take more care to make a better job of it in the future.</P>
    <P>If there are suggestions from Members as to how we can improve the <Col N="391" /> system of electing, I would be only too happy to operate them.  I do as much checking of registers every year as anybody else and I would be quite happy to be relieved of it, if it were possible. So far, I have not found a way.  If Deputies want to see that the register is, in fact, fairly and properly compiled, if for no other reason than a purely vested interest, they should make suggestions for we never know the hour or the day a particular register will be used.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made also of the State paying more of the cost.  We pay an amount of the cost as it is at the moment.  These registers are not used solely for the Dáil elections.  They are used, as they must be, for local elections and, since they are in fact in that way used, I do not see that we should be pushed to the point of being called upon to provide all the cost of the register.</P>
    <P>A matter which undoubtedly gives cause for concern is the making of official marks, and such things, by presiding officers at elections.  We all suffer from it or gain by it, depending on how the cat happened to jump at different elections.  When we take into consideration the total number of ballots put into the hands of our presiding officers, who incidentally in practically all cases are just in this position for one day only and may not repeat the job for another three or four years, or may not in fact have done it before, and also the thousands of people who have to be procured on short notice by our returning officers and the total number of votes cast, together with the overall total spoiled as a result of lack of knowledge or ignorance or negligence, the total number of errors by the presiding officers is very small indeed.  If it emerges in a close count that there are numbers of these, it can make a difference between the election of one man and another and surely this highlights beyond all recognition the few faults that may be made by these people.</P>
    <P>That is not to say I condone any negligence on the part of these people but I think we should keep properly <Col N="392" /> in perspective just how few real errors are made when we consider the total number of ballot papers handled by the thousands of people concerned who are picked at short notice by returning officers and put into the job at the last moment.  Indeed, perhaps for a reason of illness or otherwise, the appointed presiding officer cannot attend and at the last moment there may be changes which neither the returning officer nor those associated with politics wish to have.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that, at times, we have to have people who are not 100 per cent up to the mark.  We must remember this is not possible to avoid in some cases and, overall, the performance of these people, in all the circumstances, is extraordinarily correct.  Where there is an error, it is brought into sharp focus in a close count where there are a number of spoiled votes and the result of an error like this would make the difference between election or elimination.</P>
    <P>I can only say that the instruction issued by the returning officers to these people is full and comprehensible. The question is whether it is comprehensible to all those who are expected to put it into operation.  That is something we must be sure is always there. In addition to that, all the other matters raised and highlighted during the recent long count are laid down. Returning officers have their guide lines and their experience.  In many cases they have this experience as assistants or enumerators, if not as returning officers, or in some cases they may have participated with people who were experienced in counting over the years.  The things they are to do and the methods by which they are to do them are fairly clearly laid down.  If there are departures, I am not aware of them.</P>
    <P>If I am made aware of such departures in more detail than they have been referred to here, I will be most interested to make enquiries in order to find out the basis for the charge and whether it is well founded or not. I will possibly be able to clear the air and discover whether the charges are correct or not and then do something about them.  I am not aware that <Col N="393" /> the things stated have taken place.  I would appreciate information from Deputies on any errors in the manner of counting, the process of elimination and the distribution of surpluses.  If Deputies will give me details, or refer me to different counts and I can readily get the details myself, and if there have been mistakes which are manifest to me, I will try to ensure that, in future, such errors will not recur.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms I have heard here also refers to the voting by mental patients at the recent election.  I should like, first of all, to say, as I already indicated the other night, that these were just not my own idea.  A Committee on general electoral law reform in their recommendations stated that they did not feel that, in future, there should be any differentiation between mentally and physically incapacitated persons and that the matter in relation to the electoral law should be changed so as to bring mentally and physically diseased or incapacitated persons into line.  We should not have one approach to the mentally ill and another approach to the physically ill.</P>
    <P>One thing I would say is that when the first lists were compiled of people's names in the mental hospitals, in some cases if not in all, what happened was that the entire number of inmates on a given qualifying date were all just put on the register.  What happened was that the entire number of inmates on a given qualifying date were just slapped on the register.  That is not what was intended; it is not now intended and further instructions for this year's new register will go out to the people responsible indicating to them that by and large the approach to the mentally ill and the placing of them on a register relating to their mental hospital should apply roughly in the following way.  The patient will be placed on the register if he has been 18 months an inmate of that particular institution or, in the opinion of the medical authorities therein, is likely to be there for 18 months.  In other words, you think into the future.</P>
    <P>It is really intended that this register will deal with long-term mental patients, <Col N="394" /> who are there or are likely to be there in the future.  All other patients of a short-term nature, who are likely to be in and out of the various institutions, will, in the normal way, be registered at their normal place of residence. It is more likely that they will be there than in the mental hospital 12 months later or at the time of an election.  This has been conveyed in a specific way to those responsible for compiling registers.  It is likely that quite a number will appear on the list for a mental hospital register who are not there as happened in some cases during the recent election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of patients who are going to be long-term mental patients, my recollection of the committee at the time this was being discussed&mdash;I say this subject to correction &mdash;was that it was felt that such people ought certainly to have an opportunity of voting within the precincts of the home where they are.  I put it to the Minister and the House at that time that a person who was incapable of transacting business in the ordinary way was also incapable of casting a vote, that is, that mental patients should not have the opportunity of deciding an issue when, in the ordinary way, they would be deemed incapable of transacting ordinary business.  I think Ennis is one place quoted to me where of nine members of the district council, the inmates of the mental hospital could on their own elect two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of what the Deputy says but it is also true to say that not all long-term patients can be said to be in a condition which would leave them unfit to mark a ballot paper at all times when they are there. In talking to some of these people, I am very often surprised.  They make me wonder whether the right people are there.  They have all good and bad days and these bad days may be very casual but it is not unknown that the bad days can keep recurring.  Therefore, they cannot be released or let out for any long time and the mental institution almost becomes a home for them. They grow old there.  So far as knowing what they are doing, they know very much better than a whole lot of people <Col N="395" /> who have never been in there.  That is not a reflection on those who are out any more than it is on those who are in.</P>

With regard <Col N="396" /> to this whole matter there may be reasons why we should think again about it but I am quite prepared to concede what was done was right.  I should be glad to hear more about whether these people should vote.  As I say, my mind would be open on it.  I would say, from my association with mental patients, as a member of a visiting committee for nine years, the majority of the inmates are far more sane in their outlook than many people outside.</P>

      <P>The Deputy had better not because he might get an answer he does not want.  He should not believe all he hears.  Leaving aside electoral matters there are some other things which were mentioned.  Many Deputies mentioned traffic matters and spoke about them in some detail.  This is a very good thing because it shows there is a great awareness on the part of all <Col N="397" /> members of the House with regard to it.  It reflects the awareness of people outside the House of the greater need there is for all of us to have more regard for safety on the road as a whole.</P>
      <P>Criticism was expressed that the speed limit signs were placed, in many cases, too far outside towns and that instead of lowering the speed, they are the cause of increasing it.  At the same time, I hear the criticism made: &ldquo;Why did you not leave these things alone; why did you not leave them with the local committees, as the engineers and the Gardaí, with their local information, know so much more than you do?&rdquo;  The unfortunate thing was that I had not the last word because I believed what was put to me here. Originally, I agreed with the recommendations of the people on the local committees&mdash;I do not know how they knew more than I did&mdash;and now I find them wrong.  The result is that we have had to sit down and do the roads, mile after mile of them.  Having started that job, we found that it would not be capable of being done for a number of years yet if we were to deal with all the roads.  Therefore, we had to confine ourselves to the more heavily trafficked roads, the main roads and the arterial roads that are now so described.</P>
      <P>I have just to-day signed the amended regulations for the re-siting of all the signs that have probably been a cause for complaint.  The one reason for the time taken is that each and every one of those changes had to be visited, examined, seen and decided upon and then, for the purposes of the law, absolutely and without question there has had to be clear identification of where the new site will be so that if anybody is pulled up within that sign or the other sign the law will be able to stand up and somebody will not be able to come along and to say: &ldquo;That was changed a few weeks ago.  Is there any law to cover it?&rdquo;  We have had to change it down to the finest detail.  This has caused a considerably longer delay than I thought it would take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did get these signs up.  We made our mistakes and now we are <Col N="398" /> trying to rectify them.  It is taking us longer to rectify them it did to put them up originally.  You can often do a job wrong at the outset and correct it later but the point is that we did try.  In the Six Counties lately, the Minister concerned, I think, was interviewed on television in regard to the introduction of these new signs and the new international signs we have been erecting and have in operation in this country for a considerable time. His estimation of the time it will take in the Six Counties, as against the Twenty-six, is five years&mdash;and we have not been five years on this job altogether, including the mistakes, and so on.  We hope to go on from there, once these come into operation on all the main heavy traffic roads.  We intend to continue from there and are at the moment investigating all the other complaints&mdash;probably thousands&mdash;about all the other roads and as soon as we can bring them into an amended regulation I shall be happy to sign it.  They are annoying and I think defeating the purpose of inducing people to keep the law by being too far away from any danger&mdash;and once people get the habit of breaking the law they are inclined to continue with that habit.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell talked at some length.  He castigated the law as it now stands because a new recruit from the Depot having spent three months there and three months out of school, goes into court and says that because he saw somebody staggering, and so on, he was incapable of driving because of drink.  I do not drink.  I agree with Deputy P. O'Donnell that that sort of situation does not commend itself to me as a just way of doing things. However, it has been in practice for a very long time and, pending the changing of the law to bring in some more positive practice, that is what we have to operate.</P>
    <P>Apparently, these new fellows and the older fellows do not see enough of the people often enough that I see who should be described as incapable of driving because they have had too much to drink.  Only a very few are brought to book in proportion to the number using our roads, particularly <Col N="399" /> after closing time or around built-up areas.  Deputies will have an opportunity here, in the not too distant future, to discuss the other more fair and equitable and just way of determining in a really scientific and precise manner, through blood tests and otherwise, the position in relation to alcoholic consumption.  I only hope that those who criticise the present rather imprecise method of approach will throw their weight behind a positive approach on a scientific basis which I feel is required if we are to deal with this growing problem.  It is not just a problem of drunken driving: that is the wrong way to describe it. We do not have all that much drunken driving.  The trouble is that we have far too many people driving in rather difficult traffic conditions to-day who, though they have had only a few drinks, are not as alert or capable as they would be if they had not taken those few drinks.  This is the real approach to the matter and not a condemnation of everybody who takes a drink as a drunken driver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought lack of medical evidence was considered a defence in drunken driving?  Therefore, the Gardaí would not have the last say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting what Deputy P. O'Donnell said.  He has some experience on the other side.  It merely brings to my mind this possible discussion that we shall have I think in the not too distant future and which will be very important as it will affect a great number of people in a vital and particular way.  There will be opposition to it, I have no doubt whatsoever.  I do not know what will finally be determined but we are not out to condemn everybody who takes a drink as a drunken driver.  Certainly, I am not of opinion that anybody who takes a drink should not be allowed to drive but no person, no matter who he may be or what his capacity or experience or how long he is driving, after a not very great number of drinks, is as good a driver as before he took the drinks. This is the real approach we have to <Col N="400" /> make.  If we can improve safety on the roads by inducing people not to have those few drinks which leave them less good drivers, then anything we can do in that direction will be not only in the interests of the community but undoubtedly in the immediate interest of the persons concerned themselves.</P>

I do not know which it is.  I would point out, in regard to the planning which has come to my own notice through appeals to my Department that exempted developments which would not require permission have been refused permission and thus they have come, on appeal, to me. If that is indicative of the manner in which local authority officials have approached the matters contained in the Planning Act and the regulations and schedules that have gone out to them, it is no wonder that there is confusion in many parts of the country today in the minds of the public as to how this Act should or should not work.</P>

      <P>Section 35 gives to the authority the power to enforce completion of development work but this is in accordance with the terms of the permission granted, and I take it that in most cases the permission granted for these estates, or the terms of it, are not fulfilled when these estates are left in an unfinished condition.  Whether there is any loophole in the section I have no real knowledge.  On the other hand, the local planning authorities have not absolutely arbitrary power. None of us has, when it comes to the final point: there is a power over us which can determine these things.  As far as I can see, section 35 would apply to these cases.  Indeed we had hoped it would apply to cases where the terms of the permission given have not been complied with and are now the cause of complaint.  I take it the Deputy has some specific cases in mind.</P>

      <P>On the question of sanitary services, one thing more than another deserves mention.  Swimming pools were mentioned by a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Donegan. I should like to say that, not only for the healthy recreation they provide but also for the useful part they can play in preventing drowning accidents, swimming pools justify their place in our amenity priorities.  The new plan in my Department has been costed at a figure less than half the lowest we could get for the same job in the past.  It means we can attempt the construction of 25-metre four-lane pools, heated with showers and toilets laid on for £16,000.  This is less than half the lowest cost that has come to us from any local authority in recent years.</P>
      <P>We are not tied to a 25-metre pool. As circumstances demand, we can construct 30-metre or 50-metre pools and they still would not cost anything like the exorbitant figures we have had.  This happened in the past not through anybody's fault but because we had not got around to studying how cheaply the thing could be done instead of drawing up plans, specifications, costings and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was very busy during the election when I let it out.  It is very good news, a very good breakthrough.  We are not tied to our plans: we have asked for variations and they have been coming in&mdash;variations in structure and design but not in the basic size of the structure, which still can be provided at £16,000 for the smaller type of pool, covered in but with no frills or fancy work.  If any local group want to do the fancy work, let them, but we do not intend to encourage this until we have a sufficient number of pools with basic requirements. Thereafter, if we are to have frills, perhaps we can contribute to them For the moment we shall stick to the utilitarian structures so that we do not dissipate the money from the Vote in my Department on frills and flounces.  If they want these things, they can pay for them after we have got the basic requirements of ordinary pools.</P>
      <P>That is the situation.  We can do this. We have offered to the local authorities and to local groups to have it done for them through the National Building Agency.  The price I have mentioned can, of course, be beaten because we shall try to get a bulk number out for tender.  We could build five, ten, 15 or 20 and see what the reduction would be.  Some startling reductions have been disclosed in the tenders so far received.  All of these prices, of course, are still subject to scrutiny but over all I can stand over what I projected already that the pool can be built for under £16,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is probably the biggest thing that will have happened in the swimming pool business in this country in all these years.  It gives me hope that we can, in built-up areas such as Dublin or other large centres, have not just one large pool with everybody scrambling to get into it at the same time but other district pools in the area, probably serviced for competitions and other uses.  In the large provincial towns, there are few places which could not support a pool of this size and which would probably repay their share of the moneys after the subsidy we allow has been taken care <Col N="404" /> of.  There should be, to my mind, a real jump forward in the matter of providing swimming pools at very good value, a value we had not dreamt of six months ago but which we now find is a reality.  In these days it is good to find that we can get something for half what we thought we would have to pay for it six months ago.</P>
    <P>I invite local authorities to have another thought about this, particularly those with plans already passed and costing much more than £16,000.  In the light of what we know, we will have to ask them to think again because clearly it would not be possible for my Department or myself to go along with them in view of what we now know and after our investigations and after getting these plans drawn up, costed and specified and it would not be possible to OK a pool in any part of the country that is obviously costing far more than it necessarily should.</P>
    <P>While we invite newcomers who hitherto have been scared away by the anticipated high cost to come along and at least talk to us about the matter, I would also say to those who have high cost projects at an advanced stage to keep in mind that it is unlikely that they are going to have a straight run through on the basis of our concept of costs as we will have to go through their plans to reduce them to their own advantage and to our own.</P>

Finally, <Col N="405" /> I hope to hear from all who are interested in swimming, either from the safety point of view or from the point of view of sport, because if we can get a considerable number of projects going, we can obtain a cheaper price than the £16,000.  Therefore, in order not to hold up those who are ready to go ahead, any who want to do so should come along so that, by ordering through the Building Agency they can save themselves further money in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £21,176,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1966, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The total net Estimate for 1965/66, £31,765,000, shows an increase of £8,106,300 on the original net estimate for 1964/65 which amounted to £23,658,700.  Including two Supplementary Estimate provisions for 1964/65 of £666,000 and £675,000, the final total Estimate for that year was, in fact, £30,999,700.</P>
      <P>As compared with the original Estimate for 1964/65, the following subheads in particular show substantial increases: Subhead N.&mdash;Marketing, etc., of Dairy Produce; K.14&mdash;Scheme of Grants for Calved Heifers; K.8&mdash; Lime and Fertilisers Subsidies; K.18&mdash; Payments to Pigs and Bacon Commission; K.6&mdash;Farm Buildings Scheme; I.5&mdash;An Foras Talúntais; A&mdash;Salaries; K.7&mdash;Land Project; K.20&mdash;Temporary Beef Export Payments Scheme; and K.13&mdash;Brucellosis Eradication Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As compared with the original Estimate for 1964/65, K.11&mdash;Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme is the only subhead to show a substantial decrease.  I am asking for a very large <Col N="406" /> sum of money but as Deputies will be aware from the document entitled &ldquo;Notes on the Main Activities of the Department&rdquo; which has been circulated to them, I am operating a very comprehensive programme for the development of agriculture and for assistance to it.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that 1964 was one of the best years ever for Irish agriculture.  The value of gross agricultural output, including livestock changes, is estimated to have increased by £27.4 million or 12.7 per cent.  Net agricultural output is estimated to have increased by £25.5 million or 14.7 per cent.  Farmers' income is estimated to have risen from £121.5 million to £143.7 million.  Allowing for the decline in numbers between the two years, this has meant an increase of roughly 20 per cent in per head income of farmers.  While this is a substantial increase and has to some extent narrowed the gap between agricultural and other incomes, a considerable gap still exists and the Government are determined to bring about a progressive improvement in this situation.</P>
    <P>The agricultural price index which had remained more or less static for many years showed a sizeable increase in 1964, rising by nearly 11 per cent over 1963.  This increase resulted from the much improved prices for cattle and beef due to strong demand in export markets and from the increase in the prices of milk, barley, pigs and sugar beet.  While there were some increases in costs, notably in wages, the total effect was to increase the share of gross output accruing as income to the farming community.  The burden of rates on agricultural land was reduced to about the 1955/56 level, through an increase in the Exchequer grant.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy in relation to agriculture was set out comprehensively and in detail in the Brown Book <i>Agriculture in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published by my Department in July, 1964.  This policy document has commanded general acceptance from farming and rural organisations and indeed from the public generally.  The 1970 agricultural targets set are <Col N="407" /> ambitious.  Their realisation is dependent primarily of course on the efforts of farmers in co-operation with the Government but the targets are also based on the prospect of improved international marketing arrangements for agricultural commodities, including membership of the EEC. The policy for agriculture is broadly settled and it will be my task as Minister for Agriculture to do everything I can to translate that policy into action.  I am keeping under continuous review the progress towards the achievement of the 1970 agricultural targets and the adequacy and scope of the measures in force to realise them.  I am particularly pleased that farmers are increasingly availing themselves of the various aids to increased production and productive efficiency.  I and the Government as a whole are closely concerned in efforts to improve the market situation for our agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>The second annual review of agriculture between the Government and the NFA which extended over three weeks in March/April surveyed the whole agricultural scene and examined ways and means of maintaining and accelerating the momentum in agricultural progress.  I regard those review talks as of the greatest value in promoting a better mutual understanding of the problems and opportunities of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The problems of the small western farms have been engaging much of the Government's attention.  The Government's aims for rural development under the Second Programme envisage the more intensive use of land and the creation of viable family farm units in small farm areas.  The problems of small farms, lagging incomes and migration are most acute in the West and it is the Government's intention to take every possible step to raise the incomes of the farming community there.  Already 12 pilot areas have been established in the Western Counties. The purpose of these areas is to demonstrate what can be accomplished by community effort in making full and proper use of all available resources and facilities so that similar <Col N="408" /> areas elsewhere may be encouraged to apply the same techniques and practices. The basic aim is educational and to this end all the resources of the advisory services are being brought into play in an attempt to induce farmers in their areas to employ the most up-to-date methods and techniques, to encourage them to take advantage of all the grants, loans and other forms of assistance already available from the different State agencies, to develop co-operation and to give particular attention to encouraging and training younger people.</P>
    <P>The work in the pilot development areas is only the first stage in the formation of a comprehensive development programme which will be capable of application in all western districts. I would like to stress, however, that ultimately it is the people of the West themselves who will determine the extent of the success of this programme. The State will do its part but unless our western farmers avail fully of the resources and facilities placed at their disposal, our efforts will not meet with the success which I know can be attained if everybody throws his heart into it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that as a result of the increased State aid to Committees of Agriculture in the West under which we contribute 75 per cent towards the salaries of advisory officers, the target of one agricultural adviser for every 800 holdings over ten acres is well on its way towards achievement.  Since October, 1963, 40 additional instructors in agriculture have been employed in the West, bringing the total number of advisers at present to 140.  The recruitment programme is being continued and we hope some time in 1966 to achieve our target of 184 instructors. Our agricultural advisory service should then be numerically strong enough to bring about a worthwhile improvement in these areas.  It rests with the farmers to make adequate use of it.</P>
    <P>During the past year circumstances were favourable for the cattle industry. The export trade was buoyant with strong demand for both our store cattle and fat cattle.  The shortage of beef on <Col N="409" /> the European Continent led to increased exports of fat cattle to that area.  In 1964 we exported 637,000 store cattle&mdash;an increase of 72,000 over 1963&mdash;and the highest number exported for quite a number of years. Exports of fat cattle increased from 90,000 in 1963 to 150,000 in 1964. Although shipments of live cattle have fallen off in the past three months as compared with the corresponding months of last year, prices have been at a high level and all the indications are that the demand in export markets will remain strong.  This makes particularly welcome the growth in cattle numbers shown by the January census returns.</P>
    <P>The high shipments of live cattle in 1964 affected our carcase meat industry which found it difficult to get adequate supplies of finished cattle for slaughter at licensed export premises.  Slaughterings of cattle at these premises fell by about 100,000 between 1963 and 1964 and, as a temporary measure to assist the factories pending a further examination of the position by the Government, it was decided to introduce a scheme as from 1st February last under which payments are made in respect of good quality bullock and heifer beef exported to the UK market at rates equivalent to the payments made on such animals, including Irish stores finished in Britain, under the British Fatstock Guarantee Scheme.  A sum of £150,000 is provided in Subhead K.20 to meet the cost of this scheme up to the end of June next.  I hope by that time to have completed my examination of this important trade and to take decisions in regard to it.  In introducing the Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture on 2nd March, I gave the House particulars of the present temporary scheme and accordingly I do not intend to go further into the matter now.  Whilst our exports of carcase beef to Britain and the Continent in 1964 showed an increase over 1963, this increase took place at the expense of our boneless beef trade with the US which seriously declined due mainly to a falling-off in the number of cows slaughtered and the fact that prices in the US market during <Col N="410" /> the year did not move in line with prices in Europe.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants for calved heifers was introduced on 1st January, 1964, to encourage farmers to keep additional cows with a view to the attainment of one of the major aims of the <i>Second Programe of Economic Expansion</i>&mdash;the expansion of the country's cattle output from just over one million in 1960 to 1,500,000 by 1970.  The response to this scheme has far exceeded expectations.  It was originally estimated that about 20,000 additional calved heifers would qualify for grants in 1964 and that the number would increase progressively to about 120,000 a year in 1967.  In fact, grants had been paid to 78,500 farmers in respect of 202,500 calved heifers by the 31st March, 1965.  It is expected that in the financial year 1965/66 over 220,000 heifers will qualify for grants and that expenditure on the scheme may reach £3,500,000 as compared with a little over £3 million in 1964/65.  The average number of heifers qualifying for grants is about 2.5 per herd and there are no grounds to support the contention that the scheme is weighted in favour of the extensive landowner. While the scheme has been widely availed of throughout the country, the greatest increases relative to existing cow numbers have taken place in the western and north-western counties where the concentration of small farms is highest.</P>
    <P>To achieve the target set in the Second Programme, we estimated that we would have to raise cow numbers by an average of 75,000 a year, compared with an average annual increase of 14,000 in the period 1960-62.  The January 1965 census figures show that we have made a good start as the numbers of milch cows and heifers in calf were about 151,000 higher than in January, 1964.</P>
    <P>Our production of sheep and lambs continues to expand and the 1964 sheep population was the highest ever recorded.  The market position was also reasonably satisfactory during the year; this may have been helped somewhat by the shortage of beef in <Col N="411" /> Western Europe to which I have already referred.  At the rate of expansion in our sheep numbers in recent years we should have no difficulty in reaching our production target of 6.6 million in 1970.</P>
    <P>On the breeding side, the main new development during the past year was the import by my Department through the quarantine station established at Spike Island of Charollais bulls and heifers from France and Friesian bulls and heifers and Texel sheep from Holland.  In all, 74 animals were imported in the combined operation, comprising 18 Charollais and 25 Friesian cattle and 31 Texel sheep.  The Charollais and Friesian bulls will be used in the general AI service and their breeding value assessed as soon as possible.  The heifers of both breeds are being retained by the Department for building up basic pure-bred herds. The Texel sheep are also being retained by the Department to build up a pure-bred flock but they will, in addition, be used for an experimental crossing programme to evaluate their worth in fat lamb production.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the question of importing some more Charollais cattle, mainly heifers, from France later this year is now under consideration; as is also the question of importing improved strains of Landrace and Large White pigs from Sweden and Norway.</P>
    <P>The AI service for cattle made further substantial progress in 1964&mdash; the number of cows and heifers inseminated being about 825,000, or about 60 per cent of the total number, as compared with about 700,000 in 1963.  Inseminations from Friesian bulls showed a striking advance during the year and were the largest for any breed &mdash;being nearly 42 per cent of the total as compared with 30 per cent. in 1963. Progeny testing of the AI dairy bulls for milk and beef continues to make steady progress.</P>
    <P>As envisaged in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> further efforts have been in train to integrate the existing milk recording <Col N="412" /> schemes for AI dairy bull progeny, pedigree dairy herds and herds in cow testing associations.  I am confident from the progress now being made that an acceptable scheme of integration can be put into operation by next year.</P>
    <P>On the dairying side, I may say that milk production is steadily increasing and each year that passes is producing its own record figure.  In 1964 the milk supply to creameries reached the all-time high of 362 million gallons or 7.3 per cent above the 1963 figure.  So far this year the supply is about 16 per cent above that of the early months of last year and while this percentage increase should be scaled down somewhat as the peak period approaches, it is confidently expected that the current year will show an increase of a further 30 million gallons at least.  At this rate of progress the target of 550 million gallons of milk to be supplied to creameries in 1970, is well on the way to being achieved.</P>

Recovery is subject to the landlord being prepared to pay by way of compensation to the tenant such sum as the court considers proper, being not less than three years' rent, including rates, whether or not payable by the tenant.

      <P>The Act has been in operation for over four years and in that time only one complaint has been received by my Department as regards the operation of the provision.  In that case the tenant concerned had accepted the alternative accommodation offered without recourse to the court.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Dublin at present there are a number of proposals for the acquisition of tenanted cottages where tenants have, in most cases, for a lifetime been paying rent of 6/- or 7/- a week?  There are many aged people concerned and these people have had to vacate their properties on receipt of compensation in the region of £300 to £400 when it is impossible to obtain housing accommodation of any type for £300 or £400 and certainly not at a rent of 6/- or 7/- a week.

      <P>Due to the rapid growth in the number of television sets and the delay on many people's part in the purchase of a combined licence, it is customary for inspecting officers to carry out routine visits to houses where an ordinary radio licence is held.</P>
      <P>The licensee concerned changed his address comparatively recently.  Within the past eight months inspecting officers called once to his former address and once to his present address and they made reports in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Following expiry of his licence the licensee purchased a renewal licence for his new address on 26th February, 1965.  Unfortunately, the previous address was not recorded on the counterpart of the new licence at the time of purchase.  It was accordingly assumed that the licence had not been renewed, and a declaration form was issued in the normal way to the old address.</P>

      <P>The rising tide of milk supplies brings with it both production and marketing problems which must be resolutely faced by all concerned. On the production side the existing creameries and dairy products factories, together with the new factories being planned, will provide for us adequate capacity for producing a diversified range of dairy products.  On the marketing side An Bord Bainne, by utilising the most modern methods of market research and advanced marketing techniques, will continue to tackle the problem of export marketing in the businesslike way of which it has already shown itself capable.  This vigorous and intensive approach to export marketing is now more than ever necessary because of the tendency again becoming apparent for world production of dairy produce to outpace consumption.  Successful marketing cannot, however, fully succeed without continued improvement in the standards of quality of our dairy products and this in turn is dependent on the quality of the milk supplied to creameries by the milk producers. With a view to improving milk quality I have recently announced that as from 1st May, 1965, a price premium will be paid to producers of high quality milk.  Details of the scheme have been circulated to creameries. The scheme provides for the payment by the Exchequer of a special milk price allowance of one penny per gallon on milk tested under the scheme and found to be of premium quality.  This special milk price allowance is in addition to the existing milk price allowance of 4d per gallon which will continue to be paid on all milk supplied to creameries and used for the manufacture of dairy produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government recognition of the importance of the dairying industry in the agricultural economy and indeed in our whole national economy is evidenced by the amount of State assistance which is being afforded to the milk producer through direct milk price assistance and subsidisation of our exports of dairy produce.  In the year just ended the cost to the <Col N="431" /> Exchequer of this assistance was about £8.2 million.  In the current financial year, this figure could rise to over £10 million which is a very substantial sum indeed.  Of this amount, over £3 million is expected to be required to meet export subsidies on butter and other dairy products and practically all of the balance takes the form of direct milk price allowances.</P>
    <P>The sum of £30,000 will be paid to the National Dairy Publicity Council as a grant-in-aid to meet one-half of its proposed expenditure for the year on the promotion of increased consumption of milk and dairy products on the home market.  The other half of the expenditure is contributed by the other three bodies which with my Department are represented on the Council&mdash;An Bord Bainne, the Dublin District Milk Board and the Cork District Milk Board.  The Council, which was established last June, has already commenced the promotion by press, radio and television advertising of increased consumption of cheese which is the product that in our circumstances gives most scope for increased domestic consumption, but its activities will cover milk and other dairy products as well.</P>
    <P>During the past year pig numbers have been increasing satisfactorily. The January, 1965, census showed numbers up by over 14 per cent as compared with January, 1964.  A continuance of this expansion will readily enable us to achieve the production target which we set for ourselves in the Second Programme.</P>
    <P>The Multilateral Understanding on the supply of bacon to the United Kingdom came into operation on 1st April, 1964.  During the year to 31st March, 1965, Ireland supplied its full basic quota of 27,000 tons and an additional 500 tons allocated from the general &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; quantity provided for in the Understanding.  Our basic allocation is again 27,000 tons for the year 1965-66 and we will also be entitled to our appropriate percentage share of any allocations from the reserve.</P>
    <P>While the operation of the Understanding <Col N="432" /> has had some stabilising effect on bacon prices on the British market, the actual price levels during the past year were not as high as we would have wished and a considerable measure of financial support for our exports continued to be required.  Also, last year's increase in the barley price was reflected in higher guaranteed prices for good-quality pigs and this in turn increased our commitment for export support.</P>
    <P>The Pigs and Bacon Commission has, since April, 1964, been centrally handling the export of bacon and, more recently, of pork.  Progress is being made towards improving the quality of our bacon exports and strengthening the organisation of marketing arrangements in Britain.  Since last autumn the Commission have been undertaking an intensified marketing campaign for our bacon in the Glasgow area and have been meeting with a considerable measure of success in establishing the identity and increasing the demand for our bacon in that area.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which has been militating against the production of the highest quality bacon here has been the obsolete condition of plant and equipment at bacon factories, as well as the lack of modern up-to-date equipment particularly in the field of refrigeration.  Unlike our fresh meat processing plants, our bacon curing industry is a long established one and inevitably a number of premises and the plant and equipment in these premises fell far short of what is required in present day conditions.  To remedy this situation we introduced a few years ago a scheme for the modernisation and re-equipment of bacon factories under which very generous grants were offered for modernisation and re-equipment works. To date we have spent almost £300,000 on this scheme; in the current financial year we are providing a sum of £150,000.  Excellent work is being carried out under the scheme and we are well on the way towards having a modern well-equipped and, we hope, efficiently run bacon industry.</P>
    <P>There is one unsatisfactory element in pig production in the last 12 months <Col N="433" /> to which I must refer.  In the late summer and autumn of last year as a result of a buoyant demand for bacon on the home market at a time when it was necessary to maintain shipments of bacon to Britain at fairly high level to meet our obligations under the Multilateral Understanding, pig prices increased and at the same time the differential between prices for good-quality pigs and heavier pigs narrowed.  This led to a deterioration in granding performance and to excessive supplies of fat bacon when normal conditions returned.  Whatever short-term advantages accured to producers by producing heavy pigs and to bacon currers in offering high prices for such pigs were more than cancelled by the fall in prices for heavy pigs which subsequently took place.  Pig producers and bacon curers must come to realise that the long-term wellbeing of the industry lies in the production of top-quality pigs, the production of which is insulated against loss by our system of guaranteed minimum prices.  If we are to have centralised purchasing of pigs&mdash;and this is a large issue affecting many interests and requiring careful consideration&mdash;a principal objective must be to establish and maintain a stable price level which will ensure the production only of the high-quality type of lean pig which the modern bacon and pork market demands. My Department are at present examing an outline of proposals for the centralised marketing of pigs which the Pigs and Bacon Commission have prepared as a basis for discussion.</P>
    <P>Later this year we will be increasing pig prices to compensate for this year's increase of 5/- per barrel in the barley price announced some time ago.  This will further increase our commitment for export support but, because pig production is such a vital part of our farming economy, and particularly the economy of small farms, this is a situation which must be faced.</P>
    <P>The various pig breeding and pig improvement schemes are continuing to make satisfactory progress.  Special reports have been published during the past year on the two main schemes for pedigree breeding stock, i.e., the Accredited Pig Herds Scheme and the Pig Progeny Testing Scheme.  The <Col N="434" /> extension of the Cork Progeny Testing Station to double its existing capacity will be completed within the next three months or so.  Increased numbers of proven Landrace and Large White boars were also imported from Britain during the past year and leased to breeders.  These importations will be continued and we may if circumstances justify go further afield for improved breeding stock.</P>
    <P>As regards the poultry industry, only two sectors have been showing any expansion in recent years, namely broiler production and the export trade in day-old chicks.  The number of broilers consumed here has risen from less than a million in 1958 to almost 6½ million in 1964, and it seems likely that the demand for broiler meat will expand still further. So far, there have been no exports of broilers, but there are prospects of a large-scale integrated enterprise being established in the West Cork area with an initial output of 7-8 million broilers per annum&mdash;all for export. In order that our producers here should have access to the best broiler strains available, it has been the practice for my Department to import, or to permit the importation by private interests, of top-class American strains.</P>
    <P>Exports of day-old chicks reached 3,008,000 in 1963, and 2,870,000 in 1964.  This trade has been interrupted during recent months, as the discovery of Fowl Pest virus in a number of poultry flocks here and in the North, following routine tests, made it necessary to suspend cross-border trade.  This has seriously limited the income of many hatching egg supply farmers attached to exporting hatcheries.</P>
    <P>Turkey numbers were again down at the June census and exports during the Christmas period were very low.  The decline in this sector of the industry is, of course, due to the expansion of large-scale turkey production units in Britain during the past few years.  These have accounted for there of some 6 million birds over the an increase in turkey production past ten years.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government <Col N="435" /> have decided to increase the basic price for millable wheat of the 1965 crop by 3s. per barrel, thereby bringing the price up to 77s. 6d. per barrel or £31 per ton.</P>
    <P>The acreage sown to wheat in 1964 was lower than in previous years. The average yield per acre was again somewhat disappointing, but the harvest was good and over 98 per cent of the crop was purchased as millable.  One of the main factors contributing to the reduction in acreage in recent years has been the marketing problem.  Efforts to establish standards that would be acceptable to both producers and millers have been under examination for a considerable time.  In an endeavour to bring these efforts to a successful conclusion, Dr. Robert Olered, Head of the Cereal Chemistry Department of the Swedish Seed Association, was invited by my predecessor last year to study the question of wheat standards and wheat marketing here.  Dr. Olered's very helpful report is at present the subject of discussions with all the interests concerned, and I am hopeful that a considerable improvement in the marketing system will result from these discussions.  The improvement in the marketing system, together with the increase in price, should assist in arresting the decline in the wheat acreage which has taken place in recent years.</P>
    <P>The 1964 feeding barley acreage was the largest on record, 329,000 acres, but, as in the case of wheat, the average yield per acre was somewhat less than in previous years.  The out-turn from the crop was, therefore, less than might have been expected, due mainly to adverse weather conditions during the growing season.  In pursuance of its objective, as set out in the Brown Book, of increased economic production and greater utilisation of feeding barley, the Government have increased the floor price for feeding barley of the 1965 crop by 5s. per barrel, therby bringing the price up to 45s. per barrel, or £22 10s. per ton.  I am confident that this will operate to ensure a further increase in the barley acreage, thereby increasing <Col N="436" /> farm income and reducing our requirements of imported coarse grains.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the marketing of home-grown barley and for the importation of coarse grains which have been operated through An Bord Gráin during the past two years will be continued for the coming year.</P>
    <P>I am confident that we shall be able to announce the successful completion of the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign in the coming Autumn.  A very substantial clearance of reactors was affected last year.  In the six southern counties which are not yet attested, the incidence of disease had been reduced to 0.5 per cent at the end, in February last, of the third round of clearance testing.  The fourth round was started immediately and will I trust, be satisfactorily concluded in August.  I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the way in which all the interests concerned&mdash; the country's herdowners, the veterinary profession, farmers' organisations and the livestock trade&mdash;have worked together with the Department in this great task.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position to embark upon the eradication of brucellosis, or contagious abortion.  This disease causes serious loss of calves, infertility in cows, and reduced milk yields.  Its elimination from the country is the main veterinary objective in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Much preliminary work has been done by my Department in this matter, including a survey of every milk-supplying herd in the country. This has shown that while, fortunately, the incidence of the disease is very light in the counties of the North and West, it is quite a problem in the main dairying and breeding areas of the South and in the counties around Dublin.</P>
    <P>A scheme for the vaccination of young heifer calves in the problem counties will commence in June.  Vaccination at the proper time will give practically life-long immunity.  Vaccination at a later stage, however, will turn the animal into a reactor and I intend, therefore, to restrict the sale and use of anti-abortion vaccine.  Subject <Col N="437" /> to the passage of the necessary legislation, I hope to commence the eradication programme proper in the Autumn, starting with some counties where the incidence is very low.  In general, the scheme will be developed on somewhat the same lines as the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.  A scheme for the registration of certified brucellosis-free herds will also be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The response in the 1964 season to the intensive voluntary campaign for the eradication of the warble fly, which was initiated in the previous year, was quite encouraging.  Over 2,000,000 of the country's 5,000,000 cattle were dosed with a new systemic dressing from 5th September to 30th November, 1964.  Consulations are at present pending with the various interested organisations, whose help and co-operation contributed to last year's effort, with a view to the expansion of the campaign in 1965 to cover the treatment of all cattle in the country.  Apart from losses due to lower milk yields and general unthriftiness, the warble fly causes up to £200,000 damage to hides each year.</P>
    <P>With the full co-operation of stockowners, farming associations and other parties concerned, it is felt that the pest could be completely eliminated in the course of a few seasons through the use of the new dressing I have already mentioned.  It is proposed that, as from a date yet to be fixed, the exhibition of warbled cattle at fairs and markets will be made illegal and the export of cattle so affected will be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The continued incidence of sheep scab in this country constitutes a threat to the future exports of Irish sheep to Britain where the disease was eradicated some years ago.  The eradication of scab can be achieved only by ensuring that a 100 per cent dipping programme is carried out over a period of two or three years and steps are being taken by my Department to implement such a programme in this and succeeding years.  Action already taken by the Department in preparation for an <Col N="438" /> eradication campaign includes a survey of the dipping facilities throughout the country and approaches to county councils to carry out any necessary repairs to existing facilities and to provide additional baths where necessary. A subsidy of 50 per cent of the cost of new baths will be available to local authorities from the Department's funds and grants have also been provided for the erection of private sheep dipping and handling facilities.  In addition, the existing Sheep Dipping Orders will be amended at an early date to meet the needs of an eradication campaign.  These amendments will provide for the use of single-dipping type dips only, the compulsory dipping of all sheep in each of two separate prescribed dipping periods each year as against one dipping period at present, and the tightening up of the arrangements relating to the certification of dipped sheep.  A widespread publicity campaign in the national and local newspapers and other media is proposed in support of the eradication effort.</P>
    <P>Proposals put forward in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> for the extension of the Department's veterinary services included provision for the establishment of a number of regional veterinary laboratories to supplement the service at present being given from the Veterinary Research Laboratory at Abbotstown. The aim is to provide an improved diagnostic, investigational and advisory service for the whole country and the siting of the laboratories was considered on the basis that they should be located in areas with a high density of livestock and in centres with good communications to facilitate the rapid transmission of perishable specimens submitted for diagnosis.</P>
    <P>Plans are being prepared for the erection of four laboratories at Cork, Limerick, Sligo and Athlone to cater for the South, West, North-West and Midlands respectively.  The Central Laboratory at Abbotstown will continue to serve the Eastern part of the country.  The location of the new laboratories was decided with a view to giving an overall coverage of the <Col N="439" /> country, the general idea being that each laboratory would provide a service for stockowners and veterinary practitioners within a radius of 50-60 miles.  It is hoped that the first of these laboratories, that at Sligo, will be operational by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The provision in the estimates for An Foras Talúntas is £1,293,280.  This includes, for the first time, provision, £150,000, for a grant for capital purposes, the original Capital Fund of £840,000 which was provided by the American Government having been exhausted. The proposed grant towards the non-capital expenses of the Institute is £1,143,280, which represents an increase of 12½ per cent on that for 1964/65.  Research is, of course, of the utmost importance under present conditions and the Institute has in hands a very full programme of agricultural research which should help in solving many of our problems.</P>
    <P>The upward trend in the consumption of fertilisers continues.  Since 1957/58 the use of nitrogen and phosphates has increased by 90 per cent and of potash by over 70 per cent. Under the Ground Limestone Transport Subsidy Scheme the full cost of carriage of ground limestone from the production plant to the farm is met from State funds.  Thanks to the Scheme there has been a marked increase in the use of ground limestone in recent years, to a figure of 1,079,000 tons for the year ended 31st March, 1964.  This figure is still not high enough, however, as it has been estimated that upwards of 1½ million tons per annum are required merely to replace current annual losses through rainfall and removal in the form of stock, crops, etc.  I decided that there should be special publicity and promotional measures, aimed at securing use of 1½ million tons this year.  These measures have included press and television advertising and enlistment of the support of farming organisations and of the committees of agriculture in the various counties.  It is too early yet to say what will be the result of the campaign to secure greater use of lime <Col N="440" /> but I hope that the measures already taken and other publicity measures contemplated for the summer and autumn will bring about a much needed increase in lime usage.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation and improvement works are proceding at an active pace under the Land Project.  During the past year 91,300 acres were reclaimed or improved by farmers with the aid of grants amounting to £1.64 million provided under the Project.  This was an increase of £20,000 in grant expenditure as compared with the previous year.  The number of applications received from farmers during the year was 21,700, which was the second highest figure in the past five years. Special attention continues to be given to the reduction of the backlog of uninvestigated applications in those areas where arrears are heaviest with the aim of shortening, as far as practicable, the waiting period between the date of receipt of application and the date of issue of approval for work.</P>
    <P>Improved facilities were introduced during the past year under the fertiliser credit scheme and also under the scheme of grant aid for the fencing of mountain grazings.  Demand from farmers under each of these schemes has recently been showing a welcome increase and I hope this trend will continue.</P>
    <P>A new scheme aimed at the production of increased &ldquo;keep&rdquo; at critical periods from mountain grazings was also introduced and should, in conjunction with the fencing scheme, help towards better utilisation of mountain lands.</P>
    <P>Substantial increases introduced in February, 1964, in the rates of grants for farm buildings and in the range of purposes for which they are provided, had the effect of increasing applications received, work done and expenditure under the farm buildings scheme.  Grant expenditure went up from approximately £1.2 million in 1963-64 to £1.65 million in 1964-65 and as there is every indication that interest in the scheme will continue to grow, provision is made in the current year for grant expenditure of £1.8 million. The amount and number of grants <Col N="441" /> for the installation of water in farmyards and fields also continue to expand.</P>
    <P>I should now like to say a few words on the subject of agricultural education. The view was once common that one did not need any training to farm successfully. Fortunately that view is losing ground in recent years but there is still a lot to be done.  A recent study in my Department showed in a very striking way that education is very closely associated with success in farming and that the possession of both post-primary and agricultural education trebled one's chances of being in the group of highly successful farmers.  The Brown Book <i>Agriculture in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> emphasises the importance of agricultural education and training and describes the facilities which are available. Work which started some time ago on two new Agricultural Schools at Athenry, County Galway and Clonakilty, County Cork, is nearing completion and the new schools will shortly be ready for opening.  The two-year course of instruction hitherto provided at the Munster Institute, Cork, for young women desirous of qualifying as instructor of poultry-keeping and butter-making under a county committee of agriculture or as teacher of these subjects will be extended, as from August, 1965, to a three-year course. A three-year course of instruction in farm home management will also be introduced in August, 1965, at the Institute for the first time.  A horticultural school to be conducted by my Department is to be incorporated in the Kennedy Memorial Park at Ballysop, Wexford.  About 54 acres of the park land have been given over to the school purposes.  The district is particularly suited to commercial horticulture and full advantage will be taken of this in the training to be given.  A one-year residential course will be provided for about 30 students and it is hoped that the school will be ready for opening before the end of 1967.  A scheme of farm apprenticeship, administered by a Board representative of various agricultural interests has got under way. The first apprentices were placed on farms in the Autumn of 1964.  My <Col N="442" /> Department will contribute towards the costs incurred by apprentices in attending short annual courses and the first course of this kind will be held in Athenry Agricultural College next October.  The Department will also provide a number of awards to young men who complete the four-year apprenticeship period with special merit in the final examination.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, negotiations with a view to improving our permanent trading relations with Britain have been in progress for some time. It is still too early to say what will emerge from these negotiations but obviously any worthwhile new agreement would have to include improvements for our agricultural exports to Britain.  There is an increasing tendency towards the regulation of imports of agricultural products into Britain.  It will be remembered that imports of butter and bacon into that country are already subject to quantitative regulation and that efforts were made in 1964 to introduce a market-sharing arrangement for meat, which would have affected our exports of live cattle, sheep and lambs as well as carcase beef, mutton and lamb.  Having regard to the very substantial proportion of our agricultural exports which is disposed of in Britain, this trend, towards limitation of access to the market there, is a matter of serious concern to us and it is, therefore, vital to do everything possible to ensure that in the years ahead market outlets will be available for the increased production envisaged under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>With regard to the European Economic Community, our application for membership still stands and will be actively pursued when circumstances make this course desirable in the national interest.  We are continuing to maintain contact with the Community both at Ministerial and at official level. In January last I myself visited Brussels and had informal discussions with Dr. Mansholt, Vice-President of the EEC Commission who is responsible for agricultural matters in the Community, and also with Mr. Jean Ray, the member of the Commission <Col N="443" /> who is responsible for external relations.</P>
    <P>I also had very useful discussions at that time with the Belgian Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Heger, the German Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Schwarz and the British Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. Peart. Both Mr. Heger and Dr. Schwarz had already visited Ireland and I am very glad that Mr. Peart found it possible to come here last week when we had the opportunity of having further valuable discussions.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the prospects for the present year, I am confident that 1965 will prove to be another good year for agriculture.  Our principal commodity is cattle and the indications are that cattle and beef prices in export markets will continue to be well maintained.  Milk production has been expanding rapidly in recent years and given suitable weather conditions a further substantial improvement is expected this year.  Sheep production is at a record level, and pig numbers are showing signs of rapid expansion.  I have already announced increased prices for wheat and feeding barley and the prices of sugar beet and malting barley have also been raised.  The recent increase in agricultural wages and the rising level of rates will add appreciably to farmers' costs but with increased and more efficient production at higher prices I have no doubt that, given a reasonable season, agricultural income should move upwards again in 1965.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I add that the problems of agriculture in this country as elsewhere are numerous and complex. I do not pretend to have answers for them all.  I have endeavoured in this speech and in the notes which have been circulated to give Deputies a detailed and comprehensive view of the whole position.  I shall welcome their comments and any suggestions they may wish to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather hoping that my friend, the Minister for Agriculture, would depart from the <Col N="444" /> usual formula in his opening statement on the Estimate, but he did not, because his first statement was to the effect again that the aids given to agriculture had increased so far as money is concerned.  Of course, he followed that up with the apologia that agricultural incomes had not as yet reached the incomes of other spheres of activity.</P>
      <P>I want to say, as I said before, that all the money voted to the Department of Agriculture and to An Foras Tionscal cannot be regarded or accepted as aid to agriculture.  The complex nature of life today means that the Government must enter into every operation and into every effort to increase production, so part of this figure must go to increased Government intervention.  It does not mean that, in fact, the farmers have been receiving large sums of money by way of grant or aid directly from Government coffers.</P>
      <P>The Minister drew attention to the fact that it would appear that the farmers had a very good year.  There was one improvement, the increase in cattle prices as a result of the excellent 1948 Trade Agreement.  The agricultural price index increased by 17 points.  If one takes that into account, one finds that agricultural output, and I believe the net profits of the farmers over the year, showed no spectacular increase.  In fact, the formula used for the definition of net output in 1965 is extremely faulty because net output is defined as gross output, minus the value of feed, seeds and fertiliser used. There are many other expenses that are not in the definition such as the cost of running a tractor, so that, in fact, one cannot regard the figures indicated by the Minister as any direct pointer towards an increase in the net profit for farmers.  Of course we all live on net profit.  The Minister is an accountant and he must agree that we must all seek an increase in our net profit so that we can live more comfortably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good thing about the year was that the numbers of livestock were satisfactory. There was an increase, and a pleasurable increase, in cows and <Col N="445" /> heifers in calf.  High prices during 1964 resulted in very heavy exports but that trend is not proceeding in 1965. Prior to the introduction of the heifer scheme, we were not replacing our stocks in sufficient numbers to meet heavy exports such as we experienced. Those heavy exports are absolutely necessary in modern conditions to preserve our balance of payments.  In fact, when they did not continue in the spring of this year our balance of payments position, on which every industrial worker depends for his employment, deteriorated to a frightening degree, and the bulwark of the industrial worker was in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>We voiced fears about the heifer scheme because we thought it was being used by the large farmers, and that the small farmer could not increase his herd because he had not the grass, the housing or the winter feeding. We thought he could not co-operate in the heifer scheme to the same extent as the large farmer.  The Minister emphatically denies that.  One thing which has happened in relation to that scheme which was not intended is that it exploded in one year.  In fact, the grade increase which the Minister's predecessor looked for did not happen. What happened in fact was that there was a sudden explosion in the number of heifers mated.  This terrific increase is an indication to me that people have moved from traditional dry stock farming into keeping large numbers of heifers on their land.</P>
    <P>The question which now arises is, will the people who have a certain number registered as their herd revert to dry stock farming because they cannot get another £15 unless they increase the number of their heifers and cows.  This means that it is possible under the scheme to see a dropping off in the number of cows and heifers kept by those people and they may then revert to traditional dry stock farming.  We will know whether that will occur within the next two years. There is no doubt that there may not be the increase in the figure by 1970 which was hoped for.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael suggested a heifer mating subsidy or calf subsidy as far <Col N="446" /> back as three years before the Government introduced it.  It is very pleasurable in Opposition to find, as we have found before, that we have been governing from Opposition, and to see schemes introduced that we had adumbrated.  It is our job to examine them clinically and in detail, and that is the point I am making when I wonder if the farmers will revert to dry stock farming.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, exports were satisfactory, but I think they have not continued into 1965.  I hope they will continue to improve until we reach the satisfactory position of 1964.  I also want to say to the Minister that the whole basis on which his agricultural price index last year has increased is the excellent permanent trading relation brought about by the inter-Party Government and by Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture in 1948.  It is on that framework the present Minister has been building and it is on that framework that the farmers have been succeeding.  If there has been any improvement, it is in this particular sphere.  In the sphere of grain production, where there was not enough opportunity for exporting, there was a grave disaster.  In other agricultural spheres where export was not available and where the Trade Agreement did not have an impact, there was no apparent success.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the question of the Common Market and our general position in relation to the Continent of Europe and Great Britain.  Before the election, a very enlightened farmer of considerable influence telephoned me and pressed me to know whether or not we would join the Common Market.  He suggested that, if we did, immediately the prices for lamb, and grain would double his income.  He did not care about industrial workers or anybody else.  He wanted to know what we would do if we governed the country. The Minister did not answer that to-day. He has been extremely vague about it and about EFTA.  He has not said anything at all about the current happenings in GATT and the current effect on this country of the Kennedy round of tariff reductions.  These items are extremely important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> All the Minister said was that he made a trip to Brussels and had two conversations with people there.  I think the farmers are entitled to a more definite approach than this.  They are entitled to know what is in the Minister's mind and what is in the mind of the Government in relation to these three international bodies&mdash; the Common Market, EFTA and GATT.  We all know that GATT is responsible for two things&mdash;limiting our butter exports to Britain and at the same time increasing the prices.  I think this is the general trend all over Europe today.  The trend is to try and get real prices for agricultural produce and do this in a way which will not cause unemployment or hardship to other members of the community.  An industrial community will not allow such hardships but our Minister for Agriculture and our Government must be in on every negotiation and completely <i>au fait</i> with procedure and on the ball as far as international co-operation and the marketing of our agricultural produce is concerned, not only in Britain but on the continent of Europe as well.</P>
    <P>Let me get back to the gentleman who telephoned me.  I could not answer him and the Minister has not answered him today because there is the difficulty of the Kennedy round, the GATT and the 1948 agreement in our system of tariff preferences.  Any changes here in relation to the Common Market would hurt Britain and she might decide that this important and valuable trade agreement to which I have referred was no longer binding on her.  There is a whole series of delicate international agreements and negotiations on which the Minister in replying might give some of his views, in relation to the statement of the Taoiseach that we are still operating towards a 1970 entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Every farmer wants to know this. Every industrial worker must know this and everybody, no matter in what sphere of life in this country, will be affected by it.  Therefore, on our side we must not do anything that will <Col N="448" /> hinder the Minister and the Taoiseach in their delicate operations.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate to us how things are going.  We all know the Minister did not go to informal discussions in Brussels by way of holiday. He could have found a nicer place to go.  Therefore, he might elucidate what the position is in relation to our 1970 entry into the Common Market and how it will affect agriculture and other industries here.</P>
    <P>The progress that has been evident for many years in the production of dairy produce is continuing.  We on our side of the House are extremely glad that this is so.  But, we would point to the fact that it was the inter-Party Government here who saw a few years ago what was happening as a result of the limitation on the export of butter to Britain.  In fact, butter prices in Britain were improved. As a result of this there would be a saving to the Exchequer in that particular year of £1,500,000. which should be given to the farmers in the price of milk.  Six months later the Government did that and that is another indication of the Government being on the ball.</P>
    <P>I should like to indicate another matter in relation to dairying on which the inter-Party Government showed the way.  On an occasion 15 months ago I had the temerity to make a speech stating that the cleanliness of milk was not all it should be.  I was immediately attacked by Deputy Corry who is not here presently.  Indeed, it was an occasion of ribaldry.  I have suffered many trials in politics and I suffered that one too.  If the Minister refers back he will find that my suggestions were that there should be a plan in the south of Ireland for the improvement of the standard of cows, the standard of the dairies available to farmers and an increase in the number of farms on which water from deep wells was available.  That is the gravamen of the whole thing.  We find, nine months later, after having suffered the ribaldry of Deputy Corry and smiles from the opposition Deputies, as well as being accused of saying that every farmer's daughter was dirty, and so on <Col N="449" /> that there will be a premium of 1d. a gallon for better quality milk.</P>
    <P>By better quality milk the Minister means milk that will be tested on certain days, but this is not the time nor the place to go into details.  I say this is not the way it should be done. We must go into far greater detail in relation to the standard of cows in the creamery areas, give better grants than are being given now for cooling equipment and better grants for the boring of deep wells and in this way produce a better quality milk.  By doing this we shall be placing the tools in the farmers' hands so that cleaner milk can be produced.</P>
    <P>I am a dairy farmer and I have a deep well in which there is so much water that when the cows are being milked we have running water continuously passing the cooler and I have never had sour milk returned to me from Dublin city.  That is so because this quantity of water is available and the equipment is available.  I am aware that my neighbour may have to spend some thousands in order to have these facilities which would not have cost me more than £100.</P>
    <P>This is something the Minister must look into.  He has not attended to it. It is all very well to have interviews in the Department of Agriculture but this does not produce better quality milk.  It is the Minister's job to know the dairy farmers.  This is how it should be done and the Minister will not do it by his present system which is only touching on the problem.  It is of course an indication again, which we are only too happy to enjoy, of this governing by Opposition.  I do not mind at all if Deputy Corry decides to abuse us over here on some serious points of agricultural policy which we may put forward.  We will suffer that because it may even draw the attention of the people opposite to the serious nature of some of these problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the <Col N="450" /> Minister is that lazy.  I want to say a few words about pigs.  The first thing I want to say is that the Minister on pages 10 and 11 of the circulated version of his speech spoke about the question of centralised pig purchasing. This is a very serious problem because when you decide on centralised pig purchasing you immediately remove competition from the pig trade.  In theory at least, you regularise the whole thing.  This should mean, that if it were possible for me to do so, I should have ten identical pigs, bring them to ten identical bacon factories and get the same price per lb. for all of them at each of these ten factories.  There are far more serious difficulties than that.  The best way I can describe the difficulty in grading is that grading is decided by the thickness of your thumbnail.  The situation at the moment is that the net profit on a pig is around 30/-, but this can mean no profit at all, when the decision goes against you, if you centralise pig buying.  It is a question of the man who is doing the grading, an extremely detailed work.</P>
      <P>I would go this far and say I would be extremely chary of creating any situation whereby the question of prices and profit one way or the other would be completely in the hands of one group of people, with supply, demand and competition available to them alone.  If the dealers are in competition with the grading system at factories then you have the best of both worlds, that is, centralised marketing or quality competing with what the ordinary dealer can produce for his seller by his contacts in the rest of the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most serious problem and I would urge the Minister to address himself to it in the most serious way. It is a situation where the farmer seems to be happier than he was when grading was introduced some years ago.  There is a great trade for Grade A pigs but at the same time there should be a trade for porkers from the ordinary dealers.  I know that the principal officer of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, who resigned, was in favour of centralised marketing.  I do not know what the views of his successor are but if I were in the Minister's <Col N="451" /> shoes, I would be very slow to put the dealers out of business.  I have no love for the dealers.  I would merely like to see the trade operating on a supply and demand system.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to one particular thing which seems extraordinary to me.  On 2nd March, 1965, I addressed my second or third question to the Minister&mdash;the previous one I addressed to his predecessor was not answered&mdash;on the subject of Jordan pighouses.  A Jordan pighouse costs £4, a Danish one £28 and a Solari one, £18 or £19.  When it comes to pig production, there is not a lot between the three of them.  I remember a man who had a very large amount of money invested in pig breeding and who wanted to know whether or not the Jordan pighouse was the best but nobody would tell him.  About two years ago in Fermoy, I was able to get information about this from the Agricultural Institute but on 2nd March two years later, the Minister was not able to give me that advice.  It seems to me that it is wrong that we cannot get advice when we need it.  This seems to me to be the case of a man in a hurry.  The man who is present Minister for Agriculture seems to be a man in a hurry. The figures which are being produced in the Agricultural Institute, not only on pigs but on every other feature of farming, must be translated into increased production on the farms of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The question of small farms has been activating the Minister's and the Government's minds ever since the recent by-election in the west of Ireland. It should well do so because that is really where they got their answer. We may have got our answer in other places but there is no doubt about the fact the small farmers gave the Government their answer.  We have the report of the inter-departmental committee on the problem of the small western farmer and it makes good reading.  It suggests that holdings which are five years vacant should be acquired by the Land Commission for the extension of holdings which are too small.  We, on this side of the House, agree entirely with that.  We do not agree, perhaps, <Col N="452" /> that the old person, who has not farmed his land for a decade, should be removed from it by the Land Commission just because his health or his age did not allow him to farm it and he is now keeping it for a nephew or a son who might be away.  I consider the Minister, where a farm has been entirely vacant, should take it over for extending holdings in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, have been suggesting for years that low interest loans should be available for small farmers and we are glad to see that the Minister is now in favour of this.  When we advocated this, we were subjected to quite a lot of derision from the other side.  Low interest loans are a most necessary departure which should pay for themselves many times over.  Furthermore it is not an expensive operation.  I shall come to agricultural labour later, in order to prove that but at the moment I should like to suggest this.  If the small farmer, through any aegis, particularly the Agriculture Credit Corporation, were allowed to get from the National Loan £1 million, the interest charged on that would be around £60,000.  When those fellows had repaid a portion of their principal, it would be less, decreasing each year. Is this figure of £60,000 to give the small farmers £1 million too grandiose? Is it too extravagant?  Is there anything wrong with it?  I do not think there is.</P>
    <P>Just as the Party opposite have been eviscerating as best they can any of the good schemes we put up, I foresee that, during the lifetime of the Eighteenth Dáil this Minister for Agriculture will produce a scheme of reduced or interest free loans for small farmers.  I want to record that we are the people who did the investigation on it and that we are the people who will be responsible for it.  The Minister may smile.  He will do it, as sure as guns are made of iron.  Do not worry, we have seen Fianna Fáil's technique before.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks about the extension of the land project and the number of applications, and so on, he is certain to leave out one particular thing and that is that Section B of the Land Project has been discontinued. The report on the small farms suggests that this section would be reinstituted. <Col N="453" /> For the information of new Deputies who may not know, Section B is the section whereby the small farmer or any farmer who has not the capital to put down, who has not got what the Minister and I would call, on other occasions, &ldquo;the readies&rdquo;, can get his land drained and the cost put on his land annuities for the next 35 to 40 years.  The Party opposite are responsible for this removal and they should reinstitute it.</P>
    <P>The question of milk production on these small farms is all-important.  The extension of the dairying industry into the west of Ireland must come.  We on this side of the House would urge the Minister and the Government to proceed with that with all haste because, no matter how you look at it, if you have dry stock as against milking stock on a farm the gross income from the milking stock is far higher and then you have the calves as well.  The small farmer must employ labour profitably. In the looking after of milking stock, home labour can be employed.  In that way, you can increase the gross income and the net income of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into complete detail on this particular report but two aspects of it must be mentioned.  One is that it is recommended that the advisory services be expanded.  We on this side of the House have never left the belief that not only should you have advisers from committees of agriculture but also that the Minister himself, if he seeks to get work of a specific nature done in a pilot area in the west, should be in a position to put in an adviser&mdash;a parish agent, to use our term&mdash;and directly control him and see what improvement he can get and, through him, channel specific schemes that may not even be available in the rest of the country.  We believe the Minister should do it and where he has his pilot area schemes he should have his advisers and instructors to help to bring about the increased agricultural production which is the only hope for the small farmers.</P>
    <P>It would not be realistic to talk about the small farmer at all if one were not to say that there must be a high income from his farmyard if he <Col N="454" /> is to survive.  The Minister himself had quite an income from egg production. In fact, when examined in relation to the capital expenditure thereon, I think I agreed with him one night that it was not anything very wonderful at all, that, in fact, the Minister's figure for his own poultry farm was quite a realistic one.  There was nothing at all wrong with the figures.  So long as he had the market for the end product, which he had, that profit was there.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to do that in Raheny it is possible to do it in the west. However, it means considerable capital expenditure.  Not only that, it means that that capital expenditure must be well employed.  It means that the buildings, or whatever they are, that are placed on that farm shall be approved as economic and efficient and as buildings that will give that net profit that will keep the people there on the land.</P>
    <P>Pig and poultry production on these small farms in the west are two of the particular things that will keep the people there.  You cannot expect to get a good gross income from perhaps 20 acres of rocks but you can expect to get an income supplemented by a very good income earned within the farmyard and that is one of the things that must happen.  I would urge on the Minister that he proceed along specific lines, and these he must do.  I intend to indicate some specific lines on which he might proceed.</P>
    <P>During the last election, we produced some points on agricultural policy.  One was that the income of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society should be expanded.  The Minister has expanded it slightly this year.  We added another codicil to this suggestion of ours on agricultural policy and that is that anywhere that the farmers would invest sums of money in their co-operative society for any particular project then, up to a limit of £50,000, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society would be in a position to put up £ for £ of investment with them.  I think the Minister should go that far: you have not gone that <Col N="455" /> far.  You have not got as far as £50,000.  You have gone to £30,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean £50,000 for any one project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is merely a suggestion.  I do not think there is a lot between us.  I am suggesting that the farmer should know that if, in his co-operative effort, he is prepared to gather within his parish a figure of £1,000 there will be another £1,000 coming from the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society towards his capital project.  The Minister may not agree with that, but it is no harm to mention it.</P>
      <P>We must also make things easier for the small farmer.  The small farmer gets it hard twice a year to pay his rates.  The fellow with a valuation of about £23 or £24 can find himself, particularly in the west, even with the present agricultural rebate, with something in the order of £18 to £20 rates, to pay twice a year.  That, to him, is two or three weeks' earnings.  That, to him, is five or six weeks' hard work per year.  On this side of the House, we have examined the exact cost of removing that burden from the farmer of £25 valuation and under.  I am in a position today to give the figures to the House and to the Minister.  To completely derate farms with a valuation of £25 and under would cost £1.3 million.</P>

      <P>But all other farms of £25 valuation and under would be completely derated on everything: is that the suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We on this side of the House think it worth it and we make the suggestion to the present administration. The Minister has taken some steps in relation to grain growing. largely an increase in grain prices next year.  There is no doubt about the fact that the increase in wheat prices is too little.  I shall not be naive when I say that the increase in barley prices is, I think, fair.</P>
      <P>However, I want to say that the production of wheat in this country has fallen catastrophically.  If one takes the millable and unmillable wheat on the basis that everybody who grows wheat would like it to be millable, in 1962 the total production was 405,200 tons.  In 1963 it was 374,000, in 1964, 241,000 tons.  That is the total of millable and unmillable wheat.  If that trend continues there will not be nearly enough wheat for inclusion in the grist in Ireland.  It is agreed that the amount of Irish wheat which can be assimilated in the grist is 260,000 tons.  When we started on this in 1953, before the Minister arrived, the Fianna Fáil Party organised a Departmental Committee who produced a figure of 300,000 tons as being the maximum for inclusion in the grist.  A further figure of 285,000 tons was produced.  There is an end to the falling graph and I do not think we are far from it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year there was a considerable fall in the amount of millable wheat and the quantity of unmillable wheat was 17,000 tons, Had we had a large quantity of unmillable wheat we would have been very short of the amount required for the grist.  The national <Col N="457" /> policy in this country has been to include in the bread of every wage earner, of every self-employed person and of us all 75 per cent Irish wheat and that this should be done at a fair price to the grower.  That is highly important for our farmers in respect of the 260,000 tons of wheat necessary for our grist.  It adds up to a fair amount of money.  It is a cash market where cash markets are scarce.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should increase the price of wheat further, that his increase of 3/- per barrel is not sufficient in 1965.  I believe wheat production may be down again this year and I further believe that the only area holding its wheat production will be that from which I come.  Why, I cannot tell you.  If the Minister does not do better than this, wheat production will drop.  My remedy is that the Minister increase the figure now.  The sowings for this year have now been done but such a move would build up the figure the following year.  My suggestion is that the figure of 3/- should be doubled.</P>
    <P>There are other matters in this connection which must be considered. While the increase in feeding barley is very creditable, the position is that the import of coarse grains is still far too high.  Our imports of wheat amount to £5 million, imports of maize amount to £2 million and other cereals account for £1,564,000.  I am aware that under the trade agreement with Britain we must import some seed, even where we are able to grow it ourselves.  It is a small matter which should not be used against the Minister.</P>
    <P>Grain production must be looked after and it is not being looked after. Our aim should be to increase the production of both wheat and barley.  The Minister has done his job in relation to barley.  If we were to have more than 260,000 tons of wheat I believe the matter of a small levy would not dissuade farmers too much.  If prices are fair production will not drop.  It would be a tragedy, if grain production were destroyed.  The Minister has some responsibility in the matter of wheat not only in relation to price. One of his duties is in relation to the Olered Report.  There was also a report <Col N="458" /> from the survey team on flour milling.  The President of the Flour Millers Association addressed a symposium organised by the NFA.  He said:</P>
    <P>Let me say here and now that the IFMA accepts Dr. Olered's recommendations, but it must be made quite clear that his recommendations are made and are acceptable to us in the context of a system of marketing which is quite different to ours.</P>
    <P>If one goes into the recommendations of Dr. Olered one finds the system is one of purchasing by dealers and of sale to the flour millers.  There is nothing wrong with that.  However, a physical matter arises and it should have been dealt with months ago.  It is a matter of segregation.  Under the Olered recommendation there would be grades of wheat and flour millers would not be coerced into using any grain.  There would be an intake of three or four grades.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has anything to do with grain knows that is a highly difficult technical problem.  You must have driers and storage facilities all of which would cost a lot of money. If wheat production is not to deteriorate, if the quantity is not to contract and if this report is to be accepted, we should have begun to get down to the task of making these segregations, of providing the driers in the grain growing areas.  The Minister has not moved on it and in his last public statement touching the question he said it was under consideration.  This is not the time for consideration but for movement.  We have now reached a stage where we can do nothing in respect of the harvest to come but the Minister should be engaged in the task of doing something about the harvest that follows.  He has got to consider this matter very quickly and very completely.  He must complete his plans and agreements with the various people involved&mdash;farmers, millers and everybody else&mdash;for implementation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of farm buildings is one on which I have touched not in any detail.  It has activated this Party and <Col N="459" /> our thinking during the past number of years.  Particularly in the dairying areas, the standard of farm buildings leaves much to be desired.  The problem must be tackled in a detailed and specific way.  I want to state our proposals in this regard.  Our proposals are that there should be a farm buildings agency run on the same lines as the National Building Agency is run for the provision of houses for individuals. This farm building agency, by contracting with the local contractors, would set up on the farms buildings of approved specifications which will be economic and efficient. Surely with the Agricultural Institute now running for some years it should be possible to get a plan for a 50-pig house for the man who wants a house for 50 pigs, or a plan for the ten-cow man or the 50-cow man.  These buildings, because of the fact that they would be erected by the same contractor, perhaps over a wide area, would be far cheaper than if the farmer had to erect them himself. As well as this advantage, there would be the advantage of the proper specifications being followed and we would produce buildings that, by experiment in the Institute, had proved to be economic and efficient.</P>
    <P>This can be related to the policy we adumbrate here on the extension of credit facilities to farmers.  It could be incorporated in a farm plan and the whole basis of agricultural advancement is a farm plan.  I want to say, and I never did this before, because I think our Department of Agriculture is an excellent one and that our officers are men of great integrity and ability, that I have been examining the detailed nature of the farm buildings proposals of the Northern Ireland Government which, of course, are duplicated in Britain.  The farm improvement scheme and the leaflets in relation to it, and the specifications of the buildings and the specifications for the different improvements they want to see carried out on the farm, are far more detailed and are more helpful.  It is necessary that we should go into this detail and integrate the whole affair with our agricultural instructors' effort to increase <Col N="460" /> production and get the whole vehicle moving at the same time towards the same objective.</P>
    <P>I believe this is absolutely necessary. An agency of this kind could work with the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The scheme of reduced interest free loans that we adumbrate could be integrated also.  You could have this section of agricultural credit bringing the specific result that is so desired not only by the people but by the Government and the Opposition.  The Minister gave no indication in his speech of any detailed plan of this type. He gave no indication that there was any serious thinking of a change in this regard and no indication that there would be such an agency as a farm building agency that would produce these buildings with the speed and urgency that would be required.</P>

      <P>I should like to discuss that with the Minister now that he has mentioned it.  One of the great successes of the Fianna Fáil Government, perhaps in a relatively small way, has been the National Building Agency.  There is no doubt about that. I like to be honest and I have built a house through it myself for an executive. You walk into the office and a man asks you what do you want and then says that the architects are upstairs and he brings in four plans and asks you &ldquo;Will you have this one, or this one, or this one?&rdquo;  He then says: &ldquo;I am building 16 of those in such and such a town, eight of those somewhere else, and two elsewhere and if you will say that you will have this one I will ask the contractor to make it not 16 but 17.&rdquo;  That has been my experience and that is why I am sold on the farm building agency.  It would be possible for it, working through the Department and the Institute, to produce for Deputy Lalor, if he wanted it, a pighouse for 50 pigs to a suitable design and price and it would be far easier than if we gave Deputy Lalor a leaflet and left him to do it himself.  Have I convinced the Minister that there is anything in the idea?  If there is he will steal it.</P>

      <P>Then I will have done some good, will I not?  However, this is my view and I think I can convince the House there is something in it.  The National Building Agency is only getting under way.  The Minister for Local Government was discussing with me the question of swimming pools and indicated that there would be cheaper rates if they could get half a dozen pools built by one contractor to a specified design.  It might be said that this is spoon-feeding the people but I intend no insult when I say that a lot of people need to be spoon-fed.  If you can set it up so that Deputy Lalor can have a 50-pig house for £X per year and that from that he can make his principal or principal plus interest repayments and have more net profit for himself, you have done something at that stage.  If I have sold the Minister that idea I am happy.  The Minister told me that he was going to deal with fishing, is it a fishy subject today?</P>

      <P>I will, but it will be for mackerel and it might make the Minister sick.  We on this side of the House have worked extremely hard in the production of detailed plans for agriculture.  We have not had the facilities which the Government have, but we have addressed our minds to the problem and there were occasions when what we did produce was filched by the Government and is now being used by them.  On one occasion I mentioned the question of giving a penny premium for clean milk and said it was something that had only been half-done and that the first thing necessary was to institute this detailed plan for farm buildings, the provision of cooling equipment and all that sort of thing.  I was going to say that there is no good putting the cart before the horse but I will say instead that there is no use taking out the horse when you have not yoked him to the cart, unless you are going to the hunt.  In <Col N="462" /> the last election, in the small farm areas, we gained votes on the basis of the work we had done.  We will not have an opportunity of testing that again for a while but we are not ungenerous and I am sure that the Minister will steal from us what has been made public in our plans in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The general attitude of our Party to Government policy on agriculture is that while there has been rather generous State aid we think it might be more specifically directed towards the small and medium sized farmer, rather than as in the past where the main profit went to the larger farmer.  No matter how bright and comprehensive a document may be provided here on agriculture, the truth to my mind is that for the agricultural community&mdash;and I refer mainly to the small and medium sized farmer&mdash;a great element of confusion exists generally.  Things are not as bright as the Government might have us believe.  The greatest indication, to my mind, that something was wrong in the past or is wrong now is that many years ago it was found possible to pay farmers 84/- per barrel for barley while beer, which I might call the finished product, could be sold at 10d. a pint.  If we examine the position now we find that barley is something under 30/- less per barrel and the finished product sells at from 1/8d. to 2/- a pint, the price varying between the country and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main concern as a Party with agriculture is the shameful reward it provides for those engaged in it as agricultural labourers.  Those working as agricultural labourers are in fact living under conditions more befitting the time of Cromwell than a time when a native Government is in control. Anybody looking at schoolchildren going to school in rural Ireland will know immediately by the pinched face of the child, the heel out of the stocking, the general delicate appearance, and bad clothes, that the child is the child of an agricultural labourer.  That is an appalling situation.  No blame for that can be directed towards the parents of the child, or to the father in particular, because I know of nobody who gives a greater contribution <Col N="463" /> physically to the national well-being than he does but the reward is not there, even though we consider agriculture to be the premier industry.  It is appalling that such conditions could be related to agriculture and the people engaged in it.</P>
    <P>If it is true that agriculture is our premier industry, it is amazing that those engaged in it are able to acquire by their efforts only half of what may be obtained by workers in a shirt factory or boot factory.  I do not think it is the intention of the Government or of any decent-thinking Irishman that those engaged in the premier industry should exist in these terrible conditions. It is also true that those engaged in agriculture have large families that are hungry.  That is a statement of fact.  Whether the industry is doing well or not&mdash;and we are told it is doing well&mdash;you can best gauge the position by what can be got out of agriculture and I suggest that the only people who are doing well out of it are those who are buying the farmers' produce.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly&mdash;and I take responsibility for saying it&mdash;to the millers, the maltsters, the bacon and beet factories which I am satisfied under consecutive Governments have been given a licence to rob the farmers. It is the people who buy the farmer's produce who do well and I make that statement fully conscious of what I am saying.  These people seem to drive much better cars than the farmers do. All this matter should be examined. The big discrepancy might exist in regard to the barley prices.  At one stage&mdash;I am not ashamed to say it&mdash;I worked in a malthouse and at the wrong end of it, because I worked with a shovel&mdash;and I know that barley was bought at varying prices, some of it, when the contract was filled was bought at varying prices, some of it, when the contract was filled was bought for 10/-, 15/- or perhaps £1 less than the contract price&mdash;but I was one of the people who started that barley into the same hopper; it was used for the same purpose and eventually sent away in the same container as the barley bought at the contract price.  Therefore, that licence to rob is there and I think the Government should as far as possible take <Col N="464" /> steps to arrest that plundering and eventually eliminate it.</P>
    <P>I think no worker would leave the land if his work there was rewarded but if the present system of reward to agricultural workers is to continue&mdash; indeed if the amount of reward obtained by the small or medium farmer is to continue&mdash;I am certain that in ten years rural Ireland will be as dead as O'Connell.</P>

      <P>O'Connell.  He is dead, is he not?  Something must be done to put the farmers in a position to pay wages if we are to save rural Ireland.  One way of doing this would be by interest-free loans.  It is true that small farmers who have endeavoured to equip themselves and their holdings find themselves now the playthings of the moneylenders and many of them find themselves in a precarious financial position.  They have to work hard and their efforts are directed to paying off the interest on the money they have borrowed because they are being fleeced by the moneylenders.</P>
      <P>I speak as one who comes from one of the greatest tillage areas in the country.  I know the feelings of the people there; I know the farmers' sons with whom I mingle and I can say it is a very happy farmer's son who has 10/- on a Saturday night.  That is an appalling situation in a country basically dependent on agriculture.</P>

The Deputy spoke about the price of malting barley and compared it with the price paid some years ago.

That was the motive behind it.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Donegan, who began the debate on the other side, was speaking and when he spoke of all the prices he wanted I wonder why his Party are on that side of the House especially when the people had a chance of reversing the position and putting him over here only a few weeks ago.  He spoke of more money for every item going into the farm: but this Estimate has increased out of bounds. He said we should have more money for cow byres and for installation of water supplies and so on but for every up-and-doing farmer the money is available and I do not see why he does not avail of it.</P>
      <P>He said that the Department was trying to encourage the farmers to have cleaner milk.  That may be all right, but to earn the penny a gallon would cost the farmer a great deal before he would get any benefit.  When you go to the creamery you must pass a test for three weeks or so and if you are down one week there is no penny a gallon.  There is a good deal to be considered there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan mentioned the price of wheat and said it should have been further increased.  I have no doubt if the Minister had increased it Deputy Donegan would have said it should <Col N="466" /> have been more still.  It is not the price of wheat so much as the method of handling it adopted by the millers that matters.  The farmers thought the increase of 3/- was fair enough but now between the bad harvest which we must risk and the manner of delivering it to the mills, the farmer finds he is at the wrong end.  It is not the price that has kept down the acreage; it is the way the wheat is being treated.</P>
    <P>The Deputy from Laois spoke on the question of malting barley.  He said that Guinness buy it on contract and if you have a surplus over the contract, it all goes down the one chute.  That would be wrong if it happened.  I do not know how you can prevent it because it is all delivered to the mill. If they are refusing it, they refuse at that point down the country; they do not take it up here.  I know farmers living around me and their surplus was not taken.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign, there were people who said that they could not see any signs of progress or prosperity.  I wonder are they blind or deaf or both?  One has not to go very far in any part of the country to see evidence of prosperity.</P>
    <P>The case of the small farmer has been raised.  It is all very well to suggest to the Minister that some scheme should be adopted.  We have a Minister who is pursuing a good policy, based on sound foundation.  I read a rather amusing statement the other day by a very intelligent man who asked how a small farmer with ten sows and ten cows could exist.  Is he a small farmer if he has ten good sows and ten good cows?  I doubt it very much. Yet that remark was published in the paper for anyone to read.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are very pleased with the Minister for Agriculture.  He has done a great deal of good for the farmers in a short space of time.  As I have said outside the House, he has done more good in six months than Deputy Dillon did in six years or, indeed, in his lifetime.</P>
    <P>The question of supplies of milk to the creameries has been raised and it has been suggested that farmers should be encouraged to produce milk.  There <Col N="467" /> was not very much encouragement to do that a few years ago when the best price was 1/- per gallon.  How were the milk suppliers to exist in those circumstances?  That price was to obtain for a period of five years.</P>
    <P>Prices of cattle are very good.  Some people seem to think that they are nearly too good, that it would be better to have a slump so that the Government could be blamed.  I do not think that those people are serious who would attempt to criticise this Estimate, having regard to the big increases farmers have got.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a matter that is worrying me in connection with the greyhound industry which I understand comes under this Estimate.  Since Bord na gCon was established, the number of greyhounds has increased enormously.  This has brought about a situation which needs to be investigated.  In the old days, it was impossible to get a sufficient number of dogs to enter for the main competitions held throughout the country.  By having nominators, it was ensured that all these competitions were filled.  Now the position is that there are more dogs available to go into these competitions than there are nominators to nominate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that for the Irish Cup, for instance, for which the prize is £1,000, the nominator puts up £25 when he nominates the dog and, if the dog wins, collects £100 of that £1,000 prize.  This was fair enough but now I understand that a situation can arise, and has arisen, that owners trying to get nominations have been known to offer up to £500, plus the entry fee, <Col N="468" /> in order to get a nomination, so the system is open to abuse.  The matter was discussed in connection with the Bill which established Bord na gCon and I thought I would avail of this opportunity to speak briefly on it.</P>
    <P>One other thing is that the status of the trainers seems not to be the same as in horse racing.  It may be possible to consider whether these people can have a somewhat higher status.  I do not think there is anyone running about with a pocketful of dope.</P>
