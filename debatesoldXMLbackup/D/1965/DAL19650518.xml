      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the dates on which the retail price of bread was increased in the years 1961 and 1965; and the amount of the increase in each case.</P>

      <P>The only official data on retail prices available to the Central Statistics Office are those obtained at the Consumer Price Index Inquiries which relate to mid-February, mid-May, mid-August and mid-November each year.  A rise of 0.62d.  in the average price of the 2 lb. loaf was recorded between November, 1961, and February, 1962.  Information regarding the actual dates of any price changes is available to the Office only from statements in the public Press.  On 21 November, 1961, it was stated that an increase of ½d. on the 2 lb. loaf had <Col N="1418" /> come into effect on the previous day and on 23 April last it was announced that a similar increase would be applied by the bakers from 3 May, 1965.  This presumably will be reflected at the mid-May price inquiry.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us in each case the exact period that intervened between the increase and the date of the respective general elections? However, we will get the date of the application from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in due course.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any indication at this stage as to when decisions will be taken about the future of the Dublin city sections of the canals.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that CIE may not close a canal to navigation until the expiration of three years from the date on which it was last used for public navigation, and any change from this position would involve amending legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will adopt a policy in respect of employment in Government Departments whereby a percentage of clerical, semi-clerical and light manual posts will be reserved for persons suffering from limited physical incapacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some posts as telephonists in Government Departments in the Dublin area are reserved for blind persons but it is not contemplated, at present, reserving posts in any other grade for persons suffering from physical incapacity.</P>
      <P>A physical defect does not necessarily debar a person from appointment to the State service.  Persons who suffer from limited physical incapacity and who comply otherwise with the prescribed conditions may compete for positions in the clerical, semi-clerical and light manual grades of the Civil Service, and, in fact, a number of such persons have been appointed in the past.  The Civil Service Commissioners must, however, in the discharge of their functions, satisfy themselves that the physical incapacity is not likely to interfere with the proper discharge of the duties of the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that many disabled people, who are quite capable of doing the job satisfactorily, do not get the opportunity of obtaining such a job because of their apparent physical incapacity? Does he not agree there is an obligation upon the Government to see that steps are taken to help these people, at least to the extent or even half the extent they are helped in Britain, where the law requires every employer to give five per cent of his vacancies to disabled people?  In the light of that, will the Minister have another look at this matter because it has an urgency, as he must be aware?</P>

      <P>This is a rather complicated question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is a feeling in the Dáil that something should be done to help these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat, as is obvious in the answer to the question as tabled, that there is no exclusion of persons with physical disability. The only standard required is that the person with a physical disability must have the necessary capacity to fulfil the functions and duties of the office for which he applies.  There are several instances where people with physical disability are employed.  In <Col N="1421" /> the long run, the test of their ability must rest with the Chief Medical Officer, but, by and large, there is not any exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>But in practice the disabled person starts off handicapped even on appearances.  There is no question about that.  The Minister knows it as well as I do.  Something should be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say appearances do not count in the slightest in respect of the great mass of people who qualify for Civil Service posts. There are written examinations followed by an interview and usually an oral Irish examination and a medical examination.  Subject to the medical examination, if the person qualifies for the post and is able to fulfil the duties of the post, there is no exclusion.</P>

      <P>Expenditure from the Exchequer on social and ancillary services, including education, in the present financial year is estimated at £132 million to which should be added roughly £5¼ million for administration. The corresponding figures for 1957-58 were £78 million and £3 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The book referred to was detained by an officer of customs and excise, in accordance with subsection (1) of section 5 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, for reference to the Censorship Board for examination as it was, in his opinion, a book which ought to be examined by the Board under the Act.  The book has not, therefore, been seized <Col N="1422" /> by the customs authorities; they will be guided by the decision of the Board as soon as it is received.</P>

      <P>That would hardly be physically possible but under the subsection I have quoted, a customs officer may at any time, on the importation of a book, refer it to the Censorship Board.

      <P>I cannot give any general practice because the manner in which inspections are carried out is on a circular tour basis.  When the inspector is assigned to carry out inspections, he may make one inspection and then have to go on a circular tour to the next inspection.  That depends on the inspections at any particular time. It is not possible to say what would be regarded as undue delay without considering individual cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Public assistance authorities are required under statute to give such public assistance as appears necessary to poor persons who are unable by their own efforts or other lawful means to provide the necessaries of life for themselves or others whom they are legally bound to maintain.  It is not specifically laid down what types of income or what amount should be taken into consideration in assessing eligibility for public assistance, nor are the rates of assistance prescribed. It is for each local authority to determine what constitutes need and, <Col N="1437" /> beyond powers of general supervision, I am not empowered to intervene.  I am, in fact, expressly precluded from directing the giving of public assistance to any individual person.  It is not, of course, my intention that the increased payments to beneficiaries should be offset by corresponding reductions in home assistance allowances with the result that improvements made by the Oireachtas in the economic position of persons in receipt of social welfare payments would be largely nullified.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is a matter which can be left to the local authorities.  If it comes to my knowledge that any of them are not carrying out their responsibilities I will take the matter up with them.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann <Col N="1442" /> Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Exact information is not available in my Department as to the dates of erection of Army barracks in Dublin city and county.  The indications are that the oldest of them, Dún Uí Choileáin, dates from the early part of the eighteenth century.  Aeradróm Mhic Easmuinn in Dublin county dates from 1918 but the majority of the buildings now there were not begun before 1939.</P>
      <P>Particulars of the accommodation, acreage and present use are briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Dún Uí Choileáin has accommodation for 579 all ranks.  Including buildings it contains about 19 acres, and six units of Na Buan Óglaigh and five units of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with their stores and equipment are at present based there.</P>
      <P>(2)  Dún Chnoc an Arbhair has accommodation for 133 all ranks.  Including a church, married quarters, other buildings, a cemetery and the area of the 1916 Leaders' Graves, it contains about 19 acres, and one subunit of Na Buan Óglaigh is at present based there.</P>
      <P>(3)  Dún Mhic Fhlannchadha has accommodation for 408 all ranks.  Including buildings it contains about 13½ acres and four units of Na Buan Óglaigh and one unit of an Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil are at present based there.  In addition, it is the central depot for the ordnance equipment of Na Fórsaí Cosanta.</P>
      <P>(4)  Dún Mhic Aoidh has accommodation for 531 all ranks.  Including a church, the Army Equitation School and other buildings, it contains about 45 acres.  In addition to the Equitation School, five Army Directorates, the Army School of Cookery, the Army Canteen Board, four units of Na Buan Óglaigh and two units of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with their stores and equipment are at present based there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  Dún Chathal Brugha has accommodation for 1,101 all ranks.  Including a church, married quarters and other <Col N="1443" /> buildings, it contains about 50 acres, and five units of Na Buan Óglaigh, and one unit of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with their stores and equipment are at present based there.</P>
    <P>(6)  Dún Uí Ghríofa has accommodation for 254 all ranks.  Including buildings, it contains about eight acres and two units of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil are at present based there. About 75 per cent of the buildings are occupied by the Labour Court, some sections of Government Departments and, for the accommodation of homeless persons, the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
    <P>(7)  Aeradróm Mhic Easmuinn has accommodation for 366 all ranks.  Including a church, officers' married quarters, hangars and other buildings, runways, marginal areas and overruns, it contains about 572 acres.  It is the Headquarters of An tAer Chór and the Aer Chór Apprentice School is also located there.</P>
    <P>I do not appreciate what the Deputy has in mind when he refers to rationalisation in the context of Army barracks but he will be aware that the accommodation in barracks is being continually improved within the limits of the provision made in the Vote for Defence.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the location of troops regard must be had to peacetime as well as possible war-time functions.  Apart from that, a condition precedent to the closing of any Army barracks in Dublin would be the provision of alternative accommodation elsewhere for the personnel, and, as appropriate, their families, stores and equipment involved.  I am examining the position, but in view of the financial and service implications of any such step an early decision cannot be expected.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Garda authorities and there seems to be no evidence to bear out the Deputy's fears that there is an increasing threat of violence to the Gardaí in the discharge of their duties.  Since 1st January last, the number of assaults on Gardaí resulting in some injury or risk of injury was seven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the law, the position is that at present such an assault carries <Col N="1449" /> a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment. I do not agree that minimum penalties are desirable in principle and, in the present context, there seems to be no need for them in practice.  In recent times, at all events, the courts have consistently shown that they are alive to the fact that assaults on the Gardaí in the execution of their duty are serious crimes which threaten the security of the citizen and which merit, as a normal rule, a penalty which the offender will not forget.  In fact, the courts are, nowadays, giving prison sentences almost as a matter of course for any assault involving injury to a Garda on duty.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, the then Minister for Justice explained to this House the circumstances in which it was contemplated that legal aid might be granted and he made it clear that the legal aid scheme was of an experimental nature and that its continuance would depend on whether it could be operated within a reasonable cost to the State.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, in the course of my opening speech on the debate on my Department's Estimates, I stressed, at length, that the legal aid scheme must be exercised with due regard to the overall cost and that £20,000 had been allocated as the maximum expenditure in the present financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the question of subvention for small farms in support of which the Minister informs us a sum of £3.2 million is set aside in the Budget.  Coming from the west of Ireland, where the whole question of small farms is very much in evidence at the moment, I am anxious, as I am sure are all western Deputies, to know in whatever detail the Minister may be able to tell us the manner in which the £3.2 million is to be distributed under the various heads.</P>
      <P>I should like to know whether this extra sum of subvention will be governed by valuations, or whether it will go to congested areas as defined by legislation, or whether portion of it will go to small holdings under a certain valuation throughout the country in whatever part these holdings are situated, or whether the assistance will go towards drainage, towards reclamation, towards the provision of lime and fertilisers and such other means of assistance as can be given to such holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of lime and fertilisers, we are rapidly being driven to the conclusion, having regard to the almost annual demand by CIE for extra assistance, that our rail and road freight services are, to some measure at any rate, social services and I would be anxious that the Minister for Finance would take up the matter of freight charges with the Minister for Transport and Power.  I put down a question which the Ceann Comhairle very properly ruled out of order in this respect today, because the Minister for Transport and Power had no official responsibility in relation to State companies, that assistance is given to them in the fiscal provisions of the yearly Budget.  A Minister must be accountable to the Legislature which provides the money for the assistance of a State company and something will have to be done about that matter <Col N="1484" /> by some Government or some Minister in the years to come.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing and the credit available for housing, I think it will be accepted by everybody that a Budget Statement, if not the Budget itself, should be indicative of the stimulus and incentive to be provided in the coming year for the purpose of promoting financial and economic buoyancy generally.  There is reference in the Minister's statement to credit and to banking.  I do not think I am giving away any secrets when I say that I am told that, to a considerable extent, a credit squeeze is being operated by the banks.  It is something of which the Government, through the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, should take early cognisance.  Equally they should take early steps to see that there is an evenness in the distribution of credit obtaining all the year round or over a period of years.  In other words, lavish loans should not be available over one period and then a sudden curtailment involving as it does unemployment and a slowing up in commercial business generally and in industry, and particularly where we feel it most, in house purchase and house building.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that at present the building societies are not lending money and that for house purchase of any kind, either of a new house or a house already built, there is no money available from either banks or building societies.  That is something to which the Government should direct their minds at once and see to it that if the building societies, which have given considerable and valuable service over the years, are in any kind of difficulty, they will be helped over that difficulty by Government guarantee of some kind to some figure, so as to avoid the present holdup, particularly with regard to new houses for people starting married life.</P>
    <P>I want now to touch briefly upon the matter of education.  There is of course an increased amount in this Budget of about £1½ million and I think I am right in thinking that most of that will go towards salary increases. I might mention in passing, <Col N="1485" /> that, as a matter of policy, consistent with our ability to do so, I do not think that the teachers can be too highly paid.  Indeed they provide a service which is unique in the history of education.  They look after not alone the educational needs and the training of young people but after their spiritual needs as well.  One has only to attend a First Communion or Confirmation Day in any part of the country, be it in the city or country, to realise the great part played by our primary teachers.  Within that list of primary teachers, there is a large number of untrained teachers, untrained by reason of the fact, solely, that there was not accommodation to train them and they were within that group that narrowly missed the standard required to be called for training and that would be called if places were available. They give great service because they are for the most part placed in remote rural areas where they give a continuity, where they stay, and as such should have a very high place in the Minister's mind in the allocation of whatever increases are to be given. I make that special plea for the untrained teacher because as well as several other Deputies from country parts, I know their value and their worth and I know, apart from the fact that they are untrained, that their lack of training is made up, and indeed more than made up, by their dedication and sense of vocation.</P>
    <P>Education and health are the two spheres in which we must make greater strides and budgetary provisions should provide for such strides.  The whole scheme of health must be looked into. We must get rid of irritations.  We must provide very soon for a free choice of doctor and in all there should be a re-assessment of the situation in that regard.</P>
    <P>By and large, this Budget while it cannot be described as a harsh Budget, is nevertheless in certain aspects going to create difficulties.  I suppose there was not any Budget at any time that did not do that to a lesser or greater degree.  This Budget has been described as a social welfare Budget and I think that is a proper description.  It meets to some extent the demands made by <Col N="1486" /> us in the course of the election.  We will continue to make these demands so that for the life of this Dáil future Budgets will make their appropriate contribution towards the just society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget has rightly been described as a social welfare Budget.  The Parties opposite have claimed credit for forcing the Government into making certain decisions in regard to social welfare policy and have claimed responsibility for bringing about certain increases. In this competition for credit, Deputy James Tully said at col. 1165, Vol. 215 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Might I point out that the proposals of the Taoiseach and of Fine Gael were originally contained in the Labour Party programme and been there for quite some time?</P>
      <P>But even if they were borrowed by Fine Gael and then borrowed by Fianna Fáil, Fianna Fáil got the results for the people concerned. Looking back over the years, it has become apparent that social welfare improvements are accepted by Fine Gael and the Labour Party but not one single social welfare project was implemented by Fine Gael or Labour when they were in office.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to social welfare was a sorry one when in the hands of the Fine Gael-Labour group. Going back to the early stages, we find their first contribution was a reduction in the old age pension, and in the two periods of inter-Party Government, they gave two increases of 2/6 each, or 5/-, 10d. a year for the old age pensioners.  That was the combined contribution of Fine Gael and Labour when in office.  It will be noted that all the worthwhile improvements in social welfare over the years were the work of Fianna Fáil, the Unemployment Assistance Act, the Widows and Orphans Pensions Act, the Conditions of Employment Act, the Disablement Allowances Act, the Children's Allowances Act, holidays with pay and wet time insurance and contributory old age pensions.  Not a single scheme was implemented by the people who now profess to be the welfare Parties, Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> It is quite clear that those on the opposite benches are now cashing in on the approved policy of Fianna Fáil since they came into office in 1932. Theirs was a proud record and we can look forward with confidence while Fianna Fáil are in office to the system they brought into being and the improvements they brought about being continued in the future and further improved as the money becomes available as time goes on.  The previous speaker claimed the improvements were due to the demands of Fine Gael but I am sure nobody takes them seriously; at least during the election campaign they were not taken seriously.  The Labour Party have the same cry but it has been our approved policy since we came into office to improve the lot of the people and that policy will be pursued in the future.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about housing in Dublin.  The Minister for Local Government in the inter-Party Government indicated that they alone were responsible for having so many vacant houses available in 1957.  He gave a figure of about 1,600.  It is true that a considerable number of houses were available in 1957 but these were casual vacancies created because people had to leave the country.  These were broken homes, cases where not only one member but the whole family had to emigrate.  The building workers of the city and the country had to go and then Deputy O'Donnell claims credit because he had some 1,600 houses available.</P>
    <P>It is quite apparent that Fine Gael policy in Dublin is that the housing programme should be impeded.  It is obvious from recent meetings of Dublin Corporation that Fine Gael are trying to impede housing progress in the city.  Quite recently we had a meeting of Dublin City Council at which it was decided that a meeting of the whole house would be convened to discuss the question of central heating and its impact on rents in the new scheme at Ballymun as well as the question of native fuel as against imported fuel.  On that occasion not a single member of Fine Gael attended <Col N="1488" /> the meeting of the whole house.  They did not put forward one proposal. That indicates their outlook: they do not seem to be concerned about housing the people of Dublin.  Were they not concerned about the people going to live in Ballymun, about the impact on the rent of central heating?  But at two other meetings, one held after and one before&mdash;one was held only last night&mdash;to discuss cattle marts, Fine Gael were there in strength, an indication that they are more concerned about the comfort of cattle than the comfort of people.</P>
    <P>We in the Corporation know over a period that there is opposition within. It is a disgrace that the Ballymun scheme, because it is the brainchild of a Fianna Fáil Minister, should in any way be subject to an attempt to impede progress.  I hope that the Fine Gael Front Bench members who are here will inform their members in Dublin Corporation that they have a duty to attend these meetings to ensure there is no impediment to the building programme.  We heard a lot from Fine Gael speakers during the week; we know the salty tears they shed about housing: I am sure the cleaners had a terrible job mopping them up, but the facts are that the Fine Gael members do not attend the meetings.  I hope now that we shall have a substantial additional representation at the Corporation meetings so that we shall be able to implement plans put before that council.</P>
    <P>It was indicated during the Budget speeches that the Fine Gael Party were voting for certain increases because they said they alone were sufficient for the social welfare increased payments.  They opposed the increases for petrol and so on even though the money is required for items in addition to social welfare such as housing, education, agriculture and aids to industry.  Do Fine Gael consider these things are not necessary, that it is only necessary to give social welfare benefits?  We have a comprehensive policy covering all these items. The Labour Party voted for these items.  The Fine Gael Party indicated that they would support what they consider sufficient to cover welfare benefits; apparently the remainder was of no <Col N="1489" /> importance.  It is about time Fine Gael considered the other items for which extra money is being sought and had the courage to vote that money.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Flanagan the other night.  We have heard him condemning social benefits; he condemned the taxes on beer, spirits and cigarettes; he was not in favour of any of them but he had not the courage to vote against them.  One must have courage to do what one believes is right.  We heard Deputy Cosgrave indicating that in future we shall have a responsible Opposition.  It was unfortunate that a leader of a Party should have to say that.  We would hope that the Opposition would always be responsible. From the fact that he said this I am quite sure he will have some trouble with some members of his Front Bench.</P>
    <P>We heard much of the need for additional employment and of condemnation for Fianna Fáil because the targets they indicated some time ago were not reached.  It is possibly true that these targets were not reached. There, again, Fine Gael have accepted Fianna Fáil's policy and outlook in regard to employment because in the not-too-distant past a previous Minister in the inter-Party Government said:</P>
    <P>If it is said that the Government has failed to adopt effective means to find useful work for willing workers, I can only answer that it is no function of Government to provide work for anybody.</P>
    <P>That was reported at column 563, volume 9.</P>
    <P>I am glad they have now changed their tune and agree that it is the policy of the Government to find work for willing workers and I hope they will never make an effort to disrupt industry as it was disrupted in 1948 when the great project to produce heavy machinery, much of which is required to-day and is imported, had been proposed for my constituency and was ruthlessly sabotaged.  Willing workers who were to find work there instead found themselves on the emigrant ship just as members of Aer Lingus found themselves emigrating. It is quite an easy matter in Dublin <Col N="1490" /> to produce empty houses if we send the workers packing.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate state of affairs that the Labour Party on that occasion supported the Fine Gael Party in their efforts to destroy two vital industries.  It was lucky for this country that Fianna Fáil returned to power and re-established Aer Lingus, now firmly established in its continental and transatlantic routes, giving vast employment to a large number of people.  We hope this employment will continue and expand.  It is quite clear it can expand only under Fianna Fáil.  It is quite clear that the workers in Aer Lingus, the workers in the engineering industry, do not trust the Fine Gael Party.  That is the position in my constituency where an industry was so ruthlessly sabotaged.</P>
    <P>While the weaker section of the community has got some relief, there is still much ground to be made up. I have every confidence in the Minister that he will in time make good any defects there are in our social welfare system.  The Minister for Health has already given an indication that he will examine the health services to ensure that proper health services are available.  We are anxious in regard to health.  A further £1 million is being made available to ensure that the health of our people is adequately looked after.  We know that in the not-too-distant past it was on a question of health that one of the previous Governments fell asunder. We can be assured that the Minister, in common with the other members of the Government, will do all in his power to ensure that any defects in the health services will be completely eradicated in the near future.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to education and housing.  I trust the Fine Gael Party will adopt a more responsible attitude in the Dublin City Council on future occasions and that never again will a meeting of the council in session, that is, the Committee of the whole house, on which they have one-quarter of the representation, be without even one member of the Fine Gael Party.  If one member comes along he can indicate <Col N="1491" /> that he is speaking on behalf of the Party.  I suppose that in the course of the coming week we will hear every member of the Fine Gael group in the Corporation making a personal explanation as to the reasons for his non-attendance at the meeting to which I have already referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like previous speakers, would like to congratulate the Minister on this breakthrough in providing a substantial increase for the most needy of all sections in the country, those in the social welfare group.  I welcome his announcement.  My only regret is that it has come so late.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker has been endeavouring to accuse the Labour Party Deputies of claiming credit for forcing Fianna Fáil to give this concession. I have very grave doubts as to whether any individual Party can claim any credit at all for this substantial increase.  I would rather suggest that the public have been conditioned by newspaper leading articles, by a general declaration from leading people of all types throughout the country over the past year, that a general awakening has taken place over the past year, which was reflected in the general election results and that Fianna Fáil have very cleverly realised now that unless the warning given was accepted and unless this needy group was cared for they would not survive very long beyond the next general election.  Be that as it may, I welcome the increase and I congratulate the Minister for having the courage to introduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party, while making no claim to being a pressure group, have indicated for the past five years to the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance that he should introduce in his Budget taxation on cigarettes, on liquor, on luxury items, on entertainment, dances, films, horse-racing and various other types of taxation which, being indirect, are not ideal taxation from a Labour point of view and would probably increase the proportion of indirect taxation, but that the Labour Party, provided they were satisfied that the main <Col N="1492" /> income from such taxation would be devoted to the social welfare group, would give it their support.  I, on behalf of the Labour Party, have announced that at least five or six times in the House over the past five years.  It is still our view that if we had a Labour Minister for Finance, while we would give something of the same type of increase in benefit, we would not tax in the very same type of way.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party do not believe that indirect taxation is the proper type of taxation.  George Bernard Shaw in his book on modern socialism indicated that each time income tax was reduced and indirect taxation was increased that was conservatism.  That is what we are drifting to in Ireland. Apparently, we have the highest proportion of indirect taxation to direct taxation in Europe.  Unfortunately, in this case we were forced because of the need of the social welfare group to agree with the Minister but should the time come, as it will, please God, that a Labour Minister for Finance will be imposing taxes, we propose to inflict them in proportion to the ability of the people to pay and not per head of the people, as happens in the case of indirect taxation.  Our only regret in connection with the increase in social welfare payments is that it has come rather late but better late than never. We welcome it.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed that the Minister did not deal in a large manner with the health services.  The main remaining grievance in the country, so far as I can ascertain it, and certainly the main remaining grievance in my constituency, is in regard to the health services.  Everybody in the House knows the unhappy position that has gone on for the past three years.  At the beginning of the Seventeenth Dáil, the Government, by resolution of the House, were instructed to set up a Select Committee on the Health Services in order to secure views from all sides of the House as to required amendments.  Unhappily, for three years we laboured on without producing a single amendment.  The last nine months was the most important period of all.  During that period we did not <Col N="1493" /> have a single meeting of the Committee. It is true that we had subcommittee meetings to plan agendas but not one single meeting of the whole Select Committee was held for a period of nine months.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, gave as the reasons: (1) that there would be difficulty in getting a quorum; (2) that there would be no suitable accommodation in Dublin.  There was not a room to be found in Dublin for a meeting of 20 persons, notwithstanding that in the Department of Industry and Commerce in Kildare Street there are two or three empty conference rooms and that every hotel in Dublin provides an assembly hall free of charge in the daytime, which can be booked.  However, these were the reasons given by Deputy MacEntee, then Minister for Health, for the fact that the Select Committee did not meet.</P>
    <P>Those of us who were regular attenders know very well that if we had been called we would have attended and would have provided the Minister with a quorum and that, if he had acted on a motion which I had put forward on behalf of the Labour Party, we would have brought in recommendations prior to the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There are many things wrong with the existing health services.  The 1953 Act, which I and all members of my Party supported in this House, was an excellent advance on previous health services legislation.  Unfortunately, many of the good things in the 1953 Act were deprived of their strength by regulations made by the Minister.  To quote one instance: Under the 1953 Act it was arranged that any adult, that being a person over 16 years of age, with means of or below a prescribed amount, would be entitled to a medical card and by virtue of holding that medical card would be entitled to free medical services, free attendance from a medical doctor and free hospital and specialist examination.  By a regulation, which was never discussed in this House and which most of the Dáil Deputies did not even know about, the Minister altered that Act to mean that the individual members of a household, <Col N="1494" /> the father, mother, brothers and sisters, would have their earnings combined. It very often meant that when the wages of three people in a household were combined, five people were deprived of a medical card.  That is a ridiculous position.</P>
    <P>I know of people who go through their life enduring general infirmity because they lack money to call in a doctor and to pay not only for his services but for the medicines he may prescribe.  Because of this regulation, both boys and girls and, in many cases, husbands in a family have been deprived of medical cards to which they would normally be entitled under the 1953 Act.  Certainly there is need for, and I trust, as previous Fianna Fáil speakers seem to indicate, we shall have very soon, a Health Act which at least will provide for a free choice of doctor, where that is possible.  Unless that is provided, people will have to accept service from whoever happens to be the dispensary doctor.  Should he by any chance dislike the patient or the patient dislike him, or should any member of the patient's family have had a quarrel with the doctor in the past, it would create difficulty.  It would be much better to have a system based somewhat on the British system, having a panel of patients and giving the doctor a choice and the right to accept a particular number and giving the patients the right to choose the doctor in their area who, in their opinion, will give them the best service.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe there should be an all-out Health Act.  We believe that while people are able to work and to earn, they should pay a contribution towards a health services scheme.  We believe that the working people would be willing to contribute to such a scheme.  We also believe that all the people of the country should be compelled to contribute to a health services scheme so that if it is ever necessary for them to enter a hospital or to receive medical attention, they will be entitled to that automatically without this investigation of means which is so degrading and so time-wasting that it has spoiled the whole effect of the health services.</P>
    <P>It may well be said that voluntary <Col N="1495" /> health insurance is the answer to this problem.  I am aware that when Deputy O'Higgins was Minister for Health he introduced a voluntary health insurance scheme and that it was thought very highly of, but there is one flaw in that which I have found as an individual Deputy, that in regard to members of the voluntary health scheme who got family cover, when it came to renewal at the end of the year, if any member of that family had a serious illness and if that illness was likely to recur, that cover would not be granted by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  That cover is along the same lines&mdash;only it is much worse &mdash;as the cover by an insurance company for a car which was involved in an accident.</P>
    <P>It may be said that that is not so. I had such a complaint and I sent it forward to the then Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee.  He investigated the complaint and found that unfortunately the situation was so but he had no power to redress it.  If the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, a non-profit making body, refused to give cover, it was perfectly entitled to do it.  However, it is an unfortunate state of affairs that it does not cover a member of a family in the circumstances I have outlined, particularly in respect of hospital expenses which can be fairly crushing.  Only a short time ago I had experience of having to meet a bill for a period of hospitalisation where the charge was £2 19s. 6d. per day, apart from medical attention; this was only for maintenance and care in the hospital.  A charge of £2 19s. 6d. is a substantial one and I would suggest that irrespective of the contribution that had to be paid by a worker, he would be well satisfied to secure cover in order to avoid this problem and certainly to be independent of the degrading means test.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the Minister for Finance did not indicate what percentage increase will be granted to IRA medal holders in receipt of a special allowance.  On a number of occasions I have raised this question and I have just tabled a motion to be taken in <Col N="1496" /> Private Members' Time appealing for consideration for these IRA medal holders who through no fault of their own are now without means.  I realise that, provided their health is of such a standard that they are unable to carry out their normal employment, due to either their health or age, they will qualify for a certain amount but I regret to think that any old IRA men holding service medals and who have no means of any sort are unable to receive from this State, which they by their actions established, a sum of money that will keep them in ordinary frugal comfort.  Such medal holders should receive at least £5 per week. That is niggardly enough but it would show appreciation of their services to the country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a Deputy here or that there is anyone in the country who would denounce any Minister for Finance for including in his Budget a provision which would ensure that amount for these medal holders.  I would appeal to the Minister, if there is no percentage fixed for these people, to increase the allowance. The figure involved would be dwindling each year because, in the way of things, due to age, these people, as they must be, having taken part in the Troubles between 1919 and 1921, will be gradually dying away.  Eventually the sum involved would disappear completely, but, in the meantime, the Minister would have the satisfaction of knowing that those who deserved most from this country will have got at least some compensation for the work they have done.</P>
    <P>It has amused me on occasions to listen to Ministers on radio and television and to read in the newspapers, in particular, their remarks in regard to the Opposition.  Who are the Opposition in this House?  It would appear as if the Ministers, on the one hand, and the radio, television and the newspapers, on the other, all felt that the Labour Party and Fine Gael were one and the same Party. It is true that we are both in opposition to the Government, but we are not the Opposition.  There is, if you like, the main Opposition and the second Opposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> One of the reasons I draw attention to this is that the television experts, &ldquo;Hurlers on the Ditch,&rdquo; indicated that the Opposition were now becoming calmer and beginning to accept their responsibilities and not so inclined to throw mud or go back over the historic past.  I believe that the main reason why they took that view is that they confuse Fine Gael with Fianna Fáil.  There is nothing now between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael except the Civil War.  The effects of that Civil War are slowly fading away and I can well believe, with the Hurlers on the Ditch, that they will ultimately come together.  The Labour Party will then be the Opposition.  We shall find it very difficult certainly to agree with the views of either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael on most of the economic matters in the life of the country.  We shall equally find it difficult to agree with them in relation to most of the social problems.  But, whenever we can agree, our opposition will be constructive. If we are satisfied something is being done in the interests of the people, we will certainly give it the full support of the Labour Movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>After the three or four day discussion that has taken place on this Budget, I suppose neither the Minister nor the Deputies sitting behind him are now feeling so complacent about the budgetary provisions. I would suggest to the Minister and to the Deputies sitting behind him that they should not feel complacement about the measure of support accorded to the Budget from these benches.  We supported certain provisions in the Budget.  We welcome those provisions and we have agreed to the taxation the Government claim is necessary to finance those provisions. We have done that because these particular provisions are, in our view, in line with the policy of a just society which we advocated during the general election and which we will continue to advocate.  I refer to the policy which was castigated, condemned and derided by members of the Government and, in particular, by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the particular provisions to which I refer in the Budget, it is true to say, I think, that the Taoiseach, <Col N="1498" /> his Minister for Finance and the Deputies supporting them must parade now in the role of reluctant witnesses to the worth and the value of the policy they were outbidding one another to condemn just a few weeks ago. The Government are entitled to say&mdash; without any background information, I am certainly not in a position to contradict them&mdash;that whether or not there was a general election they would have introduced these provisions.  My own view is that, were it not for the general election, and were it not for the policies advocated by the Fine Gael Party in particular, the Government would not have introduced a Budget of this sort.</P>
    <P>It is true, I think, and it is recognised by all Parties, that the Fine Gael Party did succeed during the general election in fully awakening the social conscience of our people.  We directed the attention of the electorate in a very emphatic way to the social needs of different sections of our people and it became clear before the election was over that no Government&mdash;it did not matter what Government were elected &mdash;elected as a result of that general election could afford to ignore the many deficiencies in our society to which the Fine Gael policy had pointed in the course of the election campaign.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Finance has posed the query: Why, if the electorate supported the Fine Gael policy, did Fianna Fáil win?  That is a fair question and I propose to give very briefly now my interpretation as to how and why Fianna Fáil won the election, believing, as I do, that the majority of the electorate fully accepted and recognised the value of the policies we put before them during the election campaign.  I believe Fianna Fáil won the election and are in government today because their spokesmen and again, in particular, the Taoiseach, made very effective use of that most fraudulent of arguments in a parliamentary democracy, namely, the argument that, because Fianna Fáil were the biggest Party going into the election, there could not be any other Government except a Fianna Fáil Government, and, if the people voted against the Fianna Fáil candidates, they would, in effect, be voting for <Col N="1499" /> chaos and instability.  That argument is, I believe, quite fraudulent.  But I concede it was a most effective argument. It was a damnably effective argument in the election and I believe that many people who sincerely wanted a change of Government, and who still want a change of Government, voted for no change because they were affected by that argument, some because they were gullible, others because they were, perhaps, politically cowardly, and still others because they felt they had a vested interest in the continuance of a Fianna Fáil Government in office.</P>
    <P>I want briefly to examine that argument. Neither the Minister nor the Deputies behind him will deny it was the one argument made consistently by the Taoiseach and other Fianna Fáil spokesmen during the course of the general election.  To whom was that argument directed?  It was not directed to those hardened Fianna Fáil campaigners working for that Party; it was not directed to well-wishers of the Fianna Fáil Party, who would vote Fianna Fáil in any event.  Obviously it was directed to those who did not want a Fianna Fáil Government; and the measure of the Taoiseach's success &mdash;politically, he is entitled to all credit for it&mdash;is the fact that he has succeeded in forming a Government, gaining seats by getting the votes of people who did not want a Fianna Fáil Government. That was the logical result of the effectiveness of that argument, an argument which is, in any parliamentary democracy, a particularly fraudulent argument.</P>
    <P>There was never, of course, any substance in the suggestion that in a country of this kind, operating a parliamentary democracy, one could not have any Government but a Fianna Fáil Government.  People thinking of the position of the man who was making these statements, the responsible position he occupied, and the responsible positions which the outgoing Ministers occupied, Ministers who were making similar arguments, and people who did not think too deeply were obviously impressed by that sort of argument.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> In the general election, there was another eve of the poll manoeuvre.  I want to say at the outset that I acquit the Fianna Fáil Party of deliberately applying these tactics, but I am sorry no member of Fianna Fáil, particularly in Donegal, took the opportunity of repudiating them.  A few days before the election, to be precise, on 4th April, the Fianna Fáil Party newspaper, the <i>Irish Press</i>, carried, coupled with a report from the Minister for Local Government, a statement issued to the electorate by a councillor in Donegal.  I do not like mentioning in this House the names of people who are not in a position to reply to me, but, rather than leave the position that I might be referring to any number of councillors in Donegal, I propose reading in full this cutting from the <i>Irish Press</i> of Tuesday, 4th April.</P>

      <P>However, I have indicated to some extent my views on the subject.  I would have liked to have taken this opportunity, which would seem to me to be an appropriate one, of dealing with that particular point.  Since the Chair has decided it is not in order, I must in the circumstances leave it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party have supported the social welfare provisions in this Budget.  We supported the taxation necessary to raise the money which the Government claim is necessary for those provisions.  We have been critical&mdash;and, I think, rightly critical&mdash; of the many omissions from the Budget.  There is nothing in it to bridge the gap, or even narrow the gap, between agricultural living standards and the standards enjoyed by <Col N="1502" /> other sections of the community.  Part of the policy for a just society, which the Fianna Fáil spokesmen condemned and derided during the general election, dealt with the question of agricultural living standards <i>vis-à-vis</i> the living standards of those engaged in industry, the professions and other non-agricultural occupations.</P>
    <P>We believe every necessary encouragement should be given to the proper development of essential facilities in rural areas.  That indeed is one of the principles upon which the Fine Gael policy is based.  That particular principle is certainly supported by very good authority.  It is supported by the famous Encyclical Letter, Mater et Magistra, of the late, much-beloved Pope John XXIII.  What have the Government done in this Budget to assist the attaining of that objective of bringing the living standards of the agricultural community somewhat nearer to those enjoyed by workers in other occupations?</P>
    <P>The most effective comment on the failure of the Government to do anything in that direction is the comment of the National Farmers Association, which term this Budget, as far as they and those they represent are concerned, as the great betrayal.  A cutting from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 12th May, 1965, reads:</P>
    <P>The National Farmers Association said last night that the 1965 Budget would &ldquo;go down in history as `the great betrayal'.&rdquo;  It had made no effort to close the gap between urban and rural incomes and had actually reversed that process by stretching the tax net to include a few farmers who sold produce directly to the consumer from their own farms.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the NFA spokesman responsible for that statement for feeling disillusioned and disgusted with the Fianna Fáil Government's failure to do anything in this Budget to narrow that gap, particularly having regard to a statement made just a few months ago by the Minister for Agriculture, when speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Dublin Institute of Catholic Sociology <Col N="1503" /> Debating Society.  He was reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 23rd November last in these words:</P>
    <P>Our national objectives in agriculture must be of a very broad and comprehensive nature.  We must increase farmers' incomes by every means available to us.  This problem can be attacked on a broad front. Better prices for agricultural products can be achieved in various ways, output can be increased by the application of better methods and techniques and the eradication of diseases and pests.  Every possible method of supplementing farm incomes by the addition of new lines to the traditional ones must be explored.  The problem was particularly urgent in the case of the small family farm, a majority of which did not provide those who lived and worked on them anything like a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the Minister is reported to have said:</P>
    <P>To have a community in which social justice prevails, we cannot contemplate a permanent state of affairs where one substantial sector of our people lags far behind in living standards.</P>
    <P>The gist of the NFA complaint against the Minister's Budget is that he has done nothing whatever to relieve that situation, that he has done nothing whatever to live up to the target which was set by the Minister for Agriculture when talking a few months ago before the Budget was introduced.  We are entitled to criticise the Minister on that score and to express the hope that, having decided that portion of the policy for a just society, which was derided and condemned during the general election, was to be implemented, this time next year he will decide to implement a little more of it with regard to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in connection with estate duty.  The Minister, in his Budget, has fiddled about a bit with the estate duty provisions. A small relief was given <Col N="1504" /> on the one hand and then, on the other, there are provisions for a general tightening up to try to squeeze some more money out of the estates of persons.  I want to say quite frankly that I do not think there is anything fresh in this.  There is nothing fresh or dynamic in that kind of approach. During the course of the general election we were promised that we were to have only the youngest men in the most forward-looking Government in Europe.  There is nothing forward-looking or progressive about the Minister's approach to the estate duty provisions as outlined by him in his Budget speech.</P>
    <P>I believe it is true to say that the estate duty system is part and parcel of a taxation system in this country which has flourished piecemeal over the years.  I believe the time has come when there should be some kind of fresh thinking generally with regard to the question of estate duty as a method of taxation, as a method of raising money for the Revenue.  I hope the Minister will agree with me when I say that there is at least a statable case for the complete abolition of estate duty.  I think I am correct in saying that the origin of estate duty was to prevent the accumulation of too much wealth in too few hands.  I do not believe that problem exists in this country in that way today.</P>
    <P>Estate duty is a taxation system which probably would achieve the objective to some extent, in the old days, of preventing the building up of great wealth, too much wealth in too few hands.  That is hardly a problem which we are facing today.  The whole state of affairs here has changed since the estate duty system was first introduced. I should imagine, by and large, that a landed estate here of anything you like, 100, 300 or 400 acres, would be regarded as very large but it is not the type of estate against which it is necessary to take taxation measures.</P>
    <P>Estate duty taxation has many drawbacks. It is uncertain.  It is haphazard in its incidence and a source of uncertainty in that it depends, not so much on the wealth of the estate as on the number of deaths which take place in <Col N="1505" /> any given period in any given family. I could appreciate if we were thinking in terms of a country with vast ranches, vast estates, either landed estates or property of any other description that the need which motivated the estate duty legislation in the early days might still have validity.  I doubt very much if, nowadays, there is anything like the same force of argument for the levying of death duties on estates in this country.  I concede the argument that our death duty rates here are on an average lower than those in Northern Ireland or England but they still hold terror for many people in this country.</P>
    <P>Under the estate duty system you can still come across cases, not infrequently, where farms or the major shareholdings, for example, in a limited company&mdash;the asset producing the income for the survivors, the man's widow or his children&mdash;have to be sold off to meet the demands on an estate in the form of death duties.  It is undesirable in a country of this sort with a large agricultural community that property should be taxed in that way, a way which is often uncertain and often unfair and inequitable.  Instead of what I have described as a bit of fiddling around with the estate duty provisions, if there is to be any dynamism, if there is to be any progress or thought in this matter, then the Government, who are being held out to us as young and forward-looking should do something about this.  It would be well worth while if the Minister for Finance made a searching inquiry into the whole question of estate and death duties in an endeavour to arrive at some alternative method of raising the money which would be fairer and cause less hardship, in the long run.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions that the Minister has made in this Budget is to extend from three to five years the period for which a person must live after giving a gift, if estate duty is to be avoided.  I want to make a special point to the Minister on that.  I do not know for how long, but certainly for a very great number of years, the three-year period has been in operation: that is the period that was well known for years back to everyone. <Col N="1506" /> Many people have made provision, relying on the continued existence of the three-year period.  Now, that is suddenly nearly doubled: it is changed from three to five years.</P>
    <P>I would suggest seriously to the Minister that at least in those cases where provision was made by parting with land, property or assets of one description or another, before these Budget provisions were announced, the three-year period should be allowed to ride and that the five-year period should apply only in cases of dispositions made after the Minister made his Budget Statement here on 11th instant.  If the Minister agrees to that suggestion, he will meet the wishes of quite a number of people in this country and not to meet those wishes may very well impose a great hardship on them.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been dealt with already, particularly by Deputy Sweetman, is the question of housing credit.  I just want to emphasise the importance of that subject and the urgency of having it dealt with effectively from the point of view of many house-purchasers throughout the country today.  I do not want to go in any great detail into the existing position. The Minister is familiar with it. Deputy Sweetman, in the course of his remarks on this Budget, dealt with it and put on the records of this House at least one very effective quotation which the Minister would do well to study.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note that, in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of last Sunday, 16th May, 1965, it was at least acknowledged that this problem exists.  In an article by the Economics Correspondent of that paper, headed &ldquo;State May Advance Loans for Housing,&rdquo; this was said:</P>
    <P>A tightening on loans for dwelling houses for the middle and upper income groups by building societies may induce the Government to take a more active interest in the granting of loans for such houses.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has had any complaints in that regard.  If he <Col N="1507" /> has not, I suggest it is a matter to which he should give his urgent attention without delay.</P>
    <P>Generally, on the question of housing policy, I should like to refer also to the question of stamp duties on house purchases.  The Minister for Justice recently has been indicating that he is in rather a critical mood so far as legal costs are concerned.  I think many Deputies who have read the remarks of the Minister for Justice and, indeed, have read or heard remarks made from time to time in this House with regard to legal costs, may overlook the fact that, in any dealing with property in this country, the Government take a pretty good whack and that what appear to be very high costs charged by a solicitor include the stamp duty that has to be paid on the transfer of property.  It includes, in other words, the State's share of the money.  So far as the solicitor is concerned, and so far as the client is concerned, that is simply dead money.  It is money that simply has to be paid for the stamp duty on these transactions.  In conveyancing transactions, the State in this country certainly mulcts the purchaser to a far greater extent than is done by our neighbours across the water in England or Scotland and certainly to a far greater extent, too, than is done in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>It might be of interest to examine just what the situation is and what share the State takes here when property changes hands.  If a house is bought anywhere in the Twenty-six Counties for a sum of £700, then £7 has to be paid in stamp duty.  In a similar transaction in the Six Counties or in England, no stamp duty whatever has to be paid.</P>
    <P>On a purchase price of £1,000, stamp duty of £10 has to be paid here. Again, there is no stamp duty whatever in England or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On a purchase price of £1,500, we have to pay stamp duty of £30.  Again, nothing whatever has to be paid in the North or in England.</P>
    <P>On a purchase price of £2,000, stamp duty amounting to £50 has to be paid here and, again, nothing whatever <Col N="1508" /> has to be paid by means of stamp duty in the North or in England.</P>
    <P>So it is, up along the line.  If we take a case of a purchase price of £4,000 in this country, the stamp duty payable is £120.  Nothing whatever has to be paid in the North and nothing whatever has to be paid in England or in Scotland.</P>
    <P>On a purchase price of £4,500, a sum of £135 has to be paid in stamp duty here.  Nothing has to be paid in the North and nothing has to be paid in England or Scotland.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty does not become payable at all in the North of Ireland or in England unless the purchase price of a house exceeds £4,500.  Even after that, when stamp duty does become payable, it is on a much smaller scale than here.  We can have cases in this country where £135 has to be paid in stamp duty on a single transaction while there is no stamp duty at all chargeable in similar circumstances in the North or in England.</P>
    <P>On a purchase of £4,600, stamp duty is payable in the North or in England amounting to £23.  Here, the State demands that there be paid by means of stamp duty for similar transactions a sum of £138.  On the £5,000 mark, only £25 has to be paid in stamp duty in the North or in England; here we demand stamp duty at £150.  If you move up to the £6,000 bracket, the purchaser has to pay £180 in stamp duty as well as the purchase price of the house.  In the North or in England, all they have to pay in stamp duty for a £6,000 transaction is a sum of £30. So, when the Minister for Justice talks about legal costs, it is as well that Deputies should know where the money is going, or where a great share of it is going in regard to conveyancing matters.  If the Government want to make an effort to do something about speculative housing as distinct from local authority or State housing, one very definite contribution they could make is to lower substantially the stamp duty rates which are now applicable and which, as the Minister will see from the figures I have given, are so very much higher than are <Col N="1509" /> applied either in the North or in England.</P>
    <P>I should like before finishing to say a few words in connection with rates. The Taoiseach indicated in the course of his speech on the Budget, and, I think, earlier, too, that the Government were at least thinking about this problem. At any rate, they are nibbling at the problem.  I should like to express the view that nibbling at a problem of such dimensions as the rates problem is certainly not enough.  If the Government are serious in their efforts to do something about this problem, they will have to do something fairly drastic. They will have to overhaul the entire local taxation system.</P>
    <P>On 14th March, 1956, the present Minister for Health, then Deputy O'Malley, spoke in this House regarding the rates problem.  He went on record then by asserting that the people cannot pay any more in rates.  That was nine years ago, just a year before Fianna Fáil were re-elected as the Government of this country.  What has happened in the nine years that have passed since then?  The rates have been going up and up steadily every year.  I wonder is there a single example of the rates coming down in any part of the country in the past nine years. They have gone up again this year.  It has become a cliché to say that the rates are a crippling burden on the backs of the people.</P>
    <P>This Budget, apart from the reference of the Taoiseach, does not hold out any hope of relief for the people so far as the rates are concerned.  It does not hold out any relief for the farming community who very often are the hardest hit people in this regard.  I am glad to know examination is being made of the subject and I hope the Government, when the position is being examined, will not feel content simply to take the existing local taxation system as it is and suggest this or that small alteration, adjustment or amendment to it.  I hope at least they will keep an open mind on the necessity for a complete overhaul of the system, and get away completely from the present system of local taxation.</P>
    <P>In so far as the rates consist of <Col N="1510" /> charges for the servicing of premises, in the form of public lighting, roads, refuse collection or anything of that sort, there does seem to be a logical reason why the rates should be connected with the size and the value of the premises.  But, nowadays, every one of us know that the charges which go to make the total of the rates are by no means confined to charges which go into the servicing of particular premises or into the servicing of a neighbourhood.  There are many other items such as, for example, the health charges which have nothing to do with the size of premises or market value of them.  In regard to the other services, roads, public lighting, and so on, it can be suggested that the householder or the occupier is getting some personal or definite benefit from the rates and there does seem to be a reason that he should be the person responsible for the payment of the rates as he owns or occupies the premises.  That to my mind is not at all true with regard to charges such as health charges which are included in rates.</P>
    <P>At least a case can be made that the individuals who are benefiting from these charges, rather than the single person who is the householder or rated occupier, should also pay something towards the financing of these other services.  I know they pay in their capacity as taxpayers when the charge is partly on the State and partly on the rates.  It is a big question and one which should be examined.  I believe the British Minister of Housing has indicated that he would regard something in the form of a local income tax system as preferable to the rating system existing in England at the moment but he feels that administratively it would be impossible to carry out.  I do not know whether or not a suggestion on those lines would be workable in this country.  At least it is the kind of thing that should be examined by the Government in any review they make on the question of rates.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more I want to say in connection with the Budget except to renew the appeal made to <Col N="1511" /> the Government by Deputy Cosgrave and others.  The benefits conferred by the Budget should not be whittled away by local authorities reducing home assistance in relation to people who will now get an increase in pensions.  I should like also to ask the Minister in future Budgets to try to get away from pennypinching devices by taxing the social welfare recipients now and postponing their benefits until later on.  It is too late for the Minister to do this in the present Budget.  I do not know whether the reason for that particular device, which certainly has the appearance of being merely a pennypinching one, is administrative or not. If it is administrative, I would suggest to the Minister that it is an administrative reform which should be undertaken by him during his term of office.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to advert to a point already made from these benches which I think should be repeated. The taxation imposed by the Government in this Budget shows how shallow were the arguments made from the Fianna Fáil benches in 1963, in support of the turnover tax.  We were told in those days by the Taoiseach, and others who were advocating the imposition of the turnover tax at that time, that the ordinary sources of taxation to which we were accustomed &mdash;beer, tobacco, spirits, petrol, and so on&mdash;were drying up as sources of revenue, and could not be taxed any more, that if we taxed them any more, the money would not be forthcoming, and that it was essential if this country was to be saved, that we should have the turnover tax.  That was in 1963.</P>
    <P>I want to quote now from the Official Report of 24th April, 1963. The Minister for Social Welfare said:</P>
    <P>Tax on any of the traditional items such as tobacco, beer or spirits is scarcely justifiable because these things are not necessaries, but they are so widely consumed that they almost rank as necessaries.  It is an undoubted fact that such taxes do not favour the lower paid workers to the same extent as income tax or the turnover tax <Col N="1512" /> because, as I said, there is many a man on a low income who spends more than very wealthy people on these items, of his own choice no doubt, but some people find it hard to change their habits.</P>
    <P>At column 303 of the same volume, the Taoiseach said in his own dogmatic way:</P>
    <P>It is clear that the old Budget stand-bys, tobacco, beer and spirits and petrol, will no longer suffice to sustain this policy.  Indeed it is now fairly obvious that higher tax rates upon these commodities would not yield higher revenue in the same degree.  That is the case for extending the range of the expenditure taxes by the introduction of a new system.</P>
    <P>It is now quite clear, two years later, having suffered two further Budgets&mdash; suffered so far as these commodities are concerned at any rate&mdash;in which these commodities were taxed, that all that argument was shallow, that all that argument has, in fact, proved to be wrong, and that the damage which we in the Fine Gael Party said would be done by the imposition of the turnover tax has been done.  Having done that damage, the Government have not been able to retrieve the position, and have gone back to what the Taoiseach referred to as the &ldquo;old Budget standbys&rdquo; to get the further money they need.</P>
    <P>Before sitting down, I think I should &mdash;and I do sincerely&mdash;compliment the Minister on his appointment.  Whatever we may say about the policies which he as the representative of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Department of Finance may follow, I think all of us on these benches have found the Minister to be a very reasonable and courteous person either to argue with or make representations to.  I hope that in any future Budgets which he may introduce he will continue to peruse the Fine Gael policy for a just society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South Central</i>): It is my intention to be very brief in my remarks.  First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I have no doubt that he will be as successful in this Ministry <Col N="1513" /> as he was in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Indeed, the office of Minister for Finance is an unenviable task, particularly at Budget time.  There has been no shortage of views during the past few days on what should be done in the Budget.  There were plenty of suggestions as to where money should be spent and the need for expenditure, but unfortunately there was no suggestion as to how it was to be found.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of the Minister for Finance to apportion the amount of money at his disposal in a just manner. I think on this occasion the Minister is to be congratulated on the way in which he has apportioned that money and on the small amount of taxation he has inflicted on the public.  It is generally agreed by all that the social services deserve an equal portion of the national wealth and, indeed, it is encouraging to see the old age pensioners getting such a substantial increase this year.  The increase was in no way related to the cost of living.  It represents three and a half times the increase in the cost of living since last year.  It is, indeed, my hope, and I have no doubt the hope of everyone in the House, that these increases can and will continue to be given.  Of course we can give these increases only if our national economy continues to expand, and I believe it will.  Our economy to-day is very soundly based, and with proper guidance and administration, I have no doubt that the targets in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will be achieved.  With this progress, so also will the social services be improved.  This year alone, £5.7 million was given to the social services.</P>
      <P>I should like now to refer to the tourist industry.  It is particularly pleasing to know that income from this section of our industry is continually mounting, and that last year we had an income of £58.8 million from tourism. That is an encouraging factor, and I believe the target of £90 million set for 1970 will be achieved.  There are many aspects of tourism which have yet to be set right.  There are many resorts throughout the country which have not yet been geared to full capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Catering and drinking facilities play a major part in our tourist industry. There is one aspect, especially in rural Ireland, in which I think the amenities which the tourist demands are lacking. I am referring to the licensed trade. The standard there is not at all in keeping with the standard in other sectors of the tourist industry.  Of course this is entirely due to the fact that there are far too many licences in Ireland.  I suggest that the Minister should provide some fund within the Department whereby many licences could be rendered redundant.  I do not for a moment suggest that this fund would be provided out of the Exchequer.  My suggestion is that it should be paid for by the licensed trade throughout the country.  At the moment there are roughly 12,000 licences in the Republic and if the licence fee were increased from £4 to £6, the receipts would be at the rate of £72,000 a year.  This, over five years, would amount to nearly half a million pounds and would provide the fund wherewith to reduce the number of licences by ten per cent, leaving a reasonable standard of living for the remainder who could then set about modernising their premises and providing up-to-date hygiene facilities, to the benefit of the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>One more point I should like to mention is the method of taxation.  I suggest that other avenues should be explored.  I do not suggest, of course, that beer and cigarettes should be totally exempt but today a substantial proportion of our young people are earning quite substantial wages and neither drink nor smoke.  The Minister could investigate where they spend their money and see whether a new source of revenue could be opened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South Central</i>): Precisely.  Thank you.  I suggest that the Minister investigate this aspect where, I feel sure, he will find another source of revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is still in this country, notwithstanding <Col N="1515" /> the number of publications we have had in recent years, a great deal of misunderstanding about our economic and financial problems.  I think this misunderstanding is contributed to, sometimes deliberately, by the Government through lack of candour in making known the basic economic and financial facts of the country and sometimes by a deliberate failure to inform the public of the realities of the economic life of this country.  I should like to pick up a phrase used by the Minister in his Budget speech as indicating what I have in mind.  Having reviewed the economic situation, he said:</P>
      <P>These must be our guiding lines in budgetary and credit management.</P>
      <P>I should be obliged if he would inform us what he means by credit management.  Management of credit by whom?  Is it by the Government or by the Central Bank?  If it is being suggested there is to be credit management by the Government through the medium of the Central Bank, would the Minister inform us what weapons the Government have or what weapons the Central Bank has?  This is a matter of some importance and some moment because we were criticised very severely during the general election campaign, and I have no doubt it affected some votes, for the proposals we put forward by means of which we proposed to bring about a system by which the level of credit would be under the control of the Central Bank and ultimately under the control of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the use of phrases such as this that misleads the people.  It is the suggestion&mdash;I shall deal with it where it occurs elsewhere in the Government's economic programme&mdash;that we can do things when we cannot do them that in fact is ultimately damaging. This Government have in fact been operating under what is an extraordinary monetary system&mdash;extraordinary in the strictest meaning of the word&mdash;because I do not think its like is to be found in any other country in the world.  They have been working <Col N="1516" /> under a principle announced in the document <i>Economic Development</i>, produced under the auspices of the Government in 1958.  Reference is made in it to banking and the monetary programme and at page 27 it is stated:</P>
    <P>Experience and expert opinion confirm that, in relation to deposits within Ireland, a net external assets ratio of 30 per cent represents no more than a &ldquo;minimum safe level&rdquo; for the commercial banks as a whole. In practice, the ratio may vary for individual banks because, e.g., of variations in the proportion of their current to deposit accounts.</P>
    <P>The banks should use increases in their resources to expand their domestic advances and investments if there is an unsatisfied demand for credit for productive purposes, rather than to build up a global external reserve ratio in excess of 30 per cent. Interest-bearing balances with the Central Bank would rank as the equivalent of external reserves in assessing this ratio.  On the other hand, if the ratio tends to fall below 30 per cent a tightening of bank credit must be expected and must be accepted as a corrective to the balance of payments drain which is causing the fall in liquid assets.  It must not be forgotten that fluctuations in our balance of payments can, as experience teaches, be both sudden and severe and that the reserves of the commercial banks are exposed to the first impact of such fluctuations.</P>
    <P>A footnote states:</P>
    <P>Fluctuations within, say, 27-33 per cent might be regarded as normal and those outside that range as requiring corrective action.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report for that year underlined in very clear terms what was involved in this policy because it stated very clearly that the link between the commercial banks' holdings of external assets and the amount of credit they could extend was direct and inevitable.</P>
    <P>This Government, by this policy which has been adumbrated in this document, in fact propose to operate a policy akin to the old gold standard <Col N="1517" /> which most countries got rid of more than 30 years ago.  One of the principal aims and objects of our policy was to try to get this country away from a system which is analogous to the gold standard.  It has been the object of monetary authorities throughout the world to try to insulate, in so far as they can, the credit policies of commercial banks from fluctuations of one sort or another in the balance of payments, and under the gold system where gold flowed out if there were deficits and flowed in if there were surpluses, this was not possible.  The Central Bank's words in 1958 were to the effect that most countries thought it desirable to get away from this system.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Central Bank means there is a direct and inevitable flow from the change in the external assets of the commercial banks and their credit policies.  We did not suggest the credit policies of our banks could be carried out without regard to the balance of payments or that the national interest might involve a restriction in bank credit.  What we did suggest was that the system which is enshrined in this document, produced by the Government, that there would be an automatic relationship between the net external assets of the bank and the availability of bank credit was a bad system and we proposed it should be changed.  The extraordinary thing that has occured, however, is that the Government have not in fact operated their policies.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that it was suggested this ratio of 30 per cent between net external assets and deposits in the commercial banks was to be sacrosanct. In the footnote it was suggested that a margin of 27 per cent to 33 per cent would be permitted.  In fact this ratio has not been kept, and although it is stated in the Government publication, and although it was given the benediction of the Central Bank in 1958, the ratio of net external assets to domestic deposits has gone below the so-called danger figure of 27 per cent in <i>Economic Development</i>.  In March, 1963, it was down to 28 per cent and in March, 1964, to 25 per <Col N="1518" /> cent.  In the quarterly bulletin of the Central Bank, which was produced a couple of days ago, an interesting exercise is carried out as to the monetary consequences in this country of, amongst other conditions, a prospective decline of £10 million in our deficit in the balance of payments this year. An exercise of considerable worth and interest is carried out by expert economists in the Central Bank in this regard. What is of interest and of significance, however, is that this ratio, which was enshrined in this earlier document in such very vivid phrases, even assuming an improved balance of payments this year of £10 million on last year, is to decline to 22.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>We drew attention to these facts in our policy document.  I do not suggest for a moment that the facts and figures I have given are the sort of facts and figures to cause great excitement at chapel gate meetings or public meetings during an election campaign.  It is proper that we should draw attention to what is behind the financial policy which we were suggesting, in the last election, would be the correct one because we were criticised and I say&mdash;and say it with all due regard to the choice of words&mdash;that we were criticised dishonestly by the Taoiseach and by the Tánaiste for our proposals.  I repeat that their criticisms were dishonest because they should know the realities of our banking situation here.  The Tánaiste went around and said that our suggestions were in fact going to put the hands of the Government in the banks and might endanger the savings of the people.  The Taoiseach repeated this on two occasions.  For what it is worth, it might be of some interest to the Minister and the Taoiseach to know that the criticism which he made to some extent boomeranged because people in responsible positions realised it was most irresponsible for a Taoiseach to make statements such as that.</P>
    <P>In fact our proposals are of a highly technical nature.  We tried to point out a fact which is undoubtedly true, that the policy which the Government suggested was (a) a bad one and a type of policy rejected 30 years ago in most other countries and (b) a policy which <Col N="1519" /> they had dropped without putting anything in its place.  We in this country are very subject to thinking and to theories which come from our neighbour across the waters and one of the difficulties we have to get away from the ideas that become current and popular in Great Britain. One of our difficulties also is that the literature on such subjects as banking mainly comes from Great Britain and not sufficient attention is paid to developments in other countries.  The fact is, of course, that banking mechanism in each country is different but there is a very wide range of difference between the banking mechanism of a large commercial country and ours.  Many of the ideas which are current and which are in the text books for students, about banking and monetary proposals, have no applicability to this country at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I say, referred to credit management.  The text books on the subject, theories on which were enshrined in our Central Banking Act, suggest that by what is called open market operations, by the buying and selling of securities, the Central Bank can influence the credit policies of the banks.  However, as everybody knows, this weapon is useless in the context of the Irish economy.  I challenge the Minister to say if tomorrow he wanted the banks to expand credit, what power he has got to make them expand credit.  There is a special power in section 15 of the Act to which I shall refer but it is a limited one.  If he wanted the banks to reduce credit, what power has he got?  The answer is none.  We of course depend on what is termed moral persuasion, on the influence of the Governor of the Central Bank in discussions with the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>We made it quite clear in our policy document that we were not intending in any way to minimise the importance of the contacts and discussions that must take place and do take place between the Central Bank and the commercial banks, and possibly the Minister also.  Anybody conversant with these things will say that one of the <Col N="1520" /> most important methods of credit management cannot be written into books.  It is the influence of the personality of the Governor of the Central Bank of the time being that is of such significance.  We did not intend to minimise that.  We did make this point, that if you are trying to persuade somebody with a line of policy and if that person knows that you have no power to back it up, then your gift of persuasion, great as it may be, will lack a certain amount of authority.  Every other country has found it desirable to have a statutory system by which the views and ideas of the Government, through the Central Bank, can be implemented.</P>
    <P>Again, we put forward suggestions of a highly technical nature for what are called minimum reserve ratios. These will not be found in any great detail in the English text books because they are not weapons used in England but they are used in New Zealand.  In our own bulletin of the Central Bank last year, details were given of a system used by the South African Central Bank.  We also suggested, in the course of our policy document, that we thought it desirable that we should do what every other country does, namely, require commercial banks who earn foreign exchange to centralise this foreign exchange in the Central Bank.  This again was a system which was not unique or extraordinary but which would help us to bring about what we considered necessary as part of the process of insulating our credit policy from the fluctuations of the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>As I said, the suggestions we made during the general election were of a highly technical nature, which were not revolutionary and which had been used in other countries, but which were used against us in an unscruplous way to get votes for the Government, to endeavour to paint us as a Party who were in fact going to be irresponsible in Government, a Party who should not get the support of the electorate.  I have no doubt part of the victory of the Government is to be found in the misrepresentation that was deliberately undertaken in regard to bank policy.  I have raised <Col N="1521" /> this in order to make clear to the Dáil what we had in mind and also in order to ask the Minister to say, in replying, what he had in mind when he spoke in his Budget speech of credit management and what powers he thinks he may have and how he proposes to operate them.</P>
    <P>I think other examples of the distortions of our policies are to be found in the manner in which our proposals for economic planning were treated by the Government spokesmen and by their paper.  I refer to our economic plan not only in that context but also to point out that the Government have in fact attempted to mislead and, to a considerable extent, have succeeded in misleading, the public as to the nature of the economic policies which are being operated today by the Government.  I should imagine a very small percentage of the electorate has read the First or Second Economic Programme, but these have been heard of and talked about a great deal.  Here is the first Economic Programme, a 50-page document, and we are led to believe this 50-page document was the method by which this country had found economic salvation.</P>
    <P>This document, of course, was merely a statement of policy but it was dressed up in a more formal way and put in the form of a White Paper but there was little more in it than would be in the reviews of the economy which would be found in the speeches of Ministers on different Estimates each year.  It did contain a little more and that was an estimate of the net capital cost of the development proposals. It suggested how the country was to be developed and estimated what the cost of it was going to be. One of the travesties we have met in this document is the inefficiency of the Government in planning their own expenditure.  As a basic thing in any programme, the Government must be able to plan their own activities and one of the failures of the Government has been their failure to plan their own sector of the community so as to ensure that we have a sustained economic programme.</P>
    <P>They set out in the appendix what <Col N="1522" /> was proposed to be done, what was the proposed cost of economic development and they were wide of the mark in their figures.  It was suggested that development costs in respect of industrial credit were going to be, over the period of the proposals, £17.5 million: in fact, they were £12.32 million.  It was suggested that agricultural credit for the period of the programme was to be £7.5 million; in fact, it was £4.7 million.  The overall development cost of this so-called programme was to have been £53.4 million; in fact it was only £44.6 million. The cost of the development programme was £11 million less and the economy, instead of increasing by less than two per cent growth rate, in fact expanded by more than the two per cent gross rate that was anticipated.</P>
    <P>The Second Economic Programme was a much bigger document and it had some significant differences in detail but basically it was the same. Basically, the Second Economic Programme is merely a forecast of what will happen in this country on the assumption that we get a four per cent growth rate each year.  The Government's expert economists have done a good job in this expert, highly technical field.  They have worked out what would happen here if we get a four per cent growth rate, if we get so much from industry, so much from services, so much from agriculture and so on. If you do, they say, your national income will be so much and then by the elimination of this, by adding up, multiplying and substracting, they are able to work out what the imports and exports will be and what the capital investment is likely to be.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that this exercise is not worth doing&mdash;because it is.  It is well worth while to make an estimate which is based on a projected growth rate.  Other countries do it but they do not produce it as a Blue Book and say: &ldquo;This is the Government's plan for economic development&rdquo;.  In Britain, the National Economic Development Council did it for England; in France, in the first stage of economic planning, they do it; they do it in Holland and <Col N="1523" /> they do it in most of the developed countries.  Their experts work out what the economy is going to be like in four years on a postulated growth rate of four per cent or five per cent or even three per cent.  They do not call this an economic programme and they do not try to cod the people that everything is going to be all right by producing the work of the experts between two blue covers.</P>
    <P>Everything is not all right and that is why we suggest that we should have proper economic planning in this country.  Let us say what we are doing. We are concerned with economic planning and basically we believe it is perfectly consistent with economic planning and political thought to have what we term the just management of society towards an agreed objective. May I say why I think it is necessary? The recent NIEC Report has underlined some of the facts of the situation. This Report published a few days ago included comments on the Department of Finance review of economic progress in 1964 and sets out some of the prospects for 1965.  It states on page 5:</P>
    <P>Total employment, however, does not seem to be rising at the rate envisaged in the second programme mainly because of a more rapid decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture and a slower increase in employment in the services sector. The slower rate of increase in employment is not the result of a general labour shortage...unemployment remains high and annual emigration has recently been about 25,000.</P>
    <P>NIEC is not happy with the progress that is being made because the country is, in fact, not reaching the limited targets which involved a high rate of emigration that had been set in this economic programme.  This country has the fourth lowest income per head of all the OECD countries.  We have had Fianna Fáil in office for 27 years and the country is now beaten to last place by Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey.  We come around about the same level of national <i>per capita</i> income as Italy.  We make the point <Col N="1524" /> that our economic growth which has gone up in recent years at an average rate of around four per cent, has, in fact, not been sufficient to give us the economic wealth we need; that there is, in fact, no guarantee that it will continue the spontaneous economic forces which have been working in our favour.  How long is that going to last?  There are indications even in the Minister's Budget speech that things are not going as well as they might.  There are indications that there will be restrictions on the expansion of bank credit.  If experience in the past is any guide and if Britain gets into more serious difficulties and deflates further, it is quite clear that we shall get into one of these economic deflations that have been the curse of this country since the war.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another reason why we believe there should be economic management and better planning of our affairs.  Many countries have difficulties in relation to regional differences in their societies. Deputies are, of course, familiar with, say, a country like Italy which has a great problem in connection with undeveloped sites and a great country like France has its problems.  We have them here.  Deputies know from getting into their cars and driving out of Dublin into the country what the problems are.  The statistics bear out what the eye sees.</P>
    <P>The regional differences in this country are very marked.  The income of people in Minister is ten per cent below the income of people in Leinster; the income of people in Connacht is 23 per cent below the level of incomes in Leinster and in the part of Ulster which we have, the income of people is 27 per cent below the income of people in Leinster.</P>
    <P>These are the regional differences that exist in this country and we made certain suggestions in respect of the mechanism of economic planning, for which we were criticised severely in the course of the election campaign.  We suggested that agriculture should be represented on the NIEC.  We suggested the National Industrial Economic Council should, in fact, provide a consultative body for the whole of the <Col N="1525" /> economy.  We suggested that agriculture should be represented, as well as tourism, on the NIEC.  These suggestions were scoffed at, as was the suggestion which we made for regional development councils, for economic boards for regions to assist the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach scoffed at these and suggested that these were just a means of creating disagreements, the implied suggestion being, of course, that when Irishmen sit down together to work for economic development, they growl. We do not suggest that.  We see no reason why agriculture should not be on the NIEC.  We see a great deal of benefit to be gained if you had representatives of local trade unions, local employers' groups, representatives from some of the excellent development associations that are to be found throughout the country who are, on their own and very largely unaided, going out to help the rural areas where they work, being let work together with the assistance of expert economic guidance to work out plans based on a region as a whole.</P>
    <P>We do not claim any originality in these ideas.  What we say is that they have worked elsewhere and we are not ashamed to say that we base our thinking a great deal on the experiences that occurred in France where these ideas have borne fruit and have benefited the people.</P>
    <P>A further aspect and very important aspect of Government policy on which I think the Government are being less than candid and on which this Dáil and the people generally are getting the minimum of information is our relations with the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Area.  It is not enough for the Minister to come into the Dáil and to say that recent developments would indicate that the hope of membership by 1970 is a reasonable one.  What are these developments?  Why do the Government stick to the idea that we will be in the European Economic Community by 1970?  We on this side of the House are in favour of Ireland's full participation in the European Economic Community.  We understand the difficulties that exist <Col N="1526" /> at the present time.  What we object to, though, is the lack of candour in the way the Government are dealing with these difficulties.  There are considerable difficulties in the way of our joining the European Economic Community and we all know that the Taoiseach, in fact, himself had said some years ago that we could not be in any trading bloc if Great Britain was not in it, and we all know that our application became, in fact, suspended at the time of the suspension of the British application.</P>
    <P>The European Economic Community, of course, is itself in difficulties all the time.  There have been the internal stresses and strains which any developing experimental body such as this has to face and it seems quite clear that these developments inside the Community are such that it will not be in a position to start seriously considering new applicants for membership for at least a couple of years and there is no indication that the British Labour Party or, indeed, its successor if it is succeeded by a Conservative Party in Government in the meantime, will be any more successful in gaining entrance than it was before General de Gaulle's veto.</P>
    <P>Why are not these facts stated? Why are we not treated as adults and told, &ldquo;We are very sorry but at the moment there are forces outside our control and it looks as if this country has to do a bit of contingent planning in any event&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The whole of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is based on the assumption that we will be in the European Economic Community by 1970 and particularly the agricultural parts of the programme, which talk about the freedom and liberalisation of trade and new markets in Europe, are based on the assumption that this country will be in, not by 1970, but in the middle of the 1960's.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this is another example of the way in which this country is not being treated adequately by the Government.  If we were given the facts, it would be possible for us, and not just for us as Deputies in Opposition who have not, it must be <Col N="1527" /> admitted, the full resources, the information, the contacts that are available to the Government, but it would be possible also for the public, seriously to consider alternatives: the possibility, for example, of a trade agreement with the European Economic Community; the possibility of some form of association with the European Economic Community.  In fact, as we know, Austria has been successful in applying for association with the EEC and the negotiations are continuing and it would be of considerable importance for us to know what the pros and cons of such course of action would be and to be given the information on which the public could seriously discuss the merits and demerits of other courses of action.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Taoiseach was serious when he was talking about the possibility of our joining EFTA.  Less than two per cent of our exports go to EFTA countries outside Great Britain.  By 1967, it is proposed to have complete free trade in the EFTA countries in industrial goods.  Are we to join EFTA with less than two per cent of our exports going to EFTA countries other than the United Kingdom, with free trade by 1967?  I am not saying that the Taoiseach said that we were going to join EFTA.  He carefully chose his words and he suggested this possibility that might arise in future but we should be given a great deal more information as to the basis for even expressing the view before any serious consideration can be given to this idea.</P>
    <P>We differ from this Government on a number of matters.  As has been made clear in our economic policy, we differ from them in regard to our monetary and banking policy.  We differ from them in regard to our economic planning proposals and their so-called programming proposals.  We differ from them, too, in our policy in respect of prices and incomes.</P>
    <P>The cost of living in this country has gone up under Fianna Fáil since 1957 by 31.1 per cent.  It has gone up in the past 12 months by seven per cent. The Government, I believe, are powerless <Col N="1528" /> or unwilling to deal with this situation.  We in this country have been too much under the influence of certain ideas about rising prices.  It is too readily assumed in this country that price rises occur because wages go up and it is almost an automatic response when we hear of an increase in wages: &ldquo;You are going to put up prices, you are going to price yourself out of the market and this is a bad thing.&rdquo;  Then, on the other hand, some economists will suggest that there is excessive demand in the economy and&mdash;using the phrases that are used by economists across the sea&mdash;that demand, in fact, should be damped down.  In fact it was suggested that last year's Budget was a mildly deflationary Budget on the basis that we had to damp down demand in the economy.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, causes of price increases other than what is called wage push and other than what is called excess demand.  There are what are termed in this document which the OECD has produced special factors such as the Suez crisis or again, for example, the turnover tax, where a special factor arises in the situation which causes an increased demand. There are also profits.  We are inclined to forget in this country that profits play a part in increasing the cost of living.  Again we have been misrepresented over the policy we have put forward for prices and incomes.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested we are against the <i>entrepreneurs</i> who are reasonably making profits and remunerating their investments and their skill.  We are not.  However, we have drawn attention to this fact, a fact which is not mentioned very often in this country, that profits do affect the cost of living and that there is evidence for that. There is evidence produced by a paper published by the Economic Research Institute, paper No. 22., by Professor Nevin, that the passing on to final prices of something over and above the full impact of increased costs has occured, and his analysis was that the cost inflation of 1957-1960 was due more to higher profits than to anything else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> We differ from the Government on this matter of prices.  The Government take the line: you cannot have price control as you had it in the war years. We say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to that but we say it is a false dichotomy to suggest that there is only, on the one hand, price control as it was in the war years and, on the other hand, the free-for-all such as we have been having over the past eight years or so.  We have pointed to the experience in other countries, countries that are to some extent analogous to ours such as Holland and Norway where they work out a system of price notification, a system of guide lines for the behaviour of prices.  They require traders to notify the Department of Industry and Commerce or its counterpart, of increases. They have statutory powers to ensure that increases do not take place. They have operated a system which is different from that of other European countries.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 66 of the OECD Report on Policies for Prices, Profits and Other Non-wage Incomes contains these words:</P>
    <P>In concluding this section it may be useful to consider briefly to what extent it is possible to reconcile the views of the Norwegian and Netherlands' authorities with the rather widely held feeling in most other countries that price control can at most only be regarded as a temporary measure or as a means of intervention in a limited number of specific sectors.  To some extent, at any rate, this difference of views can be reconciled if price regulation is thought of, not so much as a means of control, but more modestly as simply a means of ensuring that the government is well informed about price and cost developments throughout the economy, and that industry is aware that the government&mdash;and ultimately public opinion&mdash;is actively interested in all price decisions.  Nevertheless, there are differences; in both Norway and the Netherlands the authorities feel that in the last resort the effectiveness of their policies depends on the existence of statutory powers to <Col N="1530" /> control prices when this proves necessary.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 67 reads:</P>
    <P>In this context, it may not be irrelevant that Norway and the Netherlands are both comparatively small countries, where it is possible for the Government to have extensive and close personal contacts with much of industry and commerce. In larger and less socially homogeneous countries, this may be more difficult.</P>
    <P>We have all noticed the great difficulties that are facing the Labour Government in Britain in trying to work out and implement its incomes policy at the present time.  It is obvious that the task of implementing an incomes policy in a country with an economy the size of that of Great Britain is an enormous one, but it is equally obvious that the experience in countries not all that dissimilar to ours in size, at any rate, such as Norway and Holland, indicates that it is much easier to operate an incomes policy there than it is in large countries with complex economies such as the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>We do not for a moment underestimate the difficulties in operating an incomes policy but we think it should be accepted that the old concept of the Government, in their <i>Closing the Gap</i> document which was published in 1963, that the only sector of the economy which must be looked at is that of wages and salaries who are asked to limit their demands while other sectors are not is a wrong one.  The only way in which we can get orderly development, development which will mean that every sector of the community benefits from the increased growth, is by a policy which covers not just wages and salaries but other incomes as well.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like a little more information and I am sure other Deputies would, too.  In his Budget speech, at column 996, volume 215, of the Official Report, when the Minister says that the trend of wages and salary costs and the level of profits also require careful attention, what does he propose to do? Is he proposing to implement our incomes policy?  If he is, I welcome it. What does he mean by saying that the <Col N="1531" /> level of profits require careful attention? This is the first time reference has been made to this.  Again to revert to the election campaign, the suggestions which we made that consideration should be given to a dividend equalisation tax and that consideration should be given to a tax on speculative gains, met with very great criticism, criticism which was warped, which was unfair and which amounted to misrepresentation. What we were suggesting was an incomes policy and a means of implementing it.</P>
    <P>I wonder what will happen towards the end of this year and the beginning of next year when the new round of wages and salaries will be negotiated. Will there be any criterion for it? Will there be any basis for agreement arrived at or will it be a case of who can bargain the hardest and who can outbluff the others?  Or will it be done on a rational basis, as we suggested it should be, whereby a fair and reasoned examination can be made of the economy, an examination which will be acceptable to both sides of industry, whereby the Government will be prepared to undertake that the growth in the economy will be an orderly one and that prices will not get out of control, and whereby there will be a mechanism established to ensure that some sectors of the community do not benefit too much or do not take too much benefit or an unfair benefit from, perhaps, a situation of monopoly or quasi-monopoly or a situation where free competition does not exist?</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, much for us to debate in the months and years to come.  As has been said already in the course of this debate, we welcome the proposals for increasing the social welfare payments.  Although the Minister and his colleagues must naturally dislike the suggestion put forward by the Opposition Parties that it was as a result of their pressure that these social welfare increases came about, there is no doubt that if it had not been made clear to the public that what we were suggesting in the course of the campaign was possible, the increases would not have been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> One can ask: why should there be exceptional increases this year?  Reference was made in the Budget speech to the fact that this year there were to be exceptional increases.  Why this year?  Why not last year or the year before?  Surely the explanation is that public opinion had been aroused. People had been made aware for the first time of the needs of our social welfare classes, people who were hitherto unfamiliar with the true social facts.  As I say, public opinion was aroused.  The Government saw this and were prepared to go some way, at any rate, towards recognising this awakening.  It seems to me a pity that the Government would not give the 10/- increase to the 30,000, or so, who, because they have got a little more than £26 a year to live on, will have this sum reduced.  It also seems a pity that the Minister for Social Welfare should think it is a matter for the local authorities concerned to see that the increases in social welfare payments do not result in a reduction in home assistance.  In answer to a question addressed to him today, he made the point that these were matters for the local authorities concerned.  We have raised these points because of experience and I am sure Deputies opposite have had the same experience as we have had.  I know of a case in which a disability allowance was increased and the home assistance was reduced.  We anticipate that this pattern is likely to be repeated now.  It is only fair, I think, to give the Minister notice that there will be an amendment down to the social welfare legislation which will be introduced providing specifically that these increases may not result in a reduction in home assistance.</P>
    <P>As I say, we welcome the increases and the improvements.  There are many other matters in relation to which the Government will have the views of our Party, particularly in relation to the economic and financial situation that faces us.  There is a considerable danger that the Government, having won the election, will now once again become complacent.  There is considerable danger that the Government, having got their experts to produce the Second <Col N="1533" /> Programme, will now sit back and allow the situation to develop, hoping that spontaneous economic forces which, to some extent, have worked in our favour in the past, will continue to do so.  We shall do our best to try to ensure that movements which we believe are inevitable, movements towards a prices policy and towards greater economic planning, movements towards greater monetary control by the Central Bank, and ultimately by the Government, will be accelerated. The document we produced will, in five years time, be commonplace.  In five or ten years time, people will be wondering why we were criticised by the Tánaiste and by the <i>Irish Press</i> for producing this document.  People will be wondering why it was alleged we intended to pry into every nook and cranny in the lives of our people. People will be wondering what it was we said that put the savings of the people in jeopardy, as the Taoiseach said they would be.  I believe that what we say in this document is correct and, if we can get it implemented by this Government, or by a new Government, all our people will benefit.</P>

      <P>It is usual after a general election to make reference to the type of campaign, and that is particularly so in those circumstances in which the Budget had to be postponed until the result of the election was known.  The election and the type of campaign did, I think, a service to Irish political life.  The speeches made on television, on the radio, from public platforms and in press interviews dealt with things with which the people were really concerned.  None of us is too young not to remember when general elections were fought primarily on questions like the Irish language, Partition, neutrality and so on.  These were matters on which we could get much more agreement than we can on things economic and things social.  In the recent election all Parties were talking &mdash;some were forced into it&mdash;about the things that really matter, economic planning, housing, social welfare, health, education, an incomes policy, prices, and so on.  The fact that we had this campaign in March and April of <Col N="1534" /> this year did a service, I believe, to Irish political life.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Taoiseach here last Thursday.  He spoke about glib phrases; he spoke about gimmicks.  In particular, he talked about some of the phrases adopted by political Parties. In relation to the Labour Party, he was critical of the fact that we talked about social justice.  He described &ldquo;social justice&rdquo; as a glib phrase.  He said that, if his Party were ever to have to resort to gimmicks of that kind, he would prefer to get out of office. I shall not go too far back in the past, or dwell on it at any great length, but surely the Taoiseach must remember the main slogans of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1957: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands back to work&rdquo; and &ldquo;100,000 new jobs.&rdquo;  In any case, the Taoiseach ought to appreciate that these phrases to which he takes exception are not peculiar to Fine Gael or the Labour Party but are used by all political Parties, particularly in an election campaign.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his speech last Thursday, appeared to be a very reasonable man.  He talked about co-operation between Parties to provide for greater economic progress and for a better society generally.  We have never had to declare to this House that we do not oppose merely for the sake of opposition because it is evident to both sides that our attitude, not alone in relation to budgetary measures and financial proposals but in relation to all types of legislation is one of independence. We walk into the Division Lobby with Fianna Fáil when we believe it is right to do so.  If the Taoiseach is asking for co-operation from those who are now in opposition, then he should be prepared to accept co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What have we found over the past 40 or 45 years?  A Minister comes in here with a proposal for new legislation. Does anybody remember when a Minister sitting over there, inter-Party, Cumann na nGaedheal, or Fianna Fáil, was big enough to say &ldquo;Yes; I think the section should be changed,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yes; I think my proposal is wrong and I believe the Opposition, even though they are in a <Col N="1535" /> minority, or the Labour Party, even though they are a small Party, are right and I will accept this amendment&rdquo;? If we were to work on that basis, we could, I think, work in the manner in which the Taoiseach believes the Dáil should work.  From experience, we know that a proposal from the Opposition side of the House is never acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also referred to the fact that during the past seven or eight years the international situation was favourable.  He was good enough to admit that.  He did not claim all the credit for the progress that has been made as being the entire responsibility of the present Government or the Fianna Fáil Party.  He was not quite so tolerant in 1956-57 when there was a grave international situation that would have upset any Government, whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour. Apart from the Taoiseach looking for co-operation, he should also have mentioned the word &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We made our views very clear on the day the Budget was announced.  I believe the Fianna Fáil Government learned something from the campaign. They learned, as has been pointed out by almost every Opposition speaker, that the people want increases in social welfare and were prepared to pay for them if the tax proposals were, in themselves, fair.  On the day the Budget was introduced I commented that the Labour Party had been consistent. A pretty good proportion of the new taxation in this Budget is devoted to social welfare, but the overall picture is not quite the same.  Even though they are indirect taxes&mdash; although not on the necessaries of life but in respect of tobacco, drink and petrol&mdash;we had no hesitation in voting for them.  We will continue to vote for proposals to assist social welfare, health and education.  These are the things we believe require to be helped. If the Minister introduces a fair tax proposal, a tax which will mean taking money from a source where it can be afforded, he will get our general support.</P>
    <P>This is the biggest increase the old age pensioner has ever got, but it has <Col N="1536" /> been marred by a few stipulations by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare.  Deputies from all sides have complained many times about the means test.  They complained not so much about the overall means test but the number of means tests applied in respect of the old age pension, unemployment assistance and so on.  Here we have a new means test.  The unfortunate thing is that many people now in receipt of the full old age pension will assume they will receive the 10/- from 1st August next. But it appears that many of them&mdash; not the majority of them, I hope&mdash;will be subjected to this means test and will receive only 5/- a week if their income exceeds £26 per year or 10/- per week.</P>
    <P>The task of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare in respect of the old age pensioner is much easier today than it was in 1957. The introduction of the contributory old age pension has made things a lot easier.  We all remember a time when one thought in terms of an expenditure of £1 million for an increase of 2/6 a week in the old age pension.  Now I am amazed at what can be done with a relatively smaller sum of money, something like £5 million or £5½ million per year.  This is because the number of contributory old age pensioners is becoming greater each year while the number of non-contributory old age pensioners is becoming smaller.</P>
    <P>I admit it was the practice, even at the time of the inter-Party Government, to pay these increases from 1st August.  But it is no reply to me to say &ldquo;You did the same&rdquo;.  Changes are made every year.  In most cases they are changes for the better, particularly in respect of the people we are talking about now.  If not this year, certainly next year&mdash;when we trust the old age pensioners will get a further increase&mdash;I hope an effort will be made by the Government to give it to them immediately.  We can all appreciate the frame of mind of somebody aged 70 or 80 years, whose expectancy of life cannot be very great, being told in the month of April that their increase will come in August. Many of them&mdash;indeed, many of us all &mdash;will ask the question &ldquo;Where will <Col N="1537" /> we be next August?&rdquo;  If the Government want to be benevolent and generous to them, an effort should be made to bring in the necessary legislation or regulations to ensure that these increases can be applied when the Budget is announced or as soon as possible thereafter.  This should be so, particularly in view of the fact&mdash; although I know it is not entirely a logical argument&mdash;that the taxation raised to pay for these increases operates in the majority of cases on the very evening of the Budget or certainly the next day or week.</P>
    <P>I admit this is relatively better treatment than the social welfare groups have received heretofore, but I would like to remind the Minister that there is still a great deal of poverty in the country.  I do not think anyone can say that those in receipt of the various social welfare benefits have an income that would allow them a fair standard of living.  However, we hope that this new attitude on social welfare, and the provision of the money to pay for it, will prevail to such an extent that not alone will these rates be increased in accordance with increases in the cost of living but, over and above that, there will be an effort to give them a proper standard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello talked about home assistance.  In my constituency &mdash;there is a colleague of mine, who is a Fianna Fáil member of the county council, who knows this&mdash;the rates of home assistance paid to people entitled to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and so on, are miserable.  It is true this is sometimes paid to a person living in a household where the income is not too bad.  But in the case of, say, a married couple with two children, who for some reason or other have not qualified for these benefits or have experienced some delay, they are offered some miserable amount like 30/- or £2 per week by the home assistance officer.  That may be for only four or five weeks.  But in the meantime the health of the children particularly can suffer, because that small amount is not sufficient to provide them with the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>Some people&mdash;not necessarily people in this House&mdash;may think that the <Col N="1538" /> taxpayers are over-burdened by the amount required to be paid by them for social welfare, health and education. You would imagine by the criticism of some people that the taxes they are expected to pay are an unfair burden or that they are paying them to provide people with something they do not really deserve.  I do not have to prove why a sick or unemployed person needs to have some assistance from the community through the State. It is also well to remember that the proportion of money devoted by the Government to social welfare, health and education has declined rapidly from 1959-60 to 1965-66.  Social welfare as we know it as a proportion of State expenditure has fallen from 19.8 per cent in 1959-60 to 16 per cent in 1965-66.</P>
    <P>There is also a decline in the proportion of tax revenue for social welfare, health and education.  The proportion spent on these three items, which we call social services, has declined again since 1959-60 from 38 per cent to 34 per cent.  Do not let us imagine that in the Budget of 1965 we have gone wild suddenly because we gave the old age pensioners 10/- and because we made all the other improvements as well.  They are certainly to be welcomed but let nobody give the impression &mdash; as somebody outside the House has stressed&mdash;that too much of the taxpayers' money has been spent on these things as would have been the case had the Minister for Finance been moved to greater generosity.  It would not be entirely his generosity because the local authorities pay a good proportion of the public service pensions but £600,000 does not seem to me to be an over-generous increase for pensions when, so far as I can remember in the Minister's statement, applied to pensioners who retired before 1959. These people, as everybody knows, have been endeavouring for a long time to get what they and we regard as a measure of justice.  Nobody can say that the pensions of which they are in receipt at the present time are over-generous.  Perhaps, the Minister would take another look at his proposals in respect of these pensions when he comes to the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>It had been mentioned&mdash;there is no <Col N="1539" /> point in my trying to over-emphasise it here&mdash;that the allowances in respect of income tax are out of date.  I cannot say what the new costings would be if bigger personal allowances, bigger allowances for children and different other things, were conceded.  The Minister should make some change in these allowances because they are a very heavy burden on many people.</P>
    <P>Our progress in the past five or six years may be explained, if we bear in mind what the Taoiseach said, that the international climate, so to speak, has been favourable.  There has been progress indeed.  The main theme of many speeches from my Party during the election campaign was that whilst prosperity had been created we were concerned about the distribution of this prosperity.  It seems, in any case, that economic progress is being maintained. I do not believe that anybody could claim it was spectacular or was in any way significant.  Our criticism of the two programmes for economic expansion was they were not ambitious enough.  If we had done the normal thing the four per cent increase in gross national production would have happened in any case.  I suggest the Government have just done the normal thing without any spectacular effort and without, as other speakers have said, any plan.</P>
    <P>The two programmes for economic expansion are, as has been said, merely forecasts of what could have happened. The increase in industrial production has been significant.  It slowed down, according to the Government figures, in the second half of the year. The fourth quarter of the year can be explained by the introduction of the 15 per cent levy by the British Government but the slowing down in the third quarter needs some explanation.  I cannot remember any particular event that would have slowed down industrial production in the third quarter of 1964.  So far I have not seen or heard any comment from either the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance with regard to this.  The increase in agricultural production was one of the heartening <Col N="1540" /> things in the year 1964.  That is a trend which I know everybody in the House will want to see continuing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, used to become very annoyed with members of the Labour Party when they spoke about prices.  I heard a comment by Deputy Declan Costello with which I do not entirely agree.  He was, or seemed to be, in agreement with the Government that price control is a bad thing.  The Minister, in his Budget speech, said something to the effect that prices must remain stable.  It is not sufficient for the Minister merely to say that.  He has got to take the necessary steps to ensure that prices will, in fact, be stable.  It seems to me there is a lack of concern by the Government about prices.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Economic Council are concerned about prices according to their publication in which they commented on the progress made in relation to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  We were told on very many occasions that price control is wrong and that prices will reach their own level by dint of competition. Of course, this has not happened, when we have regard to the percentage increase in prices over the past 12 months and when we remember that between August, 1963 and February, 1965 the consumer price index rose by 11.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Finance, who is a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, to tell us what is the difference between the Government's action in controlling the price of petrol, flour, various soaps and tinned goods and the action he took as Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of these things?  Surely that was in effect price control?  He controlled the price of petrol when he told the petrol companies: &ldquo;You cannot increase the price.&rdquo;  He merely had to say that to them.  He caused an investigation to be made into the proposed increase in the price of flour and he had an investigation made into the price of various other commodities, two of which I can remember now, tinned goods, tinned foods and soaps.  What <Col N="1541" /> was that?  Is it to be inferred here that there is a ring in regard to the price of petrol, flour, bread, soap or tinned foods and that that is what he was going to get after?  I do not think we have ever had an adequate explanation as to the action he took, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, in respect of certain commodities and what he refused to do in respect of others.  These items could be regarded as vital items in the economy and in the running of a household.</P>
    <P>We do not want the Minister to attempt to control the price of every single commodity but we say, in respect of those essential commodities, that there should be concern by the Minister and the Government to ensure that the people are not exploited, as they have been, in respect of the price of certain commodities. I mentioned here before, and let me mention it again, that if there is no atmosphere, and the least thing the Minister could do is to creat an atmosphere, in respect of the price of important items to cause them to come down, those who are dependent on wages and salaries &mdash;one might say all the income groups &mdash;will take the steps, themselves, to ensure that they will be compensated, particularly with respect to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Economic Council took note in their report of price increases and certainly, by inference, showed that they were concerned. By mentioning it at all, I am sure they must have had in their minds the directive to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, particularly, to try to ensure that price increases will be in accordance with the increases in costs, wages, import prices, and so on, and that there will be no exploitation.  There was another comment by them in which they said that price changes in the past seven or eight years were not caused by rises in import prices but by internal effect. Many people are inclined to think&mdash;those who have not read, for example, this report of the National Industrial Economic Council&mdash;that wages are entirely responsible or are in the main responsible for the increase in prices. <Col N="1542" /> This is certainly not so because, over the past 12 to 15 months, the increase in the consumer price index contained a 30 per cent increase in respect of wages.</P>
    <P>However, I wanted in particular to talk about something I mentioned here when this Budget was introduced.  I think it can be well said again that, whilst we can measure our progress in gross national product in terms of an increase in national income, whilst we can get an indication of our progress and prosperity with reference to the balance of payments and different things like that, with our peculiar background here in Ireland, the best test is employment.</P>
    <P>If we judge the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in respect of the past year as against employment, we must say that it has failed or, to be kind to it, has certainly not succeeded. This <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisaged 78,000 new jobs by 1970.  That was not an over-ambitious objective in 1960.  This forecast of an extra 7,800 new jobs per year was made having regard to the fact that we still had a pretty big flight from the land.  All these things were considered.  Still, this <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> forecast an increase in jobs over those ten years of 78,000.  The Government told us in their pre-Budget booklet that, in 1960, we had 1,055,000 people in employment and that in 1964 we had 1,059,000 people in employment.  That means that between 1960 and 1964, we created an extra 4,000 jobs, which represents about 1,000 extra jobs per years.  We had anticipated an increase in jobs of 7,800 per year.  We now have five years left in which to get the balance.  We now have five years in which to get 74,000 new jobs, which represents about 15,000 new jobs per year.  Therefore, if we are to judge the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, I think we can judge it already and say that it seems to be a formidable undertaking to get anything like 15,000 new jobs per year between now and 1970 or a total of 74,000, in all.</P>
    <P>I say this about employment but still give credit for the fact that there has <Col N="1543" /> been a pretty good increase and a fairly consistent increase in manufacturing industry, in industrial employment. Between 1960 and 1964, industrial employment in manufacturing industry rose by 24,000.  As I said, this was a fairly consistent increase over the years from 1960 to 1964.  Included in this extra employment are 15,000 in building and construction.  I thought at one time that this would be a declining figure.  I had hoped during the past six or seven years, that building, as far as houses are concerned, would be nearing completion by now or in another year or two years' time.  Therefore, as far as that figure is concerned, it seems that there is still a job to be done by the 72,000 at present employed in building and construction. On the other hand, one would hope that that would increase substantially in order to ensure that the thousands of houses needed will be built as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> also talked about unemployment and a decrease.  In the past three or four years, we find no decrease in the unemployment figures.  I believe that, as far as the countries in Western Europe are concerned, we have one of the highest, if not the highest, rate of unemployment, standing as it did in the year 1964 at 5.7 per cent of insured persons.  It was exactly the same as it was in 1961 and in 1962.  Therefore, let what praise may be given or can be given to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> be given to it, but as far as jobs are concerned, it has not been of any use as far as overall employment, agricultural and industrial employment, is concerned in the whole country.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> also envisages an emigration rate of 10,000 persons per year by 1970.  I think that may not be an impossible task but the trend of emigration gives one to fear because it has been increasing in the past three years.  About three years ago, it was at the rate of 20,000.  Last year, it was about 25,000.  For the year up to the end of February, 1965, it is 27,500. Those, therefore, who want employment <Col N="1544" /> in their own country can certainly not be cheered by the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and are certainly not impressed by the claims made for it.</P>
    <P>The National Industrial Economic Council certainly had something to say about employment.  Whilst they did generously concede that industrial production had risen, employment in industry had not increased at the same rate.  The National Industrial Economic Council made certain recommendations. They recommended:</P>
    <P>that greater efforts should be made to achieve a faster, sustainable increase in employment.  In our view, this might be achieved in four ways. First, by laying greater emphasis on the establishment and expansion of employment-intensive growth industries, especially those employing workers with a higher level of skill, such as electronics and engineering.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what message the Government take from that, what directive the Minister for Finance takes from it.  This recommendation in itself is somewhat vague.  It says: &ldquo;by laying greater emphasis on the establishment and expansion of employment-intensive growth industries&rdquo;.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, two years ago we advocated that grants should to some degree in industry be dependent on employment or the numbers that would be employed.  I should be glad, therefore, to hear from the Minister for Finance that the emphasis for the future, as far as the establishment of industry is concerned, will be to a very large degree on employment.</P>
    <P>In that report certain types of employment are mentioned &mdash; electronics and engineering.  I do not know what can be done in respect of those two particular branches of industry.  Will the Government now give increased grants for the establishment of industries like those?  Will the Government try to persuade Irish industrialists, or foreign industrialists, to establish those industries?  Or will the Government take the initiative themselves and establish those industries as semi-State bodies?  This, I believe, is the line the Government should take, if there are <Col N="1545" /> not people prepared to do this job either from the country or outside it.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation of the National Industrial Economic Council for an increase in employment is:</P>
    <P>the speedy implementation of a manpower policy so that shortages of particular skills, or shortages of labour in particular areas, can be remedied as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is to establish a manpower policy.  I do not know whether or not there has been an official announcement on this.  The Parliamentary Secretary is to be in charge of that particular section under the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have no criticism to make of the Parliamentary Secretary or the post given to him, but I am sure this policy will be established in consultation with the body already in existence to deal with this particular problem.  The sooner the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes some proposals, or says what is in his mind, regarding a manpower policy the better.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation of the National Industrial Economic Council was to the effect that public investment should be raised.  They make some qualifications there.  But the most interesting recommendation is the fourth which is to increase employment. It reads:</P>
    <P>by using some part of the annual increase in productivity to reduce prices and thus to make possible an expansion in sales and open up new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I read from that an inference that prices can be reduced.  I do not know how the Minister regards this comment of the National Industrial Economic Council.  In any case, I believe it is a recommendation that certainly should be examined, if it is to open up, as they say, new employment opportunities. I would regard this general comment by the National Industrial Economic Council as one that could not be called over-enthusiastic about progress in 1964.  Therefore, the Government should have regard not alone <Col N="1546" /> to the comments of the Council but to their recommendations.  If we are to go along as we have been going over the past few years and be satisfied with results in unemployment, in employment and in emigration, we ourselves cannot be over-enthusiastic about the programme either.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention just two other matters.  I have said that, as far as progress is concerned measured in statistics, one would have to admit that the results are pretty favourable.  I think we also have to think in terms of social policy.  I do not mean a social welfare policy, but a social policy.  The Taoiseach also referred to this in his speech last Thursday.  He said there will be certain changes in social policy. He said, first of all, side by side with the economic policy, there ought to go a social policy.  We have been saying that for a long time but I do not think the Taoiseach will take it too seriously, even though he did say it on Thursday last.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said there would be changes in social welfare, education, health legislation and health administration. The peculiar thing is he went on and told us about the sort of life we should be living.  He said:</P>
    <P>There is no evidence anywhere in the world that the growth of affluence necessarily means greater human happiness.  There is indeed much evidence to the contrary, even in the very wealthiest countries. We, as a nation, now, for the first time in our history, have to consider the implications of steadily rising national wealth, steadily rising living standards for our people, and to think about the social problems which in this situation will certainly be generated for us.  This is the kind of study I should like to see beginning and it would have far more significance in relation to the country's future than the commitment of money in future years to the expansion of the State social services.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the job of the Government, the Taoiseach or anybody else.  In any case, he seems to suggest that there is so much money floating around that people will have to decide <Col N="1547" /> on the proper way to spend it.  He does not mean Government expenditure, on food and clothing, and so on. He is afraid people will go crazy with all the money they have&mdash;dancing, smoking, drinking, and so on.  He thinks we will have to change our way of life.  That may be a problem in time to come.  Still, the Taoiseach ought to realise there is poverty in the country, that there are people unfed, and people with small incomes. Before we think in terms of what sort of society we should have in the situation he described, we should ensure that these people are looked after.</P>
    <P>The last point I should like to make is in relation to housing and health. There does not seem to be any stir as far as the building of houses is concerned.  Is there any Deputy from Dublin, Cork, or anywhere else in the country, but particularly in the towns, who is not approached about housing more than about any other single subject?  I think, therefore, the Government, and particularly the Minister for Local Government, will have to see that there is some breakthrough as far as housing is concerned.  It may be&mdash;and I know this is a big part of the problem&mdash;that we have not sufficient operatives to build the houses. Even where we have them, there does not seem to be the dynamic interest that any Minister for Local Government should have in the situation in which we find ourselves as far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Local Government making a comment recently in answer to a parliamentary question. He suggested that the onus was on the local authority.  That may be so in theory, but, as far as the provision of houses is concerned, in our circumstances where we need so many houses, where there are so many difficulties, leadership must be forthcoming from the Minister for Local Government. All we are doing, as my colleague, Deputy Mrs. Desmond, recently said, is merely keeping our heads above water in the provision of housing.  The problem in Dublin is far bigger than it is in other parts of the country.  Even if there were only one person condemned <Col N="1548" /> to live, sleep and live in one room, we would have a problem, but there are tens of thousands of people living&mdash;not entirely in those circumstances&mdash;in condemned houses, in bad leaky houses, and in slums.  As part of their social policy, the Government should initiate, at least in 1965, the same sort of drive and enthusiasm as there was in 1948 when the late Deputy T.J. Murphy was Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister sitting in the Custom House and telling us what the law is, what the regulations are; and saying the local authorities have the initial responsibility.  The member of the Labour Party who was Minister for Local Government in 1948 knew what the problem was.  He went to every local authority and spoke with the public representatives about housing, because at that time 100,000 new houses were required.  He visited every single local authority, and he made decisions on the spot, whether in Gorey, Cavan, Macroom, Bandon, or elsewhere.  I do not say this disrespectfully, but we are getting much more talk than houses from the Minister today.  We need more action.  I believe the main responsibility lies with the man who presides in the Custom House, the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said the other day that there was criticism from someone in Opposition to the effect that there was stagnation so far as the health services were concerned.  He went on to say that expenditure had increased from £16 million in 1957 to £30 million.  That was because there were increased costs.  There has been stagnation, and there has been no improvement in the health services since they were introduced away back in 1953.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talked about co-operation in order to achieve progress, but there was no sign of co-operation from the former Tánaiste when members of the House gladly agreed to become members of a Committee of the House to inquire into the health services and make a report as to how they could be improved.  That co-operation <Col N="1549" /> was gladly given by members of my Party, members of the Fine Gael Party, and one Independent, but there seemed to be a determination by the then Tánaiste, and Fianna Fáil members of the Committee, that nothing would be done.  They succeeded in ensuring that nothing was done, so much so, that in his last speech in the Seventeenth Dáil, the Taoiseach wrote off that Health Committee without consultation with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I think the new Minister for Health must know the feeling in the country that new and improved health services are required.  We have given our ideas on a health programme; Fine Gael have given their idea of what the new health services should be; but we have heard nothing from the Fianna Fáil Party.  We do not want them to commit themselves in any great detail.  We had a comment from the Taoiseach during the general election that there should be an improvement, but we had no indication of what the improvement might be.  I have confidence in the new Minister for Health.  I think he will produce something new, and if he wants the co-operation of the Labour Party in order to ensure that we will have better health services, we will gladly give it, as we will give our co-operation to the Minister for Local Government in regard to housing, and to any other Minister, so long as we are assured that the changes to be made will be an improvement in the services for which they are responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a little unusual but I do not think it would be out of place for me as a colleague at the Bar and a member of the Munster circuit to wish the new Minister for Finance well in his very arduous office.  I do so in the hope that he will be able to rise above the difficulties which will undoubtedly face him.  At the same time he must realise that it will be our task and our duty&mdash; which we will carry out with intensive vigour, I hope&mdash;to clear him out of his seat as soon as possible.  I hope he will take this in the same spirit as the person who spoke to the then leader of the Government, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, <Col N="1550" /> about the bitterness that had been engendered by certain shooting incidents during the Civil War.  Mr. Cosgrave said: &ldquo;If you were responsible for the Government when jurymen and judges were being shot, what would you do?&rdquo; and he answered: &ldquo;I would shoot them but there would be no bitterness.&rdquo; We hope to put the Minister and his colleagues out of office, and we hope to do it with vigour but without bitterness.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of his Budget speech, the Minister paid tribute to his new Department and said:</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance has been traditionally regarded both as the holder and as the watchdog of the public purse.  It will continue in this necessary role.  It is essential that the central agency of Government should see both that no unnecessary expenditure of public moneys is incurred and that whatever is spent is spent to good purpose.</P>
      <P>He went on to speak about the public view of his Department as being what a high official once described to me as a walking negative, and reactionary. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Whatever truth there may have been in this in the past, it is certainly not true today, nor has it been true for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather the Minister has faith in the new section of his Department which is responsible for the formation of economic policy and putting it up to the Government for adoption.  I had some experience in connection with the advisability of doing that.  I had formed a very strong conviction as a result of my experience that it was essential that the Taoiseach, the Head of the Government, should have some base by which he could judge the advice which was given to him, particularly by the Minister and the Department of Finance, when they were putting to the Government their official views, their sometimes retrograde views, and their always traditional views.  I felt that was essential and I think that when the Taoiseach was first appointed, he followed it up to some extent because I had initiated to some degree the setting up of a section in the Taoiseach's <Col N="1551" /> Department to advise in an economic and financial capacity.  I told the Taoiseach&mdash;I think in this House but certainly privately&mdash;that I approved of the policy of having in the Service what are known as quality men.</P>
    <P>I expressed publicly in this House my disapproval of putting this new section in the Department of Finance and making it responsible for the formulation, initiation and development of our economic programmes.  It was tried in England and has been found wanting.  The Department of Finance is not the proper place for it, and while I agree with the Minister when he said his Department had, to some extent at any rate, ceased to sustain their formerly reactionary and negative role and have in fact produced some good economic work, I am still of the opinion that this is not the proper place in which economic policy, in the circumstances of this country, should be formulated.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why we on this side of the House believe there should be a Minister for Economic Planning.  There is in the Department of Finance at present a section that is supposed to be advanced, one that can produce policies that will provide the necessary groundwork, the machinery and the direction for an expansionist policy, but in the same Department there are a number of officials whose duty it is to see that as little money as possible is spent.</P>
    <P>A distinguished member of that Department in my time said that if he succeeded in the course of each 12 months either in preventing the expenditure or postponing the expenditure of moneys to the extent of £1 million, he could feel he had justified his drawing of a not inconsiderable salary.  I should be glad to think that time has passed.  I wonder if Deputies, if asked a question in one of these quiz games, would be able to say who said this:</P>
    <P>Let me give the Deputies opposite a word of warning in conclusion. Beware of the Department of Finance.  It has always been restrictive <Col N="1552" /> of development.  Under the Fianna Fáil administration it was not successful because Fianna Fáil has its own policy and was undeterred by any impediments.</P>
    <P>Those words are to be found at column 253, volume 110 of the Official Report for 1948.  They were uttered by the present Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I hope the position no longer obtains that we are to beware of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>As I have submitted, a better job would be done by a separate Department in charge of economic planning. I have been led to that conviction by what has happened in relation to the two economic programmes.  During the election campaign, I made very few speeches but one of the topics I touched on was the authorship of these two documents.  The First Programme and the Second Programme were formulated and drafted by the distinguished Secretary of the Department of Finance and his able assistant in the Economics Section, not in the course of the last six or seven years, when these documents were published.  There was not one single new idea brought forward by any single Minister or member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  These two programmes represented the policy of the Department, not of the Government.</P>
    <P>I have repeated that again and again and I shall go on repeating it.  It bears out my suggestion that the Department of Finance is not the place for this job. This economic planning should be done in a separate Department where they have independence, where they are not sitting cheek-by-jowl with colleagues who might say: &ldquo;You cannot do that.  There is no money for that sort of development.&rdquo;  The duty of the Department of Finance is to examine everything in detail and present the opposite view to any scheme that is brought forward for development.  It would be a strong Government indeed which would override interDepartmental views that had been arrived at after a project had been argued hotly in the Departments.</P>
    <P>I shall now come to the Budget itself. I represent the city constituency <Col N="1553" /> of Dublin South East which extends from Ringsend, round through a variety of streets by the canal, through Haddington Road, Percy Place, Ranelagh, a little bit of Rathmines&mdash;some of it was taken from me&mdash;and right around to Rathfarnham.  It represents a pretty fair average of all sections of people, rich, not so rich and very poor.  I am glad to say that I am here as the representative of the not so rich and the poor.  My canvassers told me that if there was a big car outside a house, they did not call because it would have been a waste of time.</P>
    <P>What have my constituents got out of this Budget?  What has it meant to them?  It is my duty to look at the financial proposals of the Government from the national viewpoint first but then I am not merely entitled but bound to examine how my constituents are affected.  That applies to every Deputy in the House.  I find with great pleasure that the proposals dealing with social services improvements, subject to certain very strong reservations I have which I shall mention in a few moments, are reasonable. However, when I come to the closing paragraph of the Minister's Budget Statement, I find that he adopts the description which was obligingly furnished to him by the newspaper columnists in the preceding weeks&mdash; the social welfare Budget.</P>
    <P>In another paragraph, having told the bad news about the taxation changes, the Minister proceeded to appeal to those on whom the new taxation would fall and, as reported at column 979 of the Official Report for 11th May last he said:</P>
    <P>I would ask the man who takes a drink or smokes a cigarette to reflect that the slightly higher price he has to pay for his pleasures represents his contribution towards the relief of hardship amongst those who can rarely afford these luxuries.</P>
    <P>That is an appeal to the poorer sections and I think the Minister will be very lucky if, instead of being called the social welfare Budget, it is not called the Budget for the rich.  The rich have no particular interest in paying 2d extra for a pint or 4d extra for a glass of whiskey.  It is their fellow <Col N="1554" /> taxpayers who will foot this bill because the rich normally put it down in their expense accounts.  Neither will the higher price of petrol lie too heavily on the rich people because motor cars and petrol are also shown in the accounts of business and industry and the fellow taxpayers will pay for them.</P>
    <P>Representing such a constituency, my outstanding feeling in relation to this Budget is centred around these outrageous expense accounts which are still going strongly in this city and throughout the country.  Not only must the working people pay extra for their drinks and their smokes but they are saddled also with the additional burden placed on them by these expense accounts.  There was not a word about income tax.  I realise it would be wrong at this juncture, that it might affect development of business, industry and even agriculture, if income tax had been increased. Most or some of my constituents gained in that respect but would it not have been a gesture&mdash;it may not have brought in £1 million&mdash;if these expense accounts had been hit to some extent in this Budget?</P>
    <P>Would it not have been more appropriate for the Minister to have been in that position and to have said to the very people who are hoping to get increased benefits &ldquo;We are now taking away these heavy expense accounts which are of such benefit to certain rich sections&rdquo;?  But there is not a word about that.  I heard about a case of a luncheon in a city restaurant for four people and for which the bill was £27. That is only one instance and it is happening every day.  Twenty-seven pounds for an expense account luncheon!  That was paid for by me and by the rest of us here in taxation and by the poor people when they buy cigarettes and drink.  The Minister would have been very well entitled to have called this a social welfare Budget if he had taken that step of putting an end to these unreasonable expense accounts.</P>
    <P>I realise and recognise that in the carrying on of business in modern times, business people and industrialists are entitled to a reasonable measure of these expense accounts but this system here which has now become rife&mdash;you <Col N="1555" /> can walk up to any big restaurant at about 2.30 p.m. any day and see these people coming out in pretty substantial numbers&mdash;was taken over from England.  It arose in England as a method of getting around the excessive taxation brought into operation during the war and because of the war.  The burden of taxation in England was very heavy indeed and it was recognised that it was proper for people to get away with these expense accounts because of the very excessive taxation.  That excessive taxation exists in England but does not exist to the same extent here.  These accounts have become part of our economic life but there is not a word about them here.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start, the rich people who have these accounts are able to pass their income tax to a very considerable extent on to other taxpayers and are not in any way hit by this Budget, nor are the rich people generally. The people who smoke cigarettes or plug tobacco and who have to run a car for business purposes, commercial travellers and so on, are hit.  The other people can off-load it on to the other taxpayers.  That is a very grave defect in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I come then to find out what next we get out of it.  Certain of my constituents get additional benefits by way of the increased pensions and other benefits which are set out.  I have spoken here before&mdash;I was going to say until I got tired of it but I will never get tired of it &mdash;and indeed the last speech I made in the general election was from the platform in O'Connell Street, on the iniquity of the manner in which old age pensions and non-contributory widows' pensions are administered.  It is no exaggeration to say that many of these people are suffering what amounts practically to mental torture because of the way they are harried by Government officials prying into their concerns and asking: &ldquo;What work did you get yesterday?  How much did you earn this week?  Did your son give you something this week?  How much did he give you?  Did any of your other children give you anything?  Who pays the rent here?  Did the St. Vincent de Paul Society give you anything?&rdquo; That has been going on for years and it <Col N="1556" /> is about time it stopped.  On every Budget and on every Vote on Account I have spoken about this.  It is a source of great irritation amounting to mental torture to these people, particularly in respect of non-contributory widows' pensions.</P>
    <P>After one speech which I made this year&mdash;I think on the Vote on Account &mdash;I received a letter referring to this and I shall quote one paragraph from it.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>There is living in this area an old age pensioner who is a retired carpenter. He is still able to do light work for an hour or two at a time and it would suit him very well to earn an occasional few shillings from small jobs but such is the attitude of officials he is afraid to undertake such work.  I think this is not as it should be.</P>
    <P>This is only one instance.  I am sure we have all come across such cases.</P>
    <P>I said before, and I repeat, that if there were an easing up of this harsh administration in connection with non-contributory widows' pensions and old age pensions, and even unemployment insurance, there would be less demand and less necessity for increased old age pensions.  The position is that when the man or woman who works with a firm which has a pension scheme for their employees reaches the time when he or she is entitled to the old age pension, although the individual has been in receipt of the firm's pension, it is then automatically stopped.  Why should the private firm go on when the official comes along and says: &ldquo;You are getting a pension which you earned over the years and to which you are entitled&rdquo;?  Why should the private firm continue because they are paying an employee and the State is taking advantage of it?</P>
    <P>That is one matter.  There is another matter which is very cruel.  When these old people go into institutions or hospitals, as they do occasionally because of illness, their pension is immediately taken over by that institution or hospital and they are left in the very undignified position, amounting to an insult to the dignity <Col N="1557" /> of a human being, that they have not got a brass farthing.  All their money is taken from them.  If their sons or daughters or friends come in, then the next week they are asked: &ldquo;How much did you get from your relatives?&rdquo; and that is taken into account.  That is a matter which requires very great consideration.  It is a matter that justice demands should be ended.</P>
    <P>I remember years ago when I was very young listening to a Minister for Finance, and I remember his name, making a speech here and it has remained all the time in my mind.  He was giving an account of his stewardship at a time when the system initiated by us had not been adopted and it was merely a housekeeping Budget transaction, saying how much money was coming in and how much was going out and what he proposed to do.  He said that he would have a little deficit but that there would be no taxation required for that because he proposed to save that particular amount of money&mdash;which amounted to a couple of million pounds&mdash;from what was called the administration of old age pensions; that is to say, his officials would go around harrying people to see that they did not get sixpence or a shilling more than they were entitled to because of the fact that their children, their relatives or the St. Vincent de Paul Society or other charitable people came to their aid to assist them in living on their inadequate sums.</P>
    <P>That remained in my mind, and it is still going on.  I hope I will never leave this House until I see that system ended.  The Minister for Justice is making, and very properly making, certain efforts in connection with the administration of law, law reform and all that sort of thing and I will give to the Minister for Social Welfare and to the Government generally this suggestion, that there should be some method by which old age pensioners or social welfare recipients of one kind or another will have at least as a last resort some access to some court of justice.</P>
    <P>I suppose Deputies in the city have <Col N="1558" /> not yet forgotten the building strike of last August.  I had a particular case of the head of a family who unfortunately had lapsed in his payments to his trade union and was not entitled to any strike pay.  He applied to the Dublin Health Authority or whatever it is&mdash;it is impossible to find out, there are so many of these bodies, which is the last one&mdash; and he was told he could not get anything because he was on strike.  Because he was on strike and in arrears with his fees, he could not get strike pay and because he was on strike, he could not get money to save himself, his wife and children from starvation.  There was no appeal from that decision.  The only appeal was to kick up a row and this was duly done and I think some of the men were paid.  It is not good enough, in a matter of that kind affecting the very existence of people, that such discretion as these bodies appear to have should exist without any resort to the courts.</P>
    <P>That is just a very short outline of certain points&mdash;not all&mdash;that I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister on foot of the social welfare proposals.  I cannot pass from this subject, however, without asking the Minister if he has any notion of how many of these old age pensioners will actually receive the additional benefits.  These people get 37/6.  An old age pensioner I came across recently told me, whatever the cause was, that she had to buy very expensive drugs and had to pay for them out of that 37/6.  One can imagine how much was left.  I think that was a mistake: whoever was in charge apparently did not know she was entitled to get the drugs, even though she was not in hospital.</P>
    <P>Even adding 10/- to the 37/6, how can anybody live on it?  I suppose they lived on the 37/6 and presumably will live a little better on 47/6, but how many of them will get the extra 10/-? I suppose everybody in receipt of an old age pension is hoping to get the extra money.  It was paraded in some sections of the press as an increase in old age pensions of 10/-.  Of course old age pensions are not increased by 10/-.  Has the Minister any idea how many of these old age pensioners will benefit?  Is it 50 per cent, 40 per cent <Col N="1559" /> or what, having also taken into account the harrying methods of inquisition that will be increasingly adopted?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I should have thought that before the Minister came in with these proposals, he would have had the exact number.  I am sure statistics would have been available to him, and if he had the proposals, I should not be interrupted by the Minister merely saying that the Minister for Social Welfare said something somewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where I did not hear it, whether in this House or not.  The place to have it was in the Budget Statement.  It could be ascertained from the Statistics Office which we set up after Fianna Fáil had refused to do so for years.  That Office exists and it should have been possible to give a very close estimate in the Budget speech and that ought to have been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, as I see it, under this Budget is that the Minister for Finance says that there was tremendous buoyance of revenue this year.  There is no doubt of that.  He also says there was even greater buoyancy in expenditure and therefore it appears&mdash;and it happens to ourselves&mdash;the more you earn the more you spend.  Apparently, the Minister and the Government are in that position, that they are getting moneys as fast as they can in a most unexpected way and the more the wave comes in and breaks on the shores of the Department of Finance, the more money they spend.  We now have higher taxation each year, higher yield from that taxation, even though it is higher, and there is greater buoyancy, <Col N="1560" /> more money coming in and more going out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power said in my presence just before the general election in his speech on the Vote on Account that it was something that belonged to the bygone days for people to expect that if there was a higher yield from higher taxation and greater prosperity, there would be any relief in taxation.  They could put that out of their heads; they need not expect it; that was old-fashioned.  I cannot follow that reasoning but this Budget is based on it.  Not alone have we millions of revenue more than we expected&mdash;and we expected a lot and it exceeded our hopes and estimates and we spent a tremendous amount of money&mdash;but buoyancy is still there.  If this were an old-fashioned Budget, I think a way would have been found of getting the £1 million deficit that was found at the end of it all and things could have been left as they were.  Is it not astonishing that when you find in this Budget Statement that there is buoyancy of revenue, there is no relief of taxation?  It is out-dated and old-fashioned apparently to think that.</P>
    <P>There is not a single suggestion in this Budget speech&mdash;there was a little in last year's&mdash;of economy.  We have so much money now we need not bother about economy.  Do Deputies not think&mdash;certainly the public do&mdash; that it would have been a better policy for the Government to have tried to get the comparatively small amount of money required to finance the social services proposals at least by getting some economy in the public services? Is it to be taken that the Government and the Minister have abandoned all hopes of securing any economies in the public service or its administration? That appears to be the position.</P>
    <P>Last year the Taoiseach&mdash;and I criticised him for it&mdash;in his speech on the Budget of the then Minister for Finance, referred to the fact that he had directed that there should be a complete examination of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with a view to securing economy.  I watched with great interest the arrival of the Estimate for the Department <Col N="1561" /> this year and so far from there being the slightest sign of any economy, there was a vast increase in expenditure and not a word was said by the Minister on the Vote on Account, or certainly in the Budget Statement, of the economies in that Department or in any other Department.  The public must take it that this is now the system of finance: raise your taxes; you know you will get more money than you expect; you can always increase expenditure and nobody must look for anything in the nature of an easement of the burden of taxation through buoyancy of revenue or economies in the public service.</P>
    <P>Again, coming back to my constituents, where is there anything in the Budget that will ease the burden of rising prices for them?  Anybody who lives in the city of Dublin, and certainly anybody who lives in my constituency, will know how it is becoming daily more and more difficult for many people to live on their incomes, having regard to higher prices, but that is to be let rip, just the same as public service economy is to be forgotten about and to be let rip.</P>
    <P>A person whom I know very well was in a shop recently.  A lady came in and was looking at a particular thing she wanted.  She had to go out without buying it.  On inquiry made outside, it transpired that she had a very small income and had recently had an illness which cost a lot of money and was not able to buy any of that particular stuff for that week. That is not a single instance.  I am sure that even those people who are not able to live within their means, having regard to higher prices, in every single respect would be glad that other sections of the community would get benefits in social welfare services under the provisions of the Budget.  Yet, they will get nothing and will still have to pay the higher prices without any effort being made to keep prices down. They will still have to pay the higher and higher rates being imposed by Dublin Corporation, largely for health services which are of very little advantage.</P>
    <P>There is no end to the rating and to <Col N="1562" /> the amount of rates being imposed on these people.  They are not able to bear it.  There is no doubt about this proposition, that rates as such are the most unjust form of taxation that could possibly be conceived.  Rates fall upon people irrespective of what their income is.  Whether they have any money or whether they are rich, they pay the same.  The rich people pay much the same, proportionately at all events, as the person in a corporation house, even as the person in a corporation house who pays rent under the differential rents system.  The rates automatically put up the rents and no effort is being made to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>I could go at length through many other matters affecting my own constituents. I would just like to make this comment, in addition to what I have already said, on the particular form of the proposed taxation.  I am glad that intoxicating liquor has been taxed&mdash; not that I am in any way a confirmed pussyfoot or, I hope, intolerant in the matter of intoxicating drink&mdash;but when I see night after night, when I am coming home, rows and rows and lines and lines of motor cars outside every public house in this city until the last moment, then I say there must be a lot of money floating around amongst those people who own these motor cars and who are able to pay for that drink and would be able to pay an extra few pence.  While I am sorry for the publicans, nevertheless, one cannot be too sorry for people whose premises have gone up and up to astronomical heights in the market in recent times. I am sure the Minister does not like accepting bouquets from me but, if he likes, he can accept that bouquet, that I am glad that that particular item was taken as one of the Minister's objects of taxation.  As I said before, the rich people can afford it.  The docker and, certainly, the old age pensioner, cannot afford to have another pint.</P>
    <P>I want, in passing, to refer to the section about pensioners.  I should imagine that the proper place to deal with this topic of pensioners of all kinds would be on an appropriate Bill. I am sure a Bill dealing with this <Col N="1563" /> matter will have to be brought before the House.  We did get circulated to us in this document a report of the Committee on Post-Retirement Adjustment in Public Service Pensions. I read that very hurriedly.  It was only given in the last couple of days.  It certainly did not in its proposals bring conviction to my mind that substantial justice had been done to certain of the classes of public officials who had retired some years ago.  However, I do not propose to go into that in detail at this stage.  I am not competent to do it but I have sufficient information to be able to deal with the matter when it comes in the form of a Bill.  I would, however, like the Minister to give us this information&mdash; why the increase in State pensions was based on the cost of living in mid-February, 1964, which at that time was a figure of 165, and not on the current cost of living figure, mid-February, 1965, of 177 &mdash; an arrangement which involves a rather substantial loss to those pensioners.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to an old friend of mine, death duties.  I have been speaking about death duties for many years and when I was in a position to do so I did something about them.  I have been advocating the complete abolition of death duties for many years.  I suppose nobody took any notice of me.  Certainly, no Minister for Finance took notice.  We see in the Financial Statement of the Minister in this year that in response to various representations some relief of estate duty payable on small estates will be given, that he intends to grant certain abatement.  I do not know who made those representations.  I spoke year after year, I think twice a year, on the Vote on Account and on the Budget, pointing (1) to the injustice and inequity of estate duties and (2) to the fact that if they were abolished progressively you would get more money into the State by income tax from people who came here because of the abolition of death duties than you would get from death duties, which at one time represented only £2 million and which represent about £4 million now.  I <Col N="1564" /> pointed out that it was not merely a visionary dream of mine but a practical proposition, that it was an unjust imposition.</P>
    <P>It is now apparent from the Financial Statement that, so far from there being any hope of death duties being abolished, they are to be more firmly embedded in the fiscal structure of the State.  The abatement given is of very little consequence indeed.  The Minister has not given any reason, beyond stating the fact, for his intention to increase the period from three years to five years within which people may part with their property to their relatives without incurring death duty on their death.  Is the Minister taking up the attitude&mdash;it must be so in this proposal&mdash;that it is a bad thing that a father should distribute his goods to his children when they are young and when they can make good use of it?  I think it is a good thing.  The Minister says: &ldquo;no; we will salt you on that.&rdquo;  Probably what will happen is that the father will have to pay because he parted with it five years before to his children and the children will have to pay in some other way as well&mdash;in income tax certainly and possibly in a variety of these extraordinary taxes that a very efficient Civil Service is able to produce out of this death duty code.  It would turn your mind inside out to have anything to do with death duties.  Income tax is bad enough but death duties are beyond the beyonds.</P>
    <P>I have no notion why the Minister has made that increase.  It is unjust. The only justification for it&mdash;and it is not a justification&mdash;is that he wants to get in more money.  There is no other reason.  I challenge the Minister to say if there is any other reason for doing that.  It may be that he is copying the British.  That is frequently done in Finance Acts and Budgets.  The British have a different social system from ours.  Income tax was devised by a gentleman called Harcourt who caused a tremendous uproar when he brought it in at the end of the 19th century.  It was brought in for the purpose of redistributing wealth.  It was brought in to catch multi-millionaries who derived their wealth from mines and other big properties.  It has <Col N="1565" /> achieved its purpose in England.  We have none of these millionaries but we are on the way to having them.</P>
    <P>I should like to put to the Minister the effect, from the social point of view, which this proposal about death duties will have.  Does he, or anybody who is advising him, realise the effect this will have on the farming community?  One of the consequences of the imposition of these duties, in greater and greater degree as time went on in England, as war succeeded war and death succeeded death, was the complete wiping out of the estates of the aristrocrats of England.  They have used the device of passing over the liability to the Government on some sort of trust, whereby one can see around a ducal residence for half a crown and be personally conducted by the duke or earl.</P>
    <P>There are no such people in this country but there are farmers, and it will happen as sure as we are here&mdash; and the Minister has not thought of this&mdash;that certain farmers in this country, and they are not the wealthy farmers, will be liable to pay death duties and they will not be able to pay them because they will have saved nothing.  They will have to sell part of their farm, as death succeeds death, in order to satisfy the demands on the estate for death duty.  What will happen then?  This is a problem which has come to my notice personally only in the past few weeks, before the Minister's Budget came in.  The farmer was contemplating giving over certain parts of his farm to his son and he thought that if he did that and lived for three years he would be all right.  Now he will not be all right because the Minister will not let him, and portion of that farm will have to be sold at a public auction or otherwise and the farm will be subdivided in order to satisfy the demands of the estate duty office.  That is unjust and inequitable, and it is bad policy.  It is also bad politics.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the point of the increased pressure to deal with death duty avoidance.  The Minister says at column 985, volume 215, of the Official Report of the 11th May, 1965:</P>
    <P>I have been impressed by complaints of death duty avoidance and <Col N="1566" /> I propose to bring in provisions to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>There is avoidance only when a tax is unfair and unjust and when a person is not able to pay it, and many a good citizen has to resort to these things. Many a selfish citizen is getting away, through expense accounts and otherwise, with the avoidance of taxation that I and other people have to pay, but many a conscientious person has to try to find a method of avoiding what he considers to be an unjust tax, and more power to him as far as I am concerned.  Now we are setting up another section to harry people and their families in order to extract the last penny from their estates, and there is to be another imposition by the Department of Finance.  What is the point of it?  Who have made these complaints?  I have no doubt that it was the efficient officials of the estate duty branch of the Department of Finance who impressed the Minister, but what is the public need for this?  I can understand, in the case of income tax, if each person does not bear his due share of income tax then it falls more heavily on other people.  I have no use for those people who avoid income tax but in the case of estate duty, which will bear very heavily on individuals, I must take a different line.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the farmer I have mentioned.  He dies and his son succeeds him.  If a tragedy occurs&mdash; as could easily happen; the son may be run down by a motor car&mdash; inside 12 months there will be two death duty impositions on that property. It would be practically wiped out.  I have, as I said, spoken at great length on other occasions on this subject and I propose to do so as long as I am able to speak in this House, which I hope will be at least for the duration of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is another small matter on which I should like the Minister to give me some information.  At column 981 of the same volume of the Official Report he says he proposes to carry out certain recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation and that:</P>
    <P>... in certain cases where at present the decision of the Special <Col N="1567" /> Commissioners on claims for income tax relief is final, the taxpayer will be given the right to a rehearing by the circuit court judge and both the taxpayer and the Revenue a right of appeal by way of case stated to the High Court.</P>
    <P>... I propose also to authorise inspectors of taxes to admit late appeals against assessments in appropriate cases&mdash;a power reserved under existing law to the Special Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There is a great veil of secrecy over the right of appeal that the taxpayer has against the law in connection with taxation.  Years ago I raised this matter and I put down an amendment to the Finance Bill providing that, in all cases of any decision by the Special Commissioners or the inspectors of taxes, there should be a right of appeal to the circuit court judge. I was induced to withdraw that amendment very much against my will.  I want to know now what is being left unknown to the taxpayer, not capable of being found out even by a person like myself who practises the law. One cannot find out what powers the Special Commissioners have.  What the Minister proposes to do now is not to give an appeal in all cases to the taxpayer but in certain cases unspecified.  Why not give it in all cases?  I suggest to the House that in justice there ought to be an appeal in all cases where the Revenue Commissioners have the right of determining the amount of taxation to be borne by a particular taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the statement I have read I should like to know what is meant by saying to Minister proposes to authorise inspectors of taxes to admit late appeals against assessments in appropriate cases.  As those of us who practise the law know, people are, for a variety of reasons, frequently late and not always through their own fault.  Why should there not be power, in all instances where a proper case is made out, for a late appeal to be heard, if necessary an appeal to the circuit court judge?</P>
    <P>A more important matter to which <Col N="1568" /> I wish to refer has already been referred to by Deputy Corish.  I was very glad to hear him say what happened under our Administration in 1948.  I do not want to go back on that now.  I want to speak of my own immediate experience.  I have spoken about this before.  I will give one instance and I shall ask Deputies to judge the position here in Dublin on that particular case.</P>
    <P>In 1948, with the consent of my colleagues and, in particular, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I stated that no question of lack of money would interfere with our conviction that everybody in this State, who wanted a house, should get it.  We asked those who had gone away&mdash; bricklayers, plasterers, carpenters and craftsmen of all kinds&mdash;to come back and build houses here.  We would supply the money.  We did supply the money until we no longer had any power to go on doing that.  That was in 1948.</P>
    <P>We are now in 1965.  What is the position?  I have been approached in my own constituency.  I referred to this before.  I gave the matter publicity because I had thought that it was something that could not happen after 15 or 16 years of government by Fianna Fáil.  There is a family of six, father, mother and four children, living within a very short distance of where I live in Donnybrook.  Two of those children are sleeping in a pram and one on a chair.  Another was sleeping, I think, in the father's and mother's bed.  Two had been ill in different hospitals.  I asked a question and I got the usual stock answer from the corporation.  I asked my local councillor to help me.  He did.  After raising it here, after speaking about it and writing about it, I finally got a letter from an official saying: &ldquo;We hope to be able to reach the case of people who have six children in 12 months time, and perhaps in six.&rdquo;  That is the situation now at the end of this period of Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Is there any remedy?  Is there any conviction on the part of the Government that they are prepared to deal with this problem?  Is there any indication of their preparedness?  The <Col N="1569" /> problem still exists in the city of Dublin.  It is a problem, apart altogether from the houses that are falling down or that have had to be pulled down before they fell down.  The Government have no conviction.  As far as I can see, all they do is say: &ldquo;There is the money.  We will provide the money.&rdquo;  More than money is required. The Government must make those responsible do the job.  How often has money been provided and not spent in the particular year?  That is the position here.  I appeal to Deputies and, through Deputies, to the people, to realise the position of housing in this city.  They can judge on the particular case to which I have referred.  The real trouble I have in my constituency is not answering letters but people coming to me begging for houses.  They ask me can I do anything for them.  I have an answer now: &ldquo;If you want me to help you to get into Heaven, there is some chance of my doing that, but I have no chance of getting you a house from the Dublin Corporation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was interested in listening to Deputy J. A. Costello speaking of the particular Budget proposals relating to social welfare payments and the method of raising taxation to pay for them.  I do not think I am unfair to the Deputy when I suggest that he hinted that something more ought to be done than had been done to get money from the better-off people.  But every suggestion he threw out he more or less cancelled by implying that what he suggested could not be done.  That, I think, is a perfect indication of the lack of real&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;effort to plan policy by the Fine Gael Party.  He said there was no mention of income tax in the Budget.  In the next sentence, he said it would, no doubt, be unwise to impose any increase in income tax because of the way it would fall presumably upon the various sections of the community and because of its possible effect on industrial growth.  He did not make one listening to him feel <Col N="1570" /> that he was any way certain about anything.  I suggest he was trying to make the people in his constituency feel that in some way the Budget was wrong.  He put, in parentheses, all the warnings he felt himself sincerely to be true but left one with the impression rather that the people would read it both ways; there should be increased income tax and there should not be any increase in income tax.</P>
      <P>He referred to expense accounts, with a quite clear suggestion that, if the Minister for Finance took more account of the amount spent on expenses, it might be possible to garner some extra taxation.  In this particular context he referred to heavy drinking all over Dublin and suggested that some of the money for social services could be found in that direction.  Again, there was a little quick parenthesis: of course, perhaps not much money could be found by looking more carefully after the expense accounts.  Again, one feels Deputy J. A. Costello would like the people in his constituency to feel that this is not really a very good Budget.  If only the Government would collect tax, all these expenses people like those in his constituency would not have to pay so much.</P>
      <P>The whole speech was indeterminate. The Deputy knows perfectly well that expenses are very carefully scrutinised by the Revenue Commissioners and the inspectors will not allow expense accounts of any magnitude unless they are fully vouched for.  A great deal of control over all this was introduced in a previous Budget by a previous Minister for Finance.  Deputy J.A. Costello knows perfectly well that any further adjustment that might be made could not possibly affect the character of this Budget to any extent, but he has left the impression go abroad that somehow something is wrong.  The rich are not being sufficiently fleeced, but he was not, of course, sufficiently definite to commit the Fine Gael Party to a good wallop on the income tax, on direct taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their programme published prior to the election was rather like that, too. They were opposed to indirect taxation. Then, when one read all the colourful, <Col N="1571" /> rather longwinded paragraphs about direct taxation, so many provisos were included aimed at relieving people in various ways of direct taxation, that it was quite obvious that, even though they were opposed to direct taxation and appeared to think it was bad, they were not prepared to find an alternative. I might add that there was no examination by the Fine Gael Party in their published policy of the effect of indirect taxation accompanied by increases in children's allowances or benefits of one kind or another.  In spite of the thousands of words published on the subject, there was not complete examination to find how one could relate indirect taxation, such as the turnover tax, with increases in children's allowances to offset any antisocial effects.  Neither was there any mention by Fine Gael in that document of the £13 or £14 millions raised by the turnover tax, nearly one-third of which was remitted back again with the precise object of alleviating the undesirable effects of indirect taxation in so far as that affected people with lower incomes or large families.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy J. A. Costello made the position of his Party sufficiently clear.  He referred to the lack of proper planning, in his view, by the present Government.  He suggested the appointment of a Minister for Planning and quite clearly implied that under our system of planning in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> we had a whole group of people behind the scenes who never believed in spending money on anything and there was still an atmosphere of ultra-conservatism on the part of the officers in the various Government Departments and other authorities advising the various Ministers on planning for the future.  I do not know how that view of his contrasts with the suggestion of very serious over-taxation and over-expenditure by the Government made by other Deputies in his Party.  One has the peculiar impression now that the Deputy apparently thinks that the Government have not spent half enough because of over-restrictive ideas on the part of those who assist <Col N="1572" /> the Ministers to plan the programme. On the other hand, there is the other impression from the Fine Gael Party that the present Government are wildly extravagant.  At the same time, of course, no specific suggestions are made whereby expenditure could be reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also said that he implied to his constituents that, whereas he approved of the increase in social welfare payments, he felt somehow or other the money could have been found by economies in expenditure. He wanted that impression to go out among the people he represents, to give them this lurking suspicion that there need have been no taxation on tobacco and on petrol, if due regard had been had to certain economies in administration.  Every Deputy is entitled to charge and challenge the Government to be more economical in their methods of administration; but Deputy Costello knows perfectly well there has been a very big examination of the whole administration, that mechanical methods have been introduced, computers have been used and that every effort is being made to induce the maximum productivity in the Civil Service.  However, regard must be had to the fact that it never can be like a private commercial organisation because of the need to protect the public interest and weal and to ensure that every proposition is examined so that there can be the utmost impartiality and incorruptibility in making awards and deciding issues.  Deputy J.A. Costello knows very well that the limit to which one can engage in purely commercial attitudes in administering the government of a country is not very considerable.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also knows perfectly well that before the Budget the Estimates are examined, questioned and reduced, that a tremendous cross-examination takes place of every Minister in regard to the expenditure by his Department at every level.  Long before the Estimates are produced, very considerable economies are in fact made as a result of carefully pruning expenditure, examining every item with a view to ensuring that an excessive burden is not imposed on <Col N="1573" /> the community.  Yet, Deputy J.A. Costello chooses to give to the people of his constituency this thought, to spread this kind of rumour, that economies could have resulted in sufficient money being available without any increase in taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello did not solve the problem of what the Fine Gael Party mean by a Ministry of Economic Planning.  The House knows perfectly well that our Programme was examined in very great detail.  There were consultations with every industry in the country before the Programme was published.  Individual groups of industries were asked what progress they could make between now and 1970. Very close examinations were made of the trend in exports, the trend in production, of the industries which were more likely to face difficulties of one kind or another in the next five years.  It was not just a haphazard guess made by people who simply wanted to produce a programme for the sake of inspiring confidence in the community.  The Second Programme was planned in a very detailed way.</P>
    <P>In the same way, all the trends in regard to agricultural production, trends in the European consumption and the English consumption of agricultural produce, the varying prices for agricultural produce, the likely changes, as far as they could be foreseen, in the consumption of such produce, its destination and origin&mdash;all these things were examined before the agricultural section of the Programme was formulated.  As the House knows, the agricultural part of the Programme was formulated in the belief that we would some time join the Common Market.  It was not an exaggerated Programme.  It was based on the belief that at some time within the next few years we would be able to enter into a planned market system of the kind that is now developing in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>It would take far too much of the time of the House to explain how some of this planning was effected. Merely to illustrate how the plan was examined in connection with aviation development and airport development <Col N="1574" /> would take far too much time.  One would have to show how the various elements were related and how the predictions were made in respect of airport development and the growth of aviation over the next five years.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are still waiting to hear exactly how far the Fine Gael Party intend to plan the actions of the people, their movements, and production, whether a greater degree of Government guidance and compulsion is involved in the Fine Gael concept of planning.  In any event, we did not hear anything about it from Deputy J.A. Costello in his speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello made another observation.  He said with astonishment that in the course of a previous speech I indicated it was most unlikely there would be any very great relief in the burden of taxation in the course of the next five years.  He appeared amazed at that.  Yet, at the same time, other members of his Party are crying out for more expenditure.  Other Fine Gael Deputies use the well accepted formula: comparing the cost of any Government service with the gross national product of different countries. If that expenditure is lower here than it is in some of the countries that have had greater opportunities for free enterprise than we have had over the past hundred years, they then cry out there is a deficiency in the expenditure. If one were to read some of the paragraphs in the Fine Gael policy, one would have to ask oneself how it was conceivable that Deputy J. A. Costello should be surprised when we in our Programme have indicated that, as far as we can see, the cost of education, health, social services and housing needs will mean we will have to take roughly about the same amount in rates and taxes as a percentage of the people's production in 1970 as we are taking now, and probably a little bit more.</P>
    <P>At least, we have been frank about it.  Everybody can read the Programme. They can see the allocation of capital expenditure and the presumed allocation of current expenditure in all the years up to 1970.  They will note that at the end it is felt we will be taking <Col N="1575" /> something just over a quarter of the people's income in taxation and rates, 26 per cent.  We have frequently published the proportion spent by the Coalition Government in their last year of office, which was just under 23 per cent.  In the passing year the amount taken was just under 24 per cent.  The amounts have not differed.  We have gone into great detail to explain that taxation here is still comparatively light.  Other countries in Europe are paying considerably more in taxation and rates in one form or another as a percentage of their production.  The figure goes up to 30 per cent and, in the case of the northern European countries, from 28 per cent to 32 per cent.  Equally, it can be said, going back to the accounts of those countries in previous years, that the percentages have not greatly altered.</P>
    <P>There is no good in Deputy J.A. Costello talking about conservative Ministers for Finance, advised by officers dealing with planning who will never spend more money or advocate some new system and, at the same time, blaming us if we say so great will be the educational and other needs of this country that we cannot envisage great reliefs in taxation between now and 1970.  That does not mean there cannot be allowances here and there.  It does not mean the Minister for Finance at some period will not find the need to make allowances for certain categories of the community, if it is possible to do so, make allowances for people with large families, for instance.</P>
    <P>He may discover that in relation to the growth of educational needs in the future some allowance may have to be made for those people concerned with very heavy educational expenses. There are all sorts of individual changes which can be made in the impact of taxation rates on the different elements of the community that are the business of the Minister for Finance to examine, analyse and make reports to the Dáil upon.  Therefore, when one speaks of there not being a likelihood of the total weight of taxation being reduced, it does not mean the Minister for Finance is unable <Col N="1576" /> to make adjustments, and very essential adjustments, from year to year and from time to time.</P>
    <P>I feel very proud of the fact that our Party have been frank about this question of taxation.  I have not seen many general election campaigns during the course of which the Taoiseach of the day has made it quite clear there would be an increase in taxation.  I do not think anybody can accuse us of failing to give the facts about taxation and national expenditure on this side of the House.  We have been more than clear about this matter.</P>
    <P>We have made adjustments in the relief of the rates on agriculture.  These figures were running at about £4 million in 1956-57 and this year they will be over £12 million.  This is an example of very important adjustments made as an aid to farming.  It has been said farmers' incomes have not being going up at the same rate as the incomes of the non-agricultural community. I want to advert, in that connection, to the fact that the position in regard to agricultural incomes has, in fact, slightly improved.  Even if agricultural incomes are still too low, the relevant rate of increase is more satisfactory than it was.  In view of the exaggerated comments that can be made about the position of farming, I think it very wise to recall that between 1960 and 1964, the first part of the Second Programme, the incomes of the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors rose by almost exactly the same percentage, between 38 and 39 per cent.</P>
    <P>The problem now remains that although the actual incomes of the farmer allied with the skill they require and the hazards of their occupation are still too low even though the income growth is at least going up. It has been growing in the past four years by the same percentage as that of the non-farming community.  That is a satisfactory feature resulting from the Government's aid to farmers and the many projects which have been put into operation to help farmers increase the productivity of their land, to increase their crops and grass and to enable them to carry more stock.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the <Col N="1577" /> general economic position of the country and the care that will have to be exercised if we are to succeed in our economic programme and to avoid having the incomes of the country artificially inflated before we have actually earned the prosperity to justify the growth in such incomes.  There was considerable discussion, in the months before the general election on the ideal of a national incomes policy. A great many members of the Labour Party suggested that what we were looking for was not a national incomes policy but a national wages policy. There is a fear that no one will seriously examine a permanent basis for arranging a general increase of income every year on the basis of national income and the growth in productivity.</P>
    <P>Everybody seems suspicious of the idea of a national incomes policy and everybody who speaks of it is accused of merely wanting to hold the wages of workers down and to allow profits to increase at the expense of the workers. One of the most interesting observations of the National Industrial Economic Council was their report on the economic progress made in 1964 and the prospects for 1965.  The Council has published a table showing profits, rents and professional earnings as a percentage of the total national incomes for the different years and, equally, how wages and salaries, and pensions relate to the total national income.  The facts quite clearly show that in fact over the past three years the profits have not swollen in comparison with wages and salaries as a percentage of the total national income. If that is so, then those people who refused to accept the idea of a general incomes policy will have to look for some other argument if they are going to suggest that profits have become so inflated and they would never accept the idea of a rise in wages and salaries which would conform with the general growth in productivity of the community.</P>
    <P>I have said several times in this House that what I would like to see was a more genuine discussion on this and I have for example sought to secure a general understanding of an <Col N="1578" /> incomes policy which would enable the growth of wages every year to be such that the workers could keep at least the greatest proportion of what they received and that there would be but a little increase in the cost of living. If that is to take place, it would be interesting to have a more detailed discussion on what more assurance those who represent the workers would want. They already can examine the relation of profits in general to wages and sal aries.  If they feel, for example, there should be report on collective profits in industrial groups at the end of a period when there had been a re-calculation of the general recommendation for wage increases, why did they not say so?</P>
    <P>If the employers could be expected to communicate with the workers sufficiently so that every worker knew in a general way how much extra profit had come to the shareholders in his industry in relation to the extra remuneration he received over a period and if every worker was able to discuss that in a general way, would the idea of a national incomes policy become more acceptable?  If those who were opposed to this policy could be convinced that most prices were competitive and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce investigated all those, where investigation was really required, would they then accept more readily this concept?</P>
    <P>I mention this because there are problems we have to face in the future and one of them relates to the necessity of avoiding inflation, if we can possibly do so.  There are some people who constantly, from the background, trying to excuse inflation, imply that inflation is absolutely essential to national progress.  These people should read the record of Europe since the war in that regard.  They will find that the countries with the greatest economic growth rates since 1953 were the countries which took the greatest care to avoid inflation and made use of the national incomes policy concept so that the actual growth of production each year showed that it was not mitigated, so far as real spending power was concerned, by a very great increase in living costs.</P>
    <P>I think it is time all sections of the <Col N="1579" /> community made a much greater study of the countries in Europe where there has been a tremendous rate of progress.  They would see immediately how important it is for us to get some agreement not on some enormously complicated national incomes policy system but on a general understanding that wages and salaries will increase in a manner that will not cause inflation, that will not result in most of the wages being lost in price increases.  It would be a splendid thing if people would examine the result of that policy in some Northern European countries where it can be seen that, from year to year, the real wages of workers increased and were not lost through increases in prices that negatived the effect of their increased earnings.</P>
    <P>The four countries with the highest economic growth rate in Europe since 1953 were Germany&mdash;where the average annual income growth was 7 per cent with an increase in the cost of living of 2.7 per cent only&mdash;Italy, Austria and Switzerland.  In every case in these communities, it can be seen that whatever the trade unions desired, whatever the employers desired, they eventually came to an agreement whereby it was possible from one year to another to ensure a national incomes policy and that, even though it was not perfectly operated and even though there were exceptions and wage drifts, they were able, in the course of the year, to avoid the kind of inflation that we have had in the past year which simply cannot continue if we are to make real economic progress in the future.</P>
    <P>It may be noted that when the Government initiated the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> we were able to secure very considerable increases in the incomes of the people for the first three years without corresponding increases in the cost of living. The cost of living remained stable for the first part of that period.  It was only towards the end of the period that the cost of living started to rise very markedly, culminating last year <Col N="1580" /> when the cost of living rose between 7 and 8 per cent with a third of that due to increases in wages.  As I have said, this seems to me to be a matter requiring further thought and further consideration by everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>If it were possible, for example, with an actual wage increase of only 8 or 9 per cent in 1964, for the workers to retain the same amount in their wage packet as they actually got through an increase of 12 per cent, then it would have been better for the community.  They would not have suffered or lost anything out of their wage packet.  They would have kept the same net increase.  Export prices would have been more competitive. The lines of goods that would be exported in various industries would have been widened and broadened. More exports would have been considered and the effect of the re-equipment of industries and the greater productivity of industries would have been even more marked than before.</P>
    <P>It is equally true that moderate increases in wages not only benefit the workers themselves but compel manufacturers who are not considering re-equipping their firms to act more hastily and to go ahead more rapidly with plans for improving productivity. Quite obviously, there must be the right kind of balance.  The growth of national output last year, measured in terms of the current value of money as some 14 per cent, being reduced to a mere 4 per cent through increases in the cost of living is something which cannot be contemplated with anything but anxiety so far as the future of the country is concerned.  Members of the Government have been very clear in their position in regard to this.  They have never said anything which would discourage discussion on this very serious problem.  They have never taken the part of manufacturers against the workers.  They have constantly suggested greater communication between manufacturers and workers, greater disclosure of all the important facts which, on the one hand, will encourage workers to ask for higher wages and, on the other hand, would encourage them to restrain their demands if the only result <Col N="1581" /> is that they lose part of what they asked for through increased costs of living taking away from the gross value of the wage increase.  We have been particularly clear in regard to this.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in the course of his speech on the Budget, expressed the hope that we might be able to establish a rough guide each year as to how far wages could increase.  This, indeed, can be done experimentally.  It is very easy to adjust if it goes wrong.  It seems to me unreasonable, in the long life of this nation, over a period of a decade when the country is developing, to refuse to undertake an experiment of this kind which for a short period has proved so successful in a great number of Northern European countries where inflation has been contained.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is a matter for discussion between management and workers.  The Government cannot direct the national incomes policy.  It should be accomplished by voluntary action.  This will require agreement by the employers and by the workers.  It will certainly require a greater understanding between them.  I want to answer accusations of the Labour Party, particularly a remark that Deputy Corish made, that we are looking for a national wages policy.</P>

    <P>It is only possible to have a general national incomes policy, and one of the reasons why there has been confusion about this whole business is the very great difficulties encountered <Col N="1582" /> if one tries to be too precise about what a national incomes policy means.  There are industries which have not experienced sufficient growth of productivity. While the employers are re-equipping and reorganising their marketing, they may deserve consideration by the workers because of some temporary recession they are going through.  There are equally extremely buoyant industries with a very marked growth of productivity, where through the use of modern machinery the workers may feel they are entitled to better status and where the workers in that particular industry may not accept what would be a national average growth of wages.  There may be groups of workers within a community who are extremely badly paid, whom everybody feels should be helped in a particular year by an increase in wages beyond what was generally recommended as the guide for the year's economic development.</P>
    <P>As I have said, an incomes policy can be only a general guide and it must be agreed.  I want, on the occasion of this debate, to repeat in some more detail a few words spoken by the Taoiseach when he hoped that people would think about this problem.  If the Government can establish a feeling of goodwill towards the general concept and if we encourage communication between employers and workers by which they can understand each other's problems and above all try to avoid the feeling that each section is exploiting the other, progress can be made.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate things about failure to follow a general national incomes policy is that even if wages and salaries do go up markedly as a protest against increases in prices it generally will not work.  The simple result will be in another increase in prices, so that protests against what appear to be injustices in the form of demands do not bring the expected result.  Therefore, there is a greater need for more understanding between employers and workers on this matter.</P>
    <P>We are moving forward towards 1970 and it is essential that we show something more like the Austrian and the Swiss pattern of growth, where the rate of economic growth in real terms, <Col N="1583" /> allowing for increases in the cost of living, comes very much nearer the gross rate of increase than has been the case in the last two years.</P>
    <P>No doubt it is natural and human for people to suddenly want very big increases in salaries lasting over a period because of the growth in the national income and the evident growth in our national prosperity.  But, we are inevitably facing free trade, and we had difficulties recently through the imposition of the levy by the British Government upon the exports of this country.  We have to ensure far greater productivity in a number of industries where it is too low.  Having had this two-year sudden changes in incomes, an unusual increase in income all at once, inevitably there will be an unusual increase in the cost of living. We ought to be more conscious and careful in the way we look at these problems in the future.  This is an obligation on management and workers in their consultations together. Unless they understand each others' needs and unless the needs of industry as a whole are understood, it will be impossible to arrive at the kind of understanding which will be so necessary next year when this whole problem has to be re-examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister for Transport and Power talking about the kind of co-operation he desires between the workers, the unions and the employers. To hear the Minister for Transport and Power woo the trade unions is to me rather startling.  One has to have regard to the manner in which this Minister has treated the workers in the many State-sponsored industries for which he is responsible over a number of years, particularly the workers in CIE where he has been responsible for tearing up so many hundreds of miles of railway line, with a consequential loss of employment for many people. I have in mind also the kind of pension scheme this same Minister devised and imposed upon the workers of Bord na Móna.  I spoke on that particular pension scheme.  It was one of the worst and one of the most niggardly <Col N="1584" /> that could possibly be conceived in these times.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister seems to infer that it is the workers of this country who are responsible for all the economic evils with which we have to contend&mdash;this inflationary trend and this rise in the cost of living.  The Minister talks about the desirability of the trade unions accepting less than 12 per cent over 12 months ago in the national agreement.  But he carefully omitted to mention the salient fact that it was as a direct result of Fianna Fáil governmental policy that the cost of living spiralled and that the trade unions were forced to demand compensation for the increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>It was as a direct result of the deliberate policy of that Government in imposing the turnover tax this time 12 months that the price of all the commodities of life increased, particularly the essentials of life&mdash; bread and butter, clothing, fuel, light &mdash;as well as the cost of medicines for human beings while exempting them for animals.  It was as a direct result of the implementation of that turnover tax that this inflationary trend arose to which the Minister for Transport and Power has adverted and which caused the workers and the trade unions to demand, and rightly so, that they should be compensated for the worsening in their standard of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should cast our minds back to the attitude of the Government, and particularly to the attitude of the Minister for Transport and Power, who has talked so glibly here for the past hour, about co-operation between worker and management.  I dare say he was one of the architects of the pay pause, the document on incomes and output which was brought into this House a few years ago.  The intention of that document was, and Fianna Fáil have never denied it, to peg down wages&mdash;the &ldquo;pay pause&rdquo; it was called.  We will not quibble with words, but, as far as the Labour movement is concerned, it was an attempt to impose a standstill order on wages at a time when there was a <Col N="1585" /> deliberate policy to allow prices and profits to spiral skywards.</P>
    <P>We said, and we repeat for the benefit of the Minister for Transport and Power, that that kind of legislation was anti-trade union and antiworking class.  It was the power of this Party, backed by the trade union movement, 500,000 strong, which stopped the Government from imposing that pay pause on those classes.  We know the kind of mentality which exists in the Government in respect to the trade unions and the workers.  They have always attempted to blame the workers for all the problems, and to excuse themselves and others in our society who are the real culprits.</P>
    <P>This Budget has been called a social welfare Budget.  We are very pleased that the question of welfare has at last agitated the mind of the Government. We have always said we are concerned not with wealth but with welfare, with people and not with profits.  Therefore, the part of the Minister's Budget on this occasion which contained that uplift for the social welfare classes was liked by our Party and supported by our Party.  It was suggested&mdash;I might say asserted&mdash;in the Minister's statement, in the public press, on Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann, that there was a 10/- increase for the social welfare beneficiaries and the assistance elements in our society.  It has now been revealed that with this 10/- increase there goes an odious, niggardly means test which will have the effect of cutting out quite a large percentage of these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>It was a most despicable thing to apply a means test of £26 a year, or 10/- a week, in determining who will get the increase of 10/-.  A figure of £26 a year might have been used by Lloyd George 60 years ago in determining what would be given to the old age pensioners in Britain.  If this means that a large percentage of the aged, the sick and the infirm, will not benefit by the increase, as we feel they will not, I assert that this Government and this Minister have perpetrated a lie and a fraud on the Irish people, and they are particularly defrauding those against whom the winds of adversity blow <Col N="1586" /> hardest, the social welfare beneficiaries, the widowed, the aged, the sick and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Unless this odious means test is lifted, we look on this so-called increase of 10/- with suspicion and the utmost distrust.  We are anxiously awaiting a determination of just how many of the people it was supposed to help will actually benefit by it.  Whoever in the Department thought of this £26 must have realised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I would say that this means test must of necessity have the effect of nullifying this benefit to quite a large number of people.  Consequently it is untrue to suggest that there is a 10/- increase in this proposal.  The increase amounts to 5/-.  Be that as it may.  We welcome an increase of 5/-.  We are very pleased that at last we have got away from the 2/6 which was doled out to these categories last year at a time when the organised workers were seeking a 12 per cent increase.  At a time when the Government thought fit to give an increase in wage and salary scales to quite a large section of the community, many of whom had not even asked for it, they also thought fit to dole out 2/6 to the most helpless and most needy in our society.  In what we conceive to be a welfare Budget, we expect the Government to go much further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this Budget which will affect the lives of our people and give us that degree of full employment which we all desire to stem the haemorrhage of emigration.  There is nothing in it to improve the health services which must be one of the worst in Europe.  Our health services deny many people, all working class people, the right to hospitalisation, the <Col N="1587" /> right to a particular doctor when they require one, the right to specialist services and drugs and medicines when required, under the kind of odious means test applied to medical cards.  It is true to say that many people go to their God long before their time because they are denied these essentials under our archaic Health Act.</P>
    <P>Despite the vainglorious talk of Government spokesmen, it is true to say that we have the highest unemployment rate in Europe.  Despite the fact that our country has enjoyed partial freedom since 1922, we do not seem to have overcome the problem of providing jobs for our people.  When every progressive country in the world, and especially in Europe, is moving forward to a higher standard of life, to full employment, to a proper social welfare code, to proper health services, and to educational opportunities for all their children, this country of ours is still crawling on its belly.  When the Americans are thinking of putting a man on the moon, and the Russians are walking in outer space, we are still crawling on our bellies in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is something fundamentally wrong with the kind of system we have been operating here if we cannot solve these social evils.  I choose to think that the younger generation will realise the intrinsic worth of the policy and philosophy of our Party, as the only means of ensuring that the people will be adequately cared for. As a first essential, we would provide them with work of a gainful and productive kind.  We would ensure that the children of this nation, as we would expect in a progressive Budget from an Irish Minister for Finance in 1965, could expect an educational system under which we would at last see the end of snobbery and prejudice, under which the children of this country would be free at last to give their talents, their energies and their genius in the service of their own country. We would see a situation where our people would be adequately housed, where we would not have a situation in Dublin, the capital of our Republic, in which over 8,000 people wait for rehousing, while some 60,000 throughout <Col N="1588" /> the country are living in unfit dwellings.</P>
    <P>We would hope that the Minister would realise the importance of extending State enterprise in order to exploit the resources of our country and put people to work.  We must now admit that despite all the State aids and stimulants which have been lavished on private enterprise by Governments during the past 40 years, private enterprise is either unwilling or unable to do the job.  We believe in aiding and co-ordinating the efforts of private enterprise but it must be realised that where private enterprise is unable to provide employment opportunities, there is a moral obligation on the State to step in.</P>
    <P>In that respect we praise the Minister for Finance who, in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was responsible for establishing some State and semi-State undertakings.  We are intensely proud of Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, CIE, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, the ESB, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and all these State and semi-State bodies.  These industries have the stamp of permanency.  We had tolerated for too long the fly-by-night efforts.  We have poured too much of the taxpayers' money into holes in the ground from which we got no return. We ask and demand, therefore, that in a society where so many thousands of men and women are idle and where the vast resources of our country and of the sea which bounds it lie dormant and unexploited, the Government should come to terms with the problem because a Government who tolerate that situation are guilty of dereliction of duty to their people.  We in the Labour Party shall condemn that type of inertia, incompetence and indifference.  We shall support in this House every effort to expand State enterprise.  When public enterprise has proved its ability to succeed, there should be no suggestion of its return to private ownership.</P>
    <P>I have said that the badge of permanency goes with State enterprise.  In these industries one expects that the human factor will always be taken into account.  In these industries <Col N="1589" /> people find secure work and decent conditions and we should see to it that the profit motive alone does not prevail but that service to the community is the real criterion.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister for Transport and Power and others speak a lot about the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> The Government would seem to be bereft of any policy in recent years and, in my opinion, were very largely depending on entry into the Common Market by January of last year.  In anticipation of that entry, we had no positive Government planning whatsoever. In respect of any good which we might get from entry into that extensive market, the Government would have accepted the kudos and if any economic evils had sprung from it, the Government could have blamed the fact that we had to go into the Community because we had no alternative.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in their over-anxiety to enter that Community the Government embarked on a programme of reducing tariffs and quotas, thus exposing Irish industries to imports from outside and the further possibility of serious dumping. It is particularly unfair that the protection which Irish industry enjoyed over a long number of years should now be dismantled rather indiscriminately at a time when there does not seem to be any possibility of our benefiting from this great market in Europe.  It might be all right if we knew for certain we were going in next month or next year.</P>
    <P>Our entry depends on Britain's attitude and from what I can gather from the policy of Britain's Labour Party, Mr. Wilson and his Cabinet do not have any inclination to join the European Community until certain positive safeguards are assured for his Government.  In the light of the belief that the possibility of our entry is fading rather than becoming more promising, I appeal to the Minister for the retention of these tariffs and quotas in order to allow Irish industry to reestablish itself and improve its position in the atmosphere of freer trade which we know is inevitable in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> On the question of planning in general, the Party which I have the honour to speak for have always cried out for a co-ordinated plan, at Government level, for intelligent planning of our economy.  That has always been the aim of the Labour Party.  Not a few weeks ago, on the eve of a general election, did we call for planning on welfare.  They have always been an integral part of our policy and philosophy over the past 40 years.  We have always believed in intelligent, planned, economic development and we support the Government in regard to any possible planning they may embark on.</P>
    <P>Certain claims were made for the first economic plan and admittedly it did achieve some good things.  However, the most glaring defects in that plan were obviously overlooked by Government spokesmen in presenting its effects.  One must not forget that the intention of the first plan was to create full employment.  Full employment was its keynote.  It was backed by slogans in 1957 calling on the women of this country to put their husbands back to work.  They were told to accept the plan and everything in the garden would be lovely.  But during the period of the first plan, from 1958 to 1963, 170,000 of our people were forced to emigrate.  That was the effect of the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i>; we lost in a haemorrhage of emigration 170,000 people.  The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which is now in operation will be judged in the light of its likely effects on our main problem, the creation of new jobs quickly for all those in need, will be judged by the desirability of price control, of equilibrium in our balance of payments and by a rising standard of living for our people.</P>
    <P>The Second Programme forecasts the attainment of a growth rate which would mean an increase of 78,000 jobs by 1970.  My leader, Deputy Corish, has already adverted to this aspect of the plan, but it needs emphasising and I will repeat it.  The aim is 78,000 jobs by 1970 compared with 1960 and this represents an increase of under 8,000 jobs per year.  That is precisely <Col N="1591" /> less than half the number of jobs required.  It is disquieting in the extreme for us in the Labour Party to learn that assuming that this Programme is fulfilled in its entirety, in 1970 we shall still have an unemployment rate of 3½ per cent and an emigration rate of not less than 10,000 persons per year.</P>
    <P>Far from the full employment proposed in the 1958 plan, there is no full employment either in the 1970 plan, so that this Government are obviously satisfied that for them full employment is impossible in our society and that emigration is something we must suffer on with as inevitable. However, let me say that we in the Labour Party will never accept that kind of economic thinking. Again, the growth rate set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will not even begin to bridge the gap between our living standards and those of other progressive countries. A revealing table shows Ireland's gross national product per head of the population as being £360 in 1970, whereas Britain is shown as having in 1961 a gross national product per head of £510.</P>
    <P>It is clear to us that the targets set by the Government are totally inadequate to bridge the standard of living in this country <i>vis-à-vis</i> Great Britain and the countries of the Common Market.  We appreciate that targets of this kind are difficult to achieve and we accept and face the fact that some radical changes in policy are required.  We would not shirk the responsibility of bringing about these radical changes in policy if need be in order to achieve the desired targets. We reject this attitude of helplessness and hopelessness on the part of the Government in respect of fulfilling this plan.  If we are over critical, it is because we want to see this plan pursued and perfected and the targets set attained.</P>
    <P>When the first plan was being considered in conjunction with the trade union movement, the Labour movement suggested at the time that the progress set out was much too low. It was fixed at a two per cent growth rate per year.  We suggested that that <Col N="1592" /> could be increased and that our people and our economy should and could be geared for higher productivity than a mere two per cent.  We were told we were being unrealistic in hoping for a greater growth rate than two per cent and what happened?  Over the years of the first plan a growth rate of four and a half per cent was achieved instead of two per cent.  You will see, therefore, that by accident rather than by design a growth rate of four and half per cent was achieved. Again, when the programme for economic expansion for 1970 was being considered we again suggested, and we suggest now, that the growth rate fixed should be further increased and could be attained.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that the Government are not prepared to go beyond what in economic jargon is called economic forecasting.  This is not a plan; it is a mere programme and the Government hope by exhortation and inducement to see this plan perfected and accomplished.  We say that with the kind of economic and social factors with which we have to contend the Government should be prepared to move in and, if necessary, direct in order to achieve the desired targets of this plan.  There is no hint in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in regard to the desirable machinery or arrangements to ensure that the targets and objectives are realised.  In essence it amounts to planless planning.  What is clearly desired is a national planning board, an economic council, removed from interference by Government control and whose bounden obligation and duty it would be to see that this plan is pursued, perfected and achieved.</P>
    <P>It is futile to talk of a plan of this kind if the objectives are not realised. It is sobering to think that from 1958 to 1963, despite the number of people who were taken in, fooled and misguided into believing that this kind of plan would attain full employment, we had instead one of the greatest haemorrhages of emigration this country has experienced since the Famine of 1847.  We all know that extra taxation will be required to <Col N="1593" /> maintain the essential services and to give the kind of social services we all desire.  Our Party have always been willing to support any Government in respect of raising taxation for these desirable things, to improve health and educational services, to create new employment opportunities, for rehousing and so on.  The only condition we lay down in respect of taxation is that it should be fair, equitable and just and so proportioned as to ensure that it falls on the backs of those best able to bear it.  That is why we resented so deeply and met with such hostility the imposition of the turnover tax.</P>
    <P>This was an instance of a tax that was flagrantly unjust, unfair and unequitable in that it extracted from the poorest of our society as much as from the rich.  It was essentially an evil system of taxation against which this Party set their face.  We are concerned too in that it is a very easy device for any Minister for Finance: to collect revenue in future, all he has to do is to increase that odious tax by the percentage required to get whatever he needs.  It constitutes a serious threat to stability in management-employee relationships about which the Minister for Transport and Power spoke so much tonight.  It was wise of the Minister for Finance on this occasion not to have the audacity to increase the turnover tax and to choose certain items for taxation instead.</P>
    <P>We should have much preferred, in regard to the taxes imposed in this Budget, if the Minister had secured his revenue from the things the then Minister for Justice spoke about 12 months ago, prior to the implementation of the turnover tax, when, in his own constituency he said the turnover tax would be put on the luxuries of life, on furs, jewels, cosmetics and costly cars and such things.  He told the people that is the kind of taxation they would have.  We should have much preferred that rather than the great betrayal which, in fact, took place.  We should have preferred that the jewels, furs and cosmetics of the jet set in our society should be taxed rather than the commodities of the working classes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> For me it was particularly sad that the price of the working man's pint was again increased.  The only satisfaction the producers in this country, the working classes, have, after a hard day's work, is sitting down in the company of their friends to enjoy a few pints.  It is time to stop exploiting these classes and continually picking out this particular drink for increased taxation. It is particularly disturbing that the Minister having increased the price of the pint by one penny, we should now witness what I can only describe as an act of exploitation by the publicans, of this city particularly, when they increased the price of the pint by 100 per cent more.  The Minister increased it by a penny and I understand they are charging twopence.</P>
    <P>This is what happens all the time. Some people bemoan the thought of their commodity being increased in price but when it happens, they move in and increase it still further to have an extra profit out of the public at large.  I ask the Minister to consider showing the same courage and determination as he showed in relation to other sectors of the community when they increased prices in recent times and to ask these people to justify increasing the price of the glass of whiskey by 100 per cent and also the price of the pint.  If it was the Minister's intention to increase the price of the pint by a penny, that should have been stated categorically to these people. We must ask where is the justification for adding another penny.  If the Minister increases the price of a glass of brandy or whiskey by twopence where is the justification for increasing it by fourpence?</P>
    <P>I must deplore the action of the Minister in continually picking out these commodities which can no longer be regarded as luxuries.  I am particularly concerned and perturbed that so many of our aged people who long for a drop of whiskey can no longer hope to have it.  The only place the average working class person, particularly the poor, the aged, and the sick, will ever see a glass of whiskey again&mdash;not to talk of brandy&mdash;is in an advertisement or in a publican's window.  The price <Col N="1595" /> of these things has gone beyond the reach of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>There is a humane approach to this problem in other countries.  In Northern Ireland and in Britain, it is recognised that a stimulant of this kind, a drop of whiskey or brandy, is essential for old people, especially poor people, that it is medicinal.  I am sure there are thousands of old people in the country whose tongues are out for &ldquo;a drop of the `cratur&rdquo;' tonight but they can never hope to have it; it has gone beyond their reach.  Many of them will be parched for a drop of brandy or whiskey unless some benevolent friend should offer it to them.  Other countries have recognised this need and they provide cheap stimulants of this kind for their old people.  In Northern Ireland and Great Britain, I understand there is a provision whereby old age pensioners are entitled to a certain quota of these drinks at a reduced rate. I ask the Minister in future, when he thinks of imposing further increases on drinks of this kind, to have regard to the working classes as producers of the wealth of this country, to whom the pint is an essential, and to have regard to the sick and the aged poor for whom a drop of brandy or whiskey is as essential a stimulant as the pills or medicines which a doctor might prescribe.</P>
    <P>The Minister is unwise in selecting items of drink for further taxation.  It is significant that countries in which drink is cheap attract tourists in very large numbers.  One has only to think of places like the Channel Islands to realise the importance from the tourist's point of view of the consideration that he will get his drink cheaper there than in his own country.  The fact that we could say abroad that drink was cheaper in this country than in Britain or Northern Ireland or the Continent would have the effect of attracting very large numbers of people to this country.  I would like the Minister to realise that.  I choose to think that the Minister would derive more revenue from tourism than he will derive from the increases on intoxicating liquor imposed in the Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> I welcome that part of the Budget which makes provision for increases for social welfare beneficiaries and would like to express the hope again that the niggardly means test of 10/- a week in respect of the full 10/- increase in pension will be eliminated or else modified to a more realistic figure.</P>
    <P>I want to express the bitter disappointment of this Party that, otherwise, the Budget contained nothing that would signpost the way to the attainment of the price stability, the rising standard of life, the stemming of emigration and the creation of the full employment to which we aspire. Neither does it do anything to give us any reason to hope that we will have the decent health services which are so long overdue or that in respect of education we will at last see the barriers of snobbery torn down, the corridors of the Department of Education permeated by enlightened thinking and the children of our nation at last free in their own country to give their talents and their genius in the service of their own country and to no other, be it John Bull, Uncle Sam or anyone else.  We claim for them the right to live and work and marry in their own land.  We do not think it is outside the bounds of possibility that we can secure for them the same high standards, the same social welfare code as can be witnessed in all the progressive countries of Europe and which this country so obviously and sadly lacks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget of 1965 will be remembered as a social welfare Budget.  The Budget was eagerly awaited by the people and particularly by the Fine Gael Party because we had fought the recent general election in support of a just society.  We offered to the electorate a policy clearly indicating a just society.  We pointed out the injustices that were being done to the people who were in receipt of social welfare payments, our poor housing conditions, inadequate health services, limited facilities for education and the neglect of the old age pensioner and the handicapped.  The electorate did not accept our policy but there are many reasons for that.  Opposition was <Col N="1597" /> offered to that policy by the Government Party during the election campaign. They said it would be utterly impossible to implement that policy, that the necessary money could not be provided.  It is rather amusing to find that in this Budget the Fianna Fáil Party have accepted the first leg of our policy.  It is now clear to everybody that we have succeeded in getting the Government Party to accept it.</P>
      <P>Admittedly the Minister in his Budget proposes to give some help to the old age pensioners.  It must be remembered in this connection that on 28th November, 1964, there were 3,045 old age pensioners in receipt of public assistance, which should have proved beyond question that these people could no longer exist on the miserable 37/6d they were being paid and that that was a deplorable position for any Government to allow these unfortunate people to drift into.  That figure is six months old, and if a more recent figure were available, I am sure we would find that it is now much higher than 3,045.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister did not give a straight 10/- increase to every old age pensioner.  There will be very many of them who will be disappointed. Persons whose income is less than £26 a year will get an increase of 10/-; persons whose income is over £26 will get an increase of only 5/-.</P>

    <P>We were told by the Minister that he had to impose extra taxation of 5d. per ounce on tobacco, 4d.  per packet of cigarettes, 2d.  per glass of spirits, 3d.  per gallon of petrol and oil and 1/- per bottle of wine to provide the money for the old age pensioner, the widows and orphans and persons in receipt of the infectious diseases allowance. On the day following the introduction of the Budget, we found that manufacturers had increased their prices; a few days later the wholesalers increased their prices.  I suppose that tomorrow or the day afterwards the retail trade will be collecting the increased price from the consumer.  The unfortunate position is created that the old age pensioner must wait until 1st August to get his increase, despite the fact that the money is already being collected and going into the Exchequer. <Col N="1598" /> Persons who will get increases in unemployment assistance will have to wait until January.</P>
    <P>Those persons who benefited by the seventh, eighth and ninth rounds of wages and salary adjustments&mdash;civil servants, the Garda, the Army, local government officials, were paid on most occasions six months' or 12 months' or 18 months' arrears.  The unfortunate old age pensioner must live another few months in order to qualify for what he is entitled to get from a just society.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking in this debate last week, said that there will not be another general election for many years and urged that Party political interest should be left aside. Later in the same speech he told us that there were 1,500 houses vacant in Dublin city in 1957.  The explanation was, I assume, that the people had emigrated.  In the next breath, he told us that a new Housing Bill would be before the Dáil in a few weeks' time and he expected that 12,000 to 14,000 houses per year would be constructed. He did not say in what year building would be commenced.</P>
    <P>There are different points of view about the housing position of 1957 but I do not think it should matter to the House now what the position was in 1957 or 1948 or at any other period.  Our people are solely interested in the Government's housing policy of 1965 and 1966.  It would be no harm, as previous speakers have said today, if the Minister for Local Government would make a statement on housing.  In introducing the new Housing Bill, I hope he thinks of 3,000 to 4,000 houses in the constituency which I represent, Roscommon and South Leitrim.  These houses are condemned as not fit for human habitation. The unfortunate people who own them and live in them cannot afford either to build new houses or to reconstruct the old houses.  They are rather poor people whose valuations are very low.  They are all farmers, and with the present grants that are being given by the Department of Local Government, they cannot afford to undertake the responsibility of doing the work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> It is a pity that when introducing his Budget the Minister did not give some thought to providing relief for the small farmer.  Crocodile tears are shed occasionally by the Government Party in regard to the west of Ireland. When we speak of small farmers, we usually think of the west of Ireland. Over the past year the small farmer has had to suffer substantial increases in the cost of the necessaries of life. He serves many a useful purpose. In relation to our adverse trade balance we are hoping the small farmer will continue to produce the calves and other agricultural products for export which have a great effect in redressing our adverse trade balance.</P>
    <P>This year the small farmer is asked to pay more for his tobacco, cigarettes and beer, and to pay higher rates. Shopkeepers have now become glorified tax collectors.  A few years ago they had the PAYE system imposed on them.  Last year the turnover tax was introduced and they must collect it.  This year they are asked to collect more taxes on tobacco, cigarettes, beer and spirits.  They are passing through a tough period.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the population figures, particularly for the west of Ireland and the constituency I represent. I have mentioned these figures here before but to no effect.  In 1926 the population of Leitrim was 55,907; in 1961 it dropped to 33,468.  In a period of 35 years, therefore, there was a drop of 22,439.  In Roscommon, over the same period the drop was 24,341.  That gives a total drop of 46,780 in a 35-year period, and the people are still leaving.</P>
    <P>I was highly amused by the reply of the Minister for Finance to a question today.  In 1963, the number of civil servants employed was 30,045; in 1964-65 the number rose to 31,087; and in 1965-66, it rose to 32,329, which represents a total increase over a two-year period of 2,284.  If the same attention were paid to the west of Ireland as is being paid by this Government to Dublin and other big centres, our population would not be dwindling at the rate it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not speak here very often but I take this opportunity of saying a few words on the occasion of the Budget debate.  The introduction of the Budget always arouses interest among all sections of the community in towns, cities and rural areas.  This time it has aroused a greater than usual interest, more or less due to the fact that we have just had an election.  Speeches were made and promises given all over the country and new Deputies and new Ministers have arrived.  However, we as an Opposition Party are not satisfied that enough has been done for the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>Only last week I asked a question as to how many of our old age pensioners were in receipt of home assistance in each county, and the answer was rather surprising to me.  In two or three of the best counties, the figure was over 300.  One of them was County Louth and the other was County Cork.  That goes to show to any fairminded person that our old age pensioners are far from satisfied with the sum of 37/6.  Now that the Budget has been announced we are told that with an income above £26 10/- a pensioner may qualify for 5/-.  I travelled around quite a bit throughout my constituency before the election.  I met old age pensioners who appealed to me very sincerely to try to do something for them.  I hope this increase will relieve their anxiety but I am certain that, with rising costs and rising prices, these people will still be in need of home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister did not go the whole way and give the 10/- increase to everybody because those who are getting 22/6d as against 37/6d also need an increase.  The position is not really satisfactory as far as the people in the west are concerned. The majority are small farmers. The towns and villages are, I admit, harder hit than are the small farmers because there is wholesale emigration from the area and no trade to speak of, even in the medium-sized towns like Manorhamilton, Ballina-more, Carrick and many others I <Col N="1601" /> could mention.  Emigration is hitting our part of the country very severely. Homes are closed and, as a result, the small trader is being wiped out.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the people are not getting a fair deal considering the amount of money being spent on housing, roads, drainage, Land Commission work, forestry, health services, and many other things.  There are still people living in the most appalling conditions.  Last Saturday I met a young mother.  She has four children. She described her position as quite horrible.  It was plain from her own appearance that she was living in horror of what the future held for her. She is living in a home in which she is not wanted, but her husband had no alternative.  Her four children are rushed off to school in the morning and she tries to persuade them to come home as late as possible.  When they do come home, she has to keep them quiet until such time as she can put them to sleep in the smallest little apartment in the house.  That is just one example of the cases that are brought to my notice.  Families like this will ultimately become long-term patients in some hospital or other in which they will have to be maintained by the State.  The only result of living lives like this is a breakdown in health and in spirit.</P>
    <P>This problem should be tackled immediately.  Up to £50,000 is spent on a small stretch of road.  We are told that the expenditure has been sanctioned by the Department and the money must be spent.  If these grants were diverted to housing for a year or two, our ratepayers would get much more satisfaction out of expenditure in that direction as against improving roads for the benefit of people who come in here for a few weeks or a few months to have a good time and enjoy the beauty of the countryside.  When we make representations about housing the people, we are told they will have to avail of the grants.  A grant to a family with no means is quite useless. A bungalow will cost something in the region of £2,200.  The most a small farmer will qualify for by way of supplementary grant from the county council is £929.  That has no appeal for <Col N="1602" /> people who have no means and no money to spare.</P>
    <P>There are many people in that position. They make representations to other Deputies as well as to me.  Local authorities are not inclined to go very far with the scheme because it is a rather elaborate scheme considering the rates.  In my area the rates are in the region of 66/6d in the £ and 64/6d in Deputy Gilhawley's area.  I appeal to the Government to get down to hard facts and deal with this problem.  It is an urgent problem and one which is forcing many young men to leave this country.  I have known these young men to arrive in a city in England with their mothers, brothers and sisters because they have no home here to shelter them.  We know what housing conditions are like in England.</P>
    <P>I mentioned rates.  We would like to know when the network of by-roads will be dealt with by the Government. We get a very substantial grant for main roads but the grant for county roads is very limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the plight of the lower and middle income groups where health services and hospitalisation are concerned. I know people who are at a loss to know how they will continue to pay the high cost of medicines.  It may be a question of 15/- to 30/- a week for a small box of tablets.  These are the people who need increased allowances under social welfare.  Our hospital services are far from adequate. Because of the Health Acts, there is <Col N="1603" /> today a greater demand on hospitals. Many people are availing of the hospital services who would never have dreamt of doing so hitherto.  It is very hard for those people to meet the costs of hospitalisation.  This is a matter constantly being brought to the attention of Deputies all over the west and the sooner something is done about it the better it will be.</P>
      <P>People are very disappointed because there is no agricultural grant in this year's Budget.  A great many commodities have increased in price.  Most people have cars today.  The £1 we were paying for petrol 12 months ago is now £1. 2/.  The sooner the Government consider giving some relief to the farmers the better it will be.</P>
      <P>Rates are now extremely high.  If rates continue to rise, there will be a revolution here.</P>
      <P>Now that the people are so heavily taxed, it is no harm to bring to the attention of the Government the plight of young people in the rural areas who have to travel 12 or 14 miles to school. You see them grouped at the crossroads at 8 a.m. in the dark months of the winter.  They have to go perhaps 14 miles to Sligo or Manorhamilton and it is dark again before they get home.  This may sound strange to city people and those living in towns, but nevertheless it is the situation in my area.  The sooner we have schools to meet the needs of children living in the country, the better.  To avail of the benefits of a full vocational education course, the children have to go into these centres.  We cannot have first-class schools everywhere, but there should be a smaller type of school to cater for the needs of boys and girls who will eventually settle on farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies spoke about unemployment, of which we have much experience in our constituency.  Even the small groups of men who work in each church area for the county council are idle for almost four months of the winter.  It is too bad that that should happen.  How can a man living in a cottage hope to maintain himself and his family for those four months on unemployment benefit?  It is sad to think we cannot provide more employment <Col N="1604" /> than that.  The council cannot advance the money because it has to come out of the ratepayers' pockets.</P>
    <P>We are proud to know that the State bodies employ so many men and women.  Nevertheless, many young people of 16, 17 and 18 years have to ask themselves what job can they find. A small number of them secure jobs in the county council offices.  Some of them become civil servants, perhaps in the city here.  But the majority of them have no alternative but to emigrate.  It is sad to see a mother and father at the railway station bidding good-bye to their boys and girls, whom they would love to have in Dublin or Sligo, and able to come home.  In 1964, 25,000 went and in 1965, 27,000.  The majority of them would wish to be at home, but there is no employment for them.  After 40 years of self-government and with a population of only 2,800,000 in our little country it is a sad reflection that we have to export so many of our fine boys and girls, who could be a great asset to our country and make it more prosperous and productive in every way.</P>
    <P>Many of our small farmers could make a better living if representations made by us to the Forestry Division of the Land Commission were taken heed of.  We often ask that land, which would eventually make a comfortable holding, be given to a farmer, but the Forestry Division will not accede to representations of this kind.  In the interest of fair play and with a view to keeping a farmer on the land, very careful consideration should be given to such representations.  If a plot of good land beside a man's holding is taken away, you do not give him much encouragement.</P>

      <P>The fact that in this Budget more substantial provision has been made for social welfare improvements has led to the Budget getting a more favourable reception than it would otherwise have received.  It has been described by the Minister for <Col N="1605" /> Finance as a social welfare Budget. I believe it has been deliberately so described in order to distract attention from its many weaknesses and shortcomings generally.  So far, if that was the aim, it has succeeded.</P>
      <P>Almost every Deputy who spoke welcomed the increased social welfare benefits that have been provided.  It is my view that these benefits are still inadequate.  They are long overdue. They go only part of the way towards relieving the worst hardships of the poorest sections of our people.  I was amazed to hear from the Minister for Social Welfare that no fewer than 70,000 of our people will not qualify for the 10/- increase.  The 10/- increase will apply only to people whose incomes do not exceed £26 a year.  It is hard to believe that that number of people had only 10/- a week to live on before they got the old age pension, but apparently that is the case.  It means that when these people get their increase of 10/- they cannot have more than £2-17-6 from all sources, and many of them will have much less.  Of that, 10/- is their own private income from some source or other.</P>
      <P>This is still not sufficient to provide for the most frugal needs of these unfortunate people.  As a result, they are being forced into hospitals and institutions all over the country.  These institutions are crowded out with old people who should be able to live in some sort of frugal comfort in their own homes or the homes of their relatives. If the pensions provided for these people were more adequate, many of them would be kept at home and would be much happier there.  There is a good case to be made for this, not only from the humanitarian point of view, but on purely economic grounds. The cost of keeping such people in institutions is fantastic by comparison with the cost in their own homes if we gave them reasonable pensions.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that when these social welfare benefits were being provided there was no mention at all of any improvement in children's allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan today asked the Minister for Justice whether any direction or advice, written or verbal, has been given or conveyed by him or his Department to any branch of the Judiciary or the District Court Bench either collectively or individually as to how the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, or the Rules made thereunder should be operated or interpreted; and if any such direction or advice was given or conveyed in writing if he will lay a copy of such writing before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his reply, stated that the views expressed by his predecessor in 1962 and by himself in introducing his Estimate this year were communicated in writing to the Justices of the District Court so that the Justices might adopt a uniform, practical approach to applications.  He said also that the views were also communicated to the President of the Circuit Court for communication to Circuit Court Judges.  Finally, he said it would be contrary to established practice to publish communications of this nature and he did not propose to do so.</P>
      <P>I gave notice that I proposed raising this matter on the Adjournment and I do that not out of any desire to embarrass either the Minister or his officials but simply because I believe there are two principles of fundamental importance involved in the disclosures which the Minister made here today.  I believe it is a matter of vital and fundamental importance to all of us and to all citizens of this country that we should ensure through our actions in the Dáil that there will be a completely free and independent judiciary who will function without any interference whatever from the Minister for Justice, the Government or any State officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe also that it is a matter of fundamental importance, particularly to Deputies and to the general public, that if communications of the sort disclosed in the Minister's reply here today are made the contents should be disclosed when they are requested <Col N="1607" /> by any Deputy by way of parliamentary question.  It was disclosed by the Minister today in connection with what is commonly called the free legal aid scheme that certain communications were made to the District Court Bench and to the Circuit Court Bench as to how that scheme was to be operated.</P>
    <P>When the Bill on which that scheme is based was going through this House, a number of Deputies, including myself, expressed the gravest concern that the particular machinery proposed would be Civil Service machinery, that it would be operated not by the courts, not by the legal profession but by the Civil Service functioning under the Minister for Justice.  I raised that point on the Second Reading of the Bill, I quote from the Dáil Debates of 15th February, 1962, volume 193, column 240:</P>
    <P>It seems to me that under the scheme as outlined in the Bill this is to be a Civil Service administration and I think that is wrong and I think it is dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, who is now Minister for Agriculture, dealt with that in his reply on the Second Reading. At columns 257 and 258 of the Dáil Debates of the 15th February, 1962 he said:</P>
    <P>As I see it, the only function the State will have in the matter will be to pay.  The Civil Service will not enter into the scheme in any way whatever once the original regulations are prepared except to foot the bill.  In any social service that is the State's duty but certainly it is absurd for Deputies to suggest that this is a Civil Service administered scheme. It is a scheme administered by the courts and they are the correct people to administer it.</P>
    <P>That was the assurance the Minister for Justice at that time gave across the floor of the House.  The fear expressed from these benches was that the set-up in the proposed scheme in the Bill would be one which would be operated by civil servants; that the courts would not get an opportunity to function as they should function freely and independently of any of these matters. <Col N="1608" /> The assurance given by the Minister then was, as it had to be, accepted by this House.  The scheme was passed through this House on the basis of that assurance.</P>
    <P>It was disclosed today that that is not the case and that the scheme has been operating without the free functioning of the judiciary in this matter. I hope the Minister will be able to dispel the fears I have because it seems to me to be a deplorable situation. When a Bill has been passed by this House, signed by the President and promulgated it becomes law.  It is the Bill, as passed, which becomes law.  It does not rest with the Minister or anyone else in the House to make addenda to the Bill.  It does not rest with the Minister or anyone else in the House to interpret the Act or to say what way it is to be administered through the courts.  The job of interpreting the Act is a job to be performed by the courts and by no one else.  I, myself, have endeavoured to make that position clear to successive Ministers in the House.  I discussed that on the Committee Stage when the Bill was going through the House.  I quote from the Dáil Debates, volume 194, column 137 of the 20th March, 1962:</P>
    <P>I do not think it can be said too often in this House that what we do here is open to construction and interpretation by the courts which must have regard to what is written into the Act, not to anything the Minister or anyone else may say in explanation of the measure as it passes through the House.  The courts may not have any regard to any remarks the Minister may make or any explanations issued by means of a White Paper.</P>
    <P>That is the position and that is the position which must be accepted.  If we do not do our job properly when legislation is going through the House we cannot mend our hand afterwards and give directions or advice to the courts. If the Minister made his communications innocently to the District Court Bench for the purpose, as I understand from his remarks here today, of conveying to them the views and the feelings <Col N="1609" /> of the Oireachtas in this matter, then it was his job to convey the views and the feelings of all the members of the Oireachtas, not merely Ministerial pronouncements.  There were many matters in relation to this Bill upon which Deputies expressed different views.  Were all those views communicated to the District Court or the Circuit Court?  I do not believe it was right to communicate any of those views to any of them but if any were to be given, then all should have been given.  As matters stand, unless the Minister can give an extremely good explanation to this House he is deserving of censure for the action he has taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. J. Fitzpatrick of Cavan asked this question jointly with me and is equally interested in this matter and I propose to give the remainder of my time to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice, I stated that I feared that the Minister for Justice or his Department had communicated with the judiciary in an effort to influence the judiciary as to how it should operate the Legal Aid Act.  I assured the Minister then that if he could tell me that no such communication had been made, I would accept it and would be satisfied.  I gathered from the Minister's reply to that debate that he was not prepared to give any such assurance and that, in fact, there had been such a communication.  I will pay the Minister the credit of saying that he was candid in that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I joined with Deputy M. J. O'Higgins in putting down this question to establish two principles: (1) the principle that the judiciary in this country is independent, independent of the Oireachtas, independent of the Executive and (2) that justice should, in accordance with Article 34 of the Constitution, be administered in public.  I regret to say that the Minister's answer to the question today discloses, in my opinion, an alarming state of affairs, a situation in which the Minister quite candidly claims the right to make his views known to the District Court Bench, to the Circuit <Col N="1610" /> Court Bench.  For what reason?  For the purpose of influencing the District Justices and the Judges as to how they will exercise their discretion.</P>
    <P>I am not raising this matter purely because I am concerned as to how the legal aid system will be operated.  I have not joined the legal aid scheme. I am not really all that much concerned about it.  However, I am concerned with the principle that the judiciary should be independent and that justice should be administered in public.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say, as he said today:</P>
    <P>I certainly do not think it is unsound. I have a responsibility to the elected representatives of the people of Ireland to make known my views to any branch of the judiciary. Whether they follow them or not is their business in the interpretation of any scheme they may administer.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the position for a moment.  The District Justices can have, within their ranks, promotion: they are entitled to promotion.  Two scales of salaries are paid to District Justices, one scale of salaries paid throughout the country and another in the cities.  If a vacancy occurs on the Bench of the District Court in the city of Dublin, the Minister for Justice or the Government can promote a rural District Justice to a city seat.  And in doing so, can increase that District Justice's salary by £250 a year.  Surely it is not unreasonable to think, if the Minister's wishes and desires are made known to the Justices, that if they refuse to fall in line with or to accept the Minister's views they can hardly expect very favourable treatment from the Minister.  Furthermore, District Justices can be transferred from a less desirable area to a more desirable area but, again, they are dependent on the Minister and the Government for that.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of Circuit Court Judges.  Occasions arise for promotion on the Circuit Court Bench. A vacancy might occur for the Presidency of the Circuit Court.  That would normally go to an existing Circuit <Col N="1611" /> Court Judge.  But, again, if some member of the Circuit Court Bench refuses &mdash;without being offensive&mdash;to obey the Minister's order or to fall in line with his wishes, he can hardly expect very preferential treatment from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I say that there is a lot more in this question than the legal aid system: the whole question of justice and its administration is involved.  The duty of this Oireachtas is to make laws, to pass Bills into Acts of Parliament and when they become Acts of Parliament this House is finished with them.  It is then a matter for other agencies to enforce those Acts of Parliament.  It is the duty of the Executive to appoint judges but once those judges are appointed, they should be independent and it is their duty to interpret Acts of Parliament which we pass.  It is not their business, nor are they allowed, to have regard to speeches made in this House when those Bills are going through.  Again those judges, when they are appointed, stand between the ordinary plain people and the Executive and they can do that effectively only if they are free from the hand of the Executive.</P>
    <P>The next point is that in Article 34 of the Constitution it is declared:</P>
    <P>Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by Judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution and save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law shall be administered in public.</P>
    <P>How can we say that justice is being administered in public if secretly the Minister for Justice or the Government goes into the courts to tell the Justices and the Judges how they are to interpret Acts of Parliament?  If the Minister is claiming the right to do it in the case of the legal aid system, surely he will do it in other cases?</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with what the practice has been; I am not concerned with what has been done in the past.  I do not know what has been done in the past but I say that if this has been the practice, it is a bad practice and a <Col N="1612" /> practice which should be discontinued and discontinued forthwith.</P>

      <P>First of all, I think we should get this matter into perspective. There is no point in entering into a lengthy homily about the principles underlying the administration of justice.  The Legal Aid system is a social welfare scheme, in effect.  The Judges and Justices in their administration of this social welfare scheme must have regard to the fact that they are administering public funds for which I am responsible to the Dáil and to the country.  In that capacity, they have to make administrative decisions in regard to how these funds are to be disbursed by way of legal aid.  In the making of any decisions concerning the disbursement of public funds I, as Minister for Justice, or any other Minister administering funds which have been voted by this House, must ensure that these funds are administered in accordance with the wishes of the House and in the public interest.  I might point out that it is the practice of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Local Government to discuss with county managers the administration of the Health Act and any of the other Acts which come within the province of the county managers.</P>
      <P>In the particular field of legal aid, the judges are not performing a judicial function in the sense of administering justice as between party and party.  They are administering what is in effect a social welfare scheme with funds voted by this House.</P>

      <P>The sum voted for the current year is £20,000, and I am concerned to see that that £20,000 is disbursed properly.  I am also concerned to see to it that in the administration of the scheme, the views of this House, and, particularly, my views as the elected executive of this House, are made known to the judiciary so that a balanced administration of the scheme can develop.  Indeed, bringing <Col N="1613" /> the matter down into perspective from the lofty heights of legal principle to which people are trying to elevate it, I may say that my attitude in this particular matter was actually welcomed by District Justices, who themselves were anxious for elucidation on how they, the people concerned, were going to work the legal aid system.  I sent a memorandum to them in which I made it quite plain that I had no intention of interfering with their discretion in any way.  I set out the views expressed by my predecessor when introducing the legislation.</P>

      <P>All the matters which I made known to the District Justices were matters which I and my predecessor had mentioned in this House.  The District Justices then requested that the President of the District Court should convene a statutory meeting of the Justices for the specific purpose of discussing how they would administer the legal aid scheme. This meeting was convened at their own request and I was not present at it.  I have no information as to what actually took place at the meeting.</P>

      <P>This meeting of the Justices was convened on 3rd April for the specific purpose of discussing how they would administer the legal aid scheme in a uniform and practical way.  As I said, I have no information <Col N="1614" /> as to what took place at the meeting.  The Justices had before them the memorandum from me, and I take personal responsibility for that memorandum and for the setting out therein of my own views and those of my predecessor.  They were the same views which were the basis of a Bill passed by the Oireachtas.  I, as the Minister responsible for the administration of the funds to be disbursed, felt quite free to make my views known to the Justices.  I am certain they had a very sensible meeting, although I do not know what occurred.  The meeting was convened at the request of the Justices themselves and was one of the statutory meetings they hold regularly since the passing of the 1961 Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Act.  That particular Act, which found much favour on all sides of the House, was designed to remedy a problem which caused much comment over the years, that is, the question of having uniformity in the administration of the District Court, uniformity in the practice of the Court, and uniformity in the imposition of penalties.</P>
      <P>These statutory meetings are held regularly and I am certain the House welcomes the fact that the District Justices meet in this way.  They have reached a situation where a degree of uniformity is maintained, and it was precisely for this reason that they had their meeting on 3rd April, at which they discussed what their balanced and sensible approach should be to the legal aid scheme.  I am certain that there will be a balanced and sensible approach and one which will be in line with the sort of approach that I and my predecessor have mentioned here as being desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a legal aid scheme under which we disburse moneys got from the taxpayer.  This money must go to needy and genuine people who find themselves in trouble with the law and who require funds to conduct their defences so as to ensure that justice is done to them.  This is the underlying principle of the legal aid scheme.  We do not want, and I am sure the people do not want, a legal aid scheme under which we will be subsidising hardened criminals for the benefit of a few lawyers who choose to work in that <Col N="1615" /> kind of a practice.  Nobody wants a legal aid scheme whereby the judiciary will be ladling out funds for every criminal defence, irrespective of the merits of the particular accused person involved.</P>
    <P>That is what I was at pains to make plain some weeks ago in my Estimates speech.  The legal aid scheme is specifically for the benefit of unfortunate people who get themselves into trouble with the law and who have not got the means to defend themselves where defence is essential in the interests of justice.</P>

      <P>I have made known my views and the views of my predecessor to the judiciary.  I have seen fit since I became Minister for Justice to make known my attitude, and I have in fact attended a meeting with the District Justices and had a frank and free discussion with them on the administration of justice generally.  I see nothing untoward in that and, so long as I am Minister for Justice, responsible to the House and to the people, I shall consider myself ultimately responsible for the administration of justice in this country.  So long as I do not issue directives to the Justices as to how they should administer justice, I feel quite free to make my views known to them.  They can accept or reject these views.  More particularly, I am fully entitled to make my views clearly known to them when the matter concerns not just the ordinary administration of justice but the administering of a social welfare scheme in which funds voted by this House are involved and for which I am the responsible authority.</P>
      <P>I put my views quite plainly on paper before the Justices.  I am glad to say my views were considered not as a directive but as helpful information. The Justices, without my being present, were able to make their own decisions on how they would achieve a balanced and sensible interpretation of the scheme.  I have every confidence in the judiciary being balanced and sensible. Their attitude contrasts strongly with the unbalanced and hysterical approach of certain members on the Fine Gael benches opposite.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 19th May, 1965.</P>
