    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to make on this Estimate. <Col N="777" /> On the question of the Ground Rents Commission, I would ask the Minister to see that the necessary legislation to implement the Commission's findings is introduced with all the speed and urgency it deserves.  I am aware that complicated factors are involved but as ground rents and leaseholds affect such a large number of people I hope the Minister will see his way to give this legislation priority.  A large number of the ground rents and leaseholds, as the Minister knows, will fall due for renewal about this time and many landlords will make use of the present property boom to squeeze the last shilling from the tenants.</P>
      <P>It may be pointed out that if the tenant has a grievance and if he fails to reach agreement with the landlord, he has the right to go to court but this involves legal expense which many people may not wish to incur or may not be able to afford.  There is also the fact that many decent people have a horror and fear of the courts and will allow themselves to be coerced by the landlord or the agent to reach some settlement rather than face the ordeal of a court appearance.  As well, there is the fact that many of them are not treated with the sympathy they deserve when they do go to court.</P>
      <P>Since the Labour Government came to office in England, new trends in relation to property companies have been driving these companies to buy up large slices of Irish property so that Irishmen are becoming mere tenants in their own land.  I am against foreigners, whatever their nationality, coming here to by Irish land and property.  There is an urgent necessity for legislation to give each man the right to purchase his own ground rent or freehold.  Only then will our people have security in their homes and businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I should like to raise is the jury system.  I would ask the Minister to consider the present method of selecting people for jury service.  It is unreasonable to expect a man to give freely of his time from his business or profession.  Many of the <Col N="778" /> people liable for jury service are self-employed. They go into court to act as jurors and may attend the court several mornings before being called to service.  Naturally a man in that position is concerned at the time being wasted and consequently at the money he is losing.  Then he is expected to sit down calmly and give fair and impartial treatment to the case he hears.  That is asking a lot of human nature and I do not feel such a juror is temperamentally suited to deal with problems in a high and noble manner.</P>
    <P>Surely today, when there are so many people retired and living on pensions, it ought to be possible, particularly if we make realistic payments by way of travelling expenses and the cost of meals, to get elderly retired people to act as jurors.  We would have the advantage that we would be drawing on the more sensible judgement and maturity that comes with age.  It would lead to a far better jury system than the present one and I feel sure these people would be happy in the feeling that they were wanted and that they had something to contribute to the community in their retirement.</P>
    <P>On the question of motor car parking in Dublin, I am not quite sure whether this comes under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice.  If it does, the problem of parking meters should be dealt with with far more urgency than appears to be the position at the moment.  I should like to see them introduced in the main shopping streets in this city and throughout the country.  It would then be possible to stop for a short period, go into a shop and transact your business in a reasonable fashion.  At present the man who drives his car into the city arrives at about 9 o'clock, parks his car and leaves it there all day.  This is choking up the streets and everybody is aware that it is a most unsatisfactory arrangement.  I hope the Minister will deal with this matter and treat it as a matter of urgency.  Those are the only points I wish to make and I hope the Minister will consider them when preparing further legislation.</P>
    <Col N="779" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to say, as many other Deputies have already said, that we have a very fine police force.  Down the years the Garda have given excellent service.  In recent times many young men have entered the force and we are proud that they have followed the good traditions of the older men.  These younger men have the advantage of the experience and advice of the older men.  They have, too, come in at a time when more peaceful conditions prevail.  As one passes through the city or through the country towns, one cannot help nothing the fine physique and appearance of the young gardaí.  Speaking from experience, I must say that they are most courteous and obliging and have rarely been known to hound anybody, so to speak, or go looking for trouble.  They have the co-operation and goodwill of all our citizens and I hope that that state of affairs will continue.</P>
      <P>From time to time when reading the newspapers, one notices a big difference in fines imposed by district justices for similar offences.  In one court somebody who had no tail-light on his car is fined 10/- while in another court, for a similar offence, a person is fined £2 or £3.  That does not impress the ordinary citizen and it does not always seem that justice is done.  It is a pity that we could not have more uniformity in the fines imposed for similar offences.  From time to time people feel that they have got a raw deal in court because of this disparity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from a rural area, I should like to say that the courthouses themselves are not what one would like them to be.  Conditions for the district justices or the judge, for the lawyers, the newspapermen and the litigants are very poor indeed in many rural areas.  If it would be possible to have these facilities improved, it would be very desirable.  People often have to come in perhaps ten or 15 miles from rural areas, perhaps on bicycles, and on arrival may find the courthouse crowded and they have to stand around waiting.  In winter time they may have to wait in conditions of the greatest discomfort.  I would ask the <Col N="780" /> Minister to try to have these facilities improved.</P>
    <P>One matter raised many years ago is the question of Garda uniforms.  It took successive Ministers a long time to do anything about changing the uniform.  The present uniform is very smart but I would suggest that a change could now be made in the cap which has outlived its usefulness.  I should like to see a lighter cap.  The cap which the Ban-Ghardaí wear is very becoming and I suggest we could have something like it for the male garda.  I hope the Minister will look into that and I hope it will not take him as long to make up his mind as it did some Ministers in the past with regard to making a change in the uniform.</P>
    <P>The question of sports facilities for the Garda has also been mentioned.  It will be appreciated that in the more remote rural areas it is not always possible to provide football or hurling for these young men.  That is a pity and it would be a very good thing if they had some form of outdoor amusement. The Minister should recommend to the officers of the Garda that these facilities should be provided even if it were necessary to provide a park within a county, or to provide transport to enable the men to get out of the barracks to play hurling or football, or whatever other sport they might wish to play.  The superintendents and the sergeants could help greatly in this regard.  It is a pity to have men of 23 or 24 years of age sitting in the barracks, perhaps playing cards, when they could be engaged more actively in an outdoor sport.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that we have now a very young Minister from Connacht, who understands the problem in the rural areas and who is a very active man not alone in his constituency but throughout the west.  If he keeps these matters to which I have referred in mind, I believe he can improve the lot of the Garda a great deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow up on a previous speaker who referred to jury service.  At present a very limited number of people is obliged <Col N="781" /> to give this service and I think far too many are exempt from it.  The original idea, I suppose, was that people with high technical qualifications would not rank as being ordinary men in the street and as being ideal jurors.  It was felt that they might be unduly confused by their own technical problems and could not give as clear a decision on purely matters of fact.  In my view that is entirely outdated.  We live in a highly technical age and it is very hard to get anyone who is not technically qualified in some way.  I see no reason why, for instance, a civil engineer should be regarded as any less suitable for jury service than a plumber or a carpenter or any other tradesman. At the same time, I agree with the previous speaker who stated that it is a tremendous burden on a man living on a small wage, or self-employed, to have to give a fair amount of time to jury service for a very nominal fee, if anything.</P>
      <P>If we are going to continue jury service at all, I think we shall have to be far more realistic and pay a reasonable fee to jurors for travel and attendance. That would have to cover days on which they were called to be jurors-in-waiting as well as the days on which they are actually engaged on a jury. The number of cases referred to juries at the moment is, I think, too big and it will be well for the Minister to keep this in mind when considering this matter, as he has said he is doing, under expert advice.  I object very strongly to cases of damages in road accidents being referred to a jury.  It is right that jurors should be called on to decide the facts of the case and to give impartial verdicts as to where the main responsibility for a road accident really lies but when it comes to the issue of damages for injury, I think the jurors are the least capable of giving a fair assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common knowledge that what very often happens in such cases is that the foreman of the jury tries to get some agreement on a figure for damages once liability has been decided.  It is very rare that unanimity, or anything like it, is reached in the <Col N="782" /> early stages and the jurors are then usually asked by the foreman to write down the figure which each one has in mind.  I know from those who have been on such juries that the figures very to quite a fantastic extent.  One juror will be in favour of £10,000; another juror will be in favour, perhaps, of £50.  It is not at all unusual to have that wide discrepancy and that is because we are all, as private individuals, prejudiced to some extent.  We are either prejudiced as motorists, as cyclists or as pedestrians and it is very hard to get that out of our mind.  If you are a pedestrian and the injured party is a pedestrian it is very hard not to say: &ldquo;It is time we gave the motorists something to think about and I shall award £10,000 damages. That will keep them quiet for a bit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the juror is a motorist, he may feel prejudiced because he believes pedestrians are far too apt to wander thoughtlessly into the roadway and to think it is about time they got some warning by the award of purely nominal damages when they suffer injury in such cases.  The assessment of damages in these cases is really more a matter for an actuary who is able to assess what the immediate damage has been and also the possible loss of income in the future.  I should hope that while jurors may be retained to decide purely matters of fact, the calculation of damages should be left to experts who could advise the judge in the matter.  I should hope, therefore, that in this review of the jury service generally, we would be able to spread the load much more widely over the whole community and make many more people liable for jury service than are liable at present. I hope we shall restrict the number of cases referred to juries and I also hope that when a man is called for jury service he will be adequately paid, whether he is called on to serve or not, for his loss of time and his travelling.</P>
    <P>In regard to free legal aid, I was rather disappointed by one quotation by the Minister from a speech by his predecessor.  This gives me some cause for anxiety.  I fear I have not got the exact quotation before me but there <Col N="783" /> was an indication that free legal aid would not be readily granted to people who appeared to be making crime a career.  From the ordinary commonsense point of view, I can see that seems reasonable but we must never forget that any accused person comes before the court as an innocent person until proved guilty.  The fact that a man may have a long record of previous convictions must not allow anyone to conclude that he is guilty in a particular case.  A previous criminal career should not in itself be any obstacle to the granting of free legal aid if the case is one of sufficient complexity to warrant it.</P>
    <P>In his speech yesterday, Deputy Ryan made some reference to differences in the handling of cases of motoring offences.  He appeared to give the impression that he felt that while people who broke into and entered premises were real criminals, motorists who were found guilty of dangerous driving were in a different class altogether. I deny that absolutely.  I feel that people who are guilty of dangerous driving are criminals in the very worst sense.  The sooner we get this across to them, the better.  No one has a right to take a car out on the road and drive it in a dangerous manner any more than he has a right to go around with a loaded gun.  A motorcar is no less a lethal weapon than a loaded gun and it can be far more dangerous.  With a loaded gun, you can kill only one person.  With a speeding car you can kill many.</P>
    <P>Anyone who, out of sheer selfishness or impatience or even bad manners, endangers the life or safety of his fellow man should be very severely punished without any mercy whatsoever. If we tinker with this problem, we are going to encourage young irresponsible people with more money than sense to drive to the public danger.  It is only by making it perfectly clear that these people are worse criminals than those guilty of burglary or anything else that we will grapple with the problem.</P>
    <P>So far as the Garda are concerned, <Col N="784" /> I have the greatest respect for the force and I think they are operating with amazing efficiency.  It is a very smooth running machine.  Its record of crime detection is excellent.  I had a case only recently when one of my sons lost a bicycle.  The bicycle was stolen.  It was recovered by the Garda within 24 hours, many miles away.  Granted, my young lad had the sense to memorise the number of his bicycle.  He was able to give the number immediately at the Garda station to which he reported the loss, and that was a help.  I only wish, and I think the Garda also wish, that other cyclists would co-operate in the same way.  To find a stolen bicycle within 24 hours about six or seven miles away from the place where it was stolen was quite an achievement.  I was amazed to find that the Garda did not regard this as anything unusual; they regarded it as purely routine.</P>
    <P>I hope everyone will give the Garda their absolute, unqualified and full support in a very difficult job which they are doing extremely well but I feel that in some cases they are being discouraged by what they deem to be a lack of support from the district justices.  I have got this complaint on too many occasions to be able to dismiss it as being irresponsible.  I know that we have provided in legislation that there shall be regular meetings of district justices in order to try to achieve a higher degree of standardisation of penalties.  I hope the district justices will also be encouraged in every way to give more support to the Garda than they are doing at present. Certainly, in the public mind, quite apart from the Gardaí themselves, there is an impression that district justices are being far too lenient and that fairly serious cases are being dealt with under the Probation Act or by means of the imposition of very small fines.  I am not in favour of undue severity but I feel there has got to be greater severity on the part of district justices than is being experienced at the moment and if this is not forthcoming there will be a tremendous temptation to the Garda not to pursue their inquiries with as much enthusiasm as they display at present.  They must <Col N="785" /> be assured that when they bring a person before the courts and when that person is convicted he or she will be properly punished and the forces of law will thereby be strengthened.</P>
    <P>I should like, in conclusion, to convey my good wishes to the Minister as he starts his new term of office.  He has got off to a very good start.  I wish him the best of good luck, particularly in the furthering of the programme of law reform which is already in progress. There is much to be done still. While we do not want to move with undue haste, I know we can rely on him to press on with this programme to the best of his very considerable ability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers have paid tribute to the Garda.  All of us would join in those tributes.  The young Guards look a very smart collection of men.  I am very glad to see that attention is paid to the cut and smartness of the uniform. We can all remember when, years ago, there was not the same good tailoring displayed.  I am sure it is something that the gardaí themselves are pleased about because nothing looks better than a well-cut uniform.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the traffic gardaí, the courtesy cops.  They are very good and do a great deal to relieve traffic conditions both in Dublin and on the outskirts. We could have more of them.  On the various bridges going out of Dublin&mdash; Charlemont Bridge and so on&mdash;across the canals and rivers, but especially the canals, there is tremendous congestion in the evenings.  It is like seeing manna from Heaven to see a traffic cop arrive, take control of the situation, disentangle everything and the lines of traffic move slowly on.  I would ask the Minister to remind the Garda Síochána that we do need, if anything, more of these men.  On the Stillorgan Road also, they can do and they do a great deal to keep the traffic moving and to make the traffic behave itself, because you get people moving out of line and tangling up the whole traffic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various speakers referred to our jury system and the method of selection. <Col N="786" /> I think it was Deputy Booth, the last speaker, who said the various professional men were thought in the past to be too technical for jury service.  I had never had the idea that that was the reason they were exempt.  I thought doctors and various other persons were exempt on account of the hardship that it would cause them if they had to give up their professional duties, that it was felt that it was not as great a deprivation in the case of a businessman, that the could get someone else to look after the shop in his absence.  I thought that was the basis for the exemption of certain professional people.  If there is any basis for the statement made by the previous speaker I would think it was time that the position was altered.</P>
    <P>What I really wanted to speak about with reference to the jury system is the fact that we do not have women on juries.  We are all aware of the very noble work done years ago by women trying to get the right to vote and legal rights of various sorts.  Down, through the years, fine work was done by these pioneering women, some of them suffragettes but many of them not active suffragettes but sympathisers with this cause of justice and legal rights for women.</P>
    <P>It does seem a pity that nowadays, when these rights are fully conceded to women and when we have women barristers and women solicitors practising in the courts, there are no women serving on juries.  I have been told the reason is that it was so difficult to get them to serve, that they put up one excuse after another, that eventually the system broke down and it was decided it was easier not to call them at all.  Whether that is a fact or not I do not know, but, at any rate, one way of easing the burden of jury service on the ordinary citizen would be if women did their share of this type of work.  Nowadays when women are engaged in all sorts of activities, some of it not very pleasant, there is no foundation for the idea that women, in the main, would shrink from this work.  We are deprived of the benefit of their attitude of mind, especially in certain kinds of cases where it could be of great benefit.  I do not know how far the Minister has thought about <Col N="787" /> this or if it would require legislation but I think I am correct in saying it would not require legislation, that it is just a matter that was slowly allowed to drop.</P>
    <P>I would make this plea to the women's societies, that in view of the very great work done by many noble women in the past, a great number of whom were Irishwomen&mdash;Irish-women played an important part in the struggle in the English-speaking world for the rights of women&mdash;they should not allow these sacrifices made in the past to be left as if there had never been a struggle for them.</P>
    <P>There is one point I wish to make in connection with the Garda whom we have all praised yesterday and today.  I, in company with other Deputies, get requests sometimes for housing.  A doctor was speaking to me the other day and he asked me to take up the case of a garda who has six children with whom he is living in a flat.  One of the children is delicate and needs a special place to play.  It seems a pity that with this body of men we do not do more to provide houses for the married members. It would not require very many houses and I am sure the local authorities would co-operate with the Department of Justice and the Garda authorities if this matter were taken up with them.  It would certainly be a very great help to the Garda and would be an inducement to join the Force.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I am sure he will make a success of his office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his endeavours to achieve perfection in the working of his Department.  We are all interested in methods of preventing crime and I am glad the Minister in his brief has mentioned boys' clubs.  I have had long experience of this work and I can confidently say that such clubs run by responsible bodies can be a means of saving our young people from crime.  Such clubs can be a means of education and the uplifting of a boy and, furthermore, under <Col N="788" /> proper supervision, they can mould a boy to take his place in the community. Many problems concern boys' clubs but the main one is finance.  I wonder if the Minister, in the very near future, would consider helping, by way of grant or otherwise, these voluntary bodies, who are doing such wonderful work in the community.</P>
      <P>With reference to the walkie-talkie system at present in use in Dublin, should this prove successful here, I would ask the Minister to introduce it in Cork city and other cities throughout the country.  This system has proved very successful in other large cities throughout the world and I am sure it would be of great benefit to our police force.</P>
      <P>The Minister made no reference in his brief to unsolved murders but I am sure the Garda are continuing their investigations in this respect. Nevertheless, the Minister should give an assurance to the people that all necessary steps are being taken to bring the people responsible to justice.</P>
      <P>I am glad to know also that the report on malicious injuries to persons and property is now in the hands of the printer.  The local authorities are very much interested in this aspect of the Minister's Department.  Finally, I should like to join with other members of the House in paying tribute to the Garda Síochána.  They are a wonderful body of men and a credit to our nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised here some months ago by way of question to the Minister the matter of the sale of knives.  The question was specifically directed to the problem of flick knives and other knives of a dangerous character.  I noticed from the Minister's reply that the investigations carried out by the Garda indicated that there was no evidence available to suggest that the stabbing incidents which had occurred were due to any great extent to the number of persons carrying these knives, although it had been established that in certain cases stabbing incidents, some of a serious character, had occurred in which different sorts of knives were used.  However, I <Col N="789" /> should like to urge on the Minister that this matter should be the subject of further consideration.</P>
      <P>There is a tendency nowadays, particularly in urban areas, towards gang warfare between teenagers or young persons.  While the number of fatal accidents has fortunately been small, cases have occurred in which serious injury has resulted.  Indeed, in some cases, the fact that serious injury did not result was due more to good fortune than to any lack of intent on the part of those concerned.  Whether this development is due to the fact that on TV and films, and other modern means of communication of ideas and activities, these activities are portrayed, or whether there is some other reason is a matter for argument, but these modern media of communication must have an effect on young people and on their general outlook. It is important, in my opinion, in a matter of this sort to take action before there is any extension of these very undesirable activities.  It may be too late to take action when an extension of such gang warfare causes either serious injuries or results in fatal consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers have remarked during the debate, many weapons and many forms of activity are quite proper, if properly controlled and directed.  Reference was made to the fact that, if a car is properly driven, it is unlikely that any serious consequences will occur because of recklessness or disregard for the safety of other road users.  Similarly, in the case of knives or firearms, if what are normally safe weapons or instruments are used for an improper purpose, used recklessly or without regard to consequences, then the results will be entirely different.  I believe, therefore, that it is important to examine this whole question again to see whether some action is not possible before there is any extension of gang warfare. I know that in some urban areas this gang warfare is causing concern to the Garda authorities.  In that connection there is, I believe, far too great a tendency, because of a somewhat too sympathetic enthusiasm generated over a period by those anxious for penal <Col N="790" /> reform, to approach matters of this sort in a too tolerant way and, for want of a better description, to mollycoddle criminals.</P>
    <P>In recent times I think there is a general realisation, with certain exceptions, that the attitude exemplified by Lord Justice Goddard in Britain produces better results in the long run. It must be brought home to those who are criminally minded or have criminal inclinations that crime does not pay and that the full rigours of the law will be applied to ensure that they are made to realise the consequences of their actions.  Punishment, if it is adequate, is still a great deterrent, but, if there is a tendency to treat offenders with undue leniency or sympathy, we can scarcely hope to achieve a reduction in crime.</P>
    <P>I believe there is today a great responsibility on parents to ensure proper control of their children.  Much attention is being paid by sociologists and others, who study this problem, to the lack of adequate parental control nowadays over young persons.  In many cases these young people, who get into trouble of one sort or another, start on the slippery slope because of lack of effective parental authority and subsequently find themselves involved in many cases with the law.</P>
    <P>In connection with traffic, I support those who have said that speed restrictions should be rigidly enforced.  There is general agreement that the Garda patrols on traffic do a very fine job. They have to deal with a situation which grows daily more difficult because of the increase in the number of vehicles using our roads.  I believe speed restrictions have had a desirable effect.  On the other hand, parking restrictions are occasionally imposed with unnecessary severity.  Some consideration should be given to ensure that the rights of traders and others carrying on business are not interfered with, except where interference is absolutely necessary.  If adequate parking facilities are made available in proximity to business areas, that will obviously ease a difficult situation.  In every case in which facilities are not available, outside of main traffic <Col N="791" /> arteries, consideration should be given to allowing, wherever possible, parking on alternate days.</P>
    <P>I understand from some of those who have visited reformatories recently that the facilities in many cases still leave a great deal to be desired.  Wash-up, toilet and other facilities are in some cases very primitive.  Some of the young people who find themselves in these establishments are there because of circumstances quite outside their own control.  Their parents may be dead or they may be children from homes that have, for one reason or another, broken up.  They are in a different category from the children who come from families in which the parents reside with the children and in which the parents should exercise full responsibility and control.  Many of the children in these establishments, there through no fault of their own, turn out to be excellent citizens and an example to many from whom more might be expected.  I believe the facilities in these places should be improved in order to encourage the reform and rehabilitation of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I endorse the well deserved tributes which have been paid to the Garda force of today.  The Garda are undoubtedly an excellent example of manhood and womanhood today and worthy successors, indeed, to a great tradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Legion of Mary whose members visit St. Patrick's Institution and have done tremendous work for the young people there.  They visit employers and seek suitable employment for the boys on release.  They follow that up by visiting the homes and keeping family ties together. Voluntary organisations, such as the Legion of Mary, which participate in this great work deserve the support not alone of the local people but of the nation as a whole.  I should like to pay a deserved tribute to all of them.  If more voluntary effort were put into the prevention of crime and assisting those unfortunate enough to find themselves in trouble, the lot of the Department and of the Garda would be much easier. <Col N="792" /> I should like also to pay a tribute to the Garda for their efficiency and bearing.  However, there is one matter which requires attention.  Sport has been mentioned here.  I have been connected with sport over a period.  I hope sport will be developed as an outlet for the energies of young people and that no restriction will be placed on gardaí in participating actively in sport.  I know of one case in the not too distant past in which a member of the Garda, who represented his country at the Rome Olympics and on many other occasions in the international field, had to take part in an international contest at the Stadium at 10.30 p.m. and had to be on duty at 12 o'clock.  Apparently, this unfortunate situation arose because he was not attached to a Garda club.  It should not be allowed happen again.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that every facility is given to these young men so that their leisure hours will not become uninteresting and they will have contacts outside the police force that will be of assistance to them at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay a very special tribute to one man who has done an immense amount for the youth of this city.  As a Dublin man, I should like to pay tribute to Detective Sergeant Jim Brannigan.  He deserves the greatest possible credit for his handling of the youth of this city, both in crime and outside it, and for the assistance he has given to young people.  I am sure he has done more to keep them out of trouble than any other member of the Force.  His actions in the past are well known to Deputies, to the judiciary and certainly to a large number of parents who have relied on him for advice and guidance in keeping their children on a straight course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I had occasion, along with the Minister, to visit the new Garda barracks in Crumlin.  It is an excellent barracks and provides all the facilities desirable.  Nevertheless, although many have been improved in the past, there are other barracks where the accommodation is bad.  I would refer particularly to the barracks at Chapelizod. The young members of the Force who <Col N="793" /> go to these barracks come from good homes.  They expect to have the same standard of comfort in them as they had at home.  It is depressing when they find the accommodation and facilities are bad.  This can have a serious effect on further recruitment, because the word will soon get around that all is not as it should be.</P>
    <P>The parking situation in Dublin has become very grave.  The changeover from the horse to the mechanised vehicle has been a change from a mare to a nightmare.  It certainly requires consideration by all concerned.  The strictest possible enforcement of traffic and parking regulations is one solution to the problem at present; some people can park their cars in the city for up to seven hours while others who park for only an hour and five minutes get tickets.  These tickets are now regarded by country people as souvenirs of Dublin.  Many people who come from the country to spend an hour in the centre of the city find they cannot park unless they pay £1.  If the parking regulations were strictly enforced, they would know that no section of the community were getting an undue advantage.</P>
    <P>In regard to driving offences, the punishment does not always fit the crime.  Most motoring offences take place during hours of pleasure motoring. The suspension of his licence because of a minor offence can have far reaching effects for a man who has to earn his living by driving.  It may result in loss of his employment with a consequent effect on his wife and family. Where the suspension of the licence interferes with a person's livelihood, consideration should be given to allowing him drive during the hours of work but prohibiting him from driving during the hours of pleasure motoring and, perhaps, extending the period of suspension.  But for minor offences I do not think his livelihood should be impaired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very constructive debate from all sides on this Estimate. The points raised have been many and varied.  Naturally, the recurring theme <Col N="794" /> was the anxiety displayed by Deputies in regard to the crime situation.  I and my Department have been equally concerned with this position.  The reality of the matter is that crime in its serious aspects is largely crime in the Dublin metropolitan area.  The figures reveal that about 65 per cent of the indictable crime in the country occurs in the Dublin metropolitan area, in which there is about a quarter of the total population.</P>
      <P>That fact is responsible for our thinking in regard to strengthening the Garda Síochána in the metropolitan area.  We have not reduced the country stations to the extent stated by some Deputies.  In fact, since 1st January, 1963, we have closed only five rural stations.  We have, of course, reduced the numbers in the rural areas and strengthened the position in the Dublin metropolitan area, in accordance with a realistic assessment of the crime position in the country as a whole and recognising the fact that organised crime is largely a matter for the Dublin area.  We have increased the strength of the force by 100 in the past 12 months, and placed them in the areas where crime is most apparent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised a point in regard to flick knives.  I shall certainly have a further investigation made into that particular matter, but on the facts as they appear so far, I feel it has been exaggerated to some extent.  In eight recent stabbing incidents flick knives were not used. Pen knives or butchers' knives or table knives were used, not flick knives. The matter of flick knives is in the public mind, I suppose, because they are used in gang warfare in Britain but they are not a menace here.  However, I will have the matter re-examined in greater detail with a view to the preparation of legislation if necessary.  On the facts as they appear so far, the use of flick knives is not the menace some people believe it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to law reform, which I mentioned in introducing the Estimate, this subject has been touched upon by many speakers.  Juries in particular <Col N="795" /> have come in for mention, and various aspects of jury service were raised.  I am very conscious of the importance of this matter, and I have just had to hand a very full report from the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in regard to jury service in all its aspects, on the question of extending the scope of jury service, broadening the class of people liable for jury service, and on some form of remuneration for that service.  I am examining the matter at the moment and on both the aspects of broadening the scope of jury service, and introducing a more practical and up-to-date system of remuneration, I am sympathetic. If my final view is on the lines of my present thinking, I will, I hope, be introducing legislation later on to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>There is very divided opinion, even among members of the legal profession, on the question of juries in civil actions.  Some people come down very strongly and say the jury system is antiquated in regard to assessing liability or damages, while others say 12 ordinary people are possibly the best cross-section to decide on liability or damages.  This, again, is a matter on which I am awaiting a report from the Committee of Inquiry on Practice and Procedure in the Courts.  I have an open mind on the subject, but I feel that some reform is probably necessary.  I hope we will make some progress on this matter in the coming months as well.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of law reform is the question of legal aid.  Deputy Fitzpatrick had something to say on this matter last night.  I want to state emphatically that in no circumstances could we have a situation where legal aid would be free and available to everyone, irrespective of the merits of the person involved.  My predecessor and I have made it quite plain that we think that judicial discretion must be exercised carefully in assessing the merits of a particular claim for legal aid.  If we open the door completely to everyone there would be no end to it, and there would be no end to the cost. It would get out of hand from the financial point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> I do not think it desirable in our society that there should be wholesale subsidisation of hardened criminals in defending their cases.  If a person is poor and he gets into serious trouble, he will probably be successful in getting legal aid.  That is the intention of the Bill, and of the Legislature, and I am certain that the judiciary will exercise commonsense in their application of the scheme.  I would regard it as undesirable that the scheme should be extended in any way to habitual criminals, and people whose activities are a social menance.</P>
    <P>Another matter which brought comment from Deputy Barrett and Deputy Fitzpatrick is the question of the exercise of the ministerial statutory powers of the remission of penalties. This is a matter on which I personally have very strong views.  I feel the person elected from this House to take charge of the administration of justice should be the authority to exercise this ultimate power in regard to the remission of penalties and the modification of punishments imposed by the courts which occasionally are unduly severe.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in his comments this morning, Deputy O'Hara added emphasis to this point of view when he spoke of the importance of uniformity of penalties.  I have had discussions with the District Justices as a body and with the President of the District Court on the question of exercising, as far as possible, a broad uniformity in the penalties imposed.  I am very conscious of the necessity of this.  Any time my discretion is exercised to mitigate a penalty, it will be exercised in the direction of ensuring that penalties are as uniform as possible, within the ambit of judicial discretion.  This is a prerogative of the representative of this House in charge of the Department of Justice, and I think that as parliamentarians we should be very loath to let this authority slip away to any other body or authority that, it has been suggested, might be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister can be questioned any time he uses this power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>He can indeed. <Col N="797" /> I should say that this power is used only after very close investigation which involves getting a report from the local Gardaí, a report from the justice or judge responsible for the case, and observations within any Department concerned of the full circumstances.  If there is an injustice or anomaly of one kind or another in the extent of the penalty I may exercise my authority to remit or mitigate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give full details of each case to the House, if they were requested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  This is a matter for the exercise of my discretion, the discretion of whoever holds my Office.  I will always exercise it, as I see fit, having regard to the submissions made on petition and by the police and the trial justice or judge concerned.  Candidly, I was surprised at Deputy Barrett and Deputy Fitzpatrick, two lawyers, putting this point of view.  I would have thought they would be equally conscious of the fact that the Dáil, or Parliament, must be supreme in these matters, and that the Minister appointed by Parliament and given specific statutory authority should have over-riding authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of my discretion and I do not propose to go into the details of the rights or the wrongs of the exercise of my discretion. I refuse to be drawn any further in that respect.  I only want to say that in the past few years the graph is a decreasing one in regard to the exercise of my prerogatives in this respect.  The percentage of cases that have been dealt with favourably by me in 1965, and by myself and my predecessor in 1964 was lower than in previous years.  I would say of course that this discretion is and should be exercised in a sparing manner.  I shall ensure that so long as I am here I shall defend to the utmost any right of the Minister for Justice to exercise <Col N="798" /> the powers of remission of penalties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Barrett went further than Deputy Fitzpatrick on this particular matter.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of a very important matter of which I am very mindful as well.  That is the question of compensation for injuries to people who help the gardaí in the exercise of their duty.  This matter is dealt with at present on the basis of <i>ex gratia</i> grants and I agree with the view that this should be a matter of statutory right.  Indeed, very shortly an Interdepartmental Report on compensation in regard to all malicious injuries, be they to property or person, will be published and will be made available to all Deputies.  We are publishing this Report as a result of the investigations of an interdepartmental committee with a view to getting full public comment on this matter.  One of the recommendations of the report is that compensation should be granted to people as a matter of statutory right, who go to the assistance of the gardaí. This is by way of replacement of the existing situation where we pay on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by Deputy Sweetman last night of reforms in the administration of justice.  In my opening remarks I also placed emphasis on this aspect.  In regard to the exercise of priorities in this respect, I would regard law reform as most desirable where it can be of practical benefit. While there is much merit in the consolidation of law and much merit in the introduction of progressive social measures, the most practical thing we can do in the matter of priorities now is to improve the administration of justice in regard to procedures and in regard to practice and administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect, I am conscious of the fact that the jurisdiction of the district and circuit courts, which give <Col N="799" /> practical service to citizens throughout the country, is at the moment inadequate particularly having regard to the fall in the value of money since the last limits were fixed.  Even on a higher basis I would wish that the jurisdiction of the district and circuit courts should be enlarged substantially so as to make the services in most court actions available to citizens throughout the country in the most favourable possible centre.  With that end in view I am considering a substantial enlargement of both the district court and the circuit court jurisdictions.  This point has been mentioned and I regard it as a practical way in which litigation, as a service, can be made available to more of our people at much less expensive rates than obtain in the event of their being forced to go to the High Court in Dublin or in some other major centre.</P>
    <P>There is also much that can be remedied in the standard procedures. I mentioned one in my opening speech on the Estimate.  That is settling issues on a pre-trial basis.  A number of issues can be settled in committee by a registrar before the court hearing so as to enable issues to be well defined before the action commences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman last night referred to reform of the administration of the Land Registry.  I am aware of the fact that the expedition with which matters are dealt with in the Land Registry is of great importance so far as the legal profession and the public are concerned.  It is true that in the Land Registry most dealings are in regard to title and this will become more emphasised when the new regulations come into effect under the Registration of Title Act.  It is true, as Deputy Sweetman emphasised, that, as it stands at present, the Land Registry is not fully geared to the potential work which will devolve on it in the next few years.  For that reason, I have made plans, which are now well advanced, to improve the Land Registry by adding two extra storeys to the adjacent public record office building which will result in accommodation being provided for <Col N="800" /> about twice the number of staff we have at the moment.  I hope that accommodation will be in existence and functioning by the end of next year.  At the moment we are holding competitions with a view to bringing in a substantial number of legal assistants and we hope to attract them with improved rates of salary for these positions in the Land Registry.  I regard the Land Registry of course as the hub of the whole title system here.  That will become more evident in the years ahead under the regulations to be made under the Act passed by the House.</P>
    <P>Ground rents have been referred to by several speakers.  I can assure the House that it is my hope that this particular matter will be before the House before it adjourns: we should have the First Reading of a Bill before the summer recess.  The Bill is in course of preparation at the moment and will, I feel, finally get rid of this social evil which has been referred to on many occasions here in the past.  It will involve the abolition of ground rents and follow, generally, the recommendations embodied in the Conroy Commission Report.  It is a progressive measure which has been advocated on many occasions here in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, may I ask the Minister is it proposed to deal with new ground rents as well as those in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an aspect which I have under discussion at the moment.  I would hope that when the Bill is in final form the net effect of it will be to curtail and gradually eliminate altogether ground rents in the future as well as in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made here of the antiquated nature of the Garda regulations. On this aspect, I have been very conscious of the fact that the regulations have not been changed since their institution.  The finance codes have been fully revised and at the moment the disciplinary regulations are being revised, bringing matters in regard to discipline up to date and eliminating <Col N="801" /> any Victorian relics that may have been in them.  The newly revised finance regulations are almost ready for the printers and will be published in the near future.  The revision of the disciplinary regulations is under way.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned here concerned the question of slowness in the payments of moneys out of court from the accountant's office in the High Court.  I think Deputy Ryan mentioned this yesterday.  There was a difficulty some months ago which was caused by illness of members of the staff.  That has been rectified and I understand payments are now being made in an expeditious manner.</P>
    <P>I feel most of the points raised by various Deputies have been dealt with by me in so far as I have taken a summary of the matters mentioned.  If any matter has not been adverted to, I should be glad if Deputies would raise it with me.  I shall be perusing the debates and I shall know if I have covered everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us about censorship of films?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Corish mentioned that.  I had to consider this particular matter shortly after getting into office.  The reason for doing so was that the term of office of the outgoing Censorship Board terminated at the end of last year. I decided, having regard to many aspects mentioned to me in regard to film censorship, to reconstitute the board.  A new board was selected under the chairmanship of a judge of the Circuit Court, with members representative of the clergy, a psychiatrist, a trade union executive and social workers who included a housewife so as to cover the whole field of our society.  This particular board has been issuing limited certificates to a greater extent than formerly.  I should prefer to approach the matter on a selective basis rather than a stricter form of grading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the members of the Appeal <Col N="802" /> Board are fairly unanimous in their approach.  Where films, as Deputy Corish referred to last night, are not suitable for juvenile viewing, a certificate can be issued by the board limiting viewing in that particular case to over a particular age, say 16 or 18 years of age.  I believe grading can be brought about in that way to a better extent than the automatic way in operation in Britain.  A balance has been obtained, as Deputy Corish would wish, between a too liberal approach and a too rigid approach.  There is a middle of the road balance which I feel can be exercised best by a board such as this one under the chairmanship of a Circuit Court judge.  I am satisfied that this balance is being exercised by this board since its formation at the start of the year.</P>
    <P>Generally, we can look now at a situation where the crime position, while not good, is excellent by standards, compared with the rest of the world.  To quote one example in indictable crimes per 100,000 of the population, our figures are 632 compared with 2,100 in England and Wales.  We can take further satisfaction from the fact that the detection rate here is 64 per cent as against 43 per cent in England and Wales.  As long as we can keep on the right side of 50 per cent, we can claim that crime does not pay here.  I sincerely hope that situation will continue and, with the increased efficiency of the Garda, will improve.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the fact that the emphasis in regard to police work here should be on crime of the more violent type, that we must root out any crime which causes harm to person or property.  If we have to fix priorities in regard to crime, this particular aspect should get priority.  That is the reason for the increased strength in the Dublin Metropolitan District.  We want to ensure that any organised crime does not arise here as it has arisen in other countries.  So far we have avoided any real exercise of organised crime in the country.</P>

      <P>I hope the various matters which I have submitted to the Committee of Enquiry into Court Practices and Procedures during the past few months will be considered by them expeditiously and that I will receive a report from them fairly quickly.  The committee is working very well under the chairmanship of a Supreme Court judge.  There are many aspects of law reform, particularly in regard to practice and procedure, which need to be gone into fairly quickly in order to bring our courts and the system of justice here into line with the modern age, to ensure that the administration of justice is as efficient, expeditious and economical as possible and that it is available to all our people.  This is a matter on which I hope to place the greatest emphasis in the coming years.  I am sure it will have the unanimous approval of everybody so that the procedure of our courts can be improved.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter of law reform as a matter of urgency and I hope to have a series of measures before the House dealing with this particular aspect in the coming years.  If we are to go into the Common Market or the European Economic Community, we must have a system of law and administration that is fully geared for the sort of society we will be moving into in the 1970's.  This must be our target. I am very conscious of it.  I am certain by that particular date, when we move into broader association with the European Economic Community, we will have here a system of law that can be adjusted easily or will be on all fours in every aspect with the system of law obtaining in the Community at that particular time.</P>
      <P>This must be our objective and our target.  I am sure that the House will agree that we must concentrate on the need to improve the law so that it moves apace with the social needs of our changing modern society and that we shall, in the 1970's, not alone be geared to the needs of our own people but to the broader issues which we shall meet in the Common Market.</P>

In a theannta sin meadaíodh ar líon na bhfostaithe ins na tionscail dhéantúsaíochta go dtí174,000 nó 5,600 níos mó ná an bhliain roimhe.

Meastar gur fiú suas le £10 milliún iomlán an <Col N="807" /> capiteal atá ins na tionscail seo agus go méadófar ó líon fostaíochta de 1,900 i dtúis báire go dtí 4,800 i ndeire báire.

    <P>In the Book of Estimates, the net Estimate of £7,544,000 for the year 1965-66 compares with a sum of £7,078,320 granted in 1964-65, including token Supplementary Estimates for £20, and shows a net increase of £465,680.  On 11th February, 1965, too late for inclusion in the Book of Estimates, an additional token sum of £10 was granted by way of a further Supplementary Estimate, bringing the total amount granted in 1964-65 to £7,078,330.  The actual position is, therefore, that the Estimate of £7,544,000 for 1965-66 exceeds by £465,670 the total sum of £7,078,330 granted in 1964-65.</P>
    <P>The principal increases arising in the financial year 1965-66 result from an increase in the Grant-in-Aid to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards of £194,000, an increase of £120,000 in the provision for Departmental salaries and wages, an increase of £57,598 in the Grant-in-Aid to the Industrial Development Authority, an <Col N="809" /> increase of £16,500 for An Cheard Comhairle and net increases of £22,000 and £15,000 to the Irish National Productivity Committee and Coras Tráchtála respectively after taking Supplementary Estimates of £8,000 and £60,000 in February last into account.  New services&mdash;the Buy Irish Campaign and the National Building Advisory Council&mdash;account for £44,990 and £25,000 respectively.  Minor increases in other subheads amount to £8,810, bringing the total increases in expenditure to £571,898, to which must be added a decrease of £2,287 in Appropriations-in-Aid, giving a total of £574,185.  When allowance is made for the token Supplementary Estimate £10 taken in February 1965, expenditure under the subheads which I have indicated, arising in the financial year 1965-66, will exceed expenditure under these subheads in the present financial year by £574,175.</P>
    <P>There will be decreases in expenditure under a number of other subheads in the year 1965-66.  There will, for instance, be a reduction of £10,000 in the provision for laboratory equipment for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, while the provision which will require to be made for the New York World's Fair will be down by £58,000.  Decreases in other subheads will amount to £40,505, bringing the aggregate of the decreases to £108,505.  The net increase in the Estimate for 1965-66 compared with the year 1964-65 is, therefore, £465,670.</P>
    <P>The year 1964 was characterised by an impressive expansion in industrial output.  The average of the provisional indices of volume of production for the year (to base 1953=100) was 167.6 compared with a corresponding average in 1963 of 152.6.  This is equivalent to an increase of almost 10 per cent in the volume of industrial production, and it represents a new record in the level of industrial output.</P>
    <P>As was expected, the notable increase in industrial output has been accompanied by a considerable rise in employment in manufacturing industries. The average number of workers employed in the year rose to an estimated level of 174,100 which represents <Col N="810" /> an increase of no fewer than 5,600 over the preceding year.</P>
    <P>The pace of industrial development continues to accelerate, and this is evidenced by the substantial number of important new industrial undertakings which commenced operations during the year 1964.  In that year no fewer than 32 new factories or extensions to existing industries went into production. The success achieved by the Industrial Development Authority in attracting new industry from abroad is reflected in the fact that 25 of these new industries were started with external participation.  The total capital investment represented by the 32 new industrial units is estimated to be of the order of £10 million.</P>
    <P>The employment, which will be in the region of 1,900 in the initial stages, is expected to develop to the point where 4,800 additional jobs will have been created.  These new industries cover a wide variety of products and processes.  The range of end-products will include aluminium anodising, plastics, asbestos cement pressure pipes, refractory lining materials, filter tobacco process machinery, adding machines, industrial thermometers and recorders, electric food mixers, pharmaceutical raw materials and hypodermic syringes and needles.  The promotional campaign of the Industrial Development Authority is being actively carried on in the USA, in Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Additional financial resources have been provided for the Authority to enable its promotional campaign to be further intensified, and, as Deputies are probably aware, the Authority has recently opened an office in Germany&mdash;at Cologne&mdash;which is the first office to be established by it in Europe. It has, of course, an office in New York.  The Authority has two full time representatives in the USA and three full time representatives in Europe.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal approved grants during the year ending on 31st March, 1965, amounting to £2,040,200 for industrial projects located in the undeveloped <Col N="811" /> areas.  This brings the total provision for these grants to £8,892,960, of which grants totalling £5,614,590 were paid up to the 31st March, 1965. The total capital investment involved in projects which have been approved amounts now to almost £23 million and it is expected that ultimately employment will be provided for 12,600 persons.</P>
    <P>In all, 144 industrial projects have now been approved for the undeveloped areas.  Of this number 121 are now in production and the remaining 23 projects are in varying stages of development.  About half of the projects which have been approved were promoted entirely by Irish interests, the majority of the other projects were promoted by foreign industrialists, while in a number of instances industries were sponsored by a combination of Irish and foreign interests.  It is worthy of note that a substantial number of these industrial projects will find an outlet for their production on external markets.</P>
    <P>The grants scheme for industries outside the undeveloped areas continues to develop satisfactorily, and during the year ended 31st March, 1965, An Foras Tionscal approved grants for new industries amounting to £2,072,799.  This brings the aggregate of grants approved under the scheme to £8,018,592, of which amount rather more than half had been paid at the end of March last.  The total capital investment in the approved projects amounts to over £33 million, and it is expected that employment will eventually be provided for 17,800 persons.</P>
    <P>The new factories will send most of the goods produced to foreign markets. More than 60 industrial projects assisted by An Foras Tionscal are in production outside the undeveloped areas.  There are 28 other projects for which grants have been approved and which are advancing towards the stage at which production will commence. A majority of the projects approved have been sponsored by foreign interests, though a considerable number have been promoted by Irish groups.</P>
    <P>Exports in the year 1964 reached a <Col N="812" /> record figure of £223 million&mdash;an increase of £27 million compared with the year 1963.  Imports also reached a new level of £347 million, a figure which exceeds by £41 million the value of imports for the year 1963. The import excess arising from visible transactions will, of course, be offset to a very substantial extent by invisible earnings, and it must be remembered also that a considerable proportion of our imports consist of industrial and agricultural plant and machinery which will give productive employment and remove the necessity for the importation of considerable quantities of consumer goods which are imported at the present time.</P>
    <P>The detailed trade figures issued by the Central Statistics Office show that virtually all categories contributed to the increase in exports in 1964.  Exports of live animals brought in £67 million, an increase of £14 million; food, drink and tobacco brought in £73 million, an increase of £1 million; exports of manufactured goods (excluding food, drink and fuel) increased by 32 per cent from £41 million to £54 million accounting for almost one-quarter of total exports in the year.</P>
    <P>The preliminary returns for the first quarter of 1965 show that total exports were £5.6 million below the level of exports in the corresponding quarter of 1964.  In the absence of a detailed breakdown of the quarter's export figures it is not possible to say how particular categories of exports fared.  It would appear, however, from provisional figures that industrial exports generally, while showing some improvement on the figure for the corresponding quarter last year, have been affected by the British import surcharge.</P>
    <P>It will be unnecessary to remind Deputies that our growing export trade with Great Britain received what at first sight appeared to be a major setback towards the end of last October when the British Government, introduced a temporary charge of 15 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> on imports of manufactured goods into Britain.  Our contractual right of entry free of duty to the British market was thus set <Col N="813" /> aside, and Irish exporters were immediately confronted with a situation of unprecedented difficulty.</P>
    <P>The reaction of Irish exporters to this challenge was quite remarkable, and I think that they are to be congratulated on the success of their efforts to maintain their export trade to Britain and to develop new markets, the potentialities of which had to be investigated at once.  Irish industry has managed to avoid the worst consequences of this threat to production and exports, and it is a considerable tribute to our industrialists that they have adapted themselves so successfully to this new and difficult situation without any major breakdown of production.</P>
    <P>Recognising the necessity for rapid intervention the Government, for their part, introduced immediately a scheme designed to assist exporters affected by the British import levy.  Under the scheme, market development grants are payable to exporters with the object of encouraging a continuance of our export trade at the highest practicable level.  The aggregate of market development grants paid up to 30th April, 1965 is £254,750.  It is clearly necessary to avoid a reversal of the trend of expansion of exports which has been such an encouraging feature of our economy for some years and which might upset to a dangerous extent the projections on which the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> is based.  If there were to be an inhibition of our industrial exports at the present juncture, it would be a most unfortunate development, since it would come at a time when industry's efforts to adapt itself to free trading conditions are fairly well advanced and programmes for further export development are beginning to take shape.  Furthermore, a number of new firms are now reaching a stage at which their export trade would be capable of making a significant contribution to the export drive.  The decision of the vast majority of exporters to maintain, as far as possible, their position in the British market is a wise one, since it is clear <Col N="814" /> that it would be difficult and expensive for exporters to retrieve a major loss of position in the British market.  The fact that the British import charge will be of temporary duration, only, is a relevant factor in this connection.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will recall, the British Government announced some time ago that there would be a reduction in the amount of the levy from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, effective from the 27th April, 1965.  While this reduction will be of limited value to Irish exporters, nevertheless, it is to be welcomed as confirmation of the expressed intention of the British Government to terminate the import levy at the earliest practicable date.</P>
    <P>The Buy Irish Campaign, which was a spontaneous reaction to the British import levy, has got off to a most encouraging start.  Since it is basically a public relations exercise, the results of such a campaign are naturally difficult to measure, but I am informed that Irish industry has experienced a perceptibly increased demand for its products and that the probability is that this is attributable in large measure to the effect of the Buy Irish Campaign.  There is no doubt but that the campaign has the support of the vast majority of business people in this country, and the public has given ample demonstration of its goodwill. A number of distributors have already established special promotions in support of the campaign, and further developments of a similar kind may be expected.  If the campaign is to be as successful as one would wish, it is essential that traders should co-operate in a way which will ensure that goods of Irish manufacture are consistently brought to the notice of the public at the point of sale.  The Buy Irish Committee has taken into account increased consumer sophistication in the matter of quality, price and value for money generally, and it is fully aware of the need to present to the public products which will make an effective appeal not merely because they are of Irish manufacture but because they are acceptable from the standpoint of price, quality and variety.</P>
    <P>Apart from the special value which <Col N="815" /> a Buy Irish Campaign is capable of having in the present situation in which our export trade has been impeded by the British import charge, a Buy Irish Campaign in the long-term can do much to increase the demand for goods of Irish manufacture and to promote a greater feeling of solidarity between the purchasing public and Irish industry.  There is an identity of interest in this matter between the different sections of the community, and, in my opinion, a Buy Irish Campaign conducted on a long-term basis is capable of creating new opportunities for employment in industry, increasing the volume of industrial output and rendering unnecessary the importation of products of various kinds which can be manufactured at home.  I am confident that the community at large will continue to extend to this campaign the active practical support which it undoubtedly deserves.</P>
    <P>The Grant-in-Aid of Córas Tráchtála shows an increase of £15,000 over the provision made in 1964-65.  The Board's activities in the field of export promotion, overseas market development and design development are being extended in accordance with the Government's plans for economic expansion. Since its establishment as a Statutory Board in September, 1959, Córas Tráchtála has received grants-in-aid totalling over £1½ million.  The grant-in-aid for 1965-66 will bring the total to over £2 million.</P>
    <P>The work of design development is becoming an increasingly important part of the activities of Córas Tráchtála. The Board are establishing a number of design workshops in Kilkenny, and there are already in operation workshops for textile printing, silverware, pottery, poplin weaving, candlemaking and wool weaving.  The need for an improvement in the design of industrial products has been obvious for a considerable time, and I am hopeful that any ground lost will now be recovered.</P>
    <P>I hope that an Ireland House will soon be opened in London in premises which have been secured in New Bond Street.  This will make it possible to bring together under one roof a <Col N="816" /> number of Irish State agencies which, until now, have been located in different parts of London.  An Ireland House should help to project a better image of Ireland in the British capital and facilitate the promotion of our export trade with our most important customer.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Industrial Organisation which was set up by the Government in 1961 has completed its task of making a critical appraisal of the measures required to secure a re-organisation of Irish industry to enable it to meet conditions of freer trade. Survey teams appointed by the Committee carried out detailed surveys of 26 industries in which some 87,000 persons are employed.  The Report of each team, accompanied by a covering report by the Committee giving its views on the survey, has been published in 25 cases; the 26th report will be published as soon as possible.  In addition to these survey reports, five interim reports which are of general application to industry have been published by the CIO.  The Committee has prepared also a final report reviewing, generally, the entire programme of work for which it was responsible. This report will also be published shortly.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that this Committee has rendered an extremely valuable service to the nation for which the Government are very grateful. So far as I am aware, similar industrial studies in such depth have not been carried out in any other country, and it is a source of gratification to learn that the work of our Committee has been very favourably received and commented on in responsible quarters abroad.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Committee on Industrial Organisation has completed its appointed task does not mean that there can be any slackening in the efforts which industry is called upon to make to adapt itself in the shortest possible time for freer trading conditions. As mentioned on other occasions, a new branch was established in my Department nearly three years ago for the special purpose of ensuring that the recommendations in relation to industrial efficiency made by the Committee <Col N="817" /> on Industrial Organisation are implemented.  In this matter, the Industrial Reorganisation Branch of my Department works in the closest possible contact with the different industrial sectors, and the necessity for bringing about the changes in the structure and organisation of industry advocated by the Committee on Industrial Organisation is constantly emphasised.</P>
    <P>I am now able to report that no fewer than 21 Adaptation Councils have been set up by industry.  The establishment of these councils was recommended by the Committee on Industrial Organisation as the most effective medium through which its recommendations might be implemented. Some of these Adaptation Councils have already made remarkable strides in the short time since their formation, and they have given striking evidence of what can be achieved by industry in the realm of reorganisation and readaptation by co-operative effort.  There are, nevertheless, a limited number of industrial sectors which have not yet fully realised the advantages capable of being derived from full and effective participation in the work of the Adaptation Councils.  I would urge these particular industries to adopt a more positive and farsighted policy.  Unless they participate in the general movement towards re-organisation and readaptation, they may well find that they will be quite unable to cope with the difficulties and problems which will be presented in conditions of freer trade.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a recommendation made by the Committee on Industrial Organisation, arrangements have been made for the creation of standing trade union advisory bodies which will be available for consultation by the Adaptation Councils in all matters affecting the interests of workers.  The establishment of these advisory bodies is now well under way, and there are at the present time more than 20 of these bodies in existence.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that our industries are availing themselves of the special grants and loans which are available to facilitate the attainment <Col N="818" /> of higher levels of efficiency through a process of reorganisation and adaptation.  Up to the end of March, 1965, over 450 applications for these special grants and loans were received, and the proposed capital expenditure involved amounted, in the aggregate, to nearly £39 million.  The total amount of grants approved up to the present is in the region of £5 million, of which nearly £1,500,000 has already been paid out to industry.</P>
    <P>While the particulars which I have given in relation to readaptation grants are impressive, it would be a mistaken view to regard industrial readaptation solely in terms of improved plant, equipment and premises.  The importance of modern buildings and equipment is self-evident, but there is a danger that sufficient emphasis may not be placed on attitudes of mind.</P>
    <P>No matter what assistance, advice or persuasion may be forthcoming from my Department or from other agencies concerned with improved efficiency or higher productivity, in the last analysis what really counts is the readiness of individual firms within industry to get down, both at management and staff level, to the practical problems of readaptation in a realistic, vigorous and intelligent way.  I have every hope that the increased dynamism of our manufacturers, so vividly reflected in the export figures I have given you, will likewise be reflected in their progress with the all-important work of adaptation.</P>
    <P>The Government realise that the achievement of the targets set out in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and also the movement towards freer trade are not matters divorced from human problems.  An increase in skilled workers and the availability of adequate numbers of persons with the requisite skills, are as essential to the achievement of the targets as are the adaptation and modernisation of industry.  Adaptation to conditions of freer trade will be accompanied by changes in employment opportunities.  Mechanisation or automation may create redundancies in particular industries, though the ultimate expansion of those industries, <Col N="819" /> according as efficiency improves, may eventually result in increased employment in the industries.  The Government feels it necessary, at this stage, to indicate the steps it is taking and will take to deal with the human problems involved, so that there need be no apprehension in the minds of workers about what the future holds for them.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to set up a manpower forecasting agency whose function it will be to predict, over a period ahead, the likely requirements for various classes of workers, particularly skilled and semi-skilled and the likely available opportunities under these heads in the ordinary course.  It will be part of the task of this agency to estimate the number of persons in various categories who are likely to become redundant as a result of the movement towards freer trade and the preparations being made to increase the efficiency of industry towards that end.  If, as is to be assumed, the forecast reveals shortages in particular skills, it will be the task of the Government to ensure that adequate numbers of persons are trained or re-trained so as to meet estimated requirements. For this purpose, the Government is preparing to introduce legislation to provide for the setting up of a training body.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of the Government to create a situation in which the worker who becomes redundant in the circumstances envisaged above, will have his suitability for training or re-training assessed and will be provided with such training or re-training as he requires. Financial provision will need to be made for the workers and a system of redundancy or stand-off payment, covering the period of training or re-training, is being worked out.  The Government's intention is that a worker need have no apprehension that if his employment has to be terminated because of the adaptation of the industry or because of the incidence of freer trade, he will be left without reasonable resources or left without an opportunity of being re-trained <Col N="820" /> for absorption into another industry.</P>
    <P>The task of placing re-trained persons in industry will involve an extension of the functions of the employment exchanges and the re-orientation of their activities.  It may be taken, however, that a situation will exist in which a worker who becomes redundant will be eligible for redundancy payment and for re-training if he is found to have the necessary aptitude. The purpose of this re-training will be to equip the worker with a skill for which there is a demand and thereby ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that he will be in a position to avail of suitable employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the implementation of the Government's proposals which I have just outlined will involve a considerable amount of organisation and planning.  The overall responsibility will rest with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it is envisaged that he will have the assistance of an advisory body constituted on a broad representative basis.</P>
    <P>In the field of industrial relations generally, one of the most important developments during 1964 was the operation of the national wage agreement which provided a generally accepted basis for wage settlements and helped to obviate the haphazard negotiation of wage claims, which tended in the past to disrupt employer-labour relations.  There was, unfortunately, a major stoppage of work in one industry in which both employers and workers suffered considerable loss before a settlement was reached. Clearly, we must continue our efforts to improve the machinery of industrial relations so as to ensure that the production losses and social suffering arising from prolonged strikes should be obviated as far as possible.  I have recently taken the initiative in the formulation of proposals for the overhaul and modernisation, where necessary, of the industrial relations machinery established under the Industrial Relations Act of 1946.  The organisations representative of employers and workers are considering my proposals <Col N="821" /> which were outlined for them at meetings held a short while ago.</P>
    <P>An Cheard-Chomhairle, the National Apprenticeship Board, since its establishment in 1960 has made substantial progress and has introduced statutory apprenticeship schemes in the furniture trades, the engineering and metal trades, the electrical trade and the trade of motor mechanic.  It intends to bring similar schemes, for the printing and building industries, into operation during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Board is very conscious of the need to ensure that training will be geared to the needs of the future.  The Board's aim in the case of the skilled trades is to ensure that a sufficient number of suitable boys are recruited and that their practical and theoretical training during apprenticeship is such as to prepare them adequately for their future roles as skilled workers.</P>
    <P>The intake of apprentices is, of course, governed to a great extent by the availability of training facilities on the one hand and the prospect of job opportunities on the other.</P>
    <P>In many of the skilled trades the Board has already prescribed training rules to ensure that the apprentices will be given a comprehensive practical training on the shop floor, and it has appointed technical staff to ensure, by frequent visits to factories, that these rules are implemented.  Modern employers are increasingly conscious of the importance of training as a factor in increased production and of the fact that training expenditure is a worthwhile investment.  On-the-job training may of course pose difficulties in that, apart from a possible conflict between the firm's production function and the training function, the nature of the work or the machinery in individual concerns may militate against the apprentices obtaining a comprehensive practical training.  Technical school instruction is essential not as a substitute for shop floor training but as a necessary complement.  On-the-job training combined with the technical school instruction in practical, theoretical and social disciplines is designed to increase the all round efficiency and understanding of the apprentices.</P>
    <P>There has been no change in our aim <Col N="822" /> to secure membership of the European Economic Community.  No major developments have taken place during the past year, but our desire to resume negotiations, when circumstances permit, leading to membership of the EEC is well known.  In the meantime, we are maintaining contact with the Community at various levels, and we have continually in mind the possibility of improving our trade relationship with the member countries of the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy Round of trade negotiations provided a suitable opportunity for the re-opening last year of our application for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  It is possible that the examination of our application for membership will commence within the next few months.  Our accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and our participation in the Kennedy Round, if achieved, will involve the acceptance of commitments affecting tariffs and trade arrangements. Corresponding benefits would accrue to industry and agriculture from our Association with GATT.</P>
    <P>Discussions are proceeding with the British Government with the object of improving the permanent trading arrangements between both countries. I am not in a position at the present time, however, to indicate the stage which has been reached in these discussions or to express an opinion concerning the possible outcome.</P>
    <P>While emphasis is now principally on multilateral trade agreements, nevertheless, we still have a number of bilateral trade agreements with countries such as France, Germany and Finland. These agreements are reviewed from time to time, and advantage is taken of the possibilities represented by them to develop our export trade with these countries at increasingly higher levels.</P>
    <P>Two general 10 per cent reductions have been made in the level of industrial tariffs, generally, and similar enlargements have been made in the quotas which apply to particular industrial products.  A third general reduction of tariffs had been visualised for the 1st January, 1965, but, having <Col N="823" /> regard to the difficulties created for Irish industry by the British import charge, the Government decided in the circumstances to defer for the time being the application of the third round of tariff reductions.  This decision does not, of course, imply any change in Government policy, and it certainly does not provide any grounds for a relaxation by industry of the efforts necessary to proceed with adaptation and re-organisations schemes designed to achieve the highest possible level of efficiency and competitiveness in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance grant scheme continues to provide a valuable service for industry.  While many firms have availed themselves of the scheme, a surprisingly large number of firms have not yet done so.  Very encouraging reports have been received from those firms which have utilised the grant scheme whether for consultancy work, training courses or study visits abroad.  A 50 per cent grant of the cost is, of course, a real inducement to firms to improve their productive efficiency.  Grants are also made to the Irish National Productivity Committee and to the Irish Management Institute, for the purpose of assisting existing firms desirous of improving their efficiency.</P>
    <P>With the aim of developing to the maximum extent its potential for assisting Irish industry, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards continues to expand its operations over a wide field.  Existing facilities are being improved and enlarged, and preparations for the provision of a whole range of new facilities are at an advanced stage.  Separate Departments are being established for metallurgy and engineering research, while new activities are also being planned in the fields of bio-technology, analogue computers, metrology and the industrial use of radio-active isotopes.  Developments in relation to chemical engineering, electronics and printing are also proposed. Improvements have been made by the Institute in its arrangements for the provision of Fellowships and industrial scholarships which are aimed at promoting <Col N="824" /> a greater use of science and technology in industry in this country.</P>
    <P>This expansion in the Institute's operations is seriously taxing its existing accommodation.  The Institute already has plans in hand for the provision of new buildings to house the additional staff and equipment being provided.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months, there has been considerable activity in exploration for mineral deposits in many parts of the country.  Many external companies and a number of Irish firms are anxious to carry out a thorough examination of our potential mineral resources, and these firms have been assisted by providing such facilities as prospecting licences and State mining permissions.</P>
    <P>Development of the deposits of lead, zinc and silver discovered at Tynagh, County Galway continued during the year and I am informed that it is hoped that production will commence towards the end of the present year.</P>
    <P>Further exploration is being undertaken at Silvermines, County Tipperary with a view to providing fuller information in regard to the deposits of lead, zinc and silver in that locality.  There is now an appreciable production of barytes which finds a market in the USA.</P>
    <P>The reports on the drilling programmes carried out in the Leinster and Connaught coalfields which were published towards the middle of last year indicate that reserves of coal in the Leinster coalfield are of the order of 7,000,000 tons of anthracite coal. It is estimated that there are about 18,000,000 tons of semi-bituminous coal in the Connaught coalfield.  A considerable portion of the Connaught reserves and some of the Leinster reserves may not, however, be capable of economic development because of the thinness of the coal seams or the high ash content of the coal.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis hitherto has been on raising productivity in agriculture and industry, it is also necessary to increase efficiency in the services sector which accounts for some 40 per cent of national income and of total employment in the country.  The distributive <Col N="825" /> trades form a very important part of the services sector and have a vital role to play in the development of our economy.  It is essential, therefore, that the distributive trades should continue to strive to achieve the highest level of efficiency and productivity.</P>
    <P>The Efficiency of Distribution Unit which was set up specially in my Department last year to ensure that the distributive sector makes a maximum contribution towards the aims of the Second programme has held a number of discussions with the Federation of Trade Associations with a view to arriving at the most appropriate measures designed to improve efficiency in distribution.  The Unit maintains close liaison with the Distributive Trades Productivity Committee which was formed during the year under the auspices of the Irish National Productivity Committee, with joint management-labour representation. This committee has now prepared its first programme which provides for the setting up of educational, advisory, information and research services for the assistance of the distributive trades. The committee recently held seminars in a number of centres throughout the country for the purpose of spotlighting the challenges facing the distributive trades to-day and to consider what can be done to meet the changing needs and requirements of this decade.</P>
    <P>Min Fhéir (1959) Teoranta, the State-sponsored company which was set up to produce grassmeal from bog-land in County Mayo, had successfully completed its first year of commercial production.  There was an excellent growth of grass and the grassmeal produced was, I understand, of a very high quality.</P>
    <P>The construction of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow is substantially completed and commissioning of the plant is under way.  As announced in the press recently, the first consignment of sulphuric acid made at Arklow is being supplied to Holland. It is expected that full production will be achieved by autumn, 1965.</P>
    <P>The factory will be operated at <Col N="826" /> maximum capacity to supply the requirements of the home market for sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate and, if the need should arise to dispose of any surplus production arising in the early stages, satisfactory arrangements have been made for placing any initial surplus in export markets.  The employment afforded will be in the region of 300, and since it is a basic chemical enterprise, the skilled labour content will be exceptionally high.</P>
    <P>The final stage of the development plans of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. is now being reached.  All the civil engineering works have been completed, and now major plant installations have been brought into commission. Difficulties have, however, been experienced by the company in achieving full commercial production, and operational consultants have been engaged to suggest measures which might resolve these problems.  There remain to be completed and brought into commercial operation the wire rod mill and sheet mill.  The wire rod mill is scheduled for initial operation before the end of 1965.  The sheet mill is in the final stages of installation, and commercial production will be undertaken when an increased supply of fresh water is provided under the Cobh water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>The land connection estimated to cost £300,000 between Haulbowline Island and the mainland, will reduce the company's costs.  It will also provide a useful facility to many of the company's customers and should encourage the establishment on the mainland of secondary industries requiring easy access to steel.  Work on the connection commenced last October, and it is expected to be completed in the middle of 1966.</P>
    <P>Price increases and price control have featured largely in the debates in this House and in public statements by the Taoiseach, my predecessor and other Government spokesmen during the past year.  This House has, from time to time, been given accounts of the measures taken&mdash;measures which used to the full the powers under the Prices Act, 1958&mdash;to probe price increases <Col N="827" /> which appeared to be excessive and to eliminate them where this was recommended.  The Prices Section of my Department has kept the position under constant review and has taken the initiative when this was considered desirable, in the investigation of price increases.  I am satisfied that the work of that Section, when coupled with that of the Fair Trade Commission and aided by the vigilance of the consumer public, has resulted in stabilising prices to a not inconsiderable degree.</P>
    <P>I do not say that a greater measure of stabilisation is not possible and indeed I am looking forward to a continued improvement in the position in the future partly because of the factors I have already mentioned and partly because I anticipate that improved industrial relations must influence for good such factors as efficiency, output and unit cost and provide a cushion against the impact of other increases in production costs.  I strongly adhere to the view that, times of emergency apart, statutory price control is not in any way an acceptable alternative to free and fair competition. It should be clearly understood, however, that I intend to use my powers under the Prices Act, 1958, to the full to secure fair prices within an economy based on free and fair competition at all levels.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the Fair Trade Commission investigated complaints regarding the operation of Fair Trading Rules relating to entry into and trade in the sale and repair of motor vehicles.  The investigation revealed that, in general, the Rules, which came into force in March, 1962, continue to operate satisfactorily.  The Commission reviewed the Fair Trading Rules relating to electric light bulbs and dry batteries and the Orders governing building materials, cookers and ranges and found that the Rules and Orders appear to be operating satisfactorily.  The Commission intend to review the operation of the rules relating to the distribution of coal.</P>
    <P>An agreement with the petrol companies, under which they undertook <Col N="828" /> to exercise restraint in relation to the supply of new retail petrol sites and the opening of company-owned stations, also came under review.  The Commission reached the conclusion that these arrangements have operated reasonably successfully, and the petrol companies have agreed that they should be continued for the present.</P>
    <P>The Commission completed a survey begun in the previous year of the intoxicating liquor trade in certain areas to ascertain the effects on competition of price recommendations by trade associations.  The Commission are satisfied that no collective action was taken to enforce enhanced prices and that a reasonable element of competition exists.  They are keeping the position under continuing review.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the past year have been important for Irish industry and for the economy as a whole. Productive industry achieved a very satisfactory rate of growth during the year which augurs well for the ultimate attainment of the objectives of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Industrial adaptation gathered real impetus during the year, and it is now evident that industry, in general, has a sense of urgency in regard to the problems which are bound to confront it in conditions of freer trade.  I think that it can be said that the move towards general redaptation on the part of large sectors of industry is now well underway. One cannot fail to be impressed by the extent to which industry continues to avail itself also of the facilities available for the reorganisation of management and the training of staff in modern methods and techniques. The services provided by the Irish Management Institute and by the National Productivity Committee have been extremely valuable in this connection.</P>
    <P>The promotion of industrial development continues to make very satisfactory progress, and this is evidenced by the number of new factories which commenced production during the past year and the impressive employment potential which these factories represent. <Col N="829" /> As already mentioned, many of these new factories will concentrate on exports rather than on the home market, and this is bound to be reflected in a major rise in export levels in the years which lie ahead.  It may be expected, therefore, that the present trend for industrial exports to play an increasingly important role in our external economy will develop on an even more impressive scale than in the past.  In this connection, it ought not to be overlooked that in the past year Irish exports reached an all-time record in spite of the difficulties which arose in relation to the British market. On the assumption that world trade continues to develop satisfactorily, I think that the outlook for the Irish economy is very favourable, and we can confidently hope that the major advances achieved during the past 12 months will be continued in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of his speech, the Minister adverted to the fact that the targets aimed at in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, as far as industry was concerned, were being adhered to, but the question now arises as to whether or not these targets are sufficient.  These targets aim at assimilating all the young people coming forward for jobs as well as those leaving agriculture. The Government forecast a reduction in the numbers employed in agriculture. We, on this side of the House, have never agreed that that should be the position and we think measures could be taken, measures we would take if we had the opportunity, which would mean we would not have this great reduction in agricultural employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in their adherence to the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, indicates quite clearly that they expect this reduction.  They also indicate that they expect to assimilate the agricultural workers displaced in industrial employment. From an examination of the figures, it is quite clear that that is not the evolution.  It was no surprise to me to find in paragraph 2 of the report of the National Industrial Economic <Col N="830" /> Council, which arrived in my post this morning, the following statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Total employment, however, does not seem to be rising at the rate envisaged in the second programme, mainly because of a more rapid decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture and a slower increase in employment in the services sector.  The slower rate of increase in employment is not the result of a general labour shortage (though local shortages of particular skills are occuring): unemployment remains high and annual emigration has recently been about 25,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This picture has not been painted by me.  It has been painted by the Government. We are faced then with the situation laid down in the <i>Progress Report for 1964.</i> Paragraph 22 of that report, which also arrived this morning, states:</P>
    <P>In the second half of the year the rate of expansion slowed down.  This was the result mainly of repercussions on industry of building trade disputes in the Dublin area regarding the interpretation of the national agreement on wages and salaries, and of the uncertain export situation following the imposition of the British surcharge on imports of manufactures.  The rise however, was still a large one of about 8 per cent.  For the year as a whole, the rate of growth of output was almost 10 per cent as compared with an increase of slightly over 6 per cent in 1963.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly inspiring paragraph but it does point to the fact that production slowed down in the second half of the year.  The Government have pinned their faith on the assimilation of the redundant labour force in manufacturing industry.  In the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, paragraph 51 states:</P>
    <P>. . . If agricultural growth for any reason falls short of 2.7 per cent per annum, industry will have to step up its contribution further.</P>
    <P>This indicates that what the Minister <Col N="831" /> has just told us has been adhered to, but may be not quite enough in fact. Again, in paragraph 58 there is the statement:</P>
    <P>The expansion of the industrial sector is a key objective, because the reduction in emigration, the improvement in productivity and the expansion in services all depend primarily on its achievement.</P>
    <P>We have to decide then today whether or not we have gone far enough.  All the indications are that, from the point of view of stemming emigration and assimilating those becoming redundant on the land, we are not doing enough, and that is accepted by the authorities I have quoted.</P>
    <P>This occurs at a time when the economic barometer was, for some years, set fair.  We start off in a situation in which our industrial volume is exceptionally low.  If only because of the fact that a good labour force was available, one would find industrialists coming in from abroad and people with the know-how and the money setting up industries here because the volume was so low.  The encouragements given by the Government&mdash;I do not decry them&mdash;have brought a greater upsurge in industrial activity than would have occurred had things been left as they were.  We have had a period now, however, in which import prices have largely remained static.  At the same time our export prices have improved and been quite good.  In this situation we have not really measured up to what is expected if we are to see an end to emigration and full employment for our people at home.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the enemy of all this is inflation.  If it were possible for the industrial worker here to live as well as his counterpart in England and, at the same time, find a lesser number of pounds, shilling and pence in his wage packet, we would be on a winner because that cost, and it is only one of the costs, of our industrial products would be proportionately lower and our products would, therefore, be in a highly competitive position. <Col N="832" /> All this depends principally, I suppose, on good industrial relations and an extension of the machinery for improved industrial relations.  The Minister today spoke of the introduction of new legislation to amend the Industrial Relations Act of 1946. Last year, his predecessor said the same thing.  I do not know if any amendment is necessary but, if it is, then we should get down to the job and do the amending.  As far as industrial relations are concerned, I am a firm believer in Joint Labour Committees.  I have served as an employer member on the Joint Labour Committee for the Milling industry. Deputy O'Leary serves on the same Committee.  At one period our chairman was the present Minister for Education.  Great work has been done on that Committee.  Employers and employees sit down around the same table, argue the problems and iron out the difficulties, finishing with the best production situation and, at the same time, the best employment and remuneration situation that can be evolved in the prevailing circumstances. It the joint committee fails to reach agreement, they then make their pleadings to a chairman and two independent members in much the same way as the ordinary litigant does in the courts.  It is very rarely that the decision of these independent people, nominated by the Labour Court, proves unacceptable.  The decision comes from the Labour Court and it becomes the law in a matter of seven or eight weeks. I should like to see an extension of that system.  It works well in the mineral water distributing trade, the milling industry, and in other spheres.</P>
    <P>If we are to press forward in industrial relations we must have a solid approach to some form of profit sharing where the workers are concerned. There must be a norm of production and this norm must do several things. It must give a reasonable return on capital invested because one will not get capital if one does not give a reasonable return on it.  As well as that, it must give the reserves that are so necessary in the changing circumstances of today to enable the industry to re-equip itself, perhaps twice within a decade.  It is vitally essential then <Col N="833" /> that there should be profit sharing. I operate profit sharing by means of pools in which the workers have shares, those involved more in certain operations having larger shares than those involved less in the operations.  Profit sharing will have to come.  It is the best way of procuring good industrial relations.  Everyone in the industry has an interest in the cheque that comes in the second or third week of December, to say nothing of the interest involved in wondering why the cheque is not larger or why some one in another section has got a bigger cheque.  This is something that can give us the production and the quality we need.  It will mean that everybody in industry will be interested.  It is the modern outlook and it is coming here.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work of Coras Tráchtála, the Industrial Development Authority and Foras Tionscal.  Any of us who have any contact with them realise the excellent job they are doing.  If I were to single out any group for most extraordinary enthusiasm, which infects everybody, I would single out the people in Coras Tráchtála.  The result of a call to Coras Tráchtála is that you have about four telephone calls inside a week giving you information, help and advice.  This body is rightly being expanded by the Minister.  It has already done a lot of good and will do more in the future.</P>
    <P>The system of going to the Industrial Development Authority with a project, having it set up in a general way, and then getting down to the economic factor of whether you will get a grant or a loan from Foras Tionscal is, perhaps, unwieldy.  Various Deputies, including Deputy Cosgrave, suggested there could be room for amalgamation here.  I just do not know.  Perhaps there is.  The job is, however, being done well as it is.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something a little bit local but yet of considerable interest.  I am absolutely certain that Foras Tionscal, the Industrial Development Authority and Coras Tráchtála deal with Opposition Deputies in exactly the same manner as they deal with Government Deputies.  Influence <Col N="834" /> is entirely related, not to who you are, but to the validity of your request, the manner in which it is put forward and whether or not it stands up to the scrutiny that must be given to it by any Government body dispensing funds of that kind.  During the last election campaign, the Government Deputies in my constituency were claiming everything.  I did not enter into that race.  Quite frankly, I had as much to do with the establishment of some of the industries referred to in their literature and speeches as they had, and in many cases, perhaps, more.</P>
    <P>The people in those industries know me and know that.  Jumping on the bandwagon is an operation I despise. It is not the sort of thing we want to see in this House.  It is not the sort of thing that brings lasting appreciation from the people of your constituency, although it may gain you a few votes.  I want to make it quite clear that in my negotiations with Córas Tráchtála, the Industrial Development Authority and Foras Tionscal I have received every help and got everything that could be humanly given once the matter was approached in a proper manner.  I am satisfied nobody else got any more.  I want to emphasise again that the campaign which was carried on was quite untrue. As the only Opposition Member in the constituency in the 17th Dáil, and continuing the same position in the 18th Dáil, I had as much if not more to do with these industries&mdash;some of them are referred to in the Minister's brief to-day&mdash;as the members of the Government Party.</P>
    <P>The apprenticeship scheme is most important.  I am glad to know there have been extensions to it.  I agree with the Minister that there is necessity for considerable further extension. This means that the boy who goes to a technical school and later to a technological college will have a label on him saying he is not a hewer of wood or a drawer of water.  All he requires is his own ability.  This will bring forward a race of people who will be specialists in their own fields&mdash;better metal workers, better electricians, <Col N="835" /> better garage mechanics, better operatives of all kinds.  This is the age of technology and that is what we want.</P>
    <P>I want to say categorically on behalf of my Party something we feel is of importance.  In opposition, when you must be critical of something, it is easy to find yourself being criticised as opposed to a project.  It is easy to find yourself, deliberately or by accident, being put on one side of the fence by the opposing politicians.  In relation to industries founded by the Government which have not been as successful as they might be, we on this side of the House will endeavour in every case to help to further those industries, expand them and bring them to the state of success which is the <i>desideratum</i> not only of the Minister and his Party but of everybody in this House.</P>
    <P>That does not mean, however, that we have not the obvious duty of inquiring into certain financial matters. We cannot shirk that responsibility. But it does mean that, in the case of Verolme, Irish Steel Holdings or any other industry that has not reached the position of production and commercial profit we might like, we are going to go all the way with the Government&mdash;the proof of this is in the Voting Lobby&mdash; to ensure their success.  I want to tell the people in these industries that our position is this.  We agree that when there is a large number of people in employment in an industry, democracy today insists that their jobs must be preserved and that the area is not denuded of its population.  There is no difference between the Government and the Fine Gael Party on this question. It is quite unfair and untrue of any politician to suggest that, because we have had to inquire here about the financial position of various industries, we are opposed to them.  The people in those industries now have a categorical assurance that the Fine Gael Party, whether in or out of Government, will do everything they can to maintain and expand employment and stand with the Government on this matter.</P>
    <P>If I were to take industrial incentives <Col N="836" /> most beneficial to the country in the past I would list them as follows: (1) freedom from income tax on new exports; (2) loans; and (3) grants.  I think somebody coming here to establish an industry, like Becton and Dickinson in my constituency, and to manufacture an article for export to Britain are encouraged by our freedom from income tax for new exports.  They are more likely to put more money, effort and top personnel into the project than if they came here because they got a highly advantageous grant and loan and had not to put in so much money of their own.</P>
    <P>If I were in the position of suggesting to the Cabinet the changes they should make in industrial incentives in the Budget next week, I would say the best thing would be to extend the freedom from income tax incentive, which would bring people here to invest their own money.  If perchance the loss cannot be met by the Exchequer, then perhaps it could be balanced up by not giving as big loans as were given heretofore. That does not mean I am opposed to loans or grants.  They are most important.  We must finance new industries as every country in Europe is financing new industries.  Our experience has been that the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956, introduced by Deputy Sweetman, then Minister for Finance, brought most of the new industries here.  He is the man who first introduced loans and grants, too.</P>
    <P>Those facts must not be forgotten. Those two measures introduced by him were criticised and voted against by Fianna Fáil but were adopted by them once they came back into office.  His approach of freeing new exports from income tax means that these people are coming in, and putting in their money, their personnel, and their efforts.  They are putting their arm into the Irish fire, and if things go against them, it is not so easy for them to lop off that arm and walk out of the country as it is if they come in because they get too attractive grants or loans.</P>
    <P>We must, however, discuss the failure of existing native industries to avail of grants and loans.  If we consider <Col N="837" /> the volume of native industries portrayed by the Minister, it is quite obvious that existing industries for decades to come will certainly form the major portion of our industrial manufacturing sphere.  Percentagewise they have failed to get the volume of grants and loans that has been available for new industries from abroad. There is also a political aspect to this because in the case of a grant or loan to an existing industry they will not be able to point to a factory and say: &ldquo;I put that there.&rdquo;  If there are 100 people working in the factory, that means about 700 or 800 votes.  As a practising politician, I would be naive if I did not mention that.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Industrial Organisation forecast that there will be quite heavy unemployment if we go into conditions of freer trade by co-operating with GATT or the European Economic Community.  In this situation, not only must we try to expand the number of jobs in existing industry, but in many cases we must defend the jobs already there.  We must accept the fact, on the Minister's figures, that all the grants and loans have not been availed of by existing industries.  I do not know what is to be done about this.  One reason may be that the adaptation grants have not been so long on the road.  We are only now getting into the flow of the adaptation grants. However, the fact is that the existing industries have not got the percentage of grants and loans that one would expect to be necessary to defend the existing jobs and to expand production.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is a bakery which employs 200 people.  These people applied for an adaptation grant and were told they could not get one.  Why?  They were told they could not get it because in conditions of free trade, they could not compete with bakeries across the border who had access to different flour and different prices.  As I have said, there are 200 jobs in this industry.  What are we to do in conditions of freer trade, if the Minister finds he has to allow bread from Northern Ireland to come across the Border?  Is this industry <Col N="838" /> peacefully and painfully to fold up? Is it a <i>quid pro quo</i> of an adaptation grant that an industry must be able to compete with its fellows in the same district?</P>
    <P>It is true to say that you will find few industries would get adaptation grants, or any sort of grants, if they were in fact competing with someone up the street, but the Minister must face the fact that in conditions of freer trade, the industry up the street might also go to the wall.  It is a fundamental fact, and a fact that obtrudes, itself when you think of EFTA, GATT, and the EEC, that the EEC is a tariff area and its purpose is to set up tariff walls. That was its first concept.  Statements were made at the time of the Treaty of Rome about what would eventually happen, but the first concept was of a tariff area.  They are now trying to get a situation of commercial and economic co-existence between America and Europe.  Britain is on the outside and is obviously keen to co-operate in GATT.  I think Britain is keen to have us co-operate in GATT so that we will find ourselves aligned with the general set-up when the time comes when Britain will enter the European Economic Community.  It has been suggested in the past five or six months that EFTA may be considering including the agricultural range of products.  If that happens, freer trade may be closer to us than we think, and we may find ourselves in the situation in which a highly technical and complicated trade position will have to be faced.</P>
    <P>At the time of the British 15 per cent levy&mdash;it is ten per cent since 27th April&mdash;we did not make one of our reductions.  The Taoiseach generally handles the question of tariff reductions. He was clear in his statement&mdash; and quite brutal about it&mdash;as to the purpose in having these tariff reductions at all.  It was to sweeten the pill. The pill is there and the question is whether we can prepare ourselves by a gradual reduction of tariffs by 1970 when we will have to compete with others on almost level terms.</P>
    <P>The last five years have been a period of takeovers, closures and purchases. <Col N="839" /> We have seen a rationalisation of the flour milling industry.  We observe certain changes in the rayon spinning industry and certain changes in the footwear industry.  While these things are certainly bringing about a rationalisation and some preparation on the part of the larger manufacturers for this sudden cold dip we shall have to take, I think it is true to say the smaller manufacturers have not found themselves enabled, either by failure to get grants or by their failure to look for them, to make the changes so vitally necessary.  That is something that has to be faced.</P>
    <P>The question of undeveloped areas is one that has vexed politicians and everyone else for a long time.  When you go into undeveloped areas, you have to think of services&mdash;harbours, railways, and roads.  The political snag is that if somebody in one end of a constituency sees all the industries going to the other end, or if people in one constituency see everything going to the constituency next door, there is a hell of a row.  This is a natural situation; there is nothing wrong in it.  But I feel you must have centres of industrial development.  The truth is that every industrialist who comes here would, if he were let, and space was available, build his factory within a mile of Nelson Pillar.  It is, however, our right to keep our country on an even keel.  If you want to attract people to the West of Ireland, you have to think of places like Sligo.  This may mean that you will see people migrating from Leitrim to Sligo or from Mayo to Sligo to take up industrial jobs.  I would prefer to see them do that than see them going to Birmingham. Far too many of them have gone in the last decade.</P>
    <P>As far as the undeveloped areas are concerned, I think, whatever incentives we give by way of grant and loan and whatever information we give, we must also have a planned approach to this question.  In relation to the question of the small industries, I should like to say that the experience in France, when they borrowed a vast sum from the World Bank in order to bring their industries up-to-date, and <Col N="840" /> so that they would not have a change of Government every three months, was that the inducements offered were geared to the situation.  If a small industrialist did not take these inducements, he could not compete, so an inducement to him, as well as being a carrot, became a stick.</P>
    <P>This situation developed favourably in France.  Anyone who studies the position will find that the small industries did not go to the wall in France. There was a place for them and you might find a small industry amalgamated with a large one, or perhaps there was an arrangement with the large one to produce the same product in both industries.  Perhaps a very expensive machine was installed, to be paid for over, say, 15 years, and was producing a new product in a small industry.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the prognostications for 1965-66 will be fulfilled.  Let us face the fact that the British Budget has removed a purchasing power from the British people of £10 a head per annum.  That is £600 million.  It seems to me also that Britain's withdrawal of lending money from the ordinary commercial borrowing market would indicate that we will not have a very good trade with Britain for the next 12 months, particularly for those items that can be dispensed with, such things as can be done without for another year.</P>
    <P>The British budget is a restrictive one and we may have to make more strenuous efforts to keep abreast.  I believe there is a great future for the expansion of Irish export industry.  The old argument that the raw materials were not here will go in conditions of freer trade.  The forerunner of the EEC was the Coal and Steel Community in Europe.  The price of steel in France became the price in Italy and in Belgium. At the same time they rationalised their coal, and so these two major raw materials will, if the concept of the EEC is followed, become rationalised in price.  At the present time many of our industries&mdash;in my own constituency there is the Dundalk Engineering Works&mdash;have been hamstrung by prices paid for raw material. <Col N="841" /> These are not real prices.  Anybody who studies this will find that you could not ascertain the price of steel if you tried, as far as Britain is concerned. But, if we go into conditions of freer trade, surely this material will be available to us, plus the costs of the extra transport.  I know we are going to produce steel in Cork and I want to see that industry expanded.  It is true to say that in freer trade conditions there is also the fact that things have a target price and an intervention price and any sort of rigging up of the market would completely defeat the purpose of the operation.  Just as in America, where there are anticartel laws and people can go to jail for getting together and putting up prices 20 per cent, in a freer trade in Europe there will be discipline in pricing: prices will be the same for all.</P>
    <P>I believe Irish industry has a future and the old dictum that we had not the raw materials is dead.  I think we have something nobody else has: a wonderful labour force.  People do not realise the great qualities of our Irish boys and girls.  I was involved in an industry in Louth some years ago and I was standing outside with the managing director and he told me that a small product could be produced more cheaply in Castlebelling-ham than in Stockport.  He said to me to stand there for five minutes and I would see the standard of girls and boys who would be coming out at one o'clock.  The standard here is far superior to standards in Britain.  The obvious reasons are that the British employees had for five, six or seven generations bad housing conditions and as well as that, they had five, six or seven generations working under bad conditions in industry before things like Factories Acts came along. Physically and mentally they are not within miles of the labour force we have here.  That is the thing we must sell and that is the thing the Minister has got to try to sell.</P>
    <P>I have seen those people coming out from the GEC factory at Dunleer, a few miles from where I live.  The standard of labour here, the effort <Col N="842" /> which the workers are prepared to put into their day's work and the effort they are prepared to put into learning a new trade is such that that is the reason this particular factory has raised itself up&mdash;to quote my opposite number in the county&mdash;from 211 in 1956 to something over 1,000 now.  I do not claim any credit for that.  He does.  I can tell you who should claim credit for that.  The managing director, his able staff, and the best labour force, not only in Ireland, but probably in Europe.</P>
    <P>I should be quite naïve if I did not mention the dreadful news which faced my constituency this morning as a result of the announcement yesterday that the new GEC factory in Dundalk is to close.  I am sure the Minister is as stunned as I am by this news.  This is something we must all face and try to do something about by every means in our power.  We are all in the dark about what has happened to make this factory close down.  We just know the bald statement that it is closing down and that 350 of my constituents will be unemployed.  I live beside Dunleer and I hope the factory there will be able to continue.  I understand and believe it will.</P>
    <P>I am a Deputy for Louth and as far as I am concerned the fact that 350 people lost their employment last night in Dundalk in a factory on which £750,000 was paid, and for which the Government gave a £300,000 grant is completely inexplicable to me.  I want to be quite clear on this.  I am an employer myself in the area and I am very friendly with the managing director.  I am, however, completely on the outside and I know nothing about the particular details of this matter.  I know nothing more than the announcement which was made in the papers and on television last night, but I find myself completely unable to explain away a situation whereby inside eight months of a grant of £300,000 being given to that factory, it has closed up. I do not know the reason why.  All I can say, having said I do not know why this factory has closed down, is that any effort which we from this side of the House can make in joining with the Government to try to change this <Col N="843" /> situation, will be freely and enthusiastically given.  It will be given with the intention of saving those people from the emigration ship.</P>
    <P>It is fortuitous that the general belief, and I subscribe to it, in regard to this matter, is that the factory in Dunleer will go on and will probably be expanded.  I want to say that I believe in the ability of the management of this factory.  I have seen it grow over the past ten years.  It has grown from a small factory, 15 years ago, where a local man often paid the wages of the staff on Friday if money was scarce, and took shares in the company for the value.  He was a good Fine Gael man.  It has reached a stage where they employ this large labour force.  I am sure, even though they have had to close down the factory at Dundalk, they will start next Monday morning as one unit at Dunleer again and proceed with every success.  I am sure we will have a situation in which things will not be as bad as they look today.</P>
    <P>With regard to the management and the quality of labour, I want to say there is nowhere one can get such a fine quality of labour.  There are questions which will have to be asked and again every politician who asks these questions can be labelled as against the factory and against the present unfortunate situation.  I want to ask: Was there a watching brief by the Department of Industry and Commerce or An Foras Tionscal operating during the period of the production of this factory?  I understand these grants are subject to a return to the Government if the factory is closed.  Surely a grant of £300,000 must have been the subject of a most exhaustive market survey?  This market survey surely must have taken into account a potential market that is now mentioned as having gone?  This exhaustive survey would be carried out not only by a Government Department that was going to give £300,000 to this industry but also by GEC. I want to know why this survey <Col N="844" /> finds itself after eight months so completely wrong that 350 people have lost their employment.</P>
    <P>I feel perhaps the best thing would be for the Minister to make a public statement, when replying.  Again, I want to assure him of two things.  The first thing is that I claim no credit for the establishment of the GEC factory at Dunleer or Dundalk.  Every credit lies with the businessmen who started the factory.  I will claim credit for any success I have in my own business but not for any political messages I did or did not.  I want to say that this entire Party are behind any effort that can be made in regard to this matter.  We are behind any effort that can be made to get GEC or anybody else back into that factory and to employ my constituents, who have been knocked out of employment.  I want to see that there is no redundancy that can be humanly avoided, in either Dundalk or Dunleer.</P>

      <P>The report, which we had from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, indicates the importance of this Department in our day.  Up to quite recently the report of this Department was a very slim volume and affected only a little area in our national life.  The report before us to-day shows how important the Department of Industry and Commerce is in the national life and the progress of the economy of the country today.  The most important example of this is shown in the manpower authority which the Minister intends setting up. We in the Labour Party are very glad to see what we have been looking for in this direction about to materialise. Deputies from the other two Parties may not be aware that the trade union movement have been working for the setting up of such an authority for some time past.  Successive Labour Party policies have called for the setting up of this authority.  In fact, although we are not the Government we are glad to see the Labour Party's policy adopted in matters of this sort and it will be our role in this Dáil to make sure that such policies when adopted, will be fully implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the manpower authority, we feel workers seeking employment want to get information without delay.  The forecasting authorities should be able to give them this without delay and schemes should be available for training these workers in new skills.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, it becomes evident that the pattern of industry to be set up in the future will be such that some new skills will be called for, while others will become obsolete.  We shall have to train our workers to these newer skills.  We cannot get the confidence of trade union members concerned unless we have some scheme of national redundancy compensation.  I do not think we can ask for the confidence of individual workers unless this operates.</P>
      <P>We should also, in such an authority, see that the demands of certain localities are looked into and that where variations occur in unemployment locally this is fully catered for under the new authority.  What we have looked for in the past and what we hope this new authority will achieve is that it will bring about more than a mere improvement in employment services.  It should provide for a stimulation of regional economic development and, where necessary, provide for the conversion of those industries which do not have good prospects of survival in freer trade to schemes of protection that do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be an allocation of the manpower surplus to certain areas. We might look at the situation that presently obtains and consider what the manpower authority will be up <Col N="846" /> against.  The vocational schools are unable to implement the terms of the Apprenticeship Act: all of us here know that.  In 1959, the Vocational Teachers' Association made a submission to the Department pointing out all that would be necessary in this area of training people for new skills and, really, giving us the educational groundwork necessary to set up an eventual manpower authority.  Nothing was done on that submission and it was treated, like other submissions from interested groups in the past, as something to be acknowledged and passed on to history.  The very problems referred to in this submission&mdash; the shortage of skilled teachers for the training needs, the shortage of suitable vocational schools&mdash;are now being realised.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Dublin North Central, Bolton Street Technical Schools cannot deal with the number of applicants for training.  What is true in Dublin is even more true of places in other parts of our country. At the moment, there is a complete breakdown between the planning estimate before us and the actual reality of an apprenticeship training for young people in the vocational schools.  There are not enough schools or teachers and this is a real problem for the Minister.  However, he and his Department and the different people who have been in authority over the years must now realise that the problem of training for labour is not one that can be solved by the appearance of a beautifully produced plan here and now. It should have been anticipated years ago when others from less publicised positions were advocating this very thing&mdash;as the trade union movement was doing through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and we in the Labour Party were doing.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the report to the help to the economy that has come about from the establishment of foreign concerns here.  The Labour Party would like to issue a warning today against the over-enthusiastic welcome given to certain types of foreign concerns coming into this country.  We accept that foreign investment can help our country but we welcome it only on <Col N="847" /> the basis that such foreign help can give us technical know-how and access to markets that we would not otherwise have.  We do not see the qualification for their entry as being purely one of the provision of capital.  There is no shortage of Irish capital.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are not aware of any shortage of Irish capital for setting up new industries in this country.  We accept that there may be a shortage of know-how and of access to foreign markets and, on that basis, foreign investment here would be acceptable to us.  In many cases, foreign investment that came here nominally to set up specialised industry found its way into areas which Irish capital and Irish businessmen and Irish industry should have been able to tackle.  I do not have to mention any instances: they are well known to all of us.</P>
    <P>Take one area where the appearance of foreign investment is assuming very dangerous proportions.  I refer to the number of supermarkets up and down the country in the distributive trade. Just last week, in the Phibsborough area of my constituency, a supermarket started operating which will put a couple of hundred traders there into very serious difficulties.  We must ask ourselves, if we are conscientious in our obligations as public representatives, whether the appearance of these supermarkets, subject to no check, will have the effect of putting small businessmen out of business, of putting Irish families on the streets, so to speak in business terms.  What effect will these supermarkets have, if the distributive trade, which is extremely important to Irish business and to the whole country, goes to foreign ownership?  The retail trade, falling to foreign ownership, provides a ready market for foreign products.</P>
    <P>Speaking from a trade union point of view I would say that many of these supermarkets do not provide adequate wages or in fact employ trade union personnel&mdash;many of them are nonunion shops.  They provide employment merely for young females at very low wages.  We would need to consider this matter a bit more closely before we discover too late that, from a national <Col N="848" /> point of view, we have made a sad mistake in respect of the unchecked spread of supermarkets to the detriment of our small business people.</P>
    <P>In another part of the report, reference was made to the work of the Committee on Industrial Organisation. There is no doubt that all of us must be extremely grateful for the work and the amount of material now open to us in the different reports on industry in this country.  For the first time since the foundation of the State, we have a pretty comprehensive account of Irish industry, its problems and how to meet these problems in the future.  Up to now, the great disadvantage has been that if you wished to speak about Irish industry one man's opinion was as good as another's.  Now, we have ready material to comment on.  We all recognise that some speed in the preparation of these reports was necessary. A probable lack of technical information in the questionnaire sent to employers may have had an adverse effect on some of the reports before us.  All in all, however, a tremendously good job was done by a very small number of officials and our thanks are due to them.</P>
    <P>One thing the report has made clear is just how shaky is the position of Irish industry.  However shaky the basis of our foundation is now, if we had gone into Europe some few years ago, as the Government then wanted, our position now would indeed be very serious.  The reports expose the position that Irish industry in many areas is extremely deficient in management training and in actual resources. Deputies will recall that, when the last attempt was made to get us into Europe, the alternatives were given in black and white.  We were told that a great challenge lay before us.  At that time, the Government had no compunction in telling us that a great market lay before Irish industrialists and that great employment opportunites lay before Irish trade unionists.</P>
    <P>As we can see from the accounts of the CIO reports, the actual position as it faced every industry was far from being as pretty as Government <Col N="849" /> spokesmen would have us believe at the time.  One of the points brought out in the reports is that one of our gravest deficiencies is the lack of management training and of proper management know-how in Irish industry. Several agencies are attempting to right the position, but all the reports bear out that Irish management generally is far from being in a fit position to bring us into a European community, but is not equipped to plan expansion for the future.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his Department will concentrate a great deal of attention in this area in the years ahead because we all realise now that proper management in our industry is extremely important.  Lacking material resources as we do, it is all the more important that the quality of our personnel must be second to none if we are to prosper industrially, and any great expansion in employment must come from industry.  It is all important, therefore, that the personnel in industry, the people in key positions in it, must be people capable of giving decisions, people properly qualified to do so.</P>
    <P>The industrial re-organisation branch &mdash;the branch which will implement the actual measures recommended in the different reports &mdash; are a very hard working group of officials, doing an extremely good job.  The adaptation councils set up to implement the proposals in some cases are working quite well.  The Trade Union Advisory Bodies set up to consult with the adaptation councils should not have any obstacles put in their way in the matter of receiving full information in respect of each industry.  At every dinner graced by every Government Minister we hear practically every day in the week about the need for more co-operation between the trade unions and the employers, about the desirability of taking the trade unions into consultation with the employers.</P>
    <P>Surely, in this area we can show best how earnest we are about the theoretical need for consultation and co-operation between the trade unions and employers.  That is the area where there should be a real interchange of <Col N="850" /> information, where real collective responsibility should be undertaken. There is reference to industrial relations in part of the reports and I should like now to make one or two remarks on the subject.</P>
    <P>Since the kind of society we find increasingly in this country is one in which Jack is all right and every interest group looks after its own affairs, we cannot look for any form of control on trade union bargaining rights unless the Government are prepared to say to all interests that they will have to conform with the national economic plan.  There appears to be on the part of Fianna Fáil only one desire when it comes to incomes and that is a desire to control wages and incomes when they come through the trade unions with a complete lack of interest in controlling any other form of income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts speak for themselves.  We shall never understand the position of the trade unions in this area of relations unless we understand that the trade unions will never accept compulsory arbitration, and if there are any industrial wizards who think otherwise let them get rid of that idea right away.  In a free democratic society, the right of the employee to withdraw his labour must be unquestioned.  Many of us make the mistake of keeping the continental system of trade unionism in our minds when considering the movement here.  We must become aware of one great difference between us and the continent: the full employment economy has been accepted there for a number of years.  Unemployment still weighs very heavily in trade unionists' minds in this country.  Lack of confidence between employees and employers is something that will not be solved as long as we have pockets of anti-union employers in this country. As long as we have anti-union employers we cannot expect the full confidence of trade unionists and there are still, unfortunately, despite all the lip service to the full consultative ideal, some such employers in this country who adopt anti-union positions.</P>

    <P>Only last year in Cavan an employer <Col N="851" /> locked out 16 men, sacked them, because they joined a trade union. They were guilty of nothing except the exercise of the right enshrined in the Constitution&mdash;freedom of association. They were sacked and the strike went on for a year, the employer standing for his Christian belief that these men were not entitled to the right of freedom of association.  As long as you have these things occurring you cannot expect the full confidence of trade unionists in any scheme for improving productivity. Every Dunleer that occurs, every door that closes without notice to employees, without a scheme for redundancy payments where men are laid off, will serve to retard the introduction of good relations in industry.</P>
    <P>As I have said, all along in the trade union movement and in the Labour Party we have encouraged by every means possible the efforts being made to build the National Industrial Economic Council into a real planning body. We have felt that our economy cannot really get off the ground unless there is real planning of how our resources can best be utilised, unless there is consultation between interested groups in trade unions and management.  We know that our industry must give us the necessary expansion in employment in the years ahead and we know also, as the CIO reports prove, that there are certain employers who do not live up to these obligations spelled out today with the purpose of expanding industry.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour movement do not attempt to deprive any employer of his God-given right to a profit from his industry.  We in the Labour Party see nothing wrong in profits so long as the person making them is a conscientious employer, committed to the expansion of his industry.  On the other hand, we feel that the national resources should not be channelled to people who run inefficient firms.  One of the characteristics of an inefficient firm, as proved in the CIO reports, is that management is not doing its job. No more taxpayers' money should go to them.  We should adopt the policy of other European countries: inefficiency, wherever it occurs, either in <Col N="852" /> the State enterprise section or private enterprise, should be weeded out.  Our policy from the beginning has been one of full utilisation of all the resources in the country, full employment leading to higher living standards. You might say that all Parties in Dáil Éireann have similar aims but we in the Labour Party feel that the best means of achieving increased economic expansion&mdash;and it is not on any doctrinaire basis that we believe this, but purely from our experience as a separate State&mdash;is to base it on expanded State enterprise.  We are not nervous of being labelled for believing this.  We state it as a fact which we believe, that this is the most rational form of economic organisation, and one that experience has proved has given the best service to the people.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that we are not uncritical of some forms of State enterprise.  We feel they must be made more accountable to Dáil Éireann and we feel this could be applied to other areas of our economy also and that Dáil Éireann could be made more a body that would make a real contribution on how these industries should develop in the future.  We believe that the State enterprises section of our economy should be expanded and should actually go into industrial production like, say Erin Foods did last year.  By this means we could play a conscious planning part in the improvement of our economy. We are not satisfied that Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael are really conscious of the great contribution State enterprises can make to our economic well being in the future.  We have the impression that both of these Parties merely accept State enterprise on a basis that there is nothing better there.  Every so often we hear speeches from Deputies of either Party suggesting that this or that State enterprise should be handed back to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>That is one difference we see&mdash; there are many others&mdash;in the planning concepts which we in the Labour Party have, and which the other Parties have.  We have advocated that the NIEC should be engaged in planning in agriculture as well as in industry, that it should have its own <Col N="853" /> secretariat and should bring in reports to be part of an annual economic budget, and that Budget time should become not a mere exercise of balancing payments but should be a real discussion on the economic outlook in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>One point referred to in the Minister's speech is in regard to external trading relations either with Britain or Europe.  The Taoiseach mentioned within the last few days that it is his intention to make a fuller statement about our application to the EEC during the budget debate.  I look forward with interest to his contribution on this because it does strike me that very soon we will have to have a very full debate on this whole question of external trading relations.  Too much is occurring at official level which this House does not hear about.  For example, the Minister's speech mentions meetings held with British officials aimed at developing trade relations between the two countries.  I would urge the Ministers concerned to bring these matters before the House as soon as possible so that they can be discussed fully.  I wish them well in their expectations but I am beginning to think that this idea of being in the EEC by 1970 is becoming a pious hope of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We will have alternative courses to discuss in the future but the sooner we banish this certainty from Fianna Fáil's mind, that this country will be in the EEC before 1970, the better.  If the prospects are not as good as they think they are, the sooner we discuss the whole question of external trade relations, the better.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary spoke about supermarkets and the rate of wages paid to employees, to whom he referred as child labour.  If he was speaking for the Labour Party on that score, he would want to start weeding out supermarkets in his own town. While I do not agree with them, I think they have a very important and indeed vital role to play in our economy by offering all products to the public at very competitive prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the <Col N="854" /> Minister on his speech and also on the way his Department are dealing with the needs of our economy.  I am especially pleased with the modern and dynamic approach which the Industrial Development Authority are displaying in going after new business in various countries.  This type of approach cannot but have a good effect on the economy.  I am in complete agreement with Deputy O'Leary when he says that we are more interested in know-how and market outlets than finance, although finance is a very important factor.  When we are bringing industries into this country, we should aim primarily at getting industries which will give us access to markets which we would not normally have, and also to obtain training in the basic skills where there has been no tradition in these skills.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that Verolme Dockyard, despite what some of the Opposition speakers say about it, is kept going because it is giving very full employment in my constituency.  It would cause tremendous hardship to a lot of people if some of the Fine Gael proposals were implemented.  Deputy Donegan spoke about Coras Tráchtála and I agree with what he said.  Anybody who has gone into Coras Tráchtála and discussed his problems in regard to exporting could not but be pleased by his reception by some of these dynamic individuals.  I agree also with Deputy Donegan when he says that no prejudice is shown to either party.  Coras Tráchtála, under the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is a dynamic organisation and that is the way we should look at it.  We should encourage every industrialist in our own areas to go along to them for a talk and find out how and where their produce can be marketed abroad.</P>
    <P>I should also like to compliment the Minister on the quick and efficient way he stepped in when the 15 per cent levy was imposed by Britain.  There was no red tape; he just went straight ahead as he realised that this was something about which quick and decisive action had to be taken, and this is what he did.  He cushioned the blow for the Irish industrialist as <Col N="855" /> much as possible.  One thing that always astounds me is the number of industrialists who are not availing of the various grants offered by the Department of Industry and Commerce. I wonder are we advertising them sufficiently.  In my own business as a business consultant, I have been appalled in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will give the reasons for, and explain all the circumstances surrounding, the exclusion of 101 acres from the total land acquired in the Kilbarrack area on a Compulsory Purchase Order by the Dublin Corporation for the purpose of providing local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the area referred to in the question about six acres, consisting of four small plots were excluded from the Compulsory Purchase Order because it was considered that their acquisition would impose undue hardship on the owners and that their exclusion would not adversely affect the proposed housing development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining lands excluded from the Order, 95 acres approximately, were the subject of a planning application for private housing over a year before the making of the Compulsory Purchase Order and the Corporation refused permission because they intended that the lands, with other lands in the area, should be acquired for municipal housing.  An appeal against the Corporation's decision was received by me in August, 1962.  It was represented to me that the development of the lands for private housing of the type proposed could be undertaken more rapidly by the appellants than by the Corporation and that such development would help to meet a pressing need for reasonably low-cost housing.  It was also represented to me that the provision of these houses by private development would in some measure relieve the Corporation's own housing burden.  Having considered all the facts, I decided on 7th May, 1963, to grant the planning permission sought.  Despite this grant of permission, the Corporation included the lands in the Compulsory Purchase Order made by them in the following July.  At the public local inquiry held in connection with the Compulsory Purchase Order no new facts were adduced which would, in my opinion, justify reconsideration of my decision on the planning appeal.  The lands <Col N="864" /> were accordingly excluded from the Compulsory Purchase Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of that but I think the point I have made, indeed, the real point at issue in this case, was that two years previous to that, after full consideration and examination of the town planning appeal in respect of these 90 odd acres, I gave permission on that appeal for private development and yet within two months of that appeal being granted by me the Dublin Corporation proposed to acquire it and when the time came for the official determination after the inquiry I found no new reasons had been put forward at the inquiry to change my outlook or what I had already decided two years previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Old age pensioners who hold medical cards are entitled to receive hospital treatment free of charge.  The question of making a deduction from an old age pension arises only when the pensioner is in receipt of institutional assistance, that is, shelter and maintenance in a health institution.  A health authority may require persons receiving such assistance to contribute out of so much of their income as exceeds 10/- a week, such sum as the authority considers appropriate, towards the cost of providing that assistance.  As far as the Dublin Health Authority is concerned, I understand that it is the practice to allow old age pensioners in receipt of institutional assistance, as distinct from hospital treatment, to retain, in addition to 10/- a week, a sum sufficient to meet rent and similar standing expenses.</P>

The rate of allowance for a disabled person undergoing an approved course of training is a matter for determination by the appropriate health authority; in other cases the maximum allowance, since 1st August, 1964, is 32/6d. per week.

      <P>Does the Minister see any way out of the difficulty?  It is a real difficulty.  I have come up against it on more than one occasion in relation to people who have returned to this country, whose children are just at examination age and could not possibly <Col N="878" /> have time to learn sufficient Irish. They are excluded from sitting for the Intermediate Certificate.  Does the Minister not consider it desirable to find some way around that difficulty?</P>

      <P>I would remind the Deputy that this applies only to children who have started in schools here after their 11th birthdays.  They are exempt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was appalled by the lack of knowledge on the part of various industrialists who just did not know what type of grants or training was available to them or to their staffs. If we are to equip ourselves for entrance into the EEC, one of the most important functions of Industry and Commerce is to ensure that all management has the right training. Admittedly, we have made tremendous strides in the training of management, but I am still not satisfied that our standards are high enough when compared with those of other countries. I would urge the Minister, therefore, to ensure that IMI and the other bodies concerned are staffed with the right personnel, capable of passing on their knowledge, training and experience to managements in our various industries.</P>
      <P>There are very few people in industry or in management who know about the readaptation grants.  It would be advisable, I think, for the Minister to issue a pamphlet to all these people because, when we enter the EEC, these people must be geared at that stage and not merely trying to get up to the proper standards.  I know the Minister will do all in his power to ensure that proper training and facilities are available to all these people.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to compliment the Minister on getting into such concise form all the information he gave us in his opening statement. Because of the expanding nature of the work of his Department, I know that this was no easy task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief because of the very lucid <Col N="883" /> and comprehensive coverage already given to the various points by Deputy O'Leary of the Labour Party.  As a rural Deputy, I should like to impress upon the Minister and his Department the desirability of decentralising industry as far as possible.  Agriculture, our premier industry, is no longer a labour-absorbing industry, due largely to mechanisation.  I speak, in particular, for the midlands.  Rural Ireland is starved so far as the provision of industries is concerned.  The Minister and his Department would be well advised to keep that particular aspect of our economy in mind.  There is a great deal of talk about developing industry in the west.  I do not say that is not desirable, but it is equally desirable to establish industries in the midlands and in other rural areas.  I could not say enough about the importance of decentralisation.  In my constituency, towns like Rathdowney, Mountmellick, Mountrath and Stradbally have a look of doom about them.  If rural Ireland is to be saved decentralisation of industry must take place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the desirability of some arrangement for profit-sharing by workers engaged in industry.  That is certainly very desirable. We live in an age in which the worker is no longer the ignoramus he was 40 years ago.  Educational facilities have changed that position to some extent and the worker now knows when he is being fooled.  He can size up a situation.  If he is to give his share to the national wellbeing, he will not do it until some arrangement of the kind adumbrated by Deputy Donegan is made.</P>
      <P>To revert for a moment to decentralisation, one of the worst running sores on the body politic today is emigration. Decentralisation of industry is one way in which this drain by emigration can be arrested, controlled, and ultimately perhaps eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): There is a great deal in the Minister's brief for which we can be thankful.  In general, he paints a relatively happy picture of our economy.  Our exports have reached a new record figure of <Col N="884" /> £222 million.  We have, so to speak, for the first time in our economy broken the sound barrier of the £200 million mark.  Our imports have also substantially increased.  I understand the October figure of £347 million gives us a trade deficit of £125 million.  It was always considered here that a trade imbalance of that magnitude, or much above £100 million, was rather getting into the red.  We have, at the same time, a balance of payments deficit of £31.4 million.  Were it not for various, perhaps fortuitous, circumstances, it might be worse.  We happened to have a large measure of foreign investment. We had loans by Aer Lingus and the ESB during the year which brought us in some capital.  Judging by our stock exchange activities, perhaps in measure due to economic conditions threatening in England, there has been a movement of capital from that direction also. There has been a considerable purchase of Irish properties, hotels, even land. These capital movements have kept our balance of payments at the figure of £31 million.  In the Government's <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> they are quite prepared to accept a deficit of £16 million per year. Perhaps they would call it a planned deficit.  Even translating back £31 million to the 1960 financial level, we are still facing a balance of payments deficit which is too high to be comfortable.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that our economy is a very fragile thing.  Let us take the position of the last returns for the United States.  Their trading exports were greater than their imports by £1,000 million.  At the same time, they ended up with a balance of payments deficit of about £1,000 million, largely due to the fact that they were financing an army overseas, that their industrialists were investing extensively in Europe, to such an extent that President de Gaulle tried to introduce some kind of squeeze on the dollar. The United States can operate on a planned deficit consistent with that kind of trading potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a trade deficit of £125 million, our position is completely reversed. We cannot, without serious risk to <Col N="885" /> our economy, lightly undertake a planned balance of payments deficit. Already, in the first quarter of this year, there is evidence&mdash;let us hope it will not continue&mdash;that our position may not be as happy as it was in the past year or two.  For the first quarter of this year, our import excess is £43.3 million as compared with £31.9 million last year.  If that is continued for the rest of 1965, we will have a very serious trade imbalance at the end of this year and one far in excess of what we have realised this year.  Therefore, I would say our economy is entering a more difficult and more competitive phase than we have experienced up to date.  We must not forget the fact that, as well as these capital movements, we have enjoyed over the past year or two fairly good terms of trade&mdash;terms of trade completely different from those in 1957-58 when the last inter-Party Government were in office.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the efforts made by our industrialists during the past year, particularly their efforts towards increasing our exports and in the field of trade exhibitions, both on the Continent and in America.  That is a forward-looking approach which, up to recent years, we in Ireland could not embark upon.  I hope in the year ahead the equivalent activity will show itself among our export firms in regard to trade exhibitions and fairs all over the world and that it will help to sell our products abroad.  We must remember that many of the countries in which we show our goods have a huge economy, and even a small amount of trade to them would be a very substantial help to us.</P>
    <P>Looking at the trade figures, although the position has improved somewhat, we are trading with many countries who do not give us a £1 for £1 trading relationship.  Certain countries, particularly those behind the Iron Curtain, have been prevented from conducting trade on that basis.  We on this side have been advocating pressure on these trading blocs to ensure we will get a more equitable balance of trade between ourselves and them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Again, looking at our trade figures, it is obvious agriculture is still the backbone of our economy.  No matter what the Minister for Industry and Commerce may say about our expanding industrial arm, we have a long way to go before we can regard this as an industrial country.  We will still be depending largely on exports, particularly of live cattle and food, to finance our industrial development here.  When it comes to trade balances, there is no question which is the better type of export.  When we export any agricultural product, there is very little corresponding import to balance it. Imports of a few other small items of that nature are the only outgoings we have to keep up an expanding agricultural industry.  On the purely commercial side of exports, although we can expand our exports, we are always faced with the difficulty that we have to buy a correspondingly high percentage of goods.</P>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates, I see a figure of £330,000 for the shipbuilding subsidy.  This is the same as the figure for last year.  I should have liked the Minister to have dealt with this item in a little more detail.  Considering it is exactly the same as it was last year, the figure presents itself to me as some form of employment subsidy, rather than a commercial subsidy.  Doubtless it will be £330,000 again next year.  I should like the Minister to give us some information on the question of this shipbuilding subsidy.  For how long will it go on?  Will shipbuilding in the foreseeable future become a solvent concern, or are we to continue <i>ad infinitum</i> this subsidy?</P>
    <P>I also notice a figure of £12,500 for St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  I should like the Minister to give us some information on what this £12,500 is all about.  I thought we had heard the last of the St. Patrick's Copper Mines, but apparently we are still paying some subvention.  I should like to know more about this expenditure of £12,500.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing subvention for industrial research which I welcome. The subvention is increased from <Col N="887" /> £191,000 to £375,000.  Again, I would like more details as to the nature of that expenditure.  It is now of such magnitude that one would expect an annual report from that body.  Maybe there is.  Other research bodies who receive amounts of money of that nature usually try to produce an annual report.  If a report has not already been produced by this body, I would recommend it as a suggestion to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which I am interested is the question of coal and anthracite.  On page 66, paragraph 189, of the Progress Report on the Second Programme for Economic Expansion, it is stated:</P>
    <P>Consumption of coal in 1964 is estimated at 1,475,000 tons or about 9 per cent less than the previous year.  Home production of semi-bituminous coal and anthracite was about the same as in 1963, i.e. 207,000 tons.  The continued decline in the demand for coal reflects the trend towards oil, particularly in the manufacture of gas and in industry. The feasibility of using low-grade semi-bituminous Arigna coal to extend the local generating station is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter because it is of concern to me in Tipperary in the Ballingarry mine, and in the neighbouring mines in Kilkenny.  Indeed, the Minister for Transport and Power was asked a question today on the matter. Apparently there is increasing difficulty in disposing of the products of our mines.  I think it desirable to draw the Minister's attention to it, and I presume it comes within the ambit of his Department to find if an alternative outlet can be provided for coal from those mines.  It would be a serious matter if the coal were accumulated at the pitheads and there was no sale for it. There would be considerable unemployment in my own county, and in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I wish to join with other speakers in giving my due meed of praise to the Committee on Industrial Organisation and the various survey teams who at relatively short notice have produced so many excellent surveys.  Considering <Col N="888" /> that so many of the survey teams must consist of individuals who could not perhaps be expected to have the technical background information which people in a narrow industry would have, of necessity, we must accept the fact that they produced very excellent surveys, 26 in all.  I do not pretend to have read them all, and probably the Minister has not either, but those I have read were quite worthy productions.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister is disappointed that there have not been more applications for special grants and loans. He mentioned 450 applications and a disbursement of £254,000.  That is not too bad.  About a year or a year and a half ago, the position was considerably worse.  I would say most of the applications must have come in the past 18 months or so.  I know that in the preliminary stages when these grants were introduced, there was a considerable time-lag before any application came in at all.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the success which the Minister intimated of the Buy Irish Campaign.  I hope that when the levy is lifted, our people will have become adapted to the purchase of Irish goods, and will have got over the kind of traditional distrust of articles of Irish manufacture which has for too long handicapped industrialists in this country.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed in the Minister's very skimpy reference to foreign associations.  For the past three or four years, there has been talk of our becoming a member of the EEC; yet from the Minister's speech, we seem to be doing nothing whatsoever about membership of that Community.  I cannot even gather from his speech whether we have an observer out there. We seem to be piously waiting to see if someone will ask us to come in. This is important to us because we seem to suffer from lack of membership of most international organisations. We are now applying for membership of GATT and at the moment apparently our membership is being considered.  Again there was no information in the Minister's brief as to how our application for membership was progressing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> We have announced our readiness to participate in the Kennedy Round and we are all aware that the chief difficulties confronting the Kennedy Round were the tariff barriers, the non-tariff barriers and the import quotas and protection devices.  They were particularly related to supporting agriculture.  Agriculture was the basic difficulty in the breakdown in negotiations as regards Britain's application for membership to the EEC.  It was always believed that the Kennedy Round could not come to fruition until the question of serious agreements in the EEC was arrived at. Now that has been arrived at, so the Kennedy Round does not now prevent discussion at EEC level.  But, in the Minister's brief, I find little concrete information, except the mere statement that we are again interested.  The truth of the matter is that we are unable to do so until Britain does so first, and, judging by recent pronouncements by the British Prime Minister, it looks as if British membership of the EEC is not a matter likely to be considered in the near future.  Therefore, our prognostications for entry to the Common Market by 1970 may be extremely unreliable.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister made no reference to EFTA.  It is another important trading bloc which by next year will have removed its internal tariff barriers.  There is not one word in the Minister's speech with reference to it. Yet, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he should be very much concerned with EFTA activities and should be in a position to make some statement as to our standing <i>vis-á-vis</i> EFTA.</P>
    <P>There was a recent United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at which there were 120 nations.  This work is to be continued by a 55-member Trade Development Board appointed by that Conference.  We did not hear anything from the Minister as to whether we were represented at the Conference or whether we became a member of the 55-member Trade Development Board, or whether we were merely relegated to the group of 77 undeveloped nations which were <Col N="890" /> there.  These are all important aspects of our industrial economy and of our agricultural economy, and I am extremely disappointed that the Minister did not make more specific reference to our position with regard to these bodies.  I would, therefore, ask him to indicate whether he has more concrete information to offer than the rather nebulous chapters he incorporated in his otherwise reasonably balanced brief.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, I offer the Minister congratulations on appointment to his new post and I wish him many years of success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer very briefly to a few important aspects in this Estimate.  First of all, I am glad to see the Minister will be giving effect to the pre-election promises of his predecessor to introduce a manpower authority.  This is, and has been, part of the Labour Party policy for a great many years and we hope that now that a decision has been taken by the Government to introduce this authority, no time will be lost in setting up the necessary machinery.  We feel it is not a day too soon; in fact, it is long overdue.  Many workers throughout the length and breadth of the country have suffered severe hardships due in the main to the absence of a manpower authority.  Usually when progress takes place, some lose employment and others find employment.  Up to now, there has been no worthwhile effort by the Government to deal with the people who lose employment.  Government speakers clap themselves on the back for the few who find employment through this progress but completely ignore and neglect the many thousands in the flourmilling and other industries who lost their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the other points in Labour policy for the development of this country is reliance on the development of our natural resources.  This is one point which got very scant attention in the Minister's speech.  I say this especially in view of the fact that one of the biggest concerns using our natural resources is the coal mining industry.  This directly concerns my <Col N="891" /> own constituency and the neighbouring constituency, as Deputy P. Hogan (South Tipperary) has mentioned.  It looks as if up to now the Government are not doing anything about it.  In south Laois, which borders on my constituency and where a good many workers from Kilkenny are employed, three coal mines have been closed in the past few weeks.  The coal mining area in Castlecomer is presently on short time, working only every second week.  A large number of workers in Castlecomer have only one week's employment, followed by one week's unemployment.</P>
    <P>We feel it is the duty of the Government to step in and help those concerned in any way possible.  The same problem may not affect each of those mines but they have one problem in common, and that is large imports of foreign coal.  As a result, the miners in those areas and in Ballingarry, as has been mentioned, are threatened with further unemployment.  Coupled with a labour policy for the development of natural resources and their utilisation in order to give as much employment as possible, we have also stated that where private enterprise is unable to develop these resources, is unable to keep them working, then it should be the duty of the Government to step in and take them over.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of coal in the Castlecomer colliery and there are plenty of workers but one of the biggest drawbacks there is that capital required for the further development of this mine is not available.  It is too much to expect private enterprise to help out in this regard.  This is a problem just like afforestation, in which you cannot get private individuals to put money into it because the return is too slow. They might not receive a return for their money until 50 or 100 years hence so in that regard it is the bounden duty of the Government to make capital available for the development of mines in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise, down through the years, has given good and full employment in those mines.  Now that source is completely exhausted and unless something is done by the Government <Col N="892" /> hundreds, directly, and thousands, indirectly, will be unemployed.  These mines pay good money to the ESB, CIE and other firms.  A wide circle of concerns will be affected unless something is done very quickly.</P>
    <P>As a result of the closure of these mines thousands of workers, who are on compensation, will also be affected because if the mines go into liquidation those people cannot be compensated. Something must be done about the importation of coal and then something must be done about providing capital to develop these mines at Castlecomer, which are mostly affected by lack of capital.  It has been proved that there are extensive areas of anthracite coal still in that area if the mines can be developed and shafts sunk at the appropriate points.</P>
    <P>The importation of coal, as I said, must be curtailed and there is no more opportune time to do it than at present, especially when, as previous speakers pointed out, we have serious balance of trade difficulties.  Every little helps and this is one place where we could be of some help.  The Economic Research Institute, in a recent survey, indicated that there is not likely to be much of an improvement in the import and export position in the coming year.  Therefore, every effort must be made to help in this matter.  I hope the Minister will take immediate action with regard to the coal mining industry in this country because once this industry collapses, once the workers are unemployed for any length of time they leave the country and are unlikely to return.  Coal mining is not a job in which any worker can be trained or which any worker can do.  It is a tradition which is handed down and once that tradition is broken the coal mining industry in this country will be finished for all time.  Something should be done now before it is too late.</P>
    <P>You cannot expect men to be unemployed for weeks on end and you cannot expect them to live on a wage that they can get only every second week.  The workers in these concerns were very co-operative in regard to every effort made to keep the mines open.  The miners in the Castlecomer Colliery went without the eighth and <Col N="893" /> ninth round increases in order to help to keep these mines in production. They have played their part.  Private enterprise has played its part.  Labour has played its part.  It is time now for the Government to step in and play their part.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to read in the Minister's speech about the many industries which were established throughout the country both in the undeveloped and the developed areas.  We have got none of these industries in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.  I should like the Minister to bear in mind that Kilkenny city has got none of these industries.  I was in the labour exchange on Friday morning of last week when unemployment benefit was being paid out and the queue extended across the yard of the labour exchange and out on to the street.  That is the situation despite all the talk by Government speakers during the recent election about the increase in industrial employment and the decrease in unemployment.</P>
    <P>These industries should not be concentrated in particular areas.  There should be some direction by the Government of these industries to places where they are badly needed. The flour milling industry, in particular, has closed down and two small mills in my constituency have closed down over the past few years.  The Government have made no effort to provide alternative industries for the forgotten towns.  The Minister should have discretion to direct industries to places which are not getting a fair crack of the whip at the moment.  All areas contribute to central taxation.  Therefore, all areas should be treated equally from the point of view of receiving industrial development grants.  If they are treated equally in relation to taxation they should be treated equally in regard to its disbursement.  I would ask the Minister to do something very quickly.  He should use his good offices to avert the situation I have mentioned in the coal mining industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very proud of the industrial arm which has been built up here since the inception <Col N="894" /> of the State.  I do not think this is the appropriate place to say who was mainly responsible for that.  I shall not make a political speech.  History will say that successive Irish Governments, in their own way and in the spirit of the times&mdash;the spirit that moves men and women&mdash;introduced the legislation and the attitude of mind which brought our industrial arm up to its present strength.  Starting with projects such as the Electricity Supply Board, the sugar beet industry, and so on, and moving onwards it is the way a young country develops, gradually feeling its way towards industrial strength and self-sufficiency.  In keeping with the age-long wish of Irish people, successive Irish Governments dealt with this need and, on the whole, dealt with it very well.</P>
      <P>One of the spheres in which all countries emerging from a state of comparative lack of industrial resources suffer is industrial relations. We, here, have endeavoured to do what we can in that connection.  It is a very difficult field for any Government to handle but I hope the new Minister for Industry and Commerce will handle it and persuade his Government to deal with this problem in a more forceful way than it has been dealt with in the past&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;more forceful way&rdquo;, I mean a more co-operative way but more realistic way.</P>
      <P>The day of bludgeoning either side in an industrial dispute has long passed away, if indeed it was ever a successful method of dealing with a dispute, which, personally, I very much doubt.  Certainly, in this day and age, it can lead only to trouble and in fact no Irish Government have ever attempted that.  They have veered far too much to the other extreme and have not, in industrial disputes, given the citizens generally the protection which they always feel they should get from a Government and, above all, from a native Government.  Ultimately in an industrial dispute, whilst both sides suffer very much from it&mdash; the men suffer hardship and the employers suffer financial loss&mdash;it is to the benefit of nobody and, at the end of it all, the public have to pay for it in increased prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> I hesitate to blame the Government exactly for their lack of a clear policy because it is a very difficult field.  I am aware that a Government find great difficulty in coming into a dispute which involves great interests.  They feel they will lose face, if they fail and they will perhaps create enemies on one side or the other, if they succeed.  For that reason, it is a dangerous field for a Government and for any political Party to enter. Frankly, they are afraid of losing votes. We may as well face that: it is what every Government are afraid of At the same time, as I have said, they have a duty to protect the people from harsh demands which may come from either side in an industrial dispute. The logical way is to nip the matter in the bud, before it reaches the point at which passions are inflamed and hardship caused and money lost. That is why I should like to see the Government&mdash;I think it is their duty&mdash; in this part of the 20th century, do everything in their power to set up machinery which will help us to prevent such disputes.</P>
    <P>I believe that some countries have, with a very considerable amount of success, brought in what, roughly, I would call delaying machinery which holds up everything for a time until both sides, with impartial observers, can have an opportunity of examining the situation.  I believe a period of three months is the length of time selected in some countries in pursuance of that policy.  That is probably a good enough method but, of course, there might be occasions when a three months' delay would cause hardship to persons in the trade or difficulties to firms.  I want to stress that, in this day and age, there are no fierce ideologies, as I would describe them, separating the various political Parties here in Ireland or, indeed, the various employer and labour bodies.  I know that in other countries there sometimes is a history of harsh treatment, of bitter relations with people outside.  In Ireland we have not that situation within the memory of most adults.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we should find it fairly <Col N="896" /> easy to set up that machinery.  I do not see why, with our considerable skill in what I would call mental speculation, in devising ways and means of approaching these matters, we should not be able to do that.  We could, if we set ourselves to it, give a lead to other countries in industrial relations.  The Government should set that model, that ideal before them&mdash; that every strike or lockout that takes place is a sad reflection on the wisdom of the three parties involved, the labour, the employers and the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister and his Department giving a great lot of thought to that question.  The day has come when, from the point of view of our industries, disputes are things which can do the general body of our citizens a great deal of harm unless they are dealt with firmly.  Part of this treatment is the setting up of consultations&mdash;a commission might take too long&mdash;between the labour interests and the employer interests who should really get down to working out effective agreements instead of resorting to the big stick which, as I said at the beginning, is absurd.</P>
    <P>We should be able to do a great deal more in that respect than we have ever done before.  I can speak with some knowledge of a dispute which took place last year in the building industry and which went on for more than three months.  It was a dispute in which, I am happy to say, there was not the slightest bitterness on either side.  Yet it proved impossible to settle inside three months.  Great hardship was caused all round&mdash;to the men, to the country and to the trade.</P>
    <P>That dispute, as others, had its origin in the unfortunate mixing of politics and economics, always a dangerous thing.  It is necessary for a Government to keep their eyes very closely on the economic side of legislation and, naturally, on the economy of the country as a whole, but it becomes very dangerous when, for political advantage, a Government meddles in economics.  It can upset, and does so frequently, the whole structure of <Col N="897" /> industrial relations and wages.  That was one of the difficulties involved in the 12 per cent increase.  The 12 per cent increase may or may not have been necessary but certainly its impact, on top of the 2½ per cent turnover tax, disrupted our whole economy and started an inflationary trend that inevitably led to industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>I had not intended making a political speech out of this&mdash;it is a subject far too serious for any political advantage to be sought from it&mdash;but what I call meddling Government action in this field&mdash;meddling with economic forces for political advantage &mdash;can create and has created, undoubtedly, great hardship for citizens.  Indeed, it never results in the political advantage the authors of that type of Government action hope to achieve.</P>
    <P>That is a further reason why both employers and labour should welcome the setting-up of an authority with powers to take those matters out of the hands of any Government or any individual in a Government who felt he would be free to indulge in action which might be in the long run very irresponsible in its effect.  Therefore, I ask the new Minister to give this his most earnest consideration.  I am sure I speak for the whole Fine Gael Party when I say that this is of enormous importance in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have an industrial arm.  I shall not go into all the details of all the types of industrial incentives which are being offered.  Other speakers referred to Córas Tráchtála and other bodies set up to encourage exports and the establishment of industries generally. That side of our industrial effort is going well, but in common with all countries&mdash;we are not the only country suffering from growing pains in industrial relations&mdash;we need a very clear policy and a very firm lead from our Government.  I say &ldquo;our Government&rdquo; because although I speak from the Opposition benches, we are all at one in a matter like this.  We all want industrial peace.  We know what the disruptions cost and Fine Gael do want to help to ensure that these industries, which are so necessary for us <Col N="898" /> in the maintenance of our standard of living, should, by Governmental action, be enabled to run smoothly in this matter of industrial relations which lies in our own hands.  We do not have to buy any ideas; we do not have to pay anything for ideas in that respect; and if we can cut out the vast majority of these disputes, we can increase our economic output and our export policy enormously.  I hope the new Minister, with the great goodwill he has, will assiduously apply himself to this matter, which, mind you, is an extremely difficult problem but is very important for the country.</P>

      <P>There is only one aspect of the Minister's speech on which I should like to comment, that is, his statement that expenditure on the World Fair will be reduced by some £58,000.  I had the pleasure last summer of visiting the World Fair but unfortunately the pleasure was somewhat lessened by a visit to the Irish Pavilion.  In my opinion, the outside of the pavilion was anything but representative of the country.  One could only describe the outside appearance as something like an adobe hut.  I am not sure whether the Minister has had occasion to visit the Pavilion, but if he had, I do not think he would disagree with that description.  The inside of the Pavilion in some respects was well in keeping with the best in our country. Unfortunately, however, a commercial concern had been allowed to use the grounds immediately outside the Pavilion to sell Gaelic Coffee and even by American standards the price of the Gaelic Coffee was undoubtedly exorbitant. I would suggest to the Minister that it would be in the interests of the country if he looked into this matter before the Fair re-opens.</P>

      <P>The establishment and expansion of industry generally is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of the various bodies which have been set up for the expansion of industry, <Col N="899" /> but in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, where we have unemployment constantly at a figure of about 50,000 and emigration running at about 25,000 annually, all of us have a duty to assist wherever we can in establishing new industries and expanding existing industries.</P>
      <P>I am concerned mainly with the difficulties confronting people who come here with the intention of establishing an industry.  We have a number of bodies involved in this process and I have often wondered why it was necessary to have so many separate bodies with separate identities, instead of having one or two bodies entirely responsible.  For instance, we have the Industrial Development Authority and Foras Tionscal.  The Industrial Development Authority process whatever proposals are brought before them and when they have gone through them for some considerable time, they hand on their findings and recommendations to Foras Tionscal.  Foras Tionscal then proceed either to accept or reject or amend the proposals.  It would appear to be much more sensible if there were only one body instead of two.  Then we have Córas Tráchtála and the Industrial Credit Company. The Industrial Credit company should be part of that one organisation, as should Córas Tráchtála which is the body whose officers go to various countries and carry out the necessary promotional work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that this creates a difficulty especially for people coming from abroad because they fail to understand why it should be necessary to make separate contact with these various bodies and to have to try to solve their difficulties through so many bodies.  The feeling I have encountered among these people is that they expect to be able to walk into one office and put their proposals before the people there and that a solution will be found for their difficulties.  That, however, is not the case, as we know only too well.  While recommending that we reduce the number of bodies that appear to be doing part of the same job, I would suggest, as I have always suggested, that it is quite wrong that <Col N="900" /> local authorities are not brought into the picture much more.  Local authorities have an important part to play in establishing new industry, in providing sites and services and supplying a proposer with all the necessary information before he can proceed to establish an industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer specifically to an industry to which I referred recently. It is an industry in which the State has a very heavy investment and it is surprising to me that no great concern has been shown that this factory, which has been built for some time, is obviously in serious difficulties at present, that it is employing a very small number of people when the employment content at a later date is expected to be somewhere in the region of 1,500 or 2,000 people.  These difficulties are there but they could be solved if there was a follow-up and if sufficient interest were shown.  I am referring to Potez Aerospace, the aeroplane factory at Baldonnel.  I cannot understand how the type of difficulty in which they are at the moment arises at this stage.  I was never quite certain whether an application was made to Dublin County Council in the normal way, to the town planning section, for permission to build because if it were the difficulties which now exist would then have arisen, as it is normal practice to consider all the services required by the industry and all the difficulties that may be involved before town planning permission is given.</P>
    <P>Here we have the case of an industry that has to get rid of industrial waste and the local authorities say: &ldquo;No matter what you do with that waste, we are not prepared to agree that it should go into the local stream.&rdquo;  On the other hand, the Potez people say they can render this waste quite harmless by the process they propose to use and it could, in that way, go into the stream without causing any trouble. But no great interest on the part of anybody associated or concerned with the establishment and promotion of industry has been shown in the fortunes of an industry in which the State has so heavily invested.  Not only is that so in <Col N="901" /> the case of Potez, where the difficulties are simple enough and should be solved as a matter of urgency, but it is also the case in many other State-assisted industries.</P>
    <P>I have been told today that Potez in Galway was originally expected to employ 700 people and that it is, in fact, employing 150 and that this has been going on for some time.  We are not supplied with sufficient information about industries that have been State-aided, let us say, in the past five years. What has happened?  Have they lived up to their promises?  Have they done better or have they fallen down on their original target?  I recommend that there should be a follow-up and that the difficulties which industry will inevitably meet should be solved as they can be solved, and employment continued as it should be continued.</P>
    <P>Personally, I was disappointed that the Minister's statement in introducing the Estimate did not contain a more dynamic approach to the whole problem of establishing and promoting industrial employment generally.  In the past two years about 5,500 additional jobs have been provided and I think there is no increase or if so, it is an increase of 100 or so extra jobs this year over the previous year, and the additional amount of money provided for industry and commerce in the present year is very small when we consider what is required. When we have regard to the rate of emigration, the present unemployment position and the fact that so many people are leaving agriculture we see that they must be accommodated somewhere if they are not to join those who are at present unemployed or those who have emigrated.  We also know that increasing efficiency and greater mechanisation lead to further redundancy and that if there is not much greater effort in the near future to establish new industry and expand existing industry we shall have a serious unemployment position.</P>
    <P>The services other than industry apparently have been disappointing inasmuch as they have not found the number of employment opportunities that was expected of them.  Not only <Col N="902" /> am I disappointed at the small number of extra jobs provided in an industry which seems to be the only possibility of absorbing people from the various other sources, but this booklet which we got this morning from the National Industrial and Economic Council carries the comment on page 5:</P>
    <P>We recommend that greater efforts should be made to achieve a faster, sustainable increase in employment.</P>
    <P>They, with their knowledge and their analysis of the economy generally and of its citizens, apparently are satisfied that we could, with greater effort, provide much more employment opportunities for our people.  They go on to recommend various ways in which this could be done.  There is no mention in the Minister's statement that he intends to adopt that recommendation and he seems to be satisfied with the rate of progress generally.  I am disappointed that is so because I believe there is a considerable opportunity in this field to do much more about the establishment of industry and the expansion of existing industry.</P>
    <P>We have been told that Córas Tráchtála have gone out to various countries to do promotional work but we have no information as to the response from these countries nor do we know where they have succeeded.  I think the members of the House would be interested to hear something about the industries that have been established by outsiders and the countries from which they come, in a general way.  I spoke about the lack of information generally about State-aided industries. Last year there was a reference in the debate on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce to the Avoca copper mines and there was a figure included for caretaking.  We did not hear anything at all this year.  What has happened in Avoca?  Is that a continuing liability?  Has it been closed down altogether?  The House would be interested to hear about these things.</P>
    <P>We heard a brief reference to Min-Fhéir Teoranta and the quality of the grass produced on the bogs.  Could the Minister tell us anything about the economics of this project up to date: <Col N="903" /> what sales have been made and what profits, if any, are likely to accrue from this industry?  We should hear more about industry generally because it would give us an opportunity of deciding what was worth assisting in future and, where it was inevitable that assisted industries would fail in the future, to make preparations to replace them with something likely to endure.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.E. Dockrell discussed at considerable length the importance of good industrial relations and the avoidance of strikes.  During the year we had at least one serious strike which caused a lot of trouble.  I think we can never fully measure or calculate the full effects of a strike of that kind, because many of our skilled workers leave as a result and many of them never return, and in the particular industry we badly need more skilled people.  He has emphasised the importance of using all the machinery available so that strikes may be avoided and sensible decisions can be arrived at in time.  It is far more important to prevent strikes than to allow them to occur and to continue for a time and then find a way of settling them.  We always appear to be able to find a way afterwards.</P>
    <P>I know this is not an easy matter, that it is a source of trouble in many countries but in a small country like this, where we are endeavouring to build up and expand our industry there should be greater understanding on all sides of the importance of avoiding stoppages at any price.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate the importance of having people with special skills and technical people of all descriptions.  From his experience in the Department of Education he knows what a wonderful part is being played by the Vocational Education Committees and the various technical schools throughout the country.  As soon as an industry is established and before it finds itself in difficulty regarding the supply of skilled workers the nearest vocational school should be equipped to meet the needs of that industry.  It is quite possible, and it <Col N="904" /> has been done in some cases, for skilled technicians in the industry to conduct night classes in the special skills and techniques that would be required in that local industry.</P>
    <P>There are a few cases already in County Dublin where this must be done if the industries are to get locally the supply of skilled operatives that they will inevitably require but I must say that it has been my experience always in the past that the Department of Education were very willing to meet this need and have, indeed, met it quite adequately.  The only thing that arises is the delay in providing accommodation. The need should be anticipated and all the necessary arrangements made before trouble arises</P>

      <P>Some time ago I had occasion to bring to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce the fact that public money had been allocated to a firm which was using this money for the publication of obscene literature for consumption abroad and at the time the Minister took umbrage at my statement.  As is usual whenever something responsible is said from this side of the House, accusations of irresponsibility were thrown out.  In order to put the matter beyond any doubt whatsoever a sample of the production of this firm was referred to the Censorship of Publications Board and this Board has since condemned the book as being unfit on the grounds of obscenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the height of hypocrisy for this State of ours to prohibit the circulation of obscene literature here and at the same time as this Oireachtas does that it, by its agent, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, allows something like £¼ million, I am led to understand, to be paid to a firm for the circulation of obscene literature abroad when that kind of literature is prohibited from circulation here.  It seems entirely wrong and not the kind of thing that is going to bring a blessing on this country or on our efforts here to be spending money for the <Col N="905" /> production and the consumption of sin abroad and any kind of wealth which may seem to flow from that kind of thing is not to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I refer, of course, to a book called <i>Budd Wing</i>. There may, for all I know, be other products of this firm which have been sent abroad but which have not been brought to my notice or to the notice of anybody else but the particular book was banned by the Censorship of Publications Board in March this year and as a result of the prohibition in question the book may not be circulated here.  I am aware, of course, of the fact that when the money was allocated to the firm in question by Foras Tionscal it was a condition of the granting of the money that the products of the firm be sold abroad but I do not think it entirely removes blame from us to say that its products are not for consumption or circulation here.  It is equally wrong to be spreading that kind of thing throughout the world and it is the height of hypocrisy for a country such as ours which has censorship laws for its own people to be distributing abroad literature which it is forbidden to circulate here.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting things which have developed from this controversy is the fact that Foras Tionscal takes a considerable time before it advises members of the public here, including members of this House, as to the amount of money it has, in fact, allocated to any particular firm.  I have been endeavouring for over six months now to find out how much money was allocated by Foras Tionscal to Graphic Film Limited.  One might think it was a matter upon which the public had a right to be informed as public money was involved but Foras Tionscal has refused again and again to give this information.  When, after prolonged correspondence they stated the reason for refusal, they said it was paragraph 4 of the First Schedule of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  This section provides that a member of the Board of Foras Tionscal shall not disclose any information obtained by him in the performance of his functions as to the private affairs of any person or business, <Col N="906" /> except in the course of a report to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be extending the scope of that section too far to say that the amount of money allocated by Foras Tionscal to a concern is the private affair of that person or business. It is a wholly unacceptable proposition to make to this House and I am quite certain that if Oireachtas Éireann were aware at the time of the introduction of that legislation that it was to be used to deny to members of the public information as to the amount of money allocated by Foras Tionscal to particular bodies, the section would never have been passed or certainly it would have been passed in the face of extremely strong opposition.</P>
    <P>I was not seeking, and I am sure other responsible people would not seek, detailed information about the private affairs of the person or business in question but the amount of public money allocated to it is not the private affairs of any particular business. We have been told by the Minister in reply to a Dáil question which I asked in February that he was not concerned about the basis for the refusal by Foras Tionscal to give the information. He simply stated he was in full agreement with the preservation of confidentiality in relation to proposals for the establishment and the development of industry.</P>
    <P>One can understand a certain reluctance on the part of the Minister of Foras Tionscal to release, in advance of the establishment of an industry, information about it, because it would give to potential rivals an advantage to which they are not entitled. If somebody has the initiative to apply for a grant and to put up a proposal, it should be like a trade mark&mdash;it ought to be protected&mdash;but once approval in principle is given to the allocation of money, once the decision is taken to allocate a sum of money to a business, from that time on there is no justification whatsoever for the preservation of secrecy in relation to the proposal.</P>
    <P>All we know at the moment is the <Col N="907" /> rumours which were circulating and which were recorded in the newspapers at the time that a Canadian millionaire, the greatest newspaper proprietor in the world, was coming over here and was having discussions with the Department of Industry and Commerce, Foras Tionscal, Córas Tráchtála and all the various other authorities. There were rumours that £250,000 was to be allocated to the setting up of a film typesetting industry. Beyond that we know nothing definite except that in the last published report of Foras Tionscal to 31st March, 1964, there is an indication that money would be allocated towards a typesetting industry but it is the practice of Foras Tionscal not to disclose the names of any proposers at that stage.  We know now that another report has been made out or is due in respect of the year ending 31st March, 1965.  That date is now long since past and we are still left in ignorance as to whether or not some money has already been allocated and, if so, how much.</P>
    <P>When I raised the matter in the House in February, the Minister indicated that he would get the report shortly after 31st March but he was not going to make it available to the House until June and that he would not disclose any information which that report contained until such time as he made the report available to the House.  Again this seems to be without justification.  The section upon which Foras Tionscal rely prohibits the publication of information in advance of the report being given to the Minister. If the Minister already has the report, then any information which is responsibly sought should be given. The people are entitled to know how much public money has already been spent for the subsidisation of an industry which is at public expense publishing pornography for consumption abroad.  This is not a question of setting oneself up as a moralist.  It is simply a question of calling for an end to hypocrisy and I do believe the Minister himself sees how hypocritical it is to be spending public money for <Col N="908" /> this immoral purpose when we are trying to preserve our people from this kind of damage.</P>

      <P>The next question to which I wish to turn is the Fair Trade Commission.  We were led to believe by the publicity attending its birth and by a considerable amount of activity on its part during its infancy that the Fair Trade Commission was going to work hard and see to it there were no unfair trade practices.  We have considerable reason to be upset by recent tendencies toward mono-polisation in various fields of industry and commerce here.  There is considerable danger in monopoly.  One appreciates the justification for what is called rationalisation, for modernisation and for unification of some sectors of industry and commerce but it is an undesirable trend to allow the supply of raw materials for particular industries to be channelled into the one ownership.</P>
      <P>This is a trend which the Minister and the Government are apparently not over-concerned about.  I do not wish to discuss the merits or demerits of particular industries but we are not unmindful of the fact that recently people involved in the hosiery and knitwear industries complained that one of their most wealthy rivals in that industry were about to acquire the ownership of a firm which was one of the principal suppliers of that industry. Although the Minister, in reply to a Dáil question of mine last week, stated that he had received assurances from the purchasers that they would give scrupulous consideration to existing customers of the business about to be acquired, there is the danger that they will not, and if they do not, there is very little the Minister or the Fair Trade Commission can do about it. Certainly the Fair Trade Commission in recent times has been so inactive that we have good reason to fear the worst would have happened before any remedial action would be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, therefore, urge on the Minister that he should endeavour to have <Col N="909" /> a more active Fair Trade Commission to watch over these trends towards monopoly and, if necessary, set out a certain code of conduct in relation to monopolies, making sure at all times that this particular code is adhered to as, otherwise, grave damage will be done and there will be little use in locking the stable door when the horse has gone.</P>
    <P>The Holiday Employees Act, 1961, prescribes certain minimum annual holidays to be given to all employees. There are unfortunately many people employed by insurance companies who are not yet receiving either holidays or pay in lieu.  The Minister and his Department are much too slow in taking action in relation to this matter. When it was first brought to the Minister's attention that insurance companies were not giving these holidays, the view of the Department was that they were not, perhaps, obliged under the Act to do so because the Act provided for holidays in relation to employment contracts for services.  It was the contention of the insurance companies involved that agents who collect insurance premiums are employed under contracts for services.</P>
    <P>Most people deprived of their annual holidays are agents for industrial policies, the small 3d., 6d. or 1/- per week policies.  It is an extraordinary thing that we should have this unsatisfactory position still obtaining. Several hundred agents are not permitted to take annual holidays without suffering serious personal loss to themselves.  Nearly two years ago, the Minister made regulations to bring these agents within the scope of the Act and there is provision now directly for contracts for services and a regulation to provide for contracts for services.  Notwithstanding that these men are covered by both of these provisions, they are not getting the holidays to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which I raised the matter I was told it was under consideration.  It is an outrageous position that the Department will not take strong action, and that means prosecution, against those who deny workers in this day and age the <Col N="910" /> legitimate holidays Oireachtas Éireann has prescribed for them.  I hope the Minister will take steps in the very near future to see to it that these men are given their holidays and are compensated in respect of the holidays they did not get since 1961.  The Minister has power to do that.  He can certainly invoke the aid of the courts. At the same time, these people must be compensated and given pay in lieu of the holidays so far denied to them.</P>
    <P>When the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign began last year, we had a burst of labelling products with little gummed labels stating &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo;. When some of these labels were torn off, underneath was found &ldquo;Made in England&rdquo; or elsewhere.  I had the experience of conveying the complaints made to me by constituents to those who were selling these goods and I was agreeably surprised to learn that it was not, in fact, a case of deliberate deception.  The goods had been made in Ireland but on machines or moulds which had been used in England and were, because of some change in manufacturing processes there, exported here.  It is highly desirable that there should be some definite mark on goods indicating that they have, in fact, been made in Ireland.  Ignorance of the position may lead to a considerable amount of cynicism on the part of the purchasing public.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, too, that the present situation could lead to dishonesty on the part of some sellers.  I do not know what the remedy is but it may be possible to have some kind of accepted mark affixed on such goods. I quite appreciate that the cost of new moulds might be considerable and one does not wish to add unnecessarily to the cost of the finished product, but I hope the Department will take some steps to ensure there is some way of recognising whether goods are made in Ireland or elsewhere.  There should be some more permanent way than just a gummed label, which can so easily fall off the legitimate goods or be so easily affixed to goods which were never, in fact, made in Ireland at all.</P>
    <P>There were many reasons why we had a general election when we did, <Col N="911" /> but the ink on the returns from the returning officers was scarcely dry before we discovered one of the most cogent reasons, the increase in the price of bread, the staple diet of our people.  When I raised the matter last week we were told by the Minister that the question of increasing the price of bread was under review.  It would be very interesting to know when the Minister received the report recommending an increase in the price of bread.  Considering it takes the Department anything up to three months, as a rule, to announce any information which comes to it, it is clear that the recommendation which made him increase the price of bread was received by him prior to the election.  It might have been more honest to have informed the public of this increase before the election.  Mark you, we were informed that we would not have any increased taxation.  Some people are fortunate enough not to have to pay taxes but everyone has to eat bread.  An announcement prior to the election might have been an important factor in determinng the way in which people would vote, had they known there would be an increase in the price of bread.  It was a shabby trick by the Minister and his colleagues not to disclose that the staple diet of the people would be increased in price immediately after the election.</P>
    <P>Prices are something from which the Fianna Fáil Party have been running away for a considerable time.  They seem to be afraid to consider the part which prices play in the economy.  We had the fantastic statement made by the Taoiseach, who regards himself as a modern economist, during the course of the election campaign that he did not know what a prices and incomes policy was.  A man who declares in 1965 that he does not know what an incomes and prices policy is shows himself completely unsuited for the office of Taoiseach.  This is a fundamental in every economy.  It is recognised by an increasing number of people.  We hope to educate the Fianna Fáil Party on the necessity for a proper prices and incomes policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, Sir, for affording me an opportunity of further discussing this matter.  It is of considerable importance that the facts surrounding the exclusion of 101 acres from a Compulsory Purchase Order made by the Dublin Corporation in respect of land in Kilbarrack out of a total of 329 acres should be brought to light because a great deal needs to be explained. Some years ago Dublin Corporation made the Minister aware of their intention at some future date to build municipal houses on this particular land.  I am informed that over a period of years&mdash;on one occasion in 1946 and on a further occasion in 1955&mdash;private builders sought to have some of this land excluded.  Both these appeals to the Minister were refused by the Department.</P>
      <P>On 28th October, 1964, however, the Minister confirmed an appeal by two builders, Messrs.  McInerney and Gallagher, to exclude these 101 acres from the total Compulsory Purchase Order for the purpose of building private speculative houses.  This land, which the Corporation intended to use for municipal housing, was taken out of their hands by the Minister at a time when the capital city was at the height of a serious housing crisis. Because of the situation in relation to dangerous buildings, the Corporation were under considerable pressure to acquire land and build as many municipal houses as possible as speedily as possible.  At that time&mdash;and it was known to the Minister&mdash;there was no possibility of building any considerable number of houses on the south side because sewerage and drainage facilities were not available.  However, the Minister saw fit to allow these two builders to build on these 101 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Order was made by the Minister after a local public inquiry, at which both the gentlemen I mentioned were represented by senior and junior counsel.  Both counsel representing the builders subjected officials of the Corporation <Col N="913" /> to a third degree, lasting, in at least one instance, two and a half days in the witness box.  These dedicated officials were subjected to considerable abuse and their integrity was questioned.  As a result of this inquiry, the Minister claims he is justified in the action he took.  I do not believe he was justified.  Further, I do not believe the Minister will satisfy this House as to the action he took in respect of this land.</P>
    <P>This question of the Minister solely deciding on Orders of this type is one that could be usefully re-examined.  It is unfortunate that the efforts of the local authority to provide housing, particularly during the time this incident took place, should be hampered by a responsible Minister.  There is no question that by excluding this land for municipal housing, the Minister was responsible for at least 800 families being on the waiting list of Dublin Corporation, and they will be on it indefinitely if this Order stands. There were at the time this Order was made no fewer than 8,000 families on the waiting list.  There was a crisis with regard to dangerous buildings. Houses were being declared dangerous at the rate of some 12 to 15 per day. The people affected by this crisis were not people who could afford to avail of any house Mr. McInerney or Mr. Gallagher might make available to them at a profit.  In view of that, the Minister did not do credit to his Party or to himself by excluding the 101 acres.</P>
    <P>There is of course speculation, both inside and outside this House, as to what motivated the Minister in excluding this land.  I think it is not unreasonable that people have suggested that the political beliefs of both Mr. McInerney and Mr. Gallagher have had considerable influence with the Minister in making his decision.  I do not know whether this is true, but it has been suggested.  I suggest to the Minister now that, in order to allay any such speculations, he hold a public sworn inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the exclusion of this land from the Compulsory Purchase Order.</P>
    <P>It is most undesirable that the <Col N="914" /> political head of any Department should have the power to grant an appeal of this nature.  It would be in the interests of everyone, including the Minister, if some other form of tribunal were set up to decide appeals in respect of Compulsory Purchase Orders made by local authorities.  This is still a serious matter so far as the people on the waiting list are concerned. It is not too late for the Minister to rectify the very serious situation he has been instrumental in creating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the House to be quite clear that this matter of dealing with Compulsory Purchase Orders, despite what the Deputy has just said, is not sought by me.  It is not a very pleasant position to have to decide as between a local authority and the appellants in these cases.</P>
      <P>I should like now to repeat what I said earlier today.  A very brief history of the situation is that the matter first came to my notice as a result of a planning appeal arising out of a decision by the Corporation in 1962.  I gave a decision in favour of the appellants, the owners of the property at that time, and the same owners mentioned by Deputy Cluskey this evening.  I gave a decision in favour of the appellants in so far as their planning permission was concerned, to get on with the building of the particular area of land, approximating 95 acres.  Subsequently the compulsory order procedure embraced this land together with adjoining land&mdash;a further 228 acres. At that time the situation obtained in Dublin city as outlined by Deputy Cluskey.  Houses were falling down and a serious position, almost an emergency position, existed at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put on foot certain suggestions through the Corporation, inviting private builders to make offers to the Corporation for houses they were building or were about to build, and the Corporation would buy them and install their tenants in them.  This is relevant in this case because those same people were prepared to build on that site houses that would be suitable for Corporation tenants who <Col N="915" /> were mentioned as having been on the waiting list.  The Corporation did not follow through, and they did not follow through in other cases where offers were made by private builders of a speculative type that their houses should be used to meet the difficult conditions of that time.  They would also meet some of the difficult conditions obtaining today in regard to the shortage of houses in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The projected housing programme of Dublin Corporation envisaged, among other developments, the use of this land at Kilbarrack and The Swan, as I think it is called, for their building programme in the years 1969 and 1970. All those considerations were in my mind in regard to the Compulsory Purchase Order.  There was a difficult situation calling for the greatest expedition in the housing programme we could possibly bring about by a direct building programme or by getting speculative builders to offer to the Corporation their services or houses which were already in course of erection.</P>
    <P>All those things were very much in my mind at that time.  There was also the fact that houses built for the middle-income group would also have a beneficial effect on the housing situation for the lower income group in that if people occupying flats or less attractive houses could get houses on the speculative market they would vacate that accommodation and it would be made available for the lower income groups.  Where building by speculative builders could be carried out that would be of direct or an indirect relief to the housing situation in Dublin and whichever means would appear to offer the quickest solution was attractive to me at the time.  That also had quite a bearing on this Compulsory Purchase Order.</P>
    <P>I should also add that the appellants indicated not only in relation to the town planning appeal but later in regard to the compulsory purchase procedure that they would conform to whatever plan was designated by the Corporation for the area as a whole. That is, in fact, the position now, and <Col N="916" /> they are conforming and will conform to the general development of the area from a planning point of view.  Those are the reasons and the circumstances I had to consider.  In all the circumstances, I thought it was the best thing to do from the point of view of housing for the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>So far as my recollection goes&mdash;and at this short notice I have not been able to get all the facts, but my recollection is pretty clear&mdash;all these lands were designated for development by the Corporation in 1969 and 1970. That is some years ahead.  The suggestion or the idea that may be abroad that the withholding of confirmation in respect of these 95 acres of land is directly responsible for anyone being without a house today is not borne out by the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that if performance on this site by the people concerned is not up to that indicated at the time of the confirmation of the Order, it is quite possible that a further Compulsory Purchase Order might meet with success.  If work is not gone ahead with on this site in a reasonable time, and provided no obstacles are placed in the way by some outside agency such as the development of the services by the Corporation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A reasonable time would be the time necessary to process the plans and designs, to get under way all the matters required for the development of an estate of this size, and subject to there being available to them the full and wholehearted support of the local authority and my own Department in so far as we will come into these services in respect of clearance proposed plans and acceptance of the design from the architect and all the other things. There is no fixed time for any one site but looking through it and keeping an eye on what is happening, I would, with my advisers, be able to assess as time went on whether or not a reasonable time has elapsed at any given point of time.  But it would not be possible, as the Deputy may well see, <Col N="917" /> to accept for any site that a year or two or three years would be a reasonable or an unreasonable time.  We do not know the difficulties that might arise outside the control of the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If two or three years were a reasonable time, the Corporation themselves would have been building by that time in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say two or three years' notice in given cases would be a reasonable time.  I am trying to point out the difficulty of stating in advance in respect of any site of this size what a reasonable time would be.  I would say as well that the reasonable time would be qualified by the condition as to whether or not the time taken was utilised or used up by somebody outside the people concerned; in other words, it was within their competence to do it and, within a reasonable time, they did not.  If they were prevented, through other cause, from doing it within a reasonable time, then in fairness, there would have to be a longer time given.</P>
      <P>Over and above that, I should say that far from there being any question that I, as Minister for Local Government, prevented people in the city being housed, I have made what I think are efforts further than those of any previous Minister for Local Government in trying to provide houses in Dublin, and these efforts are known to the degree that nobody will be led to believe that I have, in fact, deliberately for any reason whatsoever stood in the way of the provision of houses much needed by the citizens of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not deprived Dublin Corporation of 101 acres. Dublin Corporation have failed to get by compulsory acquisition 95 acres in the circumstances I have outlined. Through my efforts, 450 acres have been made available to Dublin Corporation and within ten months of getting <Col N="918" /> the OK, I have already embarked on the provision of 4,000 additional houses over and above the number which the Corporation have themselves declared capable of being built by traditional means.  Had they all the land of Counties Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow now, they could not provide one further house than they are providing under their normal programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Corporation have on the particular site 229 acres of land.  If these lands which they have got were necessary to them immediately, and they were able to build on them, why have they not started to build?  It is because of the fact that this is part of the overall programme for house building.  They would not <Col N="919" /> have reached it, under their normal programme, before 1968, 1969 or 1970. It is entirely wrong to say that there is one house less being provided to-day than last year because they did not get all the land they put the CPO on in this particular district.  The Deputy has been asserting this and it is not the case.  The overall evidence will show that no fewer houses are being provided today as a result of the CPO than would have been provided, had they got all the land they sought.</P>

      <P>There is little further I can add to what I have said, which is my firm belief in this matter.  The reasons I have briefly outlined are my reasons in regard to this particular case.  I still reiterate that, far from inhibiting in any way or reducing the out-turn of houses in Dublin for the people of Dublin who so badly need them, I have gone beyond what is the normal role of any Minister for Local Government. I have gone beyond anything that has been done at any time by anybody else in my position in that I have helped the Dublin Corporation personally and through my Department and the National Building Agency to try to get out of a very difficult situation.</P>
