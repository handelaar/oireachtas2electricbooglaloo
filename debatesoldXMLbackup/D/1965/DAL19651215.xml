      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to questions addressed to me in this House on 25th November last and to replies by the Minister for Local Government to questions addressed to him on the same day.</P>
      <P>Since then, as announced on 26th November, the Government have made a special grant of £10,000 available to the Irish Red Cross Society with a view to enabling the Society to relieve exceptional cases of personal distress due to flooding and storm damage during this winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The following may be taken as the general principles governing differentiation between the types of instruments referred to:</P>
      <P>(i)  a rule is subsidiary legislation providing for procedure.</P>
      <P>(ii)  a regulation is subsidiary legislation of general application,</P>
      <P>(iii)  an order is subsidiary legislation dealing with specific persons or cases and</P>
      <P>(iv)  a bye-law is subsidiary legislation of local or other restricted application.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>The maintenance of this differentiation is a matter of some practical difficulty, however, and, in this connection, the Deputy's attention is invited to Part III of the First Report of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments appointed by Seanad Éireann on the 4th July, 1957 (Pr. 4685).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office was set up in April, 1951.  The duties of the Office are, under the general instructions of the Attorney General, who is responsible <Col N="999" /> for all Parliamentary drafting, to deal with proposals for law reform and consolidation of statute law and to give effect to such proposals by way of drafting appropriate Bills.  In addition, the Office has, subsequent to its establishment, been given responsibility for the editing of the annual volume of the statutes and the separate annual index thereto and the editing of the Consolidated Index to the Statutes and the Index to Statutory Instruments, which are published at appropriate intervals.</P>
    <P>In carrying out these functions, the Office works in collaboration with the Department or Departments concerned with any particular field of reform or consolidation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Law Reform Division of the Department of Justice, any proposals originating in that Department for law reform or consolidation in the fields with which that Department is concerned and which advance to the stage of preparation of legislation must necessarily go through the process of Parliamentary drafting. The drafting may be carried out by the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office or by the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office.  There has always been co-ordination and collaboration between the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office and the Law Reform Division of the Department of Justice in carrying out such work, and <Col N="1000" /> there is no overlapping of effort involved.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the information requested by the Deputy. The figures for 1961-1964 are also shown in the table and, in order to facilitate comparison over the whole period, the figures are also given to base 1950=100.

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs the estimated <Col N="1007" /> cost of sending all three Dublin morning newspapers in one packet to Irish Missions in Australia, Canada, the United States, France and Nigeria, as compared with the present cost of sending out one particular newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers (for the Minister for External Affairs) Mr. Childers (for the Minister for External Affairs)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 15 together.</P>
      <P>Copies of all three Dublin morning newspapers are despatched on the day of issue to all Irish diplomatic and consular missions abroad except to the Embassy in London which receives its copies from a local supplier on the day of issue.  During the recent newspaper strike in Dublin, the <i>Cork Examiner</i> was supplied by airmail to the missions and since the ending of the strike, this newspaper is being supplied by surface mail.</P>
      <P>All the daily newspapers are despatched direct from the newspaper offices as this is a more expeditious method of despatch than having the newspapers delivered to the Department and then issued from there.  The newsagents which for a number of years in the past despatched the Dublin daily newspapers to the missions indicated that they did not wish to continue this service.</P>
      <P>Missions which are too distant to enable copies to be sent to them by surface without a delay of more than a few days receive at least one of the Dublin dailies by airmail.  The principal reason for sending at least one of the newspapers by airmail is to ensure that such distant missions have at the earliest possible moment the general news coverage of an Irish daily newspaper.  Thus the <i>Irish Press</i> is at present sent by airmail to practically all the more distant missions in the same way as the <i>Irish Independent</i> was airmailed to such missions during the period when the present Opposition was in office.  In addition, copies of the <i>Irish Times</i> are sent by airmail to a limited number of the missions which have specifically asked for this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The choice of newspaper to be air-mailed <Col N="1008" /> is not dictated by circulation figures in Ireland, but by the requirements of our representatives abroad in keeping themselves informed of developments in Ireland particularly as regards important news events and Government policy, which they may be expected to interpret in the course of local contacts.  All missions have in due course the benefit of the editorial and other comment, feature articles etc. of each daily newspaper as they receive all four Irish daily newspapers.</P>
    <P>Representations have recently been received from Independent Newspapers Ltd. on this subject and following a review of the position it has been decided to have copies of the <i>Irish Independent</i> despatched by airmail instead of by surface to the Embassy in Washington and the Permanent Mission to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Fourteen copies of the <i>Irish Press</i> and ten copies of the <i>Irish Times</i> are airmailed daily to the missions.  Ten copies of the <i>Irish Press</i>, fifteen copies of the <i>Irish Times</i> and twenty-four copies of the <i>Irish Independent</i> are despatched by surface mail.</P>
    <P>The major portion of the cost involved in sending newspapers abroad is, of course, the postal charges.  In the first quarter of the present financial year the total cost of sending the <i>Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Times</i> by airmail was £163 7s. 2d. and £105 6s. 0d. respectively.  In the same period the total cost of sending the <i>Irish Press</i> and <i>Irish Times</i> by surface mail was £28 13s. 9d. and £58 10s. 0d. respectively. Comparable figures cannot be given in the case of the <i>Irish Independent</i> as an account from Independent Newspapers for this period has not yet been submitted.</P>
    <P>Taking an average weight of 5 ozs. per paper the postage cost of sending by airmail all three Dublin morning newspapers in one packet to Irish missions in Australia, Canada, the United States and Nigeria would be 7s. 10d. daily in the case of each mission as compared with 2s. 10d. daily for one newspaper.  In the case of the Embassy in Paris, the respective figures are 6s. 6d. and 2s 4d.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> As the despatch of newspapers by airmail is costly, particularly in the case of the <i>Irish Independent</i> which almost invariably contains more pages and is thus heavier than the other dailies, it is not proposed in the interest of economy to incur any additional costs in sending newspapers by airmail to the missions abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's somewhat wordy, reply, can he guarantee that in future the preferential airmail treatment the <i>Irish Press</i> has been accorded up to now will apply equally to the other newspapers?</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that preferential terms have been accorded to the <i>Irish Press</i> up to now.  If the <i>Irish Press</i> is not the same size as the <i>Irish Independent</i>, would it not follow that there would be less news in the <i>Irish Press</i>?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish representatives abroad are required, in accordance with explicit instructions, to accord first priority to work concerned with the promotion of exports and other foreign earnings and the services of our diplomatic and consular missions are at all times at the disposal of Irish exporters seeking new or extended markets abroad.  Assistance is given by our missions to Irish exporters in a variety of ways and in particular by&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>general market research, market research for particular commodities, establishing contacts between Irish exporters and foreign importers and import agents, advising Irish exporters or their representatives on which importing interests they should meet and arranging such meetings, replying to specific trade inquiries from Irish exporters, pursuing the possibilities of store promotions for Irish goods abroad and Irish participation in foreign trade fairs, making representations as and when necessary to foreign governmental authorities about import restrictions and other matters of concern to Irish exporters, furnishing commercial reports on foreign firms or individuals, keeping in touch with market developments generally in the countries concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish representatives abroad are fully alive to the special and active attention they must give to their economic and trade functions particularly in the context of the present balance of payments difficulties and the <Col N="1011" /><i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which envisages a substantial increase in commodity exports and in foreign earnings generally in the present decade.  In the past year, arrangements have been made for closer liaison between my Department and missions abroad on the one hand and Irish exporting interests and State-sponsored bodies concerned with foreign trade and earnings.  The economic training of officers of my Department has been intensified and, in the case of officers being posted abroad for the first time and those on home leave, special emphasis is placed on visits to and discussions with Irish exporting firms and on briefing by the economic Departments and the appropriate State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that our Embassies abroad are showing very poor results, despite the long list of duties they have to discharge, as our balance of payments position in relation to countries in which we have Embassies indicates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly start an argument with the Deputy on the question of the balance of payments but if he will look at the figures for our manufactured exports and our exports of processed foods in 1956 and compare them with the figures for 1965, he will find that, even with our balance of payments difficulties, we have made tremendous progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs why a visa was necessary in the case of Mr. Nelson Samkange, Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) African Peoples' Union representative in Britain and Ireland; why a delay occurred in granting the visa which caused Mr. Samkange to miss a Dublin meeting; and whether any explanation for the whole matter is forthcoming from the Embassy in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As Mr. Samkange had no national passport he fell to be regarded as a stateless person and therefore not exempt from the visa requirement. Embassies abroad are not authorised to grant visas to stateless persons without reference to Dublin. Mr. Samkange's visa application was made to the Embassy only one day before his intended journey and the visa was granted next day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from recent information that has been obtained that Mr. Samkange's first approach was made on 8th December, that he phoned the Embassy at 11 a.m., called in person about 1 p.m. completed his visa application forms, left his travel document with the application and that the request for instructions was dispatched at 2.45 p.m. the same day.  He phoned on 9th December, the next day, at 12.45 p.m. and was informed that his visa was ready. He did not call to collect the visa until approximately 3 p.m.  I cannot consider that there was any excessive delay in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that due to the fact that the reconstruction of premises at North Wall had to be carried out without <Col N="1019" /> interruption of normal business, it was necessary, in order to cause the minimum upset, to choose a type of shed, the materials for which and the erection thereof could be completed in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly evident that State companies have occasionally to purchase foreign materials or equipment. I can also assure the House once more that we have had discussions with all the State companies, we have circularised them, we have discussed the matter with them, and they are taking the view that where they can purchase Irish materials or equipment, they will do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>But, as the House is aware, there must be some limit in regard to the differential in cost.  The State companies do not automatically purchase Irish materials and equipment if the cost enormously exceeds that of what can be purchased abroad, but they have been taking a most liberal point of view and percentage differences between foreign- and Irish-made have been extended ever since the balance of payments difficulties which we have experienced arose and everything is being done to encourage the use of Irish-manufactured goods among State companies.  I can say that without fear of contradiction.  There are always bound to be some exceptions. In this particular case, this steel fabric was, in fact, ordered in May, 1964, before the crisis became <Col N="1020" /> apparent and so the directions given to State companies in regard to the use of Irish materials and equipment did not actually apply to this particular transaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about what happened when we began to face particular balance of payments difficulties. State companies already had given a measure of preference to Irish materials and equipment, and we asked them to give an additional measure of preference and to try to see whether, during this period, goods which were not already manufactured here could be manufactured and advise them that they should go out to firms which normally were unable to make what they required and ask them: &ldquo;Can you make them now?  Even though the price may be a little more than we would normally pay in normal circumstances, we should like to see at what price you can furnish these materials and equipment&rdquo;.  I hope I have given the House the full picture of what was involved in our meeting State companies and giving the same kind of directive.  I might add that Irish Steel <Col N="1021" /> Holdings do not manufacture pre-fabricated units.</P>

The Government have not been approached by anyone in connection with these suggestions, which the sponsoring organisations have pointed out are the views of the individual authors of the study.</P>

      <P>The discussions with representatives of management and unions which form part of the annual review of industrial progress under the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> cover some 60 per cent of <Col N="1026" /> all industrial output.  Most of the 1965 series of meetings have now been held, but only in isolated instances have the figures requested by the Deputy been agreed by all concerned.  I am not, therefore, in a position to give the information sought in the first part of the question.</P>
      <P>As regards the industries not covered by these discussions, the review work involved is nearing completion, but it is not yet possible to furnish the particulars requested.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the current review, it has been assumed that a new Anglo-Irish Trading Agreement, based on the free trade principle, would take effect from mid-1966; that under this Agreement Irish tariff and quota protection would, in general, be dismantled over a ten-year period and that Irish industry would have immediate tariff-free access to the British market; that Ireland and the UK would become members of the EEC shortly before, or shortly after, 1970; and that Ireland would be given full duty-free access to the EEC on securing membership.</P>
      <P>The normal procedure in respect of the data requested by the Deputy would be that it would be supplied to the National Industrial Economic Council.  The Council would then furnish its views to the Government, indicating what changes in policy might be desirable.  However, in view of the interest displayed in this year's review and its immediate relevance to the forthcoming debate on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area, I shall explore the possibility of giving the Dáil some general indication of its results in connection with the debate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the very depressed state of many towns in the West of Ireland, particularly in Mayo; and if he will take the necessary steps to have the properties within these <Col N="1032" /> areas revalued with a view to effecting a reduction in rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the special problems of the West of Ireland, including the towns.</P>
      <P>It is not clear from his question whether the Deputy has in mind a reduction of rate poundages or a reduction of the overall burden of rates. The latter is necessarily related to the cost of the services to be financed. Anything in the nature of a general revaluation of properties, while it would iron out inequalities, would not affect the general rates burden.</P>
      <P>Any steps which the Government may consider necessary in relation to improvement of the valuation and rating system will be taken when there has been time to go into the problem in all its aspects.  Meanwhile, I have no function as regards the revision of valuations.  Any ratepayer has, under the Valuation Acts, the right to submit to his rating authority&mdash;to the town clerk, if the ratepayer lives in an urban district, borough or county borough; to the county secretary, if he lives elsewhere&mdash;a list of any properties in his rating area the valuations of which in his opinion require revision. These lists are passed each year by the rating authorities to the Commissioner of Valuation so as to have the valuations of the listed properties revised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. We promised to examine the whole rating system, which is an immensely complex matter.  It involves a comparative valuation of land in different areas and it involves studying the effect of any change in the methods of valuation, as to whether it would really produce what everybody would like, a lightening of the burden without any other untoward effects.  This is a very difficult problem, as the Deputy knows. The replacement of rates by general <Col N="1033" /> taxation is a matter that also requires consideration as to whether it is practicable, whether the ultimate effect would be to lighten the burden, and who should benefit by any such change made.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take the replies to Questions Nos. 49 to 52 together.</P>
      <P>The obligation to make provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires is imposed on sanitary authorities by the Fire Brigade Act, 1940.  Due to the fact that expenditure on the fire service is completely rate-borne, the acquisition of equipment is a matter for the sanitary authority.  My Department have however encouraged these authorities by means of circular letters and inspections to provide themselves with the most modern fire fighting equipment available.  In any case where equipment appears to be inadequate, my Department press the sanitary authorities to remedy the deficiency.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that, generally, sanitary authorities are sufficiently aware of the obligation imposed upon them to equip themselves adequately for fire fighting.</P>
      <P>While the provision of meals for fire crews engaged in fire fighting is a matter for each sanitary authority, I propose to recommend that these sanitary authorities who have not already adopted a scheme for the provision of meals should consider introducing such a scheme.</P>
      <P>I have not made any regulations covering the duties of part-time firemen. These duties and other conditions of employment are left to the discretion of the sanitary authority.</P>
      <P>The question of frequency of drills, and time for cleaning of equipment, is one for each sanitary authority.  I understand that, generally, part-time firemen attend two drills per month, which I would regard as the minimum necessary.  In any case where this minimum is not being observed or where the time allowed for cleaning equipment is inadequate, I shall take the matter up with the sanitary authority concerned.</P>

      <P>There is no information available to show the number of road accidents caused by short-sightedness of the drivers of the vehicles involved.  It is clear, however, that defective vision, if uncorrected, can be a contributory factor in accidents.  To highlight the importance, particularly in the case of drivers, of a check-up on vision, the Association of Ophthalmic Opticians, Ireland, in co-operation with my Department, carried out free screening tests during the Road Safety campaign in December, 1964, and again this year.  The availability of these tests was given full publicity.  In addition, the question of seeking power to have an eyesight test included as part of the driving test is being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the comprehensive reply given to a question on this subject on 27th October last&mdash;Vol. 218, Cols. 478 and 479.  As stated in that reply, owners whose prices have been agreed in land bonds but whose lands <Col N="1052" /> have not yet vested in the Land Commission will, under section 26, Land Act, 1965, be eligible for payment in such higher interest-bearing bonds as may exist when the lands do in fact vest in the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are at present being made for a new land bond issue bearing a higher interest rate and any pending cases will get the benefit of this issue.  In the normal voluntary purchase by the Land Commission for bonds there is no undue delay between the signing of the contract and the completion of the sale unless in the odd case in which there are unusual title difficulties.</P>
      <P>The answer to the final part of the question is in the negative.</P>

Will he not further agree that there has been a steep fall in the price of land bonds this year to the extent of about £9 in £100 and that this is a sizable sum of money for a seller to lose if the sale is completed before the next issue of bonds is available?  Will he not agree that the Land Commission should reconsider the whole position as far as the purchase of land is concerned and pay ready cash the same as every other person who buys land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may or may not be aware there are several different forms of land purchase by the Land Commission.  Normally, where there is voluntary purchase&mdash; and that comprises at present the vast majority of dealings&mdash;there is no undue delay.  It is an ordinary sale as between the vendor and the Land Commission as purchaser.  As I said, in that type of case, there is no more delay, generally speaking, than in ordinary transactions between private individuals.  I agree there are long delays in compulsory purchase cases, which is completely different type of procedure, and in acquisition cases, which are different, too.  There are also the odd cases in which there are unusual title difficulties.  I have pointed out to the Deputy we have made <Col N="1053" /> arrangements for a new land bond issue, which I presume will be at par, and that any of these cases pending to which the Deputy refers, in which the lands have not yet vested in the Land Commission and title proved, will get the benefit of the new bond issue. Therefore, they will not be losing money, as the Deputy fears, due to this depreciation.</P>

      <P>The tanks, to which the Deputy refers, comprised, as far as I can ascertain, part of the plant and machinery required for a new factory being established here to manufacture for export.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>All creameries are required by law to calculate the price they pay for milk on the basis of the percentage of butter-fat contained in it.  When informing their milk suppliers of the results of the calculation, some creameries choose to express it in terms of a price per pound of butter-fat contained in the milk, while others express it as a price per gallon of milk of a stated butter-fat content.  This is a matter of individual choice but the basic method of calculation is similar in all cases.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Health Authority inquired in March, 1964, if any objection would be raised to the planning of a new unit of 100 beds at St. Clare's Home, Ballymun.  While the matter was still under examination, however, my Department was informed by the Authority that alternative proposals would be put forward; these proposals were to include the disposal <Col N="1080" /> of some of the land at St. Clare's to Dublin Corporation for the provision of special housing for the aged as well as the construction of extra additional accommodation by the Authority.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>There must be some misunderstanding, as the Deputy suggests, because in June last the CEO of the Health Authority informed officials of my Department that the Health Authority had reconsidered their earlier proposals and that they intended to submit new proposals for my consideration.  These proposals were, as the Deputy probably knows, to sell some of the land at St. Clare's to Dublin Corporation for the purpose of providing special housing for the aged and, secondly, for the Health Authority to build four 50-bed units for chronically ill or frail elderly persons needing institutional care.  We did not get those proposals yet and when, in September, the Department inquired from the Health Authority, we learned that a valuation was being made of the land to be disposed of and the acting RMS of St. Kevin's was considering extensions required for institutional care at St. Clare's.</P>

      <P>The Institute of Public Administration has sought assistance from the Government in the matter of financing its accommodation requirements.</P>
      <P>The accommodation at present occupied by the Institute is at times found inadequate, so that it is necessary to rent outside accommodation on a temporary basis.  There has been an expansion in the Institute's activities in recent years, particularly in providing training courses for civil servants and local authority employees and overseas training, i.e., of students from the developing countries, and due to the establishment of the School of Public Administration.</P>
      <P>To cope with this expansion, the Institute has arranged to purchase a house adjoining the two houses which the Institute already owns.  Funds are needed to cover the purchase and to reduce the Institute's bank overdraft. Arrangements have been made to borrow the necessary funds on a long-term basis, subject, however, to principal and interest being covered by a State guarantee.  The Government have approved the giving of the necessary guarantee and to implement this approval it is necessary to add the Institute to the bodies scheduled to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, with a maximum amount of £30,000 to be guaranteed.  The draft Order before the House for approval will implement this intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I asked at the end of the Second Stage whether this register of camping sites would preclude, say, a person from letting a caravan in on some ground he might have adjacent to the sea, not being a <Col N="1097" /> progressive commercial venture.  I take it this is for commercial ventures on a reasonably large scale?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the main sanction that Bord Fáilte has in this is, first, that it will not list any caravan parks or camping sites that are not registered.  Secondly, no one may advertise in any booklet or publication or on the outside of premises to the effect that an unregistered caravan site exists, or label it as such.  If caravans are placed in a field and there is no mention of the existence of the caravan site and it is not published in any form as a caravan site, then such a site comes under the regulations of the local authority for sanitary purposes.</P>

There will be co-ordination and consistency of approach in this matter.</P>

      <P>I feel sure the Minister is aware that a number of speculators are moving in to purchase sites.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no power to interfere in that matter, but, as the Deputy knows, in his county the county manager has taken rather stern action to prevent undesirable speculation in property by imposing temporary building prohibition in a wide area of scenic attraction.  Deputies have been saying that he is being too stringent but his feeling, in common with other county managers, is that there must be a final plan approved before he will permit such building.  I have no reports of speculators moving in and I do not think I have power to stop them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which provides the money and the greatest care will have to be exercised. I asked the Minister a question today and I do not wish to labour it now. While there may not be very much to it, it is extremely desirable that State companies, Bord Fáilte and others, should come as little as possible under adverse public criticism.  It is important they should carry on their affairs in <Col N="1099" /> such a manner as to command at all times the admiration and co-operation of the public.</P>
      <P>Incidents that give rise to public criticism not of a constructive kind present a bad image in relation to the companies themselves and their dealings with the people.  If it is true&mdash;I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether it is&mdash;that the Bord Fáilte offices in Regent Street, London, which were very good central offices, were the subject matter of a lease which fell in through carelessness of Bord Fáilte who, having had notice in ample time to apply for a renewal, failed to do so, then criticism is necessarily adverse and, of course, just. People with legal facilities and money available, with business training and standards, should not have this happen to them.  From the point of view of tourism, certainly the offices should have been kept on in the same place as far as possible so that continuity would be preserved during the years.</P>
      <P>Still on the question of offices, may I say that in this country large public concerns like oil companies should be utilised, if at all possible, in the tourist drive by getting them to supply tourist information.  There are large oil companies with stations at either end of towns and it should be possible to provide them with brochures dealing with local matters within a 50 mile radius.  There might be difficulty in regard to the ability of their personnel who supply petrol to give out such information, possibly from the point of view of youth and inexperience.  I suggest it is a matter that could be explored with profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the necessity for providing an early sailing list by CIE to help hotel owners and others in the Aran Islands.  The time of the year in which the list is issued is far too late for those people to make definite arrangements to cater adequately for visitors in the coming holiday season and it is unfair that they should be deprived of this list until the very last minute. <Col N="1100" /> Another question that arises here is the provision of toilet facilities in country areas.  People may benefit from tourism but it is unfair to saddle the local authorities with the job of providing toilet facilities for tourists who pass through towns in buses.  I submit that the tourist organisations should come to the aid of local authorities in this matter.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister when it is proposed to proceed with the schemes in Salthill and Galway city.  They have been hanging fire for quite some time and are the subject of much local criticism.  I admit that a great deal of work has been done and I should like to pay a tribute to the tourist people in that respect, but leaving things half done is a source of irritation, and I hope the Minister will press to have these matters completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with Deputy Coogan's remark that a good lot of work has been done.  Anybody who travels throughout the country must appreciate that.  I have one complaint to make, and in making it, I am airing the views of my constituents as well as my own.  We feel that in all this advertising and publicity, County Mayo has not got its just share. whether that is well founded I do not know, but it is my opinion.  I do not wish to be unfair to the tourist people who have a difficult job and many problems.  Of course we are pretty far west and I suppose that people in order to shorten their journey sometimes, or for some other reason, may not visit towns like Ballina, Crossmolina, Belmullet or many other centres which are very beautiful and unspoilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider us in the matter of publicity. We need any help we can get from any source.  Anything that will supplement the meagre incomes of many people in these areas is very badly needed.  We have beautiful scenery, beautiful forests which are developing, thanks to the efforts of successive Ministers for Land, and beautiful mountains and lakes and, as Deputy Coogan has remarked, perhaps a drop of poteen. <Col N="1101" /> However, I think that industry has gone.  I would appeal to the Minister to take this up with Bord Fáilte and I would couple our area with North Sligo, places like Easkey and Enniscrone. I suppose if people visit one place, they are almost certain to visit other places as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on this move and I hope that this extra money which we are providing for Bord Fáilte will speed up the development of our major resorts.  Salthill has been chosen as one of the major resort development areas and in Salthill, we feel very pleased that this money will be available and we hope that the work will go ahead without further delay.  One criticism of Bord Fáilte which I must make&mdash;it may not be a fair one but still I feel it should be made&mdash;is that when they are selecting architects and professional people to undertake large schemes, they should consider the professional talent which is available in the area, people who, I should imagine, are better fitted to know what is required.  In Galway a scheme was drawn up by Bord Fáilte and there has been tremendous opposition to it from the people of the town. If there had been more liaison between the Board and the local people, this difficulty would never have arisen.</P>
      <P>I should also like to point out that we have an historic statue, that of Pádraig Ó Conaire, which was the focal point in the park at Eyre Square but which was removed while development work was being undertaken.  I understand that it will now be placed in a less prominent position than that which it enjoyed since the date it was unveiled.  I would ask the Minister to use his influence to ensure that the statue is put back in Eyre Square where the people of Galway and tourists have enjoyed looking at it for many years, and not to have it tucked away on the far side of this scheme which was drawn up by an architect in Dublin.  There are many other things in that scheme about which the Minister has been made aware by Galway Corporation and representatives of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> When Bord Fáilte are spending money on improvements, they should make themselves more aware of the opinions of the people in the particular locality and the opinions of those who are making their living from the tourist industry.  In this regard, I want to refer to a toilet which was supposed to be renovated in Salthill.  Work started on it at the beginning of this year but it has not been completed because the local people were not consulted and the job started before anybody knew what was happening.  The Minister has always been very helpful to me on previous occasions and I do not wish to let this opportunity pass without airing my views on these matters.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the very strange decision arrived at by CIE and Bord Fáilte who came together to erect an information kiosk for bus tourists beside a men's toilet on the opposite side of the road to any other facilities.  Why people should be left out in the rain, or why women should be asked to wait for buses beside a men's toilet in an isolated area, is beyond me.  There is also a move to erect telephone kiosks behind it.  We in Salthill want to see it taken down altogether and I recommend to the Minister that he should have this done, if an alternative site can be obtained for it.  It was a complete waste of money.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw attention to the great concern of people in my constituency over the delay in going ahead with plans for a new recreation centre which was promised to Galway over five years ago.  This centre is to include a conference hall.  We would welcome this move and the Minister can be assured of the co-operation of all interested bodies in Galway in helping to get this project under way.  I wish to thank the Minister for the co-operation he has given to the tourist industry in my constituency in the past.  I would ask him not to forget that in Galway we want a conference hall and I would also ask him to ensure that there is no further delay in providing it.  We have seen tremendous developments in other tourist resorts and we wonder why we in the <Col N="1103" /> west are left behind.  I would also ask him to get Bord Fáilte to move as rapidly as possible on the renovation of the ladies' bathing pool at Salthill.  This structure has been a disgrace for many years.  Due to the interest and co-operation of Bord Fáilte, plans have been drawn up by them and a substantial grant has been sanctioned for its renovation.  If this work could be started and completed for the coming season in Salthill, it would be of tremendous benefit to the industry in Galway and the west generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the visits which the regional tourist representatives are paying or have paid to local authorities.  Some time ago we had a visit from the man who represents the north-eastern region and he referred to the seven golden miles which lie between the County Dublin border at Balbriggan and the Bovne at Drogheda.  He asked members of my local authority if they had any questions about it and I asked him two questions.  I asked him how much had Bord Fáilte spent on the seven golden miles and how much did they intend to spend, and the answer in both cases was nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need, if you have seven golden miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seven gold miles of strand and not one shilling has been spent on them.  A couple of years ago, with the chairman of the county council and some of the members, I visited the Bord Fáilte offices and received a promise from some of the officials that money would be made available for a new park which was being planned for the village in which I live, Laytown, but the matter has been dragging on since. Last year Bord Fáilte arranged for a planner to visit the area and help to draw up a plan.  An excellent plan was drawn up which so far has been put into operation by the county council. Bord Fáilte suggested that the telephone and electricity wires would have to go underground before they paid any grant.  The amount of grant they offered was about £690 for a £15,000 <Col N="1104" /> job.  The job was threequarters completed. As far as I know, the lines have not been put underground and no grant has been paid.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister let me know&mdash; if he cannot do it now, then when it is convenient for him&mdash;whether or not the Board intend to pay any grant towards this park and, if they do, how much they propose to pay?  I think in all fairness we should know this.  There is no point in promising it if they do not intend to carry out their promise.</P>
      <P>That area is open for development, and this is where I differ entirely from Deputy Molloy.  In my opinion, a very bad mistake has been made in continuing to pour money into the larger resorts, while at the same time smaller resorts which could be developed are completely ignored.  The coastline to which I am referring is beside the town of Drogheda with 21,000 people and is within striking distance of another 60,000 people.  Yet we cannot get a shilling for its development unless it is put up by the county council.  Bord Fáilte are falling down on their job in that regard.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte did a very good job at Newgrange where they erected a museum, but I think it was stupid to set up an information centre there. That information centre is miles from everywhere and only visitors to Newgrange can make any use of it.  As far as hotel booking facilities and giving information is concerned, it cannot be contacted except by visitors to Newgrange because there is no telephone there.  It seems to me remarkable that an information centre should be set up at the back of god-speed without a telephone&mdash;and then we are told an information centre has been set up in the county.  This is something that should be rectified.  I think it was a mistake to set it up there, but, as it is there, a telephone should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister say if there are any proposals with Bord Fáilte to do anything about Tara?  I believe Tara could be the greatest money spinner in the country if it were properly developed.  This is something which should have the attention of Bord <Col N="1105" /> Fáilte.  A few years ago great plans were drawn up to deal with it.  There was to be a museum there.  Certain lands were acquired and a local committee offered full co-operation and a good deal of money.  Then it suddenly died down.  It was revived two or three times since, the most recent occasion being when the present Minister for Health announced, when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, that Bord Fáilte were taking it over and making the farm there State land.  This is all talk, talk, and not one darn thing is being done about it.  I can see in the not far distant future Germans or Americans coming along, buying Tara, building some kind of plastic palace on it and collecting sixpences from the people going in.  They will do it if nobody else does.  I honestly believe this is something on which we could recover in a very short time any expenditure made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully referred to an area of coastline extending from Laytown almost to Portrane.  No doubt about it, it is considerably more than seven miles of the most wonderful strand in Ireland.  It has that natural amenity but it is also the bleakest area in the country because no attempt whatever has been made to develop the natural amenities there.  It would be a good thing if Bord Fáilte got specialists to survey that area, the resources to be developed there and the amenities to be provided.  A long-term programme of development there is long overdue.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Tully said, we have people coming from outside the country with proposals.  I know that proposals are before one local authority I am aware of for the development of considerable areas of this coastline. It is hard to refuse it when no Irish authority will undertake the responsibility of planning and protecting these amenities for the people.  If it falls into the hands of foreign developers, there will be large areas of the country under their control and to which the natives will not have free access.  That is a growing development. It should be taken notice of and something done to stop it in time.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the wonderful strands on the other side of the country.  We have some wonderful strands but they are not approachable by car.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First, Deputy Lindsay referred to the change in the address of Bord Fáilte.  I think Deputy Lindsay may have been misinformed by somebody on that.  I have ascertained, since he asked a supplementary at Question Time, that Bord Fáilte claim they did know the lease was expiring.  These premises in Bond Street were deliberately purchased as a result of a Government decision and based on research that had been done by Córas Tráchtála in the first instance looking for a building which would be the nearest equivalent to an Ireland House in London where all these bodies could be housed together, with obvious benefits to our trade, tourism and commerce.  The Bond Street premises were not secured because Bord Fáilte discovered too late that their lease was expiring; they knew that, and that it would be renewed on much more costly terms but, as I said, in the meantime the search for a good building centrally situated on a street of a well-known&mdash; indeed, famous&mdash;name was proceeding all the time.  I do not think the question of the lease expiring enters into the controversy.  When difficulties in regard to the alterations to the premises arose it was found necessary for Bord Fáilte to take the Carnaby Street offices for the intervening period because the other premises were not ready.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked a number of miscellaneous questions and to some of them I have not got the answers because it would take some time to secure the information.  This Bill enables Bord Fáilte to provide local tourist amenity grants at any place in the country where they think it advisable.  They no longer have to give grants to areas which they classify as resort areas, as I indicated on the Second Reading, and the reason for this is the growth of motor traffic and the change in emphasis in regard to the location of areas needing development. The Bill will enable them to <Col N="1108" /> choose at will any area where, first, they regard resort development as desirable, or local tourist development in any form, and secondly, where they can get at least a contribution from a local authority or association.  While that would apply to the eastern strands, I cannot say whether these could be fitted into the programme at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton raised a very much bigger question, the whole question of how a strand can be developed.  From what I have seen of his activities here I think the Deputy is pretty expert on local government and he should know that the National Institute for Physical Planning and the Department of Local Government have been giving courses and seminars to local authorities on the basis of planning and in particular they have virtually completed a survey of one county which will serve as an example of how to plan in other places and will give a lot of useful advice and suggestions to county managers.  As Deputies know, local authorities must prepare a plan for their county within a limited period and I agree that they should engage as far as possible people with some knowledge of planning scenic amenities which is very different from planning a town.  When they have achieved a plan and it has been approved, it is then possible to carry out such development as is available either as a result of private financing or with Bord Fáilte help.  Local hotel and guesthouse accommodation, the planning of access roads and other amenities&mdash; again, these will be a combination of local authority and local association and Bord Fáilte finance.  That is the general principle underlying both the Planning Act and Bord Fáilte operations as extended and amplified in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Deputies from Galway asked some questions about the Bord Fáilte plan for Salthill.  I understand that is proceeding slowly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is proceeding steadily and a very large <Col N="1109" /> amount of money has already been spent as Deputy Coogan and Deputy Molloy know and I hope the scheme will be completed in due time.  I shall bear in mind the representations of Deputy Molloy regarding the placing of the information office which I think may now come under the regional tourist company and may be a matter for them and not Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully asked about Laytown. I am not aware of the position there which I shall investigate.  I do not know whether in fact it was possible to give a grant in that area as I do not think Laytown has been classified as a resort development area under the old legislation.  I think the Newgrange information centre will be under the care of the regional tourist company and it will be up to them, the directors and managers, to say whether the information centre in its present location is justifiable.</P>
      <P>In regard to all these matters the regional tourist companies are doing extraordinarily effective work and I am very glad to hear Deputies of all Parties praise their activities.  These tourist companies have been in operation for only about 18 months.  They have had very small funds but they are already beginning to do splendid practical work.  In 1966 the caretaker directors will be replaced by democratically elected directors from the membership of each tourist company. It is very important for Deputies to encourage everybody interested in tourism to join regional tourist companies, whether it is only a matter of selling more petrol to more people in summer because of the arrival of tourists or selling meat to hotels or running hotels or doing any business in which tourism is involved.  They can all join regional tourist companies and can all subscribe and have whatever rights are due to them regarding the election of directors in 1966 when the caretaker committees cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, regional tourist offices should be doing work formerly done by Bord Fáilte and in this regard a lot of the complaints mentioned by Deputy Molloy will be overcome.  I am glad to say that very good regional tourist consciousness is growing up <Col N="1110" /> throughout the west and it is, of course, the west which will receive the principal benefits of regional tourist activity in the sense that very high costs are involved in local development there because of the remoteness of the area.</P>
    <P>I shall have to refer the publication of the sailing list of the <i>Naomh Eanna</i> to CIE.  It does not arise on this measure but I shall be only too glad to refer it to CIE on behalf of Deputy Coogan who seems to have made a reasonable suggestion.  I understand there are difficulties in acquiring land at Tara but I agree that over the next four or five years something must be done to develop Tara as a national museum site for our own people to say nothing about tourists.  As Deputy Tully knows, standards are pretty high in countries all over the world when it comes to the development of a museum in an area of that kind.  Many tourists, for example, will probably expect to see, even if it is only a very small museum, some model or design of what the experts think Tara looked like.  I understand it is sometimes very difficult to get agreement from the academicians on these matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Deputy Clinton expressed concern lest some foreign interest should take over part of a strand in County Dublin in which he is interested and prevent access to the strand by the people.  That is purely a matter of planning for the local authority.  If they decide that some institution like Butlins or some other holiday camp established by Irish people or by foreigners to which Bord Fáilte give quite considerable grants could have some space on the beach or convenient to the beach solely for the sake of administrative convenience, there is no reason why they should not have it but if the local authority considers that the entire stretch of beach should be left open <Col N="1111" /> with no refusal of access, that is within their competence and the promoters of the holiday camp would have to decide whether or not to go ahead in the knowledge that there must be free access along the beach.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine.</P>

      <P>That matter does not arise on this section of the Bill but I would say that financially it would be completely impossible for Bord Fáilte to extend its system of inspection to all the restaurants in the country and to have their maximum prices put up. There are other countries that have found that it was not worthwhile doing that.  There are no restaurants registered in Spain, for instance, only hotels.  While there have been a good number of complaints of excessive charges for meals and evenings teas, I do not think they relate to more than a minute percentage of the restaurants and cafes in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to alter the present basis of registration for electoral purposes of patients in hospitals, homes and similar institutions for persons suffering from mental disability. It provides that each such patient shall be registered in the place where he would be residing, but for his being a patient, and that where that place cannot be ascertained by the registration authority, he shall be registered at his last place of residence.  The proposed change is on much the same lines as that intended under the Electoral Bill, 1965, which was introduced in the Dáil as a Private Member's Bill in July last, and which was debated here on 1st December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1963, mental patients were specifically debarred from being registered in the hospitals and other institutions in which they were staying. Short-stay mental patients were registered at their home addresses and permanent or long-stay patients were not normally registered at all.  The Joint Committee of the Dáil and <Col N="1113" /> Seanad on Electoral Law, which reported in 1960-61, recommended that &ldquo;persons resident for long periods in county homes and similar institutions&rdquo; should be registered there.  The Joint Committee also expressed the following opinion that the distinction between physical and mental illness should cease to be a factor in the electoral Law:</P>
    <P>The trend in recent legislation has been to do away with the distinction between physical and mental illhealth. A member suffering from a disease which prevents him for a long time from discharging his functions as a public representative is not thereby disqualified.  If, however, the disorder is mental he is disqualified. The Joint Committee does not see any logic in this distinction. (Paragraph 102 of the Committee's Final Report).</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1963, short-term patients or inmates in hospitals, sanatoria, county homes, homes for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or similar institutions are registered at their home addresses and long-stay patients or inmates are registered at the hospitals and other institutions.</P>
    <P>Following the general election held earlier this year, criticism was voiced in this House and elsewhere regarding voting at the election by long-stay mental patients at polling booths situated in or adjacent to mental hospitals. The general concensus of opinion seemed to be that the new provisions regarding voting by such patients had proved to be unsatisfactory in practice and that it would be desirable to revert to the arrangements which operated prior to the Electoral Act, 1963.  The present measure sets out to do this, but it avoids the danger of imposing, in effect, the statutory disfranchisement on long-stay patients which the Electoral Act, 1923, applied.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the provisions of this Bill will apply to the 1966-67 Register of Electors, which will be used for the forthcoming local elections and which is at present in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> I submit the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for the expeditious manner in which he honoured his undertaking to implement what I regard as being the best part of the Bill introduced by us some weeks ago.  As the Minister has said, the position following the 1963 legislation has been found to be unsatisfactory. We have gone over this point fairly fully in the course of the discussion on our Bill and it was generally accepted, and there were expressions of opinion from all sides of the House which indicated that there were abuses and undesirable practices arising from the 1963 legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Electoral Law.  It was never the intention of the Joint Committee that these recommendations should have applied to patients in mental hospitals.  Their concern at that time was with long-stay patients in county homes and other such institutions.  I felt at the time we were discussing the Bill introduced by us that this effect could have been brought about by amending our Bill and deleting the latter portion but apparently the people better qualified to make decisions felt that the best way to deal with the matter was for the Minister to bring in a separate Bill.  I am quite prepared to accept that that is the right way to do what we wish to be done.  It is quite unnecessary to go over the ground again in any detail.  I want just to welcome the measure and to see it through the House as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party also support the terms of the Bill.  It is rather a pity that the necessity arises to introduce this Bill because of the way in which the 1963 Act was framed.  All of us dislike pinpointing persons suffering from mental illness as persons apart from the ordinary people but, unfortunately, that is the case and there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it would involve too much trouble to separate long-term patients from other patients.  I am referring to <Col N="1115" /> a patient who may have been admitted to a mental hospital years ago and who has no relatives or, if he has relatives, they do not want to take him out.  Such a person, though he may be quite sane, is condemned to remain in a mental hospital for the rest of his life.  It is suggested that such persons can vote if they are brought to the place where they originally resided.  The mental hospital serving County Meath and a number of other counties is in Mullingar, Westmeath, and I do not think any candidate would be mad enough to go to Mullingar to bring a patient home for the day in order to vote because the difficulty in returning him to the hospital would be very great.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Clinton's Bill was before the House a couple of weeks ago, the Minister insisted that a Joint Committee recommended that mental hospital patients should be included in those who should be allowed to vote. While the Minister quoted a reference, I still feel that there was a misinterpretation on the part of the persons drawing up the 1963 Bill.  I think the slip-up occurred where reference is made to the trend in recent legislation to do away with the distinction between physical and mental ill health. It is suggested that the Joint Committee did not see any logic in the distinction between mental and physical ill health.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 22 of the Final Report of the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law&mdash;page 81&mdash;recommended:</P>
    <P>A further amendment to section 1 of the Electoral Act, 1923, which the Joint Committee would like to see made is the deletion in subsection (9) of the words `workhouse, poor house'.  This would enable persons resident for long periods in county homes and similar institutions to be registered there.  The present wording of subsection (9) in effect disfranchises them and seems to be an anachronistic survival from old poor law attitudes.</P>
    <P>I believe that this was where the misinterpretation occurred because the 1963 Act did not restrict the provision <Col N="1116" /> to county homes but extended it to mental hospitals.  I would suggest that it was never intended to have them included.</P>
    <P>The Minister even at this late stage is remedying the position.  It is a good idea.  While certainly people may tell patients of mental hospitals that this House is now taking punitive measures against them, I believe that, in their own interests and for their own protection, it is only right that this Bill should be before the House and should be passed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Though sponsoring this Bill, I regret the fact that it will take away from mental patients the votes they got for the first time at the last election.  The 1923 Act disfranchised these people completely. Even though we are now amending the 1963 Act, we are not disfranchising these people to the same degree to which they were disfranchised under the 1923 Act.  I am not at all certain that there will not be people who may think it worth their while to take these mental patients out to vote in some other county.  More luck to the patients if their mental state is such that they can be allowed out and good luck to anyone who takes them out, irrespective of Party affiliations.</P>
      <P>With the progress made in mental treatment in recent years, there is no doubt that many of these patients who are registered on the electoral register will be quite capable of voting under their own steam.  From that point of view, this amending legislation is an improvement on the 1923 Act, though it might be regarded as a disimprovement of the 1963 Act from the point of view of the mental hospital patient.</P>
      <P>As far as the Committee's Report is concerned, if it was not their intention that we should do what was done by the 1963 Act, I certainly took it that it was their express intention that it should be done.  However, the general opinion now seems to be that that was not the intention.  This Bill represents, I think, the best compromise.  It gives these people rights they did not have before 1963, even though it may be said to lessen to some extent those rights conferred by the 1963 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This legislation became necessary in the first instance because under existing law the capital of Aer Rianta is limited to £13,000,000.  Of this amount, a total of £12,950,047 has been taken up.  This total includes £1,300,000 of the £2,000,000 Exchequer contribution towards the cost of Aer Lingus short-haul jet aircraft.  The balance of £700,000 has been advanced to Aer Rianta by way of a repayable advance pending the enactment of new legislation to enable the Minister for Finance to subscribe for share capital in Aer Lingus to this amount.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the conversion of the repayable advance of £700,000 made to Aer Rianta into a share capital contribution in Aer Lingus.  The opportunity has been taken in the amending legislation to relieve Aer Rianta of its functions as the holding company of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte so that the State investment in these companies will now be held direct by the Minister for Finance.  Another objective of the Bill is to incorporate in one consolidated Bill all the relevant legislation relating to the control and financing of the air companies at present contained in the Air Navigation and Transport Acts so that, on the enactment of the new Bill, these Acts will relate solely to the general law of air navigation and international conventions.  The Bill provides for the necessary amendments to the existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing legislation, the statutory provisions in respect of repayable advances by the State, and State guarantees of borrowings in respect of <Col N="1121" /> moneys required by the subsidiary companies&mdash;Aer Lingus and Aerlínte &mdash;are operated through the medium of Aer Rianta in its capacity as the holding company.  Now that Aer Rianta is being relieved of its function as a holding company, it is necessary to provide for the making of advances direct by the Minister for Finance to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte, for direct borrowings by these companies and for the guarantee by the State of such borrowings.  Limits on advances and guaranteed borrowings have been fixed in relation to the likely requirements of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte in the next three years or so. No provision is being made for further share capital contributions from the Exchequer to these companies who have now reached a position in which they can reasonably be expected to meet their capital requirements either direct from their own resources or by borrowings serviced from those resources. No provision is made for advances or guarantee of borrowings in respect of Aer Rianta because under this legislation the functions of the company will be confined almost entirely to the management of Dublin Airport and the capital requirements of the airport are financed direct from voted moneys.  The Bill also applies to the Air companies certain provisions, common to semi-State bodies generally, relating to the appointment of directors, the furnishing of accounts and approval by the Minister of new or amending superannuation schemes.</P>
    <P>The arrangement under which Aer Rianta acts as holding company for Aer Lingus and Aerlínte derives from legislation some thirty years old and, at the time of enactment of that legislation, when the extent to which the operating companies would expand their activities over the years could not be reasonably foreseen, the system of State control through the medium of a holding company was administratively convenient.  Aer Lingus and Aerlínte have now reached a stage of development where their operation as independent companies, freed from the complications inherent in their existing status as subsidiaries of Aer Rianta, is fully justified.  Indeed, these companies had <Col N="1122" /> reached the necessary stage of development some time ago but steps to establish them as independent companies could not be conveniently taken because up to the 31st March, 1964, BEA had a shareholding in Aer Lingus.  The BEA shareholding was acquired on that date by the Minister for Finance by way of a share capital subscription to Aer Rianta of the purchase price of the BEA shareholding. The arrangement under which the channelling of capital subscriptions to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte through Aer Rianta as the holding company has in fact given rise to difficulty in distinguishing the capital position of each of the three companies.  Of the issued share capital of £12,950,047 shown in the Aer Rianta accounts as at 31st March 1965, £5,692,994 represents the shareholding in Aer Lingus and £6,921,477 the shareholding in Aerlínte.  The balance of about £335,000 has been retained by Aer Rianta for investment in Irish and Intercontinental Hotels Limited and for its own capital purposes.  The Aer Rianta shareholdings in Aer Lingus and Aerlínte are, of course, included in the issued share capital as shown in the accounts of those companies and this duplicate showing of capital has resulted in misconceptions as to the total amount of capital invested in the air companies and has, it will be recalled, resulted in unfavourable comments in the House.</P>
    <P>The tendency is to assume that the capital invested in the air companies is double the real amount because the same quantum of money appears in the Aer Rianta accounts and again in the Aer Lingus and Aerlínte accounts. Moreover, loans, etc. required for the operating companies have to be negotiated through Aer Rianta so that the accounts of that company show liabilities which are really proper to the subsidiary operating companies.  There is no reason why this situation should continue particularly now that the BEA shareholding in Aer Lingus has been acquired.  The termination of Aer Rianta as a holding company will result in Aer Lingus and Aerlínte being given the necessary statutory recognition to enable the Minister for Finance <Col N="1123" /> to have a direct shareholding in and guarantee borrowings by the companies without the necessity for channelling the transactions through Aer Rianta.  The present legislation will achieve this purpose.</P>
    <P>The proposed change in the status of Aer Rianta will also have the effect of removing the undesirable situation under which Dublin Airport is managed by a company the vast bulk of whose capital is invested in operating companies, one of which operates extensively at the airport; two-thirds of the landings made at Dublin Airport are by Aer Lingus aircraft.  It is clearly bad in principle that the airport should be managed by a company so closely identified with a particular operating company.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the conversion of that part of the present shareholding of the Minister for Finance in Aer Rianta which is represented by shareholding in Aer Lingus and Aerlínte into direct shareholdings by the Minister for Finance in those companies. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance has taken up shares to the value of £295,557 in Aer Rianta to enable that company to take up shares and mortgage debenture stocks to a like amount in Irish and Intercontinental Hotels, Ltd.  The Bill transfers this holding to Aerlínte as the company most closely identified with the operation of the hotels.</P>
    <P>The House may find it useful to have a short resumé of the capital position of the air companies as a whole.  With the conversion into share capital of the £700,000 referred to in section 3 of the Bill the total State investment in the three air companies will be £13.66 million, of which all but about £50,000 is represented by the investment in the operating companies, Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  The State investment in the air companies has not so far been remunerated because the companies' requirements of capital to finance their extensive operational developments over the years have absorbed any funds becoming available by way of depreciation or operating surpluses.  The total amount of depreciation <Col N="1124" /> and net operating surpluses of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte in the period 1960-61 to 1964-65 amounted to £7.65 million.  These internal resources of the companies have had to be supplemented by further State investment and by extensive borrowing from commercial sources.</P>
    <P>The present Bill does not provide for any further subscription to share capital beyond the £700,000 already referred to and accordingly the companies will have to finance their capital projects from their own resources and from commercial borrowings as foreshadowed in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> With this method of financing the proportion of remunerated capital, i.e. loan capital, to total capital, i.e. share and loan capital combined, will be substantially increased.  The total share and loan capital of Aer Lingus and Aerlínte amounted to nearly £14 million at 31st March, 1965, of which 7 per cent was loan capital; at the end of the period of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, it is estimated that the total of share and loan capital will be in the region of £30 million, of which over 50 per cent will be loan capital. Loan capital is remunerated at prevailing commercial rates of interest.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1961, provides for the payment of repayable advances to Aer Rianta by the Minister for Finance up to a limit of £1 million.  Instead of this provision, repayable advances of up to £1 million may now be paid in the case of each of the operating companies on such terms as to repayment as the Minister for Finance may determine.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for borrowing by the operating companies on such terms and up to such limits as are approved by the Minister for Finance.  Under section 75 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, as amended by section 3 of the Air Navigation and Transport (No. 2) Act, 1959, the Minister for Finance could guarantee the payment of principal moneys up to a limit of £5 million together with interest secured by debentures issued by Aer Rianta.  A corresponding provision is included in the new legislation <Col N="1125" /> except that the limits have been revised as to £5 million in the case of Aer Lingus and £6 million in the case of Aerlínte, including the limit of £1 million on repayable advances in each case.  These limits take account of borrowings which may be necessary in the next three years or so to supplement the companies' own resources for the purchase of new aircraft and other capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>At present the method of appointment of directors of the three companies differs as between Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  The appointment of directors of Aer Rianta is regulated by paragraph 4 of the Second Schedule to the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, whereas the appointment of directors of the operating companies is regulated under the Articles of Association of the companies. The Bill lays down uniform conditions for each company under which the number of directors and the terms and conditions of their appointment are determined by the Minister for Transport and Power in consultation with the Minister for Finance&mdash; conditions which are of course entirely appropriate in the circumstances that the capital of the companies has been provided by the State.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, the accounts of the air companies are submitted to the Minister for Finance who presents them to the Dáil.  Under this Bill responsibility for laying copies of the Report and Accounts before each House of the Oireachtas is transferred to the Minister for Transport and Power.  The appointment of auditors, which heretofore required the approval of the Minister for Finance, will now be subject to my approval after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  These provisions are similar to those obtaining in the case of a number of other State companies.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions in the Bill are generally consequential on the provisions which I have referred to and do not raise issues which require special mention.</P>
    <P>In summary this Bill can be described as a tidying-up process <Col N="1126" /> which has become necessary due to the changes which have occurred over the years since the passing of the first Air Navigation and Transport Act almost 30 years ago.  I should explain that the Bill does not purport to effect any change in the management of Dublin Airport and as I have already stated in the House no worsening of the conditions of any employees at the airport is contemplated.  However, should a review of the system of management of the three State airports disclose that the airports would be better and more economically managed on an integrated basis, then the constitution of Aer Rianta as a purely management body would facilitate the changeover.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this Bill as a tidying-up measure as described by the Minister in the course of his speech, a speech which, I must say, was a simple and readily understandable presentation of what would be in ordinary circumstances a very complex situation. Consolidation in matters of this kind is or should be always welcomed not alone by the Legislature but by the layman and the lawyer alike.</P>
      <P>While the Minister says there will be no worsening of the conditions of employees, the one worry I would have is that on the reorganisation resulting in the independence of Aerlínte and Aer Lingus, promotion would be blocked or the progress to promotion would be slower for present employees.</P>
      <P>I should like to say something in the normal course of events on the relationship between Aer Rianta and the Intercontinental Hotels.  For the moment it may be sufficient to say that the Aer Rianta people might take a greater interest in the day to day running of these hotels, particularly the running of functions and the manner in which that is done.  I shall leave the matter at that because I think it is more appropriate to an Estimate debate than to a measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that our air concern has been and is a tremendous <Col N="1127" /> success.  Not alone does it provide comfortable passenger services, but, relatively speaking, it provides the safest flying service in the world. Praise must be given to the operating staffs, indeed to the general staff, both on the ground and in the air.  We cannot be sufficiently proud, in words at any rate, of our air services, from whatever aspect we view them.  They are extremely good, comfortable and safe.</P>
    <P>Reading today's newspapers and the news that Dr. Dempsey, the General Manager, is thinking of retiring&mdash;with sufficient notice indeed&mdash;I felt a certain amount of regret.  It would be appropriate to say here that I do not think that in any of our State companies, or in any part of our private enterprise, is there a man to whom this country owes so much in regard to this project, started 30 years ago.  He is not alone a man of great administrative ability&mdash;all done extremely unobtrusively&mdash;but it can be said of him that he has a great labour relations understanding, the result being that during the 30 years there has been very little difficulty experienced in the running of these companies.  I regret to see he contemplates retiring at a very young age, having regard to his great ability and also having regard to the reluctance of many others much older in an active sense.</P>
    <P>The people who fly the planes, whether Atlantic or European, are people to whom a tribute should be paid.  Among them are the girls who work as air hostesses.  I do not think the remuneration they get is adequate but probably it is as much as the company can reasonably afford.  I have often wondered why, whether connected with status or otherwise, tipping is prevented.  I think there should be some sort of receptacle somewhere in a plane where people could insert certain amounts to be divided among the hostesses at the end of the year, at Christmas.  Very often coming home from abroad, we are in possession of a certain amount of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Contraband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1128" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean contraband, but amounts of money which are very small.  If this money could be put into some sort of receptacle to be divided among the girls at Christmas, it would represent a gift from satisfied customers because saying: &ldquo;Thank you very much; we have enjoyed our flight&rdquo; is a very inadequate return for the services these girls give and, if I might use the old hackneyed phrase, the service with a smile they give.  Passengers are sometimes not easy people with whom to deal.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us this is a tidying-up measure.  I feel that this company&mdash;the same can be said of other State companies&mdash;having regard to the amount of money they make, to the amount needed to keep them properly supplied&mdash;the necessary acquisition of further planes and depreciation &mdash;are such a good investment that it might be reasonable at a not too distant date to put shares on the stock market so that people could invest in them.  Certainly our air companies are the kind, having regard to their history, their safety record and the wonderful progress they have made, in which people could invest with security and, I think, invest very well.  It is a matter about which I have felt strongly for many years&mdash;not only in relation to Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, the parent body, but other State companies.</P>
      <P>This is tidying-up legislation, at the same time incorporating all the international Conventions.  It is not a Bill about which there can be any controversy. We can, however, avail of the Bill to pay tribute and compliments to the people who have run the services and are continuing to run them with such extreme attention and satisfaction not alone to Irish people who use the planes but to foreigners who have the good fortune to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for at least having provided us with a brief easily readable and easily understood.  Perhaps he would pass on the word to his Cabinet colleagues that they should attempt to simplify some of the briefs on Bills from time to time.  As Deputy <Col N="1129" /> Lindsay has said, this is entirely noncontroversial and is, I imagine, highly desirable.  The proposals in the Bill would have to be dealt with eventually and tidying-up in this way should be welcomed.  The Minister has timed this Bill well, when business is not too heavy.</P>
      <P>The fact that the joint organisations who have been running the air services are so successful is a great tribute to everybody associated with them, from the ground staffs to the pilots and hostesses.  I should hate to think that the remuneration of the hostesses is such that they would have to depend on the spare money that travellers carry back with them, not of very much use for anything.  If the money were of any value, it could be exchanged on the plane for something which might be taken home.  The staff should be adequately remunerated and I hope that is the case.</P>
      <P>While there is a certain amount of glamour attached to the job of air hostess, there is also a lot of hard work.  It often surprises me that girls are attracted to this type of work because apart from the danger attaching to flying &mdash; although, thank God, the operations of our services have so far been very safe&mdash;there is always the drudgery entailed by having to serve meals on a plane, very often to people who are not very good travellers, or not very good mixers or perhaps who may have mixed something a little bit too much earlier, or who perhaps find the food they are offered not exactly what they want.  These girls deserve to be very well remunerated and I hope that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One disturbing comment was made by Deputy Lindsay and I should like to take him up on it.  A few years ago there was a suggestion here that we should get rid of some of our State companies and at the time some of us were wondering whether we were going to try to sell the ones that were not paying or the ones that were paying. The suggestion that private enterprise should be invited to invest in a paying State company is one which we should not encourage because if we get rid of the companies that are paying and <Col N="1130" /> only maintain the ones that are not, we then can have people pointing to the fact that public ownership is not the right way to deal with these matters and that we should hand them back to private enterprise.  Therefore I would ask the Minister not to be too anxious to take the advice of Deputy Lindsay.  Perhaps if he is thinking of getting rid of some of the State companies, he might start with some of the others under his authority and see how that would work out first.</P>
    <P>As has been stated by the previous speaker, the Bill is a tidying-up measure. One point which I would like the Minister to clarify, perhaps not now but at a later stage, is that the public are often confused about the expression &ldquo;an operating profit&rdquo; which is used when talking about air services. Does that mean that the operating profit is a profit made without counting the cost of replacements or the repayments of loans?  Is it simply a profit on the operation of the company for the year, without taking into account any of the matters which could convert the operating profit into a very real loss?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this some time for the benefit of the general public, so that they would know whether or not the very substantial investment in the air company is, as some people claim, while showing an operating profit, at the same time showing quite a substantial loss over the years.  If it is showing a loss, how does it compare with the losses of some of the other companies such as CIE?  If this information were available, it would be very useful in clearing the air with regard to these matters because there seems to be a lot of doubt as to whether or not the expression used means in fact what it is normally intended to mean, or whether it covers a situation which is not quite so rosy as we are sometimes told.</P>
    <P>However, the company is providing an excellent service and I agree with Deputy Lindsay when he says that the services provided are not alone safe but it is generally accepted that the Irish airlines are equal to the best, and in fact very much better than many other services provided, particularly <Col N="1131" /> on the Continent of Europe.  We should be proud of that because I have yet to find, when travelling abroad, anybody who is not prepared to say that the Irish airlines are safe and comfortable and that the service given by the staff is the very best and is very courteous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his brief. As one of the so-called younger members of this House, one of the greatest difficulties with which I have been confronted from time to time has been, to use a hackneyed phrase, the plethora of legislative documents which I find difficult to get the time to read and study.  I do not wonder that half, or perhaps 75 per cent or 85 per cent, of the people do not know what their rights are.  As has been said the Bill is a rationalisation of the finances of Aer Rianta and Aerlinte and Aer Lingus.  As Deputy Lindsay has remarked, the safety record of Aer Lingus is second to none.  However there is one point which I should like the Minister to clear up.  How many journeys does a plane make before it is checked thoroughly and how many times is a plane used before it is finally put on the scrapheap?</P>
      <P>As we know, Dr. Dempsey has announced his proposed resignation and I should like to pay him a tribute, apart from knowing him personally. His record as a public servant has been first-class.  He has been with Aer Lingus for some 30 or 40 years and his dedication to that company has been proved by its success.</P>
      <P>In relation to the salaries of air hostesses, as mentioned by Deputy Tully, it is only fair to say on behalf of Aer Lingus that these hostesses have certain concessions in relation to trips abroad at very reduced rates.  I think that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to clarify one point for me in relation to the hostesses and the concessions granted to them. I should like to know if any changes have been made recently in relation to the concessions which were normally granted to them since the foundation of Aer Lingus in respect of their relatives.  I understand that their relatives, whether they were parents or brothers and sisters, could travel to America for ten per cent of the normal charge and they were able to do this by the system known in airline circles as &ldquo;standing by&rdquo;, which meant that they could not travel unless there were seats empty on the plane, seats which had not been booked.  I understand that this concession has been taken away from the relatives.  I wonder why. It would not make any difference to the finances of Aerlínte because, as I said, these seats are provided on a stand-by basis only.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that.</P>
      <P>I would congratulate the Minister and the Government on the decision taken recently concerning the use of Dublin Airport by American airlines. It would have been a retrograde step for the tourist industry in the west if this concession had been granted.  I have been told by friends in America that when next year's schedules are drawn up, there may be some slackening off in the number of planes flying to Ireland from America.  I am sure this was gone into very thoroughly in the discussion and I should like to hear the Minister speak on it.  Is it a fact that one can get on an American plane at New York, book to London and, if this plane were to stop in Dublin, visit Ireland at no extra cost?</P>

      <P>Much of what I intended to say, Sir, is not relevant, in view of your ruling just now.  This Bill is welcome in that it tidies up, as the Minister said, the administration of our national airline.  I should like to join with the other Deputies who have spoken in praising Aer Lingus for the service they have provided and the progress they have made.  But I hope they will get down to the job of providing a proper feeder service from Shannon Airport.  As I have already publicly stated, I welcome very sincerely the Government's decision to refuse the application for permission to fly into Dublin, but it is necessary that a proper feeder service be provided by Aer Lingus to and from Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>There is another point to which I referred previously.  It is the question of the purchase of used aircraft by Aer Lingus.  During the past year, they purchased a number of Viscounts from KLM.  I have since investigated the matter and I am satified the aircraft acquired at that time were what might be termed a good bargain, but I feel this is something that should be discouraged.  The tremendous record Aer Lingus have should not in any way be jeopardised by seeking bargains. This Bill is a step in the right direction and I sincerely hope it will lead to still further progress by Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their very pleasant acceptance of this Bill.  First, I shall deal with Deputy Tully's question as to what constitutes an operating surplus.  He will find if he looks at the accounts of Aerlínte for the past year that the operating profit made was £1,180,000. Included in that is the whole of the calculated cost of flight operations, aircraft fuel oil used, landing fees paid out, all the maintenance and overhaul and all the depreciation of flight equipment, ground equipment, premises and furniture, depreciation as verified by the auditors and depreciation, as in the normal case of company accounts, at historic cost.  Then traffic expenses, sales and publicity are charged; administration, management and general expenses are charged; and the <Col N="1134" /> operating profit, as I have said, was £1,180,000.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that Aerlínte does not remunerate its capital. Because of the fact that both of the companies were made to expand their services so rapidly, to enter upon routes with marginal profitability, it was quite impossible for the air company as a whole to earn enough appreciation or acquire sufficient reserves to invest in new aircraft on new routes at the pace at which they were required to do so by the implication of what is in the legislation or by Government direction.  Therefore, if you take the capital as being a sum of £6,000,000 odd, it is not remunerated.  There is no interest paid on it.  It is not being repaid to the State.  Theoretically, if you compare it with a private company, you will have to take from that profit what represents the remuneration of the capital, as in the case of the ESB, whose capital is repaid over a period of years.</P>
      <P>Having got down to the operating profit, if the Deputy looks further to the profit and loss account for the year, he will find that, after adding two small credit items to that profit, amounts have been deducted or written off, preliminary expenses in connection with the introduction of jet aircraft, the operation of initial services across the Atlantic with the leased aircraft, with Constellations, before the Boeing jets were purchased.  Then, having written off year by year considerable sums so as to reduce the working capital required by Aerlínte for its business, they have put aside as much as £700,000 out of that operating profit as an extra fleet replacement reserve in order to expand the fleet.  They have also put aside a certain sum for fleet insurance reserve because of the possibility of insurance rates rising as a result of an undue number of accidents in the world at large.  Air insurance is based partly on a company's experience within itself and partly on its contribution to whatever pool of insurance is required.  The balance carried forward at the end of all that is only £204,000 out of £1,180,000.  That explains the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> The only element which could confuse the public, and which I tried to clear up by mentioning it every year, is the fact that nearly £7,000,000 of Aerlínte's capital is not remunerated. Therefore, there is no mention of interest in those accounts.  If it was there, of course, the profit would be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree the public can be confused by thinking there is an actual profit when, in fact, there is no repayment of capital and no interest paid on borrowing?</P>

      <P>On the other hand, having said that, as Deputies know, the two air companies have been instructed to remunerate their capital in future, and not many years from now in respect of 50 per cent of their total capital they will have to repay in one form or another and pay dividends on it.  Therefore, as the years go by, they will tend to become more and more a company such as the ESB which does remunerate its capital in one form or another.  There is no use in comparing them with the ESB and suggesting they could do it in the same way but they are reaching that stage, and if all goes well and the tourist business expands between Great Britain and ourselves and the United States continue to grow in prosperity, other things being equal, it should be possible for a far greater proportion of the capital to be remunerated in one form or another in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews asked about checks of Aer Lingus equipment.  I could acquire the information but I do not think it is necessary to give the details. If I remember rightly, I think there are 25,000 parts in a Viscount and in the case of a given number of these parts, they are automatically replaced after a certain stated length of time and stock records have to be kept of all parts.  Even if certain vital parts appear to be in perfect order, they must be replaced.  In regard to the rest, there are stated checks at different intervals, minor checks at lesser intervals and more detailed checks at more advanced <Col N="1136" /> periods.  These checks are the subject of regulations, and as I said, officers of my Department are very concerned to establish and maintain the very strictest regulations in regard to the establishment of safety procedures required in connection with the national airline. In that of course they have the co-operation of the magnificent executive staff of the air companies towards preserving the splendid safety record of the airline.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. O'Donnell spoke about a feeder service.  I intend to direct Aer Lingus to provide a feeder service for passengers arriving by aircraft other than by Aerlínte aircraft at Shannon. I hope that will be in operation next year.  The Deputy can be sure that the KLM Viscounts that are being purchased will be in good order, well maintained and will be aircraft which will enable Aer Lingus to maintain its present standard.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my voice to that of the House in paying tribute to Dr. Dempsey for the splendid service he will have given to Aer Lingus when he comes to retire.  His retirement is a matter of great regret.  I have no jurisdiction over the airline manager's appointment; the Board of Aer Lingus appointed the manager.  Dr. Dempsey insists on retiring in order to give way to a younger person.  I admire him for this.  I am quite sure his successor will likewise give splendid service.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much I need say about the position of the hostesses. Everybody knows how splendid they are.  Much praise has been given to them in the House and I have frequently praised them publicly.  I need say nothing about their rate of pay. There is a tradition certainly among all airlines that no tips are received by hostesses and I can see very good reasons for that because air hostesses are in a very special position and are really above the level of those who would receive gratuities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke of the danger of flying from the point of view of the attraction of the occupation.  I can reassure him that according to American statistics, it is eight times safer to fly <Col N="1137" /> than to travel on the roads of America and I do not think that danger could be regarded as much of an element to discourage young women from joining the service as hostesses.</P>
    <P>I have no information about travel privileges being changed, as suggested by Deputy Molloy.  I do not think the air company would be unreasonable about it.  This may have some relation to International Air Transport Association regulations but I certainly feel that the privileges are very great, and I would feel very doubtful about any suggestion of according more privileges to the staff.  If anything, they are over-liberal, and when I consider that in relation to the fact that the people of the country have put up a great deal of capital for the air companies that has not been remunerated, unless the change was a stupid one which did not save money, I would have no objection to changes of a reasonable kind in regard to people who are allowed to fly at reduced fares and who are related to the staff of the airline which could effect some economy while still maintaining reasonable privileges.</P>
