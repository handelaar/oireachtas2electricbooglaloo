      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £93,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1965, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say <Col N="1300" /> if there is any proposal in regard to something which is referred to briefly, that is, the question of the ushers who have long service and who are not getting credit for that service?  Some of them will be retiring this year and some next year.  They have given their life's service to the State and it is most unfair that they should not get the credit for that service which they would get if they were in any other branch of the Government Services.  If the Minister wants particulars, I shall be glad to give them to him.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Land Bill, 1963: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In line 8, &ldquo;,save where the context otherwise requires&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;Act&rdquo;; in line 12, &ldquo;save where the context otherwise requires,&rdquo; deleted.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the definition section.  On Committee Stage in the Seanad, Senator Sheldon and others raised a few points on the drafting of this section, and I came to the conclusion that some verbal improvements could be made.  The proposal here is simply that the customary &ldquo;saver&rdquo; phrase&mdash;&ldquo;save where the context otherwise requires&rdquo; should be moved into the place where it usually occurs, that is, at the beginning of the section.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Lines 23 to 26 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;every reference to purchase money shall be construed as including a reference to any redemption price of a superior interest, any resumption price, any compensation or any fund, and any residue of such redemption price, resumption price, compensation or fund, and any share in such redemption price, resumption price, compensation or fund, and any residue of such share.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with another drafting point in the definition section. Here again I was impressed by Senator Sheldon who saw a slight difficulty about the wording of the last part of <Col N="1302" /> the section dealing with the interpretation of &ldquo;purchase money&rdquo;.  This refers to the delegation of power to the Examiner of Title for the purpose of expediting the distribution of funds in court.</P>
    <P>These funds are of various types and it is convenient to have a general defining clause to avoid repetition throughout the Bill.  It is necessary, of course, to keep the defining clause in line with previous enactments, for example, section 35 of the Land Act, 1931, and section 52 of the Land Act, 1933.  I think amendment No. 2 now spells out the whole idea in unmistakable language.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (5), page 6, a new paragraph added as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the life annuities section.  It was Senator Fitzpatrick who suggested that regulations governing the life annuity scheme, when made by the Minister for Lands with the consent of the Minister for Finance, should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I see no objection to this course.  The regulations are those mentioned on page 5, line 40, of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 6, line 16, &ldquo;first cousin&rdquo;, inserted before &ldquo;son-in-law&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 6, subsection (6) we have a definition of &ldquo;member of the family&rdquo; and in section 45 we have a similar definition.  Senator Stanford pressed for the inclusion of a first cousin in the definition in section 45 and I accepted his point.  It seems logical to keep the two definitions in harmony so on the next Stage of the Bill I put down an official amendment to bring section 6 <Col N="1303" /> into line with the other.  This seems only reasonable.  Amendment No. 24 is the cognate amendment to section 45.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 6, line 16, &ldquo;and, in the case of a female vendor, her illegitimate child&rdquo; added after &ldquo;daughter-in-law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Lindsay was of the view that it should be possible for a female vendor to make provision by way of secondary annuity for her own child, whether illegitimate or not, and this was a perfectly valid point.  Although I doubt if such a case will often arise, I am satisfied to accept the proposition as being in conformity with present day trends.  Accordingly I recommend the amendment.  Amendment No. 25 is the cognate amendment to section 45.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, the following subsection added:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) In deducing any relationship for the purposes of this section, a person adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 and 1964, shall be considered the legitimate offspring of the adopter or adopters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>While this was an official amendment in the Seanad on Committee Stage, it was in fact a redrafting of an amendment put down by Senator Lindsay. The tendency of modern legislation is to give full legal rights to the adopted child and while I do not imagine we will have many such cases, I see no reason, as this is a voluntary matter, why the vendor should not be free to make provision for his or her adopted child.  Amendment No. 26 is the cognate amendment to section 45.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> In subsection (2), page 8, line 52, &ldquo;so exercised as&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;exercised solely&rdquo; substituted.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the withholding of consent to subdivisions, etc.  Senators Ross and O'Brien expressed some doubt about the phrase &ldquo;so exercised as&rdquo; on page 6, line 52; they thought the subsection could be worded a little more firmly in order to limit the powers of the Land Commission to refuse consent.  On further examination by the draftsman, it was considered that it would be an improvement to use the phrase &ldquo;exercised solely&rdquo; and this is now proposed.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 9, lines 22 and 23, &ldquo;; provided that, in any case where the title has been or is acquired (whether before or after the passing of this Act) by or through possession wholly antecedent to the passing of this Act such consent shall not be required.&rdquo; added after &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with existing squatters' title on sub-division.  Senator Fitzpatrick made a good point about the possibility of a slight injustice being done to persons who obtain title to land by possession before the Bill is passed and who would thereafter have to obtain the consent of the Land Commission before they could have such title registered.  I thought it right to accept this point and so an amendment was introduced to cover it.  This amendment will exempt the type of person I have referred to, provided the whole period of possession on which he bases his claim is antecedent to the Act.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In subsection (4), page 10, line 14, after &ldquo;all persons&rdquo; the following added:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;;provided, however, that in any <Col N="1305" /> case where the consent of the Land Commission under this Act is given after the attempted or purported sale, transfer, letting, subletting or subdivision, such consent shall, if the Land Commission so direct, so operate as to validate with retrospective effect such attempted or purported sale, transfer, letting, subletting or division&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with retrospective consent to validate a transaction occurring during the &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; period. Senators Ross, O'Brien and Stanford drew attention to the desirability of giving power to the Land Commission to give retrospective consent to a transaction which would otherwise be rendered null and void by subsection (4) of this section.  It is possible that a transaction might take place which was carried out <i>bona fide</i> without consent of the Land Commission in ignorance of the fact that an inspection or acquisition proceeedings were pending; it might be unduly harsh if no <i>post factum</i> approval could be given it.</P>
    <P>There is a comparison to be made with subsection (3) of section 12 which does allow for retrospective approval. I think the Land Commission should be free to give retrospective consent in any case where it is reasonable to do so and I recommend the amendment accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite perturbed by the manner in which people are going to be able to ascertain, at the appropriate earliest possible opportunity, the Land Commission notice.  Virtually every sale will now have to be considered by the solicitor for the purchaser on the basis that an inspection may have taken place between the period of instructing his solicitor and the contract being signed. I think this is going to need some administrative machinery for the issue of a certificate somewhat analogous to a certificate with relation to income tax.  I am not clear as to the exact details that will be required but it is something to which the Minister should direct the attention of his officials so that the shortest possible notice of his order will be transmitted to the Land <Col N="1306" /> Registrar so that that notice will be on the folio and also that there should be the immediate issue of either a letter or some other notification from the Land Commission that no such certificate was made up to the stated date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties which may arise and to which the Deputy has referred.  There is provision under the Act whereby the Registrar of Titles will be notified and the notice will appear on the folio. Administratively, it is my view that the Registrar must be notified forthwith and that, in turn, he will notify any sub-registrar in the district registry so that the question of this notice would appear on the folio.  With requisitions of title, certainly in the congested areas and in the west, it is the practice at the moment to requisition that the Land Commission serve notice of any proceedings by them in respect of property for sale.  In addition to that usual requisition, it is my belief, and certainly my intention, that the fact that a notice has issued in respect of a holding will appear on the folio, in any event. I will, however, ensure administratively that that will be so because the point has occurred to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that it is always the practice to issue a requisition of title, not merely in the west but everywhere else, in the terms the Minister has made, I am concerned about the case in which there may be a gap of a very short time but it may be a very vital gap during which a sale is closed and the vendor may entirely <i>bona fide</i> have instructed his solicitor: &ldquo;No, there has not been any inspection.&rdquo; The Land Commission, however, might be in a position to make an order without having an inspection of the lands or without the vendor's being aware that the inspection has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When premises are put up for sale, people inspect them.  They do not put a placard on their chests, when going around: &ldquo;I am a prospective purchaser, and my name is So-and-So,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am acting as the agent for So-and-So.&rdquo; I am not quite clear how it will be possible to protect not merely the purchaser <Col N="1307" /> but for the solicitor for the purchaser to protect himself against an action for negligence if, in the three or four days that bridge the interim period, the Land Commission send notice, say, today, Wednesday, 3rd March, to the Land Registry and the sale is closed tomorrow, Thursday, 4th March.  It does not go down to the District Registrar in Galway until 5th March and it is closed tomorrow, 4th March.</P>
    <P>Even supposing, therefore, that the notices are transmitted forthwith, the position will be that there is bound to be a gap into which anybody can fall without any <i>mala fide</i> on any side. Something more will have to be imported into the normal requisition. The normal requisition, I think, is: &ldquo;Has any inspection taken place?&rdquo; There will have to be a position by which, by return of post, the Land Commission will answer the letter stating &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; before a certain named date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to visualise in practice how this could arise.  I suppose it is theoretically possible. I cannot see it arising except perhaps in a sale by private treaty that was closed in a great hurry.  Of course, the position would be that the Registrar of Titles would be prohibited, under the Act, from making a change, from accepting a deed, if a notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But the purchaser may, <i>bona fide</i>, have paid his purchase money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately the notice is served, from that date machinery will be devised or it is contemplated it will be, to have the Registrar of Titles enter a note on the folio.  I assume we can work out a way administratively to put the duty on the Registrar of Titles to notify the registrar of the county in which the land is situate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the central folio is the governing one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, I know that the practice, where there is a local registrar's office, is for solicitors to <Col N="1308" /> inspect the local folio there.  Administratively, we should have to make some arrangement that the local registrar would, in fact, be notified, as far as the service of a notice is concerned. I would imagine that, while it may theoretically be possible, just at the moment I cannot see it working out in practice but I shall look into what may be devised to provide protection against the point made that there would, in fact, be such a danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided for by registered post.  I understand that section 29 is the service section. There are rules to be made.  I think that, from a practical point of view, it will be necessary to provide for a service by registered post but where it would be practicable, it would be served in the ordinary way by an official of the Land Commission. However, it will be necessary to serve this notice by registered post to get over certain difficulties I can visualise.</P>

      <P>In subsection (5), page 10, line 20, &ldquo;and shall, as soon as may be after the expiry of the appropriate period or receipt by him of notification from the Land Commission of the termination of the proceedings referred to in this section, cancel such entries&rdquo; added after &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a small procedural point, affecting Land Registry.  In order to give land owners the assurance that the restrictions imposed by the section will not affect them for any longer time than is strictly necessary, this amendment furnishes positive instructions for the Registrar of Titles about the removal of restrictive entries on the relevant folios.</P>
      <P>This could arise, for instance, where there was a <i>bona fide</i> sale without having regard to the notice and the Land Commission agree it was a <i>bona fide</i> sale.  This is to enable the Registrar of Titles in such a case to withdraw the prohibition on the folio.</P>

      <P>This is in connection with rights of way to lakes, rivers and the sea.  The amendment is only a drafting point.

    <P>In subsection (3), lines 48 to 50, &ldquo;to define and extend or improve rights of way to and from the sea <Col N="1310" /> or to and from a lake or river&rdquo; deleted.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer Nos. 13 and 16 at the same time, as these three are inter-related.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage in the Seanad we had a most useful discussion on the wording of section 20 and in particular on the question whether the opening two lines of subsection (3) which turn on the phrase &ldquo;rights of way&rdquo; were sufficiently clear to control subsection (2), which deals with rights to park vehicles and to beach, moor and anchor boats.  It was thought that there might possibly be risk of conflict between the term &ldquo;rights of way&rdquo; which normally connotes movement and the other rights, to park and to beach, etc, which have a static concept.</P>
    <P>On further examination by the draftsman, it was considered that it would be better to delete the words mentioned in those three amendments, for the purpose of avoiding a possible conflict in interpretation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Land Commission's powers in relation to rights of ways in general?  Have they power to acquire a right of way for a holding that may not be entirely landlocked but where the ordinary method of access is extremely awkward, perhaps because of flooding or something like that, and where the Land Commission have no intention of taking any other action in relation to the land concerned other than this one single right of way?  I am concerned with the case where only one landowner is involved. I appreciate that if there is a number, the Land Commission have that power, but in regard to the case where only one owner is so landlocked, there seems to be very great reluctance on the part of the Land Commission even to look at the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission take the view, which I suppose is understandable in one way, that the man must have been able to get in and out of the holding over the years.  On the other hand, rivers change. What might have been a comparatively easy method of passage may have entirely changed.  Neighbours change <Col N="1311" /> and there may have been no specific right to get in on the other side of the holding.  The friendly relations may have existed but may have changed, unfortunately, and the holder concerned, in consequence of that situation, finds he has to utilise a former right of way which is virtually impossible to use in certain circumstances. In my experience, the Land Commission are not very interested where only one holder is concerned.  Have they in fact power to deal with such a case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers, as I have explained, up to now were rather limited but part of the provisions of this Bill confer the very widest powers on them in this regard.  In the first case posed by the Deputy, as I am sure he is aware, if there is a landlocked holding or field, under common law there would be an easement of necessity between the dominant and servient tenements, if that were the position.  As far as the Land Commission are concerned, their powers were limited to dealing with rights of way on lands purchased under the Land Acts.  Even then they were rather restricted as set out in section 39 (2) of the 1931 Act which states:</P>
      <P>The powers of the Land Commission to expend money on the improvement of land sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Purchase Acts shall, in addition to the matters mentioned in section 43 of the Land Act, 1923, include power to confer on the Land Commission and their licensees and to define and extend or improve ways and rights of way over any land to any land sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Purchase Acts, whether such rights of way are or are not so conferred as to be appurtenant to any Land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, I understand, has been interpreted to mean, certainly by the Land Commission and others, that they could only deal with a right of way created first, on land purchased under the Land Acts or with the aid of advances under those Acts, and secondly, that the right of way could only cross or join such land.  In other words, if there were a piece of land intervening that was held in absolute fee simple or under fee <Col N="1312" /> farm grant or squatter's title or otherwise, the Land Commission could not cross that or deal with the situation under existing law.</P>
    <P>Power is being taken in these sections which we are amending so that the Land Commission can create or extend or improve or acquire land for the purpose of doing any of these things to give a right of way anywhere over any type of land, held under any tenure or to extend a right of way where they were restricted under the former law, from land purchased under the Land Acts or lands held in absolute fee simple or under whatever title, to other lands irrespective of title to them.  So, just as the prohibition about sub-division applied to about 80 per cent of land purchased under the Land Acts, that control is now being taken over all the lands.  In the same way power is being taken here in respect of title to the land and the Land Commission will have the right to create or extend or enlarge rights of way.  In this regard, where they take land for that purpose, they must compensate the owner.</P>
    <P>We have also in mind the many representations made to me either during the discussions here or in my Department that many of the old rights of way are not now suitable in this day and age and are incapable of accommodating modern machinery such as tractors and it is mainly for that purpose that these powers are taken.</P>
    <P>The short answer to the other point made by the Deputy as to whether the Land Commission have power to deal with the case where only one owner is concerned is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  I have no doubt that before this, possibly, the Land Commission were slow to do so because there were doubts about their powers but the answer is that they can in a suitable case exercise these rights to alleviate the position of a single owner and give proper access to his farm.  No doubt when they have received the wider powers provided under these sections, they will be able to deal with many more of these cases.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that where you have, perhaps, two good neighbours, one prepared to pay and the other prepared to accept, then the Land Commission would not be required at all because the two people would work out their own problem between themselves.  Under this section it is where the Land Commission must exercise compulsory powers for the purpose of creating the right of way and that presupposes the objection of the owner in some form or other to the right of way going over his land. In a number of cases I can visualise the reaction of the owner over whose land the right of way has to run, whatever his reluctance might be if he is paid for the land taken from him and if the land is going to be fenced and his holding left intact after the right of way is made, if the Land Commission say: &ldquo;We are going to take over this land, leave it open and unfenced without any compensation&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision here which I did not read&mdash;subsection (3) of section 39 of the 1931 Act:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Where the Land Commission confers and defines a right of way <Col N="1315" /> or a right of access, whether under this section or under any other provision of the Land Purchase Acts, the Land Commission shall have power to enter on the land over which such right of way or access is so conferred and there to repair or construct a road or pass and erect fences and gates and for those purposes to take all or any necessary materials from or out of such land and to provide for the compensation paid by the Land Commission for such right of way or right of access being repaid to the Land Commission by the person for whose benefit such right was conferred.</P>
    <P>They would have power under that section to go in on my land for the benefit of my neighbour and create a right of way there, provided my neighbour was prepared to pay or contribute towards part of the cost of the facility being provided for him.  I do not say in all cases but in some cases, that is a fair proposition, that the man who is getting the benefit should at least contribute something towards the cost of it because in most of these right of way cases it would not be so much the cost of the land involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with another aspect of the new power to create rights of way to the sea and to lakes and rivers.  As it left the Dáil, the Bill included a prohibition against the creation of such rights over land adjoining an existing occupied dwelling-house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Seanad discussion, some Senators felt that the word &ldquo;adjoining&rdquo; in subsection (3) would be given a narrow legal interpretation, barely protecting a few yards around the dwelling-house.  Others felt that the opposite may be the case and that it may be liberally interpreted to include, say, the whole of a very large field, thus being unduly restrictive against the public and the Land Commission.  Senators Quinlan and <Col N="1317" /> McDonald originally proposed the writing in of a definite distance&mdash;100 yards.  After a full debate, it was agreed by the Seanad that it would be best to delete the word &ldquo;adjoining&rdquo; and substitute a definite limit of 50 yards.</P>
    <P>This was acceptable to me as being a reasonable definition to put in here and I accordingly put in an amendment to that effect and this is the amendment I am recommending to the House. Amendments Nos. 18 and 20 follow in principle on this.</P>

      <P>Where the section affords protection from nuisance to an occupied dwelling, it had been my view that this protection should only be extended to pre-existing houses; my idea was and is that a man might try to forestall the creation of a car-park or the like by rushing the erection of a cheap dwelling or chalet near the proposed site.  Accordingly the Bill says that the dwelling must be at least a year old at the vital time.</P>
      <P>I was pressed rather hard to remove this condition but the furthest I could go was to reduce the period to six months to which the Seanad have agreed.</P>

      <P>I am still perturbed about this section.  While the amendment which the Seanad has introduced does improve the situation somewhat, I still do not understand the case where in the family company the property is held by the father and mother before settlement, with remainder to the children, to the son.  As far as I can see from this section, the son must go and live with his father and mother to protect the home, even though perhaps, as we all know often happens, the daughterin-law may not entirely agree with the mother-in-law.  It seems to me that that type of case is caught by this section in a way that it should not be caught.  As long as the persons properly entitled to the income for life are there, it should be enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear both in the Seanad and here that this section has been designed to get after specific types of cases that are met with in practice, and that it was essential to get a definition of what we would call a residential holding.  With all the devices that are available under company law, the section had to be drafted as it was to get after the type of land we have in mind.  There is the large farm which under a company or some businessman or group of businessmen is carried on as a hobby, by people who do not live on the land and have no intention of doing so.  What the section does in such a case is to make that land vulnerable before other lands for acquisition for the relief of congestion.  That power was accepted both in the Seanad and in the Dáil as being reasonable.  The section does not mean that in every case of a family company the Land Commission go after the land.  Such is not the case; such has not been the case; and such will not be the case in the future.  Every Deputy knows that the kind of land the Land Commission go after, generally speaking, is land with a long history of bad user; generally it is outside the congested areas.  This section is designed to make vulnerable the type of large holding that is non-residential <Col N="1321" /> in the common acceptance of that expression.</P>
      <P>It was necessary for our purposes to define that type of land as being land on which the owner was not living or within a distance of three miles of it.  In order to provide in law against known practised evasions in this field, we had to define this section in order to make such lands vulnerable. The section as drafted now is also necessary to deal with another aspect of land we thought it desirable to get after&mdash;land in the congested areas that has been let and is non-residential, again in the common sense of that term.  In a number of these cases, the owners have gone for many years but they have close relations living in the vicinity of the land, possibly in the same parish, and if we did not have this three-mile qualification, a member of the family abroad would be able to transfer to another member of the family or to a member of another family living not so far away from these lands.  Again, to make these lands vulnerable it was necessary to draft this section.</P>
      <P>Deputies must assume, as, indeed, it is admitted on all sides of the House, that the Land Commission will act as reasonably in the future as they have acted in the past.  I pointed out that there has been power since 1923 for the Land Commission, if they so desire, to repossess any holding which was subdivided or sublet for a period of 12 months.  They did not do that.  They could take it over and sell it out. Irrespective of the user of the land, they could walk in on a landowner who had no other way of living where there was congestion in the immediate vicinity and take over his land.  In practice, they have not done that.  With the exception of one instance of which I know, I am not aware of any case where the Land Commission interfered with the ordinary working farmer in a congested district.  The House must assume that no such thing would happen in the case posed by Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Invariably the Land Commission get after the badly-run lands, lands with a <Col N="1322" /> history of bad user over a long period, lands which have been let or have been non-residential for a long period.  It has been the experience of practitioners in the Land Court that wherever there is an objection to Land Commission acquisition and, as part of the objection, the objector gives even a half-hearted promise that he is prepared to mend his ways, the Land Commission lean over backwards to facilitate him. In fact there have been many complaints about the Land Court adjourning cases for two or three years to enable these people to come back. Many of them do not live up to their undertakings.</P>
    <P>I am pointing to this because it is accepted procedure in the Land Commission that anywhere they think there is any hope at all of the owner taking up residence, they give him every opportunity of doing so, if he is prepared to do so.  The House should not assume that the practice of the Land Commission would be interfered with here.  The Land Commission would be quite happy to see these lands put into full production by these people if the people were prepared to come back and use them.  All the section does is make these lands vulnerable before the Land Commission would be forced to proceed for the acquisition of further land in the area.</P>

      <P>Nobody is interested in defending the faked case.  It does not deserve sympathy.  What worries me is that there is no means under this section by which the Lay Commissioners can act, if they are absolutely satisfied that the case being made by the objector is a genuine case of a father and mother living there and the son having some interest in the family company but not wanting to live in the house while the father and mother are there.</P>

    <P>Throughout the earlier stages of this non-nationals section, when considering the question of who will make the decision on the actual application for consent, I have thought of this as the sort of important function crucially affecting private interests which should be exercised by the Lay Commissioners. <Col N="1324" /> The section has been discussed on this basis.  I thought it better to have this matter made clearer, to spell it out in actual words as an excepted matter.  The Seanad entirely agreed with this view.

      <P>This again is a drafting amendment. My attention was drawn to a High Court decision given in 1923 in <i>Marry v. Drew, 23 Irish Reports.</i> Because of that judgement, there is a risk that the phrase &ldquo;legal personal representative, as such&rdquo; may be given a narrower meaning than is intended.  Unless the alternative wording agreed by the Seanad is substituted, the position could be that the exemption from control conferred by clause (ii) of paragraph (b) of subsection (2) on page 22 would apply only to the personal representative in the case of a lease or tenancy but would not apply in a case of realty or registered land.  In relation to section 45, a technical distinction like this would be senseless and the amendment will make it quite clear that the exemption will apply to all legal personal representatives.</P>

Can the Minister say if it is proposed, after the company is acquired, to retain the old name of British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited or the initials B. &amp; I.?</P>
      <P>In connection with freight rates, is it proposed to have a tribunal or body to which complaints in respect of freight rates may be made and investigated or will freight rates be subject to review under the Prices Act or by an <i>ad hoc</i> body appointed either by the Minister for Transport and Power or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Prices Act, or will the freight rates be subject to review from time to time?</P>
      <P>Is it proposed that the company, when acquired, will engage in the car ferry service?  If it engages in that operation, will it have the right to load and unload cars at the proposed new terminal at Dún Laoghaire?  Will the rights there be restricted entirely to British Railways and, if it is proposed to restrict rights to that service to Dún Laoghaire, will any review be made of the charges?

      <P>In reply to Deputy Tully, the new Board will only enter on their activities some time in April. The B. &amp; I. have actually made some improvements for second-class passengers using the service before the present season.  If there are any minor improvements which it is possible to effectuate in time for the season, I am quite sure the Board will attend to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate time would be required for major improvements.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Cosgrave, the name will continue to be the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited and will be known, I hope, by the public as the B. &amp; I., the name by which it has been known in the past. The name is well known to tourists who come here and there will be no change in the name for the time being at any rate.  Any change of name would be a matter of long-term policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a tribunal to examine freight rates does not arise on this Bill at all.  The actual fact is that the B. &amp; I. will have to carry out their operations on a commercial basis.  The idea that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would conduct a rate review seems to me to go beyond reality. The B. &amp; I. rates will naturally be private because they are in competition with British Railways.  British Railways have been making improvements recently in their shipping services, both for passengers and freight.  Therefore, any changes made in the B. &amp; I. rates <Col N="1329" /> will have to be private.  They cannot be disclosed to the House.</P>
    <P>However, it will be my duty as Minister in charge of the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company to make inquiries of the Board as to their progress, to make inquiries in regard to how far they are able to offer attractive freights to exporters on a package deal basis, and to examine the productivity of the company in relation to their costs and revenue.  I shall give a general statement to the House on the occasion of the Estimate in exactly the same way as I do in connection with other State companies.  For example, in the case of CIE I gave a mass of information to the House on the general profitability of CIE in its different sectors.  Equally, I have been able to tell the House how far I regard the air companies as being efficient bodies.  I have given information to show that the costs per ton mile of Aer Lingus, whether freight-carrying or passenger-carrying, I regard as being competitive with other air lines.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there is a difference between the B. &amp; I. and CIE in that CIE are the only company engaged in internal transport services in this country.  I have been able to give more information about the profitability of various sectors &mdash; for example, the number of bus services in Dublin running on a profitable basis &mdash; than I could in connection with the B. &amp; I., which would be in competition with a considerable number of services, specialised container services, general cargo services of all types and with the various services operated by British Railways.  For that reason, anything in the nature of a tribunal to examine rates would make it impossible for the B. &amp; I. to do their work as effectively as they should.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, there has been a change in the pattern of cross-Channel traffic with the advent of containers.  The character of the traffic has shown revolutionary changes in the past three or four years.  Any company engaged in carrying goods across the Irish Sea has to adjust its rates to ensure it can make adequate profit on the goods that will bear those rates, at the same <Col N="1330" /> time doing its utmost to provide the most reasonable rates possible because transport costs are of great importance. Therefore, it is a kind of mixed picture of varying rates on varying types of commodities.  All that has to be examined by the B. &amp; I.  They are obliged to operate on a commercial basis.  I hope they will be able to pay a dividend on the shares which will relate in some degree to the rates at which the Minister for Finance has to borrow in order to secure capital. That is all I can say about it.  It would be quite impossible to have a detailed investigation into individual rates as it would destroy the possibility of the B. &amp; I. being run as a commercial proposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I forgot to mention that.  The B. &amp; I. will naturally examine the whole question of transporting cars across the Irish Sea.  At the moment, in the height of the season large numbers of cars are brought on the <i>Munster</i> and the <i>Leinster</i> and on two additional cargo vessels which are chartered for that purpose.  The question of whether they can improve that service will arise for consideration by the new Board.  There would be no point in considering Dún Laoghaire harbour because the terminal at Holyhead is owned by British Railways, and you would hardly expect them to allow any other company to use it.  Therefore, the only other alternative route from Dún Laoghaire would be to Liverpool, and that would not be a practical proposition.  In fact, the potential for car traffic lies within the ports of either Preston or Liverpool, where people coming from the northern parts of England will bring their cars. I do not think, therefore, that the question arises at all of the use of Dún Laoghaire.</P>

The B. &amp; I. have their own routes to develop.  There is an enormous hinterland of population adjacent to Liverpool, all the towns of northern England.  They should concentrate on developing this traffic.  It would be very unwise of them to enter into competition with British Railways.  Even if the Board of Works agreed to allow them use the two harbours, I think it would be most unwise for them to engage in that kind of venture.</P>

      <P>The Minister reserves the right to dispose of the shares.  Does this mean that the Minister, without reference to the House, can dispose of the shares?  Is this not a new procedure?

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a further investigation, following the observations made by Deputy Corish.  The Minister for Finance claims he must have the right to dispose of these shares.  The provision is common to the other State concerns registered under the Companies Act, but, in actual fact, sections 8, 9 and 10 provide for the appointment by me of the directors, the chairman and the managing director of the B. &amp; I., with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 14 provides that the articles of association of the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company must be consistent with the terms of this Bill. The Minister for Finance could not <Col N="1332" /> dispose of the shares to a private outside company because the Act determines that the directors of the board must be appointed by the Minister for Transport and Power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and it is inconceivable that the Minister for Finance would sell the shares to another company whose board was appointed by me with his consent. Therefore, we cannot sell to a private company without having an amendment to this Act.</P>

      <P>They meant a great deal and the Deputy never referred to them.  He has not taken my speech paragraph by paragraph and questioned me on their import.  He has never even had the politeness to deal with my three lengthy statements paragraph by paragraph, even to indicate that they are inadequate.  He <Col N="1333" /> merely gets up and makes complaints. On the occasion of my next Estimate, might I ask the Deputy to go back and read the speeches and I shall be delighted to make comments on each paragraph in relation to my powers as Minister in charge of a number of State companies?  I shall be delighted to argue with the Deputy on the basis of these statements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has pointed out to me that I should have read his explanation paragraph by paragraph.  His explanation appeared to be all right but it was not an answer to the questions I had put down regarding State companies.  I still consider we are entitled, and we will be entitled in the future, as representatives of the people, to ask questions about this new State company.  If, for argument's sake, this State company started to advertise in the manner in which they have been advertising up to now, would we have any right to come in here and ask questions, and would the Minister co-operate and say: &ldquo;I shall have inquiries made as to how and why this is done&rdquo;?  These are things that should be answered now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress last night, I referred to the fact that there are still people in this country who seem to think that if a young fellow gets into trouble, the proper thing to do is recommend him to join the Army; at least a few weeks ago I saw such a comment by somebody who should have known better.  I was interrupted by the Minister who pointed out that those people were not accepted in the Army.  I am well aware they are not accepted and it is an excellent thing they are not.  But, if somebody in a responsible position makes a comment that a person who has been up for breaking the law should join the Army, it gives the impression that the Army will accept people of that type.  I want to make it clear that as far as this House is concerned the expressed opinion is that the Army are doing the proper thing in refusing to accept any except people of good character.  That is the system at the present time and that system should be continued, and should be made clear to everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy MacEoin and myself to the people who served both in the Congo and in Cyprus and there is one point I should like to draw to the Minister's attention.  Perhaps he is unaware of it.  When many of these people return to this country, they have reached the stage at which they can retire and they leave the Army.  I am reliably informed that quite a number of people have found it impossible to obtain civilian employment. Some of them I know of were in very bad straits and usually such people finish up in England, perhaps join the British Army, and are lost to <Col N="1336" /> this country.  That is a shocking state of affairs.</P>
    <P>When people who have given such excellent service to the Army leave the Army, every effort should be made to find employment for them.  I know of one person who tramped around from barracks to barracks trying to get an ordinary labouring job with the Board of Works, and although he was a fine young man capable of doing a good day's work, he could not get a job. Although there were vacancies, there was no vacancy for him.  It is too bad that that situation should be allowed to continue.  We have a further responsibility to these men after they leave the Army.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Army and the question of recruitment come under review on this Estimate.  The matter, to my mind, is not being faced up to in the way it should be.  For instance, the figures for the Army strength last year were 11,666 all ranks but the Minister has not told us what the strength of the regular Army is today. He knows that the strength is very much below that figure and a significant thing was that we got the figures of what this strength would be, if at full strength, and what the cost would be, but as soon as we came to deal with the actual cost, the figures for the strength of the Army were dropped.  Obviously there was some reason for that and the Minister should come straight out and tell us the position.  We would all like to give him every possible assistance to bring the Army up to strength but there are half a dozen different reasons which caused the Army to reach its present level.</P>
    <P>One of the chief reasons is the question of pay.  It cannot be stressed too much that it is unreasonable to expect young men to embark on a career in the Army when they know the rate of pay they will receive will be very much lower than what they could earn even as labourers in civilian employment. It is also unreasonable to imagine that those who have been serving for a number of years&mdash;and some of them have been a very long time in the Army&mdash;should continue to be content with a rate of pay which does not make <Col N="1337" /> them even second-class citizens, because they cannot compete with their civilian counterparts when they leave the Army.</P>
    <P>The Minister may consider that those are harsh words but I have a keen interest in the Defence Forces in which there are many of my former comrades and I do not believe that they are getting a fair deal.  It is all right for the Minister to say that they got the ninth round but so did everybody else.  One thing which was wrong with the ninth round was that the man with low wages, on a percentage increase, received very little compared with somebody very much higher up, on the same percentage.</P>
    <P>One thing which happened last year, and the Minister must be aware of it, was that for some extraordinary reason a rumour was started about last November to the effect that there was a further increase for soldiers about to take place.  Every soldier I met, no matter of what rank, was under the impression that that increase was coming.  Some of them are even foolish enough to believe that it is still coming and that they will get it with retrospective effect.  I do not know who started the rumour but it was a rotten, shabby trick to play and it has resulted in grave discontent among the ranks. They feel they were prevented from getting something to which they were entitled.  If they are to get an increase, give it to them; if not, do not let us start the rumour high enough to make them believe it is the truth.</P>
    <P>One thing which a man in a job likes to look forward to is a pension scheme. Civil servants, local authority employees and employees in civilian jobs are well covered in that regard and are treated decently when they retire.  That is not so, however, in the Army.  To begin with, a man must complete 21 years service before he is entitled to a pension.  The pension he then gets is only a small pension.  If he is an officer, he is all right: certain types can get a gratuity which will enable them to get a start in life but the soldier who has spent from 21 years upwards, whether as an NCO or private, will get only a small pension but no gratuity when he leaves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> The Minister can say that he gets the 90 days to which he is entitled on leaving the Army but often he does not get that.  If he is fortunate enough to find employment in the State, he does not get any predischarge leave or gets it only until he takes up employment. If the soldier who is going out looks for employment, he does not get his insurance card until the 90 days predischarge leave is up.  In effect, he is looking for a job for 90 days and if he is fortunate enough to get it, he draws his insurance card and the State feels it has no further responsibility.</P>
    <P>The private gets a very small pension but if we come up as high as a company quartermaster sergeant who has, say, 21 years service, then his basic pension is £2.17.9. a week.  The contributory old age pensioner gets almost that now.  Is there any use talking about treating people fairly when you have this sort of thing going on?  If the man is going to stay on after 21 years, his commanding officer must OK him.  He may be as satisfactory as could be but if the commanding officer does not OK him, for one reason or another, out he goes.  If the commanding officer decides to OK his employment in the Army for a further two years, then he gets one shilling per year of service.  After two years service he gets a further shilling per year of service up to a maximum of ten years, which adds to his £2.17.9d. another 10/-.  Glory be to God, if he is a married man, the Army certainly looks after him.  He gets a married pension of 18/11d per week.</P>
    <P>With whom do the Army authorities or the Department of Defence think they are dealing?  Those men have given responsible service, there is no doubt about that.  I have deliberately chosen this particular rank because there are, I understand, 120 of them employed on FCA training at the present time.  They are responsible not alone for a tremendous amount of gear belonging to the Army and the FCA but they are also responsible for the safekeeping of this property.  How are they treated when they leave the Army?  They get this money, £2.17.9d. plus 10/-, if they are a further ten years over 21 years there.  If they are married <Col N="1339" /> they get 18/11 extra, a total of £4 6s. 8d. pension.</P>
    <P>Some of those people joined the Army at the beginning and have had over 40 years service.  When they are retiring, this is what they get.  There is no point in saying they can get another job because one of the most frustrating things for any ex-soldier is his inability, if he has been over 20 years in the Army, no matter what his age is, to find suitable civilian employment. The young fellow who does a few years may have some chance but the man who has stayed 21 years not alone cannot get suitable employment but cannot get any employment unless he is very lucky and gets somebody to pull strings for him.  The belief is, because he has spent over 20 years in the Army, he would not know how to do anything else.  He is just paid off by the Army with a few shillings, and pence for the children.  There is no point in the Minister saying those are regulations which have been laid down and we are carrying them out.  If the Minister were big enough to acknowledge that this is wrong and that something should be done about it, he would get the support of every Deputy.</P>
    <P>The State in order to help soldiers with long service should give them a start by granting them a gratuity.  It would not break the country.  It would not break the Vote of over £10 million for the Department of Defence to give them a gratuity of £400-£500.  When such schemes are suggested, the Government's attitude is to ask where the money is to come from and whether the Opposition can say where it can be found.  I should like to remind the Minister that before the last war the Army estimate was very small.  Overnight, when war was declared, there was absolutely no difficulty at all in finding the tremendous finance required. Nobody objected because it was needed.  I suggest it is needed now and if the Department of Defence are really serious about the Army, they must give them more than they are getting.  As serving soldiers, they should be treated decently when they are leaving the Army.  It would be an encouragement <Col N="1340" /> for young men who have an inclination to join the Defence Forces, if they knew they would be treated properly both in the Army and when they were leaving it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things I should like to refer to in connection with the Army.  In the Minister's speech on the Estimate less than one page was devoted to the Army.  I was rather surprised.  It made me wonder why.  Perhaps, the Minister deliberately spoke about other things in his opening address but most certainly he was very sparing in his reference to the regular Army.  We have got, according to the Minister, quite a substantial number of people in the FCA.  I do not think the Minister is right there.  While there are a number of dedicated people in the FCA who are doing everything they possibly can to keep the work going, I believe the attraction for the youth to join the force is waning.  That should not be so.  I believe the main reason is the way the FCA are being treated.  The whole approach is wrong.  A very definite effort should be made to improve the position.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the uniforms.  The Army uniform was improved last year but if I had any say in regard to the selection of the uniform, I would not have selected either the type or the cut of material used in the Army or FCA uniform.  The FCA uniform is baggy.  Everybody knows the young people in this country&mdash;leaving out the teddy boys&mdash;take pride in their attire. It is certainly no attraction to them to have to wear the type of uniform supplied to the FCA and the Army and be required to walk through the cities and towns of this country.</P>
    <P>Apropos dress, I understand that an order was issued recently.  It is the most ridiculous one I ever heard. Everybody admits the present walking out dress of the Irish Army officer is a very smart one.  It looks well and if they go to the trouble of dressing properly, it is very impressive.  I understand that a direction was recently issued requiring officers attending civilian functions to wear full dress uniform.  The full ceremonial Irish <Col N="1341" /> Army attire for officers is a blue uniform with red stripes.  It is a shocking thing to suggest that this should be done and I would ask the Minister to make inquiries and find out if that is so.  If it is so, somebody has made a bad mistake and it should be rectified. We know what will happen now.  Officers will go in mufti and we will no longer see our smart looking officers.</P>
    <P>The question of Civil Defence was mentioned.  I do not know whether the Minister is serious or not but he has given 17,000 as being the present strength of the Civil Defence service. Does he believe that is correct?  I do not.  I have travelled a lot around this country and let me be quite frank about this.  The only people I see interested in Civil Defence are the officials of local authorities.  The main reason they are in it is that they are told they should be.  If there are 17,000 people in Civil Defence in this country, perhaps the Minister will break down the figures and tell us how many there are in each county.  I know how many there are in my own county and how many there are in the neighbouring counties.  I would be very interested to know how the 17,000 are made up. I believe it is just, as it was described last year, a bad joke on the people of this country if they are given the impression they are there.  I believe the place to talk about this matter is on the floor of the House.  If the Minister is able to tell me that there are 17,000 active people in Civil Defence, I shall be the most delighted person in the House, but I am afraid he will not be able to do that.</P>
    <P>As far as the Red Cross is concerned, they have, over the years, been doing quite a decent job.  I will not refer to the political affiliations of the Red Cross, but there is one comment which has been made again and again. It has been said that if something happens anywhere in the world, the Irish Red Cross immediately step into the breach, but that they do not seem to be so anxious to do something when a minor disaster happens in this country. Maybe that is not so; maybe they do step in&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but that comment has been made both by individuals <Col N="1342" /> and in the public press.  Perhaps the Minister can point to the activities of the Red Cross in cases of severe hardship.  I should be glad to hear him.  I know that a number of voluntary organisations have been doing excellent work.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the training of Aer Lingus pilots in Gormanston. That is an excellent idea, but someone has to look after those pilots, and the situation is that a few men are on fatigues continuously waiting on those pilots and looking after them as if they were royalty.  They are doing that work without getting an extra penny as recompense.  I do not think men who join the Army to defend their country, if necessary, should be asked to act as batmen to a group of civilians.  The Minister should make other arrangements, or those people should be paid for doing the work. Civilians could be brought in to do it. That type of fatigues can develop into something very like slavery.  It is a situation that should not be allowed to continue.  It leaves a bad odour.  I am bringing it to the Minister's attention and I hope he will take the necessary steps to see that it is discontinued as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Another item that merits comment is that men over a certain age cannot get promotion.  I know quite a number of men who would make excellent NCOs but who, because they were a few months over the age, were told: &ldquo;We know you are the right person but you cannot get promotion.&rdquo;  In fact they were acting as unpaid NCOs. This question of sticking strictly to the letter of the regulations is overdone in the Army.  The Minister relaxed a number of annoying regulations when he took office and made Army life much more bearable, but there are still some things that could be changed.  If the regulations are there, they will be adhered to by those in authority.  I know one man who was a couple of days over the age and could not get promotion.  That is all cod, and I would ask the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The same thing occurs in the case of men who want to rejoin.  I brought <Col N="1343" /> to the Minister's notice the case of a sergeant who had long service.  He was a marksman and an instructor in various types of weapons.  He left the Army and then applied for readmission. It was found that he was one month over age and his application was held up for a couple of months, until it could be said he was a few months over the age.  He was refused permission to rejoin the Army at a time when the Army were finding it impossible to get recruits.  This is not the Minister's fault, but the fault of all the red tape and the green tape.  In his own interest, the Minister should wipe out a lot of that sort of thing.  If he does, he will be doing a good job, and he will be remembered with pleasure by members of the Defence Forces long after he has left his present office.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the housing of soldiers and to the fact that a number of local authorities will not house soldiers or ex-soldiers.  I am glad to be a member of a local authority that will house either or both according to their living conditions. It does not matter if they are serving soldiers, ex-soldiers or civilians, if their housing conditions warrant it, they are rehoused.  That is as it should be, but that is not the end of the story.  The Minister should continue with the experiment which he referred to of building houses for members of the Defence Forces in the areas in which their permanent barracks are situated.</P>
    <P>I live beside Gormanston Camp and I know a number of young married men whose wives live in County Dublin while they live in the camp or somewhere else in the county and they cannot get housing accommodation from the Meath local authority because they have no temporary accommodation in County Meath.  I believe the onus is on the Minister to ensure that houses are made available for such people.  He could build houses in such places as Drogheda, Laytown or Bettystown, where sites could be made available.</P>
    <P>The special allowances were referred to also.  The Minister tended <Col N="1344" /> to take pride in the fact that there has been an increase of £4.  He said that the average was £20 per year.  If the average is £20 per year and some people can get as much as £140 per year, the minimum must be terribly small.  I do not think it right that men who have to prove that they gave service to the country when they were required, should be offered a sum like £20 a year or 8/- a week.  The Minister should appreciate that people who apply for special allowances are in a certain class.  They are in the class of people who feel they require some assistance or they would not demean themselves by asking the State for something.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy but I do not want him to base his remarks on £20.  The average is £75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference to the average of £20 being increased by £4.  It is in the debate and I shall get it before I finish.  However, the Minister says it is £75 and that does not make much difference because if the maximum is £140 the minimum must be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect which the Minister should remember.  I know an instance of a man who applied for and was given a special allowance.  He had reared a big family.  He was ill and was on social welfare benefit&mdash;as a matter of fact, he was at death's door a few months ago.  He had some money invested when he applied for the special allowance.  Since then, someone went around snooping and it was found that he had more money invested than was originally thought.  It was not enough that his allowance was discontinued and that he had to pay back the amount he had received but in addition, he was taken to court so that everyone would know that according to the State he was dishonest.  I am quite sure that if instead of being released at the end of the Tan War, he had been executed and brought back to Ireland only a few days ago, he would have been given a State funeral.  That man did everything he was asked to do at that time and the thanks he got from the State was to be taken to court so <Col N="1345" /> that everyone would know he did not mention a few pounds he had in the bank, and got a few pounds to which he was not entitled, and therefore he must suffer the consequences.  I am not condoning dishonesty in either this or any other case but when dealing with people who, years ago, gave good service to the State, they should be dealt with with the gloved hand rather than the mailed fist.  The mailed fist was used wrongly in this case.</P>
    <P>The helicopter service has made an excellent effort to justify its existence. For a long time, Deputies had been asking the Minister to do something in that direction and we feel now that the service, as at present constituted, is not enough.  When they were being purchased, the Minister said that three were being bought because they would require a nest of three to service one. We have the Naval Service in the same condition for different reasons.  The Minister should now make provision for the further extension of the helicopter service, particularly in view of the fact that the fishery protection service is so inadequate.  Something should be done to improve it.</P>
    <P>The extension of the fishery limit to 12 miles has put an insurmountable burden on the helicopter service and on the Naval Service.  There is no point in trying to deal with that problem at present because it cannot be done.  The purchase of smaller and lighter boats has been suggested and while I do not know enough about these matters to be able to comment on that proposal, I do know that it should be possible to spot the trawlers which come not alone inside the 12 mile limit and the three mile limit, but into the very mouths of the rivers to catch the salmon and take them from our fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the apprentice scheme and to the fact that the trade unions now recognise the scheme for service outside.  That is an excellent thing.  The lads who are being trained there are getting a very good training, but, owing to the small amount of money they receive, the temptation is very strong for them to come outside and earn a few shillings. The result is that many of these young <Col N="1346" /> men are leaving the service and coming into civilian life.  The Minister should look at that aspect of the question.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the young fellows who join the Army and who find after a few years, perhaps because of the death of a father, that they are unable to make enough to support the family.  Usually they go on leave, do not return, and are posted as deserters. Many of them go across the water and when they come back, are courtmartialled. When cases of this kind are published, the reasons usually given in excuse are financial ones.  I hold no brief for deserters but perhaps the Minister would consider putting some type of limitation on this offence after which these people would not be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong in the idea that if a man leaves the Army because of the human factor, if he goes away and makes a good living for himself&mdash;and I know some who have built up a good business and have families to look after&mdash;and if he wants to make his peace with the Army, he must come back and go through the ordeal of being courtmartialled.  These people are still members of the Army although they are unwilling soldiers. Such people are bad soldiers and of no use to the Army.  Perhaps the substitution of a fine for the courtmartial would be a better way of dealing with the matter.  The Minister would have more experience of this matter than I but I know that quite a number of people have written to the Minister about it.  The reply has always been that they should return and surrender themselves to their unit, after which their cases will be considered.  That sort of case should be dealt with in a different way and the Minister is the man who can do that.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the information that two boats have now to be bought because of the erection of a bridge.  A large sum of money is being laid out on them.  Surely there should be some other way out of this problem?  If we have to spend £66,000, because a bridge was built in Cork, to service Spike Island, I think it is stretching <Col N="1347" /> the thing too far.  That is quite a substantial sum of money which could be applied in other ways to assist the Army.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister to look into the matter of our overseas commitments.  No country in the world, big or little, can claim that we have not done our share, and more than our share.  I know there are many young men who are looking forward to a trip overseas, firstly, because of the extra money and also because they want to see the world, but despite that we have done our share.  It looks now as if we will have to pay extra ourselves because, quite rightly, the Government do not wish to accept the voluntary contribution and it is time the whole question of sending further troops overseas should be considered.</P>
    <P>The whole question of service in the Army is bedevilled by the fact that there is so much killing boredom. Serving soldiers tell me there is so little to do: a certain amount of fatigues, a certain amount of drill, very little sport and no other activities. Would the Minister consider doing something to enliven Army life?  During the Emergency a number of people in my battalion were inclined to become very bad soldiers because of boredom but when there was a chance of active service, these men immediately took an interest in their work and became fellows on whom you could depend to do their share. I suggest that there should be some scheme which will give an interest in their life to the present serving soldiers.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, over the past few years, particularly, that the number of Army teams taking part in local sports is getting fewer and fewer.  Has the idea that the Army should be engaged in various types of sports as a recreation died down?  Where once we had hurling, football, soccer and rugby teams all over the place in Army units, we do not seem to have them competing with civilians any longer.  The Minister might take an interest in that.</P>
    <P>I believe that the first thing we must <Col N="1348" /> do is to try to make the soldier contented with his lot.  After pay and conditions, which means the way he is treated in the unit, I think sport should come next.  It is one of the things which the Minister could very well advert to and advertise.  If he does that, he might find it far easier to get the recruits he needs so much.</P>
    <P>I shall not refer at all to the Naval Service because I believe that the approach to that, also, is out of date and that if we wait a little bit longer, it will deal with itself by going out of existence.  I believe we must, however, see to it that the Army is kept up to date with weapons and with the type of training they get.  That can be done only if there is a greater interest in the personnel engaged in the Army and if we just do not have people clocking in at 8.30 a.m., attending parade at 9 a.m., fatigues until lunch, then parade at 2 p.m. and at 4.30 p.m. they are gone, and that is the end of it.  That is not my idea of having an up-to-date Army and I am sure the Minister will agree with me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much agree with the concluding part of Deputy Tully's remarks.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not pay more attention to the Army in introducing his Estimate for the Department of Defence.  It appears to me to be a chronic mistake, which is always being made, to regard the Army as just one part of the Department of Defence.  The only significance of the Department of Defence is as the administrative organ for looking after the Army but the Army is the essential part.  Far too often, we get tangled up in the Department of Defence. There is no excuse for having a Department of Defence at all except in so far as we have an Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again, I should like to express my great disappointment that we have had no statement of general Army policy.  An excuse is made from time to time that it would not be in the public interest for us to disclose State secrets but, when the whole question of Army policy is discussed in Washington, Westminster, Paris, Bonn and everywhere else without anybody <Col N="1349" /> feeling that something frightfully secret is being discussed, I do not think we need be so shy about it.</P>
    <P>I have never yet heard a statement of general Army policy.  First of all, is the Army really a defence force and, if so, what in the name of all that is wonderful is it defending us against or against whom are we being defended? I believe that the thinking is still that, at some period in the future, there may yet be a danger of an airborne or a seaborne invasion.</P>
    <P>There is always a tendency amongst military people to fight the last war over again.  In this case, I think military thinking appears to be in the context of the last war but one.  I may be completely mistaken&mdash;I sincerely hope I am&mdash;but I am afraid I am not. I am afraid we are still regarding the Army as a sort of defence force against an unknown and unnamed enemy who may come in and try to invade us.  I firmly believe we must get this idea right out of our heads.</P>
    <P>We have no tactical or strategic importance at all as an island now.  We used to have.  We were the back door of Great Britain.  No invader of Great Britain would ever feel that a foothold on Irish soil was necessary any more because an attack against Great Britain would now be made almost exclusively by intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Nobody will suggest that it will be an enormous Russian horde out of a fleet of submarines and landing at Bournemouth or somewhere like that. That sort of thing does not happen any more.</P>
    <P>If there is a war, which Heaven forbid, it will be a war in the sky, with unmanned missiles.  In that context, what is the point in having an Army at all?  I think the Minister to some extent answered the question by starting off his speech by a fairly lengthy reference to United Nations operations. Surely that is the answer&mdash;that the basic reason for having an Army in training is that we have certain obligations, by reason of our membership of the United Nations, to provide armed forces for peacekeeping operations overseas?  That was something which I forecast long before it happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> Immediately we were called on to supply officers for observation duties on the north coast of Africa, I warned the Minister that this was only the start and that, very shortly afterwards, we would be asked to supply actual troops for United Nations duties&mdash;and nobody paid any attention.  As a result, when we were called on for United Nations duties, we were caught on the hop&mdash;we were caught without men, without units and without equipment.</P>
    <P>Our Army is still organised on entirely the wrong basis.  As far as I know&mdash;though it is a fairly closelyguarded secret&mdash;our Army is organised as infantry brigades and a certain amount of command troops.  There, we go back to the last war again and to the last war before that.  We still have units like anti-aircraft artillery.  If anyone gets involved in hostilities, the sort of anti-aircraft gun we have got is about as useful as a catapult.  We did have to send certain Ack-Ack units to the Congo to protect troops in an unusual situation against low-flying aircraft. The guns which we had were of no use even for low-flying comparatively slowspeed aircraft.  Our Bofors guns and their control equipment were quite out of date.  There may very well be certain United Nations operations, such as that rather isolated incident in the Congo, where ground troops will be subjected to low-level aerial attack but it is very rare and I doubt personally whether it will ever happen again.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of money locked up in completely out-of-date anti-aircraft artillery. If we are to go in for some anti-aircraft defence for ground troops, let us do it right.  It is no use fooling ourselves that the present methods will give any defence whatsoever.  In spite of protests which I and I think others have made in this House and elsewhere, we have not organised the Army to carry out its primary function at present, that is, as a United Nations peacekeeping force.  No reason has ever been given to me why we could not do this on a proper businesslike basis.</P>
    <P>The present method whereby you <Col N="1351" /> take one company from Western Command, one company from Eastern Command, one from Southern Command or from Headquarters or the Curragh, is ludicrous and damnably dangerous because you are sending men on active service&mdash;officers, NCOs and men&mdash;who do not know each other.  Only the fact that the men are so superbly trained has kept casualities down to such a low level. Under active service conditions, you must be well trained yourself but in order to carry out any combined operation, you must know the fellow on your right and on your left and not only know him but know how he will probably react in conditions of danger.  You do not get to know that by having a short course of a week, ten days or a fortnight in combined training at the Curragh.  You cannot get proper training at the Curragh for riot duties in Cyprus or jungle warfare in the Congo.</P>
    <P>What we should have done right from the start is to send out proper, well-constituted units that have been working and training together as a unit for a very considerable period.  What we have done is to send out so-called battalions that have only been together for a very short period in the Curragh before they flew out and were hardly together at all while overseas.  They did not even come back as a unit but came back in various airlifts and were never seen again as a unit.  That is very expensive and most unbusinesslike; it gives the maximum amount of trouble to everybody.  We have sent out units which are not units in the proper sense of the word and this means that the battalions and fields companies that are left behind are even more hopelessly under strength than ever before; they are entirely unworkable units.  Some battalions and field companies are reduced to half peacetime strength, with the result that there is so much maintenance work and fatigue work that the units crumble away as an effective part of the fighting force.</P>
    <P>I was sorry that the Minister made no reference to the recent conference <Col N="1352" /> in Canada where a number of countries engaged in United Nations duties came together to discuss the whole question of the provision of troops for the United Nations.  That was a very important conference&mdash;I hope. The only comments from the military and civil personnel who attended it were so guarded that we were left completely in the dark.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the Scandinavian countries in particular are already making provision in their defence forces for certain units to be formed and kept specially for United Nations duties.  That is precisely what we should do.  We should have something in the nature of a flying column, if you like, with a force of infantry of, say, 600 or 700 men accompanied by the various other arms and services to make it into a composite unit. That should be formed here ready to move at any time, having been suitably inoculated for overseas service and requiring only transport.  Immediately it goes, it should be replaced by another similar unit.  I think we should try to work on the basis of three complete United Nations units ready to move at any time.  As soon as one goes, the second steps into an immediate stand-to reserve.  The third one carries on with ordinary training.  As soon as the first unit comes back, it should not be disbanded and thrown around the country in bits and pieces but should be used as a propaganda weapon for recruiting.  We have never used United Nations service in its proper context for recruiting purposes.</P>
    <P>If other countries can do it, we can do it; it is not a question of saying we can do anything as well as they can; in actual fact, our record in this particular regard shows that we can do this sort of job fifty times better than anybody else and the calls for our services will increase.  We could well be asked to supply very many more troops than have been sought so far but the number the Minister reports as having already served overseas is extraordinarily high&mdash;the more credit to all those lads who have gone out as volunteers.  We should not leave this as a matter of volunteer service; <Col N="1353" /> it should be, and is, in fact, now, a matter of the normal terms of enlistment. When you enlist in the Army now, you enlist not only for service at home but also overseas and with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would look into this again and give me even one reason, if he can, why this should not be done.  I have given him plenty of reasons why it should be done.  I have discussed this matter with Army officers, ex-officers and civilians and nobody has yet been able to give me any reason why this should not be put into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister specifically to refer to the recent conference in Toronto, Canada, of countries discussing United Nations peacekeeping activities.  If he can give us any information on that I am sure he will not be breaking any confidence and the information will be very valuable.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear the Minister's very guarded and uncertain reference to the question of fishery protection. Like Deputy Tully, I am worried about that and even more worried when I see that two new launches have been provided at a cost of £65,000 for running around Cork Harbour while we cannot spend a bob on getting proper naval craft for fishery protection duties.  Let us face it: the Navy is a joke and nothing more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be rude about it.  It is not the fault of the Navy because it has never been given the tools to do its job.  I know the Minister says he cannot do anything because he says he cannot get recruits, but who would want to go to sea in a corvette? It is a filthy ship in a bad sea; it is very ancient.  The conditions in which the men are living are quite out of this world.  I do not see why anybody should want to join the Navy if all they are going to do is go on one of those corvettes.  But it is not that our men do not want to go to sea.  The Minister should face the fact that the Irish Lights Commissioners have a long waiting list for men who want to join <Col N="1354" /> as crewmen on their ships.  That is because those men are properly paid, properly looked after and are given a lot of time on shore.  They are allowed to live on shore for a very considerable period.  If Irish Lights can get ample recruits for their very large fleet of ships all around the coast, it is only our own fault if we cannot get men to join the Navy.</P>
      <P>I have seen descriptions of some of the craft available for fishery protection duties.  There is a new type of corvette which, I understand, is on order for some of the navies of the new African States, a new corvette to replace the present one, which would cost about £1½ million.  That, to my mind, would be complete and utter waste of money. This sort of fishery protection out to the 12 mile limit against the large fishing trawlers which can continue operating in very heavy seas cannot be done with small launches.  What is required is some vessel somewhere between the motor torpedo boat type and the corvette.  I understand the Minister has already received specifications of a small fishery protection vessel which is absolutely adequate for the work required, which would cost about £160,000 only.  I think £160,000 is not out of this world at all but I am absolutely convinced that if we got the proper ships, properly equipped to do the job they have to do and if we could give the proper pay and conditions, the Minister would get all the recruits he wants and we would get proper fishery protection.  At the moment we have to admit that we have none.  One corvette is worse than useless.  It is only waste of time and money having a thing like that.</P>
      <P>I was very glad that helicopters were used on certain occasions but I was terribly disappointed that the Minister should inform everybody that they were no use because they cannot accurately establish the position of a poaching trawler.  Why on earth did he have to let that out because, according to a press report, one foreign trawler captain confessed that he did not lose any sleep over the corvettes but was frightened of the helicopters because they came at him so quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If at the present time an Air Corps <Col N="1355" /> observer is not able to take proper observations to establish the position of a trawler immediately below him, I would be very surprised.  I think he does not know his job.  If they need additional equipment, it could not be all that expensive to get it.  It should be at least as easy, and, as a layman, I should have thought far easier, to establish the position of a ship from the air as from water level.  At least, aircraft could identify a poaching vessel and probably frighten it off, which is what we want to do.  It is not only a question of catching them but of getting them out of our territorial waters.  I would hope that if we had the proper surface craft, it could work with aircraft and aircraft could identify which trawlers were operating inside the territorial limits, radio to the surface craft, who could, if necessary, chase the trawler, catch it and bring it back.  We seem to be only tinkering with the problem at the moment.</P>
    <P>A terrible blank in our whole service is the fact that we have no coast watching service whatsoever.  That was very forcibly brought home to me only last Saturday week in Dún Laoghaire. Two men went out, in a very foolhardy fashion, in a very small dinghy with outboard motor, in a very bad sea.  The boat was upset in Scotsman's Bay and turned turtle.  Luckily, some friend of these two men spotted what had happened.  That was purely luck. They might have gone out without telling anybody and nobody would ever have known.  In fact, one of the men managed to swim in and to bring his companion with him&mdash;a magnificent achievement in a very bad sea.</P>
    <P>As I stood on the shore there, I was horrified by my own helplessness. Granted, the ambulance had been alerted and was there.  Granted, the lifeboat had been alerted and came out as quickly as it could, but that is not the sort of equipment you want for that sort of operation.</P>
    <P>What we should have had and what we should get as quickly as possible is a proper coast-watching service, <Col N="1356" /> proper coastguards, particularly in bad weather, so that when a small boat gets into difficulties such as this dinghy got into so recently, there would be somebody there to raise the alarm immediately with the lifeboat and also possibly to take immediate action by throwing out a line with one of these rocket guns which can throw a line out to sea a very considerable distance. If any such equipment had been available, we could have got these lads in much quicker.  There was great danger that the weaker swimmer might have been drowned.  He very nearly was. There was no small boat available. The sea was too rough for such a craft to get out from the shore, even if one had been available.  The lifeboat did arrive as quickly as was conceivably possible but it, again, was in difficulty. It had brought its landing boat with it, a small skiff, behind it, but it would have been in tremendous difficulty operating very close to a rocky shore. A proper coast-watching and coast lifesaving service would be equipped with lines which could be fired out to sea to help people in that sort of situation.</P>
    <P>I was reading of the Lifeboat Institution only last week and it seems to me a terrible reflection on us that the secretary of the Institution in Dún Laoghaire had to say to the members of the public who were present: &ldquo;Will you please remember to keep an eye out to sea and if you see anything that looks at all dangerous, let us know?&rdquo; We should not be relying on isolated members of the public looking out to sea at the right moment. There should be a regular service of coast watchers at all times during bad weather.</P>
    <P>Helicopters have done jolly well so far.  It is a great source of satisfaction to those of us who have been advocating their use for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the lack of technicians, the wastage of technicians. It is no use just bewailing the fact that men who are trained in the Army apprentice school tend to go off into civilian employment later on. There are only two reasons why they do that.  They join the Army to get <Col N="1357" /> the qualifications.  They go off into civilian employment because (a) the pay is very much better and (b) the conditions of employment are very much better.  Nobody wishes to submit himself to Army discipline, to the obligation of wearing a uniform and doing all sorts of other duties if he can possibly avoid it.  People would much prefer the regular five-day week, with a working day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. or 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. with Saturdays and Sundays off as a matter of right. That is what everybody would like to have.</P>
    <P>If a man qualified as an aircraft technician finds he can get at the Airport far better pay, far better conditions, a civilian job all the time, why would he not take it?  There is only one answer, that is, to make the pay and conditions of service for the technicians and for practically all Army personnel at least comparable with those in civilian life.  That is not being done.  So, what we are doing is&mdash;a good job, I suppose, so far as the national interest is concerned&mdash; training good technicians but at the cost of the Army and the Army is getting no advantage out of it.  Not only are we losing technicians but we are losing men out of the Army and we are failing to get them into it. There is no proper recruiting publicity. Very slight efforts have been made from time to time.  Last year we were told that publicity had been abandoned in favour of a system whereby serving soldiers got £5 for each new recruit they could bring in. That to me is a nauseating suggestion and singularly ineffective.</P>
    <P>The Army must study publicity as a commercial enterprise would do.  One sees the sort of advertisements that Aer Lingus are putting in the Irish papers, as well as the full technicolor advertisements in the Sunday papers in England.  That is the way to get a message over, by highly qualified technical experts advising you on public relations.  The public relations department of the Army is and always has been non-existent.  They have not an idea in the world; they sit there wringing their hands and saying: &ldquo;We cannot get recruits&rdquo;.  There is no incentive <Col N="1358" /> offered to anybody to join the Army.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of incentives that could be offered.  It is a good life but nobody ever tells the public about it at all.  The Army is kept as a secret weapon behind locked doors.  It is never brought out in public.  No reference is made to the fact that Army enlistment now entails acceptance of overseas service under the United Nations.  That is an exciting prospect for any man, to know that he will almost certainly be involved in a really worthwhile, man-size job overseas for which, incidentally, he will be extremely well paid.  The risks are there all the time but they are risks which any young man would be perfectly prepared to take.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department will never tell me why there is no reference to United Nations duties in connection with Army recruiting.  As I said before, even the troops going overseas and coming back are never shown to the public.  We go through this business of a farewell and send-off parade at the Curragh.  It is so much a matter of routine.  They are inspected by the Taoiseach or the Minister. Those who have been out before probably know the speeches by heart by now.</P>
    <P>What we should do is send those lads marching through our cities either before they go or when they come back so that we can take proper pride in those first-rate United Nations men who are doing such a magnificent job. We do not make any effort to get that idea across and I do ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to give it a crack now.  I believe it would have a tremendous effect on recruiting.  We would get men who would turn into good soldiers and enable us to carry out our United Nations obligations far better than we have been able to do before, and that is saying a lot.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Regular Army, I have been asked only last night by an officer of the Army Reserve, do the Government take the Army Reserve seriously at all or would they be happier if we were all dead and buried? I do not think the Army Reserve is taken seriously as it should be.  I think the most important thing about the <Col N="1359" /> Army Reserve is the Reserve of Officers and that is not simply because I was an officer myself but because it takes much longer to train an officer than it does to train a soldier.  In a moment of danger, what is wanted most of all is a good body of Reserve officers who can step into the breach and start not only commanding but training troops as they are mobilised.</P>
    <P>The conditions offered to the officers of the Reserve are literally scandalous. For years and years there was no promotion and we had a Reserve of Officers with the oldest lieutenants in the world.  No country had such ancient lieutenants as we had.  At last there was some effort to promote some of these lieutenants to captain but the situation remains that the rate fixed in 1926 as the retainer if you like, that is over and above the pay for the period he is in training, £30 per annum for a lieutenant, £50 for a captain and £75 for a commandant, is precisely the same rate in this year of grace. One cannot say that grants of £30, £50 and £75 payable in 1926 should not have been at least doubled by now. The very least that should be done is to have those grants increased immediately by over £100 per annum each. To expect a man to remain in the Reserve of Officers for £1 or so a day while he is in training and a grant of £30 or £50 just before Christmas is very poor encouragement, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is favourably inclined towards us and I would ask him not to waste any more time but to increase these grants at once.  The Minister has received deputations about this.  He has agreed that it is most reasonable; he will look into it; it is under active consideration and something is going to be done.  But nothing ever is done and that has gone on for years with the Minister and his predecessor.  This must be done now or the Minister has got to say on behalf of the Government: &ldquo;We do not give a damn about the Reserve of Officers.  They can go and bury themselves and we will save a lot of money as soon as they do it.&rdquo;  They are far <Col N="1360" /> too fine a body of men to be treated in this way, so I would ask the Minister, as a matter of urgency and as a matter of justice, to increase these grants by £100 per annum.  Of course, the immediate reaction then would be: how are we to get the money?  On the estimated strength of the 500 officers of the Reserve of Officers set out in the Estimate, it would cost at the most about £50,000.  We can keep that in mind and see where we can save on that later on.</P>
    <P>There is another source of grievance in the Reserve of Officers.  The FCA officers who have nothing like the training which the Reserve officers have had or the experience of long periods of service with the Regular Army, are being promoted much more rapidly and much more regularly than the Reserve officers.  There are quite a number of commandants now in the FCA who have been in the FCA for only a few years, whereas very many of the captains in the Reserve of Officers have been captains for 20 or 30 years at least.</P>
    <P>There is no reason whatever why there should not be further promotions in the Reserve of Officers, or why some of these ageing captains, who are still perfectly fit and well able to do the work, should not be promoted commandant.  I do not want to suggest that all captains should be made commandants.  Never having got to the rank of commandant myself, I have a certain disrespect for it, but at the same time by a process of selection, it is only right that captains who are worthy of the rank should be promoted commandants and given the same hope of promotion as officers in the FCA.</P>
    <P>As far as the NCOs and men in the First Line Reserve are concerned, we know that the numbers are falling steadily.  A high proportion are not expected to return for training.  What is the point?  Are we codding ourselves here again?  I think we are.  We turn to the FCA.  I agree completely with Deputy Tully that the strength of the FCA is very largely illusory.  I would agree with him, too, that there are some very dedicated men, officers, <Col N="1361" /> NCOs and men.  A large proportion of the FCA personnel are between the ages of 16 and 19 years.  They cannot get in before 16; they will not stay on after 19.  You could make the age group even smaller because the actual turnover is far too quick.  They go in, they come out, and we are not building up a body of well-trained reservists.  There is far too high a turnover.</P>
    <P>When the Estimate sets out clearly that a high percentage of the total strength is not expected to turn up for training, then I say it is about time we chucked it.  The FCA units are trained entirely separately from the regular units.  They are a class apart. They do not mix.  I understand the position is that the FCA commandants are referred to by the Army personnel as just &ldquo;commandant&rdquo; not &ldquo;sir&rdquo;&mdash;that a Regular Army captain or Reserve captain would no more think of saluting an FCA commandant than he would of saluting a private soldier.  There is contempt for these senior ranks in the FCA by the Regular Army and that is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>If a man is a commissioned officer of the Forces, whether FCA or Regular, he should be given proper respect for his rank, but if there is this feeling&mdash; and I believe there is&mdash;that men holding that rank are not really worthy of it, that they are holding a rank far higher than Regular or Reserve officers who are far better qualified, it is a situation that can cause a great deal of trouble.  I believe the only real Reserve should be a small one which could be organised as small components of each Regular unit.  For instance, an Army battalion could have, say, one platoon. It would mean there would be a chance that the infantry battalion could be brought up to war establishment during training simply by the calling up of its own reserves.  It would also have the advantage that the reservists, when reporting for training, would not be trained with other reservists but side by side with regular soldiers.</P>
    <P>It would end the necessity to keep up separate establishment as at the moment.  There would be no extra expense because the one company <Col N="1362" /> quartermaster sergeant would still look after the stores and equipment and the stores and equipment of the reserve platoon as well.  At the moment you have a number of very good NCOs&mdash; company sergeants, company quartermaster sergeants and even corporals&mdash; engaged in nothing else but FCA duties which are entirely unproductive.</P>
    <P>References have been made to the uniform.  I admit it is a bit better and I am deeply grateful, as are the men, that at last it has got a proper open-necked tunic.  The old tunic was most unhygienic, as well as being uncomfortable. However, the cut of the uniform is abominable.  It is years out of date and the material is far from ideal.  But the cut is all wrong.  First of all, the tunic never fits.  The men go out into the city looking all right down to the waist, but from the waist down the uniform is a mess.  It should never have been designed for use with a leather belt around the waist.  It is a waste of time.  It looks dirty half the time because the men do not bother to clean it.  In an effort to make the tunic look as if it fits, the belt is worn too tight, the tunic is distorted, the pockets and skirt of the tunic stick out all round like a kilt.</P>
    <P>What we want is a design and there is no earthly reason why we should not have it if only the Minister and his officials would look for it.  They are under the impression that what has been good enough for many years is good enough for a few years longer.  It is not good enough; it never was good enough.  It looks cheap; it is cheap.  It is an insult to anybody to ask him to wear it.  It is not quite as bad as its predecessor but it is still far from being right.</P>
    <P>Our men have still got no proper battledress.  The Army boots are very good for long route marches, but long route marches have gone: everything is being done now by mechanical transport and the amount of route marching done is negligible.  Our men need proper campaign boots, more suitable for climbing, for cross-country work, than these enormous canal barges we have at the moment, so heavily studded and so on.  They are <Col N="1363" /> very good for knocking down doors, for bashing your way through things. Our Army need proper modern battle-dress. We can notice that our lads going overseas are far better equipped, far more ready for the job.  Of course we could make them far more ready still, and I would ask the Minister to abandon all concepts of uniform he has had heretofore and ask an expert to design a proper one.  I would also ask the Minister to provide for proper uniform material.  I do not believe we could do better than base our uniform on the British Army uniform or the American Army uniform.  We make first-rate British uniforms here.  If we can do that, surely we can do it for ourselves.  But this is a cut-price outfit and it is about time it stopped being that.  If we are prepared to pay, our mills are able to produce first-quality material for first-rate uniforms.  The reason we have not got a first-rate uniform is, I think, that somebody has been quite unnecessarily stingy.</P>
    <P>We need more expenditure on a number of things.  We need new expenditure on fishery protection vessels and on aircraft.  We need more helicopters. Three is a good start, but it is not nearly enough.  We also need new jet trainer aircraft.  The jets we have are neither one thing nor the other; they are neither proper trainers nor proper fighters.  It would be completely ludicrous to try to keep up with the supersonic jet fighters, but we should have proper machines as jet trainers.  Piston-engined aircraft are completely out of date and, apart from the helicopters, we can forget about them.  We should have an airport equipped with jet trainers.  I suppose there might be a few observer aircraft or small transport planes like the de Havilland Dove.  Our main concern, however, is with good jet trainers and good helicopters.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of expenditure, we need very much higher grants for Reserve officers and higher pay for technicians.  We need better quality and better design in uniforms, including the uniform of the Army Nursing Service.  You do not often see <Col N="1364" /> the Army Nursing Service on parade but, if you did see the uniform, you would not wonder why they do not come out in it more often.  It is really a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Now, if we are to buy more aircraft and more new vessels, these would have to be financed as special items; but, so far as better grants for Reserve officers are concerned, more promotion for them, better pay and conditions for technicians, and better pay for all ranks, all these could be dealt with immediately out of the customary surplus which is surrendered each year out of this Vote. It is no use saying we have not got the money.  In 1962-63, the Minister handed back a surplus of £753,000.  A sum of £753,000 was voted to him by this House for expenditure on the Army and he did not spend it.  He gave back this huge surplus.  In 1963-64 he handed back £823,000.  Now, apart from new aircraft and new vessels, such things as improving conditions, uniforms, annual training grants, and so on, would be covered many times over by this surplus alone, and that without any savings whatsoever.  I feel, as I have always felt, that there could be a tremendous saving on this Estimate. There is an enormous amount of very wasteful expenditure.  Perhaps we could not save it all but, if we saved it on certain items, we could spend it to much greater advantage on others.</P>
    <P>As far as the FCA is concerned, I think we should face up to the position as to whether or not this should be entirely reformed as an integrated Reserve, completely integrated with the Regular Army, at about half its present nominal strength.  That would be some 10,000 men.  That is one suggestion. Alternatively, we could abolish it altogether.  The Minister's predecessor tried to do a fair amount of work from the point of view of integrating the FCA and the Reserve generally into the Regular Army.  He tried, but, with all due respects to him, he did not succeed.  The Reserve is still a separate, independent outfit on its own.  It is not integrated into the Regular Army.</P>
    <P>At present the cost of uniforms for <Col N="1365" /> the FCA is as high as for the Regular Army.  We spend, or are estimated to be about to spend, £200,000 per annum on uniforms for the FCA.  That is partly because of the numbers involved and partly because, as I said before, there is far too quick a turnover. Men come in for six months, or a year, and then get out.  The uniforms are scrapped.  So are the boots.  The new men who come in get new outfits. Even if we reduced the strength of the FCA by integrating it into a much tighter Reserve, a better controlled Reserve which would actually turn up with its regular unit for training, reducing it from 20,000 to 10,000, that would mean we could reduce the clothing bill by £100,000 for a start.  Again, if it were at half strength, we would save £150,000 in pay alone of FCA personnel. If we integrated it completely with regular units, we would save the cost of hiring halls, etc., which is estimated to cost £15,000 per annum.  Personally, I think we should abolish it altogether.  I cannot see that it is serving any useful purpose.  As far as I know, it has been a deep disappointment to the many officers and NCO's who have done their best for it.  It simply has not produced the desired result.  Those who have dedicated themselves to it would, I think, be willing to join a new Reserve closely integrated with the Regular Army.</P>
    <P>We could also save a great deal of money by having smaller vessels.  The cost of upkeep of corvettes is far too high.  The cost of upkeep of small vessels reduces very rapidly.  We could save a great deal of money, too, on the buildings occupied at present by the Army.  We could sell many of the old barracks.  We still have Griffith Barracks, which is partly FCA, partly an emergency housing unit for displaced Corporation tenants, and partly Labour Court.  It would be far better to get rid of it altogether and give it to the Corporation.  A proper building could be erected elsewhere for the Labour Court.  To have evicted tenants, the Labour Court and the FCA all mixing in the one building seems to me far from ideal, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>These old buildings are most uneconomic <Col N="1366" /> to maintain.  They are brutal to live in.  They are dark; they are damp; they are cold.  They have nothing to commend them.  The sooner they are got rid of the better.  All the time they have to be heated, cleaned, painted; roofs have to be repaired; plumbing has to be repaired; electric wiring has to be replaced.  Money is being poured down the drain.  The sooner we get rid of them the better. I cannot see any necessity for having Cathal Brugha Barracks, Collins Barracks, and McKee Barracks.  There is bound to be some economy possible there.  Clancy Barracks is used as a store, and it is one of the nicest and most modern.  Large blocks of buildings are also being maintained in the Curragh, but they are not used.</P>
    <P>We could save money by reviewing the whole set-up of the Naval Service. Here, you have quite a number of men with quite a big shore establishment, a big administration and everything else, all looking after one corvette, which occasionally puts to sea.  The situation has got so completely out of balance that I think our Naval Service could gain, and would gain, if no corvette existed at all.  The purpose of having a naval service is to have an outfit to do the job required.  Our Naval Service is not doing that.  It is about time some decision was taken.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to civil defence.  Here, again, I would like to repeat a request to the Minister to re-organise this entirely.  Nobody except a few dedicated and well-informed people seriously believe that we are in danger of aerial attack with atomic weapons or that we are in danger of radiation from the explosion of nuclear weapons.  I know it is foolish that we do not believe it, but we just do not.  I do not think civil defence means anything to anybody.  If this were an emergency rescue service, fully coordinated with the Garda Síochána, the fire brigade and a newly-constituted coastguard service, lifeboat service and helicopter service, it would begin to make sense.  The only jobs they have done, and done very well, are such things as emergency rescues in the mountains, emergency cooking <Col N="1367" /> facilities in cases of flooding, and so on.  Those are the jobs they should do. That has nothing to do with civil defence; it is emergency rescue work, which is vitally necessary.  If it were reconstituted on that basis and less time spent on arguing about radiation dangers and more time spent on existing activities such as training for rock climbing, mountain rescue, air-sea rescue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  In any sort of emergency, the emergency rescue service would then be there to deal with casualties.  There is no use trying to persuade the public, no matter how much the Minister and the Department may try to do so, that we are in any danger from radiation from the explosion of nuclear weapons.  The public will not believe it.</P>
      <P>I have another bee in my bonnet about one part of the Army service, that is, the Legal Service.  I am not at all satisfied, and never was, with the legal procedure in the Army.  It is completely out of date but, worst of all, there is no right of appeal from a courtmartial. This is a matter where, in full consultation with the legal profession generally, there should be a comprehensive review and reform of Army legal procedure.  There have been some improvements, but I do not think they have gone far enough.  There should be a formal right of appeal from a courtmartial verdict or sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any justification whatever for the maintenance of the office of Judge Advocate General.  The Judge Advocate General is a civilian barrister, a well-qualified man, who is merely a rubber stamp.  He gets very well paid, and nobody pays any attention to him. I know that because I have seen it happen.  I have conducted courtmartial proceedings myself.  I have had to produce the complete record and send it from the Divisional Staff I was on up to GHQ.  It was passed by the Deputy Judge Advocate General and passed on to the Judge Advocate General, and I never saw a constructive comment from a Judge Advocate <Col N="1368" /> General in my life.  Granted my experience is short, but I have never heard of the Judge Advocate General upsetting a decision or making any comment which was of any value. The only real reason for having him was that it was some form of guarantee against some miscarriage of justice in a courtmartial.  I do not think it has been that.  I think a right of appeal to the High Court would give far better protection to serving men and would make sense to them.  It would also save money.  I have nothing personal in this.  Let us get rid of the Judge Advocate General and make the senior officer of the Army Legal Service the Director of the Service the same as the Director of any other Army Corps or Service.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the Army.  I would like to give it the maximum support.  They have done a terrific job in the Congo and an equally good job in Cyprus and will continue to do that.  But it still is a cut-price outfit.  The Army have never been given the better equipment, better uniforms&mdash;all the conditions to enable them to do the job properly.  One of the greatest weaknesses in it was referred to by Deputy Tully, and I thoroughly support him on this.  There is not a proper service to deal with the re-employment of ex-servicemen when they go back to civilian life.  It is very difficult for NCOs and men to get a job when they come out at the age of 50 or so.  I also feel Deputy Tully was right when he said that gratuities for NCOs and men are essential.  The pension is very small, and the least we can do is give them some sort of gratuity to give them a start in civilian life.  The amount of savings we can make on this Estimate is more than adequate to account for all the expenditure I have advocated.  I think if we did cut out an awful lot, we would get far better value for money.</P>
    <P>I have one last point.  During the terms which our troops served in the Congo and Cyprus, there was only one recognised case where an officer, NCO or man carried out some act of gailantry beyond the call of duty.  That is an insult to the Army.  I do not <Col N="1369" /> believe it.  I think our troops have done magnificently, but there is some block somewhere.  The only awarded medal was a posthumous one.  Every other unit that goes on overseas duty like this, or is involved in any sort of activity like our troops have been, has given proper recognition to acts of gallantry carried out by their own men.  I am not in favour of having rows and rows of medals for everyone, but I know, and we all know, of officers, NCOs and men who have gone far beyond the call of duty time and again; and for a gang of hidebound, chair-borne officers in GHQ to say to the Minister: &ldquo;We do not consider anybody has been specially brave&rdquo; is an insult which, I think, should be stuffed down their necks.  It is time they got out of their chairs, got out to Cyprus or the Congo and saw what active service was like.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister what sort of officers comprised the board which advised him and how many have had active service, and he refused to say. I can only assume&mdash;I think, absolutely rightly&mdash;that the officers who are advising him are entirely chair-borne warriors.  If a proper procedure were adopted, a particular commander should be entitled to make immediate awards to his own troops for actions of gallantry carried out under his command.</P>
    <P>I should like to close on that note.  It is something which, I think, is of tremendous value.  We do not want medals dished out, broadcast, nor do we want anybody to say our troops have served in the Congo and that there was only one brave man amongst them, whereas other troops had a higher proportion.  Our proportion is as high as, or higher than, any other and it is long overdue that some recognition should be given to them. The cost of each medal would be 8d. and I do not think that is too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually a mere handful of Deputies take part in the discussion on the Defence Estimate and these are generally the same Deputies. They are usually former Army officers or old IRA men.  This is a special <Col N="1370" /> Department of which one must have some knowledge in order to be able to deal with it at any length.  I usually refer to matters affecting the old IRA, as Deputy Booth has just done, when speaking on Defence policy.  I happen to be President of the Old Fianna and, naturally, I am expected to speak for the old IRA.</P>
      <P>I have expressed my opinions here before in regard to defence.  I am no expert but I do claim to have a good knowledge of history.  I was not an Army officer, although I have old IRA experience.  I have such a sound knowledge of history that my children often ask me why I do not go on Telefís Éireann as I am always able to answer nine out of ten of the history questions asked.</P>
      <P>I fail to see the purpose of the Army, except that it is a symbol of our independence and a symbol of our right to have a force.  Personally, I do not see how, as a force, we could ever defend the country in any conventional manner.  We are not an African state having all around us states of lesser power than ourselves.  We are surrounded by empires, Britain, France, Germany and possibly, Russia if she took over Europe.  So we have to contend with empires in the event of any invasion of this country, and not just someone on the left or right of us. Whatever we have, they have one hundred thousand times more so I do not see how we could ever put up a conventional defence.  I always hold our Army is more a symbol of our right to have an Army than a means of defence.  If anyone attempted to invade this country&mdash;and I do not think it would come from Britain but it could come from some other country invading Britain&mdash;they would put anything we have out of operation in 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know from reading reports by the American Defence Secretary that this great power has war strategy and military matters under its thumb and has press-button targets everywhere. Likewise, if anyone were to come in here, they know where their targets are situated&mdash;they know where the Curragh is, and they would make short <Col N="1371" /> work of it in 20 minutes.  Any defence we could put up would be a sort of guerrilla defence.  In spite of all civil defence efforts, and so on, everything would collapse overnight and we would be back where we were in 1918.</P>
    <P>I always ask myself what sort of retaliatory effort could we make.  What can we do if someone invades our country?  What would our follow-up be?  The sort of defence I think about is guerrilla action.  The few planes and the few ships we have do not serve any purpose.  The ships protect our fishing, perhaps, and that is all.  Why should we not have midget submarines?  That may seem to be a gimmick on my part. But if we have such things as artillery, why not have it by way of submarines? If there were a sudden attack and the country were invaded, there could be attack by way of sinking ships and doing as much damage in one effort as the whole country could otherwise do in a combined effort.  We know the Italians made use of midget submarines and sank capital ships and aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean.</P>
    <P>My point is, if we have a Department of Defence and can help the United Nations, we ought to be in a position to make it tougher than tough for anyone invading this country and have something with which to attack people coming in here.  I hold any invasion from the air will be only a light invasion with which we might be able to deal.  But the proper invasion would come by sea.  What will we do about ships coming with guns and weapons?  Will we not make it tough for them?  I am sure midget submarines would cost less than aeroplanes and they would be more effective as a weapon of defence.  I make this case because I feel we ought to have some means of counter-attack and a way of making an invasion tougher than tough.</P>
    <P>There is another point I have in mind and I have mentioned it before, that is, that the Army should be equipped with steel breastplates.  Do not think I am going back to Roman times.  A few weeks ago I was watching a picture of riot police in action in Japan.  They used shields, just as they <Col N="1372" /> did in the jungle two thousand years ago.  This equipment enabled the riot police to deal with considerably more rioters than any force could, either here or in Britain.  They were able to stand up to blows from stones and bottles and I have seen a picture of a dozen police putting thousands to flight.  These shields act as a protection, and, if they serve that purpose, on the same principle soldiers attacking armoured cars and tanks feel protected.  Likewise, if our methods of defence are modern, we should be tougher than tough, tougher than we are.  We should have our armour plate.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting anything cumbersome as it beats me, on visiting a museum, to understand how people fought in the past.  A small plate on the chest could save fifty per cent of the lives lost.  We hear of gangsters using them, and they are not using them for fun.  Do not think I am going back to mediaeval days.  I am making a practical suggestion and suggesting that they would save half the lives lost.  If our men in the Congo were wearing such protection, how many of them would have been saved at the Niemba ambush?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to that with which I am more concerned.  We come in here to debate large estimates for guns, tanks, and so on, and it is our duty to make comment.</P>
    <P>In regard to our efforts on behalf of the United Nations, we are, in my opinion, in much greater danger in Cyprus than we were in the Congo. In the Congo we had to deal only with poorly armed and uncivilised people but in Cyprus we are dealing with two powers, Greece and Turkey, and there is grave danger there because the question has not been settled.  In my opinion, it will be settled either by partition or by force.  When people talk about partition&mdash;I do not want to enter into a Department of External Affairs debate&mdash;they think of this country but there is no similarity.  Cyprus was never independent.  It is right up along the coast of Turkey, not 100 miles away, but it is 600 miles from Greece and 400 miles from Crete.  I do not believe that the Turk will ever back out of <Col N="1373" /> Cyprus because Cyprus could be a dagger at Turkey's throat and they know it.  The Greeks may not want to back out for prestige purposes.  Overnight, force could be resorted to and it would not be the same type of force as was experienced in the Congo but force of a devastating kind.  If such a thing occurs, I hope the Department have some way of taking out our troops overnight.  It might not be possible to depend on the Americans to take them out as there might be no place for planes to land, but the Department should have some plan for removing the troops to some neutral area.</P>
    <P>Because I represent the Old IRA, I always speak on the question of pensions. I am one of the few who represent the Old IRA and it is always those of the Old IRA who speak about it and that is understandable.  It is because we were part of it and we feel it.  Someone has to put any grievances they have to the House.  I always hold that a great many Old IRA got a raw deal.  For example, in regard to pensions, the Civil War was recognised as service where an officer commanded a certain number of men in the Tan War; he did not have to fire a shot but as long as he commanded so many men, that was recognised as service. In that case he got the Civil War service and likewise if a man fired a shot &mdash;one shot&mdash;in the Tan War, he got the Tan War as service and also got the Civil War as service.  Either the Civil War was service or it was not. We know there was a difference between us.  We will forget about that. Men destroyed one another, or injured one another or ruined one another financially, especially on one side.  It is to be regretted but it happened.  It is a question of justice.  To the men who took the Republican side, it was the same struggle; perhaps it was not but to them it was.  We have all agreed not to question what went on.</P>
    <P>In regard to the pensions, there were doubts about who served in the Tan War but did not fire a shot, probably because it was up to their officers who had not the courage to do so.  There may be no laurels in a civil war but if <Col N="1374" /> there was no justification for awards in the Civil War, why do certain people get them and others do not?  I know a lot of men who suffered a thousand times more in the Civil War than in the Tan War.  The Tan War was a picnic compared with what certain people suffered in the Civil War.</P>
    <P>Another thorny question is the question of medals.  Some years ago the Department decided that any medals issued before a certain date were not duly awarded and that only medals awarded after that date were duly awarded.  There is now a doubt about the medals that some people have and that doubt will remain until they apply for a special allowance and until the question is re-examined.  The Old IRA object to this doubt.  Yesterday Deputy MacEoin said that it would be much better to accept everybody, even if there were some abuse, rather than do greater harm, by doing an injustice through lack of evidence to genuine cases later on.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that these cases should not be re-examined until people are 70 years old, or until they become invalids when they will qualify for a special allowance.  I was in the Fianna and I am only 60, but assuming for argument's sake that I apply ten years hence, who would be alive then to verify my case?  There would be no one; yet I am one of the youngest. There are thousands of such cases.  The Minister should decide to accept everybody with a medal as a bona fide case for a special allowance and should hear him now.  He should re-examine them now and issue a certificate to all he considers were duly awarded a medal.  By taking no action and by waiting for people to apply, he will more than likely do a greater injustice to people who may apply in five or six years' time.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, there is only one man who could verify my case but when he dies, what will be the position? I might say that I am wellknown, and that I am a TD and that I will be all right, but what about all the other people, the rank and file who are not known and who will try to make their case on their own?  I am making the case that if they are not <Col N="1375" /> going to be recognised for special allowances, the Minister should make up his mind to have all cases re-examined so that there will be no question of a further inquiry with regard to special allowances.</P>
    <P>There was some reference to a new Act to consolidate all military pensions legislation.  It is high time that this was done because it is most difficult having to look through all the various Acts if one wishes to refer to a particular provision.  One sees something in one Act and it refers to some other Act, which, in turn refers to some further Act.  One has to be a lawyer to know what is what.  It is good to know that all military pension legislation may be consolidated and brought up to date.</P>
    <P>There was also mention by the Minister that there will be some changes.  I hope so and I hope, in view of the special period next year is, the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Rising, that once and for all justice will be done.  Next year will be the one last great rally and if everything is not finalised and justice is not done by then it will never be done.  There are certain cases, I am not going to go into personally here, where there was a raw deal.  The Minister's excuse in relation to them, was that because of a statute he could do nothing about it.  He is a man who can change statutes.  Now that he is talking about bringing in a new Act he can make those changes.  Let us hope the Minister's new Act will be the last one and that there will be no further grounds for complaint.  When people start meeting for next year I hope they will have no cause for complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often heard of armies being destroyed by enemy action and of navies being destroyed by enemy action and by storm but here we have an Army being run down by the Department of Defence. We also have a Navy that is practically ready to sink at its moorings through the same Department.  The Minister mentioned the service rendered by Irish soldiers in the Congo and in Cyprus.  For the Army it was just providential that this duty arose <Col N="1376" /> because up to then there was not an Irish battalion that was completely equipped with fully automatic weapons. It took the Congo emergency, or whatever we may call it, to bring about a state of affairs where the men sent there were armed with modern weapons.  These weapons had to be bought in a hurry.</P>
      <P>These men did their duty well.  We were able to follow events in the Congo during the civil war, or whatever you like to call it.  Perhaps, it would have been as well if we had not been able to do so.  We gained experience from that operation.  We have reached the position in Cyprus where our troops are standing between two contending parties.  Our officers and men there are worthy of the greatest admiration.  They deserve the congratulations of the people of this country.  Soldiers are soldiers, I suppose, all over the world.  You might have somebody break through the lines or through the rules and something might happen.  It is greatly to the credit of our troops in Cyprus that nothing like that, which often happens with expeditionary forces, has happened there.</P>
      <P>With regard to recruiting for the Army the Department have failed in this matter, particularly in regard to publicity.  A great deal of it is in the Irish language and a great number of potential recruits are not able to read the advertisements.  As well as that, people down the country never see the Army as an army.  They never see ceremonial parades and they seldom hear our great Army bands.  They only hear them on very rare occasions. Deputy Booth mentioned this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this matter a step further.  We have these very fine parades when the men are going to the Congo.  They take place in the Curragh inside the barrack square. We have a review of troops by the Taoiseach which the Minister for Defence also attends.  The troops are then put into trucks and brought to Collinstown airport.  That is the end of it.  When they come back, triumphantly, they arrive at the airport, are pushed into trucks and brought to the <Col N="1377" /> barracks again.  There ought to be a little more ceremony when the men come home.  There ought to be a march to some barracks.  Surely an Army which is coming home should not be pushed into trucks but should march. What with modern fighting techniques and mechanisation, the soldier of the future will not be able to march any distance.  If his transport breaks down it looks to me as if he will have had it.</P>
    <P>There are centres all over the country which were used only during the emergency. The barracks are manned by a small skeleton staff in case of an emergency.  The Department of Defence should consider sending detachments of troops to these such places.  They should parade to Church on Sunday morning and back again.  The people would then be able to see them.  Any time I saw soldiers parading I was always very proud of them.  I saw the great military tattoo during the war years at Ballsbridge.  That was produced as well as any professional army in the world could produce it.  We can do this but we hide the men.</P>
    <P>There are special occasions in relation to the opening of the Dáil&mdash;I do not mean after a general election&mdash;such as we had a few weeks ago when the House resumed after the Christmas recess.  On that day there ought to be a ceremonial mounting of the guard with the No. 1 Army Band in attendance. It is a great thing that the Irish people have their own Parliament but we just forget it.  We are drifting away from everything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would give him credit for this.  If he had anything to do with it he would do it.  We had the great State funeral on Monday last.  It showed what the Army was capable of. It was a great tribute to a very fine lonely man and it was due to him from this country.  On the occasion of a State funeral it is good to employ modern equipment and everything else but such a ceremony should be based on tradition. We are supposed to be mad about <Col N="1378" /> horses in this country.  It is a legend that has built up but I suppose not half per cent of the population ever sat on a horse.  We try to perpetuate this legend of the Irishman who is mad about horses.  Everybody has a horse in his backyard according to reports in some of the newspapers.  The gun carriage, on the occasion of last Monday's State funeral should have been drawn by horses who would go proudly through the streets of Dublin with officers marching on each side as pall bearers.  These are the things which the Department of Defence are cutting away all the time.  It would be impossible for us to produce a company of mounted Irish cavalry men.  The three types of mounted soldiers embrace chargers, troopers, and gunners.  We have an Army Equitation School and these people know their business where horses are concerned.  They would be in a position to advise the Minister on the matter of bringing some horses into the Army for ceremonial purposes.</P>
      <P>The reason the jumping team is not doing so well is that there are not enough horses bought for them.  In the years when they did very well we had two or three good horses and they toured all Europe and then were hauled back to London and hauled back home to compete in our own great Horse Show in August.  A matter that has been pressed on every Estimate is that there should be more horses. You will often buy a horse that is a failure but if such a horse is bought for the Army they are stuck with it and they will not be allowed to buy another one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I ever came in here, I heard complaints about two horses that were bought for the Army by a foreigner but even though one of these was a wind-sucker and could be heard at the top of the stands he never hit a fence and we won the Aga Khan Cup.  You cannot keep your strength of jumpers down to a small number and the Army Equitation School authorities must have power to buy a greater number of horses.  Our jumping team is a great promotional idea and we can look back with pride to the days when they went abroad with good horses and were able to compete with former <Col N="1379" /> empires and great and wealthy nations and beat them.  That is a great advertisement for the Irish horse and for Ireland.</P>
    <P>There should be an extra allowance for officers of the jumping team to enable them to purchase boots and breeches.  A good pair of hunting boots such as an officer would wear at an international horse show cost from £15 to £20 before the war and they are costing an enormous sum now.  The pay and allowances in the Irish Army are not that great and the officer serving at home is not wearing his boots and breeches as often as the man who is training horses and competing at shows.  They should be turned out better than the soldiers who come here from other countries.  I have seen our men well turned out but when one sees them in contrast with Japanese, French, Belgian, American or British officers one realises that the latter have been turned out for their job down to the last button.  These men are our best trade representatives abroad and I consider that they should be turned out better than any other nation in the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth reminded me that the Bofors guns are out of date.  They look well during parades but that is about all they are good for.  My information is that if it were not for the Congo and Cyprus operations our soldiers would still be parading with the old Lee Enfield rifles.  My information also is that except for the units that are now abroad and the unit that was at the funeral the rest of the Army cannot be armed with modern weapons because they are not there.</P>
    <P>The matter of uniforms has to do with recruiting as well.  Our young men are becoming quite finicky about dress. I am not talking now about teddy boys but about the ordinary boys in the country and the smaller towns.  They are not going to appear in the get-up offered to them as uniform by the Department of Defence.  In other years Dublin had the reputation of having great military tailors.  They made uniforms for other countries and are still doing it.  I suggest that the tailoring <Col N="1380" /> trade in Ireland should be invited to submit designs for uniforms and that a board to examine these designs should be set up, a board consisting of members of the General Staff but not of them alone.  There should be other people in on that examination, even members of this House who have had Army service, so that we would have a proper uniform for our young soldiers.  That would help recruiting.</P>
    <P>There is awful boredom in the Army.  That is my understanding of the situation from meeting young men in the Army.  You have to talk to them for a long time to convince them that there is a future in it.  There is so little to do in the Army that it grinds them down.  If there were more ceremonial and church parades and if the Army were sent down to centres in the country where there are unoccupied barracks it would do some good.  The people should be let see the Army and see the turn-out.  They could bring the best of their athletes and have them compete with the local foot-ballers, hurlers or soccer players.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Irish Navy.  We have three corvettes, three dreadful craft.  They have very bad quarters for their crews in a heavy sea.  We can only have one of them at sea at a time and the Minister admits that we only have sufficient seamen to man one of these three ships.  I suspect that two of the three cannot be started up at all.  I submit to the Minister that he must now bravely do what they had to do with the three famous fishing boats they bought: they will have to sell them, and the sooner the better. The decision must be made eventually; why not now?  I do not know whether the Minister or his officials were interested but I told him some time ago that an American type of coastguard cutter was sent to Ireland and visited many of the ports so that the people could see it.  The manufacturers of this craft were trying to interest the National Lifeboat Institute in using these boats as lifeboats. These boats are preventive craft and can be mounted with a very effective pom-pom gun and manned by a small crew.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> A defender of the Department of Defence said these would be no use in arresting one of the big trawlers because you would be required to put a boarding party on board.  I dispute that: you do not need that.  If one of these boats found a large foreign trawler fishing within our limits, it could challenge the trawler and if he did not stop, it could fire a shot across his bows and if he then did not stop it could sink him.  If the small boat got within hailing distance he could order the trawler into the nearest port, escort him there and arrest him there.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of the greatest urgency.  The greatest herring fishery in the country, and one of the great herring fisheries of West Europe, lies off the south-east coast of Ireland and thanks to the neglect of the Department, that fishery has been pillaged and ravaged by enormous continental fleets.  The Irish Navy could do nothing to prevent it because they have only one ship and if they actually made an arrest and brought the trawler into Cork or Waterford Harbour, all the other trawlers outside would then come in and fish right up to the rocks.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the average Deputy thinks of a foreign trawler as a craft of 80 or 90 feet long with one funnel.  That dates back ten or 12 years ago.  The ships I have seen through my glasses fishing off the east coast are up to the size of small steamers, with crews of 40, 50, 60 and 90 men.  They are factory ships also and are able to catch more of our fish in a day than some of our muchvaunted fishing villages catch in a year. They are using a type of net no decent fisherman would use because it will catch and scratch up everything that is in the sea out of it.  I said this before and I repeat it because one must continue saying these things to the Minister&mdash;nothing but water can get through this net.</P>
    <P>It took various Deputies from both sides of the House about five years to sell the idea of helicopters to the Department of Defence.  It should not have taken so long.  But for the decency <Col N="1382" /> of the British Navy who launched an aircraft carrier into the Bristol Channel and got a helicopter to take off to save the men off the south coast of Wexford, these men would have been drowned because they could not be taken off by the lifeboat.  We were helpless at the time because we had no helicopter. However, we have three of them now and that is a start.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister could make a great job of this.  He has said that the extension of fishery limits provided for in the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act of 1964 raises the whole question of the adequacy of our fishery protection service and that this question is being thoroughly investigated but that it is a problem to which there is no easy solution.  I think this is being approached in the typical Civil Service manner: you cannot make any mistake if you buy nothing.  The Minister must realise that he has three corvettes and he is not able to put them to sea.  Even if he could recruit sufficient men, if he could fit out these boats and get them to sea, they are not adequate to protect our fisheries.</P>
    <P>The obvious thing for him to do&mdash; the experts will tell him he cannot do it but this is a case where the political head of a Department can make a decision and say: &ldquo;Let this be done. We will take a chance on it&rdquo;&mdash;is to bring in about six of these armed coastguard cutters and station them at various ports where fishing is likely to be heavy and when shoals start to run, they could be so directed as to have three of them at one fishing ground with a helicopter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it had been reported to him that the helicopter is unable to take a bearing that would measure the distance between the baseline and the ship.  I find that hard to believe in an age of precision bombing instruments and navigational aids such as radar and asdic.  Surely it must be possible, even if the baseline is drawn from head to head and that the measurement must be made from the portion of the sea through which the baseline passes.  You then measure out 12 miles and anybody within that 12 miles is breaking the law.  You must <Col N="1383" /> know where the 12 mile limit is. Surely there must be some method of dropping a colour buoy to mark the baseline?  Surely if, in marking a ship, the helicopter came along at a low altitude and set his asdic on the buoy, he could measure precisely the distance he was away from it.</P>
    <P>I am going into great detail about this because we are throwing away millions of pounds worth of fish and do not seem to bother about it.  I am fully convinced that if the captains of these trawlers saw the support coming from these fast armed coastguard cutters that would be called out and put on to them and the helicopter staying over the fellow running to get outside the limit and marking him, saying: &ldquo;There is your man&rdquo;, they would be more careful.  When he is brought before the local justice, he usually has £25,000 to £30,000 worth of a catch on board.  This is seized and the local justice usually fines him a fairly stiff fine of £1,000 or £1,500. He can walk out of the court and buy back his gear, return to his ship and go away again and will think that the chance he took was worth taking.</P>
    <P>One such trawler captain was brought into the port of Waterford. He did not get his catch or his gear back.  The gear was sold to Bord Iascaigh Mhara for about £1,400.  I do not know whether or not I am being unprofessional in this matter.  I happen to have been the auctioneer.  I had great satisfaction in selling that gear, which consisted of good nets and good ropes, to my own countrymen.  I considered it preferable that it should be given to my countrymen at the right price than to let these pirates sail away with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not waste any time about this.  I should like to read on the paper next week or the week after that the decision had been made in the Department of Defence to dispose of the corvettes and that trials were being made of craft or cutters that would be supplied on order because there is competition amongst those who build that type of craft.</P>
    <P>The next thing we have to consider is the manning of the craft.  For <Col N="1384" /> the position in the Naval Service, we must lay the blame at the door of the Minister for Defence.  In a reply to a Parliamentary Question regarding recruitment to the Naval Service, I discovered that last year there were no officers recruited and there were 20 men recruited.  The wastage is extraordinarily high.  That is due to the mean pay a seaman will get from Dark Rosaleen if he goes into her Naval Service.  A senior petty officer gets 25/- a day, free quarters and uniform.  An ordinary labouring man in the country who might not have half the skills a senior petty officer must have is better off than that. Here is a man who has submitted himself to the discipline of the navy and has worked his way up from being a seaman, fourth class, up to senior petty officer.  The Minister must be realistic and remember that good seamen are at a premium at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now let us take the seaman fourth class.  He will not be bothered by the income tax collector.  His pay is 13/8 a day or about £4 10s. a week.  That is in the year 1965.  The Minister knows that his recruiting drive is a failure and must realise why that is so.  Yet he does nothing about it.  The Minister must realise that if he offers 13/8 a day, he has no chance of securing recruits in view of the competition at Whitegate and the dockyards in the vicinity of Cobh.  Nobody will sell himself for 13/8 a day when he can get a whole lot more money in a far softer job.  The Minister must approach this matter realistically.  It may be that the Minister is going to do that.  It has been the policy of Fianna Fáil not to budget for enough, to show that they are aware of the necessity for economies.  If the Minister faces this matter realistically, he will have to bring in a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the helicopter service could not be used at night or in storms at night to take people off islands or to go to the islands in an emergency.  I do not agree, any more than I agree with the suggestion that helicopters could not establish the position of trawlers out <Col N="1385" /> to the 12 mile limit.  Flares can be used and landings can be made.  Of course, the Minister has firsthand knowledge of this matter.  I believe that at one time he was marooned on one of the islands and could not get off.  It could happen again and it might be very important that the Minister be got off the island.  If, say, there were a division coming up in the House, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach would not be very pleased if he got a message to the effect that the Minister was marooned on an island and that a helicopter could not take him off because it was dark or stormy.  In view of the fact that helicopters were able to take three men off Carnsore in the greatest storm that blew for years, I have no doubt of their ability to operate in bad weather.  The Minister should review the matter and get in touch with the officers in charge of the helicopters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether, having regard to the facts which have been brought to his attention by the Upper Beechwood Avenue Residents' Protest Committee, Dublin, in connection with the sale by Córas Iompair Éireann of the former railway line and permanent way running behind Beechwood Avenue, and to the disappointment and indignation of the residents at their failure to acquire the permanent way by purchase at public auction, he will inquire into how the actual purchaser of the permanent way proposes to use the property; whether he will ask the purchaser to sell the property to the residents at the price paid for it by him, and on failure to secure his agreement if he will introduce legislation either to enable the residents compulsorily to acquire the property or, in the alternative, make regulations concerning the use to which the property will be put, so as to preserve the amenities and value of the various premises in Beechwood Avenue affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The land in question was disposed of by CIE at public auction in accordance with the provisions of the Transport Acts.  It was sold to the highest bidder and I understand that an insufficient bid was made on behalf of the residents.  The future use of the property is a matter for the new owner subject to compliance with the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and regulations made thereunder by the Minister for Local Government and any other relevant statutes and regulations.  I can see no justification for special legislation as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that this problem is likely to arise all over the country and should we not consider directing CIE, as a preliminary step in disposing of abandoned permanent way, to offer it first to adjoining owners on the basis of tender or valuation, and only on its being rejected by adjoining owners <Col N="1392" /> should it be offered by public auction? Otherwise, you could have the situation outside the city in which the permanent way divides one man's farm and the process of purchase by public auction may give a third party a holding creating a rundale situation, in despite of the proprietor of the land on both sites desiring to acquire at an equitable price the permanent way which bisects his holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the relevant section of the Transport Act of 1950, CIE may still apply by public auction or by private treaty to the owners or tenants of the land adjoining the railway property or to the local authority, to the Commissioners of Public Works or to the Land Commission.  In practice, in order to avoid the difficulties mentioned by the Deputy, they do, wherever possible, sell railway land to the adjoining tenants, particularly if there is any desire on the part of the tenant that they should do so.  They have managed to dispose of a good deal of property in a satisfactory manner and I have had very few complaints. In this particular case, they made use of the section of the Act which enables them to choose which method they will adopt because of the long-term legal agreement with the Dublin Gas Company, about which I need not go into detail.  This made it essential to sell the property in large blocks and, having so decided, obviously an auction was the best method of so doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if I can because I think I told the House on previous occasions a fairly ready formula has been evolved by my Department for payments of these claims as soon as the appropriate documents are presented.  The delay is on the side of those whose responsibility it is to present these documents to my officials, and I believe the British customs authorities are involved in this as well as the exporters themselves.  Therefore, I am afraid I cannot give any indication as to when all these little formalities can be cleared.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the maximum amount of loan, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to questions put to me on 11th February, 1965, on the subject.  I stated that the level of the maximum house-purchase loan that may be made by local authorities is kept under review by me and that I would propose an immediate increase in this maximum if I thought that the solution of the problems <Col N="1395" /> currently facing house-purchasers lay in that direction.  I also indicated that in my opinion present difficulties in so far as local authority loans are concerned seem to arise more from the disparity between the prices being asked for houses and their value as determined by local authorities, than from an inadequate maximum loan limit.</P>
    <P>I have no evidence to show that present interest rates as such have any marked disincentive effect on persons proposing to purchase or construct houses for themselves.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1st May, 1964, married quarters for other ranks generally were provided with free light and the charge for the quarters was 5/- per week.  As from that date electricity was charged for at the same rates as charged by the ESB in the area.  To allow for this the charge for the quarters was reduced from 5/- per week to 3/- per week.</P>
      <P>When the meters were installed and where the supply lines were sufficient, the occupants of married quarters were permitted to use appliances in addition to light.  In some cases, as in Cathal Brugha Barracks, it was necessary to renew the wiring to the quarters as the existing supply lines were old and not capable of carrying any extra demand. The internal wiring which was for lighting only was renewed where necessary. The Department does not install wiring other than for lighting but if the occupants desire to use other appliances and the power lines are sufficient, wiring for them may be carried out on a repayment basis.  The provision of the appliances is in all cases a matter for the occupants themselves.</P>
      <P>The renewal of the wiring in Cathal Brugha Barracks commenced in December 1963 and was completed in March 1964 at a total cost of £2,370, including the cost of the supply lines to the individual quarters.  As wiring other than for lighting was not being installed by the Department, an estimate of cost was not made at the time the lighting circuits were being renewed in Cathal Brugha Barracks and it is not now proposed to make such an estimate.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give the average consumption for lighting in quarters prior to the installation of the meters. Since 1st May, 1964, the average consumption of electricity per two-monthly period was 149 units per quarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This suggestion would, of course, require legislation. I am not satisfied that it is practicable to improve the position by new legislation at the present time.</P>
      <P>As was mentioned in reply to previous similar questions, the evidence available from the Garda Síochána is that flick knives are very seldom used in stabbing incidents in this country and there is no reason to think that they are carried to any significant extent.  A comprehensive check made a while ago showed that in a two-year period knives were used in a criminal way on 30 occasions and on only one of these occasions was a flick knife used.  A recent spot check of eight stabbing incidents in the last twelve months shows that in five cases the knives used were penknives; in two others the knives were butchers' knives and the report did not show what kind of knife was used in the other case.</P>
      <P>It cannot be assumed that legislation would have any effect even in relation to the very few cases where a flick knife is used.  There is no reason to think that, in these cases, the culprit would not carry some other, equally dangerous, knife if the flick knife were not available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation banning flick knives would be possible but, for the reasons I have given, it would be of little or no value.  As regards other knives, I do not see how legislation could extend to them without serious interference with the rights of all those who need knives for a variety of <Col N="1402" /> legitimate reasons, and obviously no system of control would be effective. On the figures I have given, the legislation would need to control pen knives if it were to have any real effect.</P>
    <P>It is the practice of the Garda Síochána to institute proceedings against persons found in possession of flick knives where the evidence points to their being carried with criminal intent.</P>

      <P>The existing rights of leaseholders to have their leases renewed and the terms of the renewed leases are contained in the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1931 and 1958, though some leaseholders may have rights under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, as well.</P>
      <P>The 1958 Act deals with persons who hold under certain long leases and whose predecessors in title built the houses concerned.  These persons have a right to a reversionary lease for a term of at least ninety-nine years at a rent which may not exceed one-sixth of the letting value, as defined in the Act.  The 1958 Act was based on the recommendations of a Commission which had inquired into the terms of renewal of these long leases.</P>
      <P>Persons who hold under other leases are in certain circumstances entitled, under Part III of the 1931 Act, to a new tenancy for a period of not less than 21 years at a rent not exceeding the letting value, as defined therein.</P>
      <P>If there is a dispute about the term for which a lease is to be renewed or the rent to be paid under the new lease, the court will settle the terms in accordance with these provisions.</P>
      <P>If these premises are within the scope of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, the occupier is protected from arbitrary increases in rent or demands for possession.</P>
      <P>Full information on the facts of each case would be necessary to determine which of the Acts apply to the Midleton tenants and I presume that the leaseholders concerned have taken legal advice.

      <P>When I reported progress, I was speaking of the desperate condition of our Naval Service. The Minister has confessed that he can put only one corvette to sea.  Even though we have three corvettes, he has only one ship's company.  I have been exhorting the Minister to dispose of the corvettes immediately and provide <Col N="1405" /> armed coastguard cutters.  In spite of the fact we can put only one ship to sea, I see from the strength of the Naval Service, as given in the Estimate, that we have 281 seamen. Could it be that two of these corvettes are not seaworthy?  In addition, we have 45 officers, comprising one captain, three commanders, 14 lieutenant-commanders, 19 lieutenants and eight sub-lieutenants.  I have no objection to the employment of these men, but I wish they were employed in the profession they are qualified to follow&mdash;that of going to sea in ships.</P>
      <P>It appears from what the Minister says that there must be a raffle to know who is going to go to sea and who is going to stay at home.  If we look at the small print, we discover that the Naval Service have 95 civilian employees.  Yet we can put only one boat to sea, and this only a corvette in the small frigate class.  This is a frightful waste of money, men and time.  It is neglect of our valuable fisheries, which are constantly being pillaged.  I thought there would be a great change when the Minister for External Affairs announced here, with a great flourish of trumpets, that our fishery limits had been extended to 12 miles.  There are some great white fishing grounds off the north-west coast and along the west coast, and probably the best herring fishery in Europe today is off our south-east coast but it has been completely abandoned by the Minister for Defence and his Department.  I am sure the personnel of the Naval Service and those who fly our helicopters are able and competent to prevent this. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to take immediate steps&mdash;and by that I mean in a matter of weeks&mdash;to have this whole matter remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to Army pensions.  We all know there are a lot of people getting special allowances who should not get them.  I have that from people who are getting special allowances and who have given fine service to their country.  It is true in many counties, but I shall not go into it.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to one case, which I think is a shame.  I was not a member of the IRA but I <Col N="1406" /> remember during the Trouble&mdash;or what the English journals like to call &ldquo;the Troubles&rdquo;&mdash;a Kerryman who had a job in Waterford.  He was one of the foremost Sinn Féiners there. He was very friendly with two other men.  They were in everything.  I saw them taken and abused by the British Forces.  It was soon realised that this man was an intelligence officer in the IRA.  He was clerk of the court and was, therefore, in the way of getting information not available to the ordinary person.  His two friends were arrested one day and taken through the country as hostages.  They were beaten and blackguarded and lost their health as a result.  When the day came eventually that they could draw a pension, they would not apply.  They told me: &ldquo;We joined as volunteers, and volunteers we remain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This man about whom I am speaking was of the same type.  He is in his eighties now.  He had to retire on the miserable pittance given to a clerk of the court when he comes out.  I am going to write to the Minister asking him to have his officers meet this man. This is no fake case.  This would be only restitution and justice to this man. I know the money will be useful to him, but may be he requires recognition more than money.  Of course, he has his medal and a miserable pittance of a special allowance.  This man was a member of the Sinn Féin movement since 1911 and a member of the IRA. It is an unusual case.  I am sure the Minister, out of ordinary decency and sentiment, will receive my representations and grant the request that his officers should meet this man.</P>
    <P>I would not like the Minister to say: &ldquo;There is a regulation on this; I cannot do it.&rdquo; I have a tremendous regard for this Parliament and for this House.  A Minister of State is the representative of the people and he is the man who is standing between the hard rules and the cold regulations laid down, and when ordinary Deputies appeal to him, he should be able to say to his officials: &ldquo;I want you to meet this man and if and when you find his case is genuine, I want you to report it to me.&rdquo;  That is reasonable and it should be consistently done in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> Lastly, I want to say in passing, and it is more important than perhaps anybody thinks, that I hope that in the coming weeks I will read in the newspapers that the Minister for Defence will have directed that there will be an Army ceremonial at Béal na Blath next August.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with only a couple of matters on this Estimate. My first point is in regard to special allowances.  There are very few of the men who took part in the Fight for Freedom now left and the number is becoming fewer every day.  Even though some of these men may be badly off, they are too proud to apply for this special allowance.  Many who do apply are crippled or are on the verge of dying.  Eighteen months ago, one of those cases was reported to the Minister and the man is still waiting.  During the past 12 months, three people received those allowances between a week and a month after they had died.  Surely if there is any nationality in the Civil Service section of the Department of Defence, it should not take 18 months to judge a man's case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know; the cloak is good.  However, some time or another, the ordinary representatives of the people will get through the cloak and get at the &ldquo;bucks&rdquo; responsible.  There is also what is known as a means test. I do not know where these geniuses come from but I have seen some of their reports, and in one case the value of the produce of 50 hens was double what the Minister for Agriculture is making out of his hens, and that is putting it pretty high.  That was the return made by one of those gentlemen and the reason that man was deprived of a special allowance.  I do not wish to labour that any further but it is high time the Minister, as an Old IRA man himself, looked at this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to examine this Estimate <Col N="1408" /> and ask ourselves what assistance or benefit the ordinary citizen is to get from the expenditure of this money, where would we put our finger?  We would put it on the protection our fishermen are entitled to get from the Department of Defence.  We are now supposed to have a 12-mile limit and I speak on this matter as one who is on the spot, who can see what is happening and who knows what the conditions are.  As I say, this is the one section of the Department which can supply a service to remunerate the citizens for the amount spent on defence. I am leaving aside such things as ceremonials and getting down to bedrock and to what the citizens look for and are entitled to from any Department.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that whatever else he may have to curtail that branch should be put into proper condition immediately in order to be able to carry out its function of protecting our coasts and our fisheries.  I would also suggest that the Minister should take a trip south.  Let him not look for a guard of honour, or anything else, but just drive in and go aboard one of the two vessels lying in port. If he takes his pyjamas with him and spends the night on it, better still, for he will be able to see the conditions under which these people who earn 13/8 a day are expected to live when they go to sea.  I know that in other days the Minister often slept on rough beds, as I did, but he will never find anything to equal the bed he will find on board that ship.</P>
    <P>You cannot expect to hire a man at 13/8 a day.  The wages paid in Irish Steel are between 11 guineas and 20 guineas and the wages paid in Rushbrooke are of the same order.  What kind of creature is going to go into the Navy for 13/8 a day?  These are the very simple matters I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I would suggest that he does not give prior notification to anybody but that he goes down there and see for himself as the Minister responsible and get things straightened out.  He should straighten out the pay of these men.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go any further <Col N="1409" /> into the position as regards the Army but I want to deal with something that affects the livelihood of people who have to live and work in this country. They are the fishermen who go out from our coasts to earn their livelihood and who are entitled to protection and to protection for their nets.  We want to see that protection afforded to them but that cannot be done by the present set-up in the Irish Naval Service.  I am told that it would cost somewhere between £4 million and £5 million to provide any kind of efficient protection. If it does cost that, let us get the money.  There is no use in having white heads out defining a 12 mile limit from our coastline if we are not prepared to protect that limit.  There is no use in looking at the remnants of what we bought from John Bull in 1943 or 1944 to provide that protection. I appeal to the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is for a net sum of £10,440,000, which represents an increase of almost £1 million on last year.  That is not the whole picture. There is a Supplementary Estimate for nearly £2 million to be taken into account.  That is quite a sum of money for this country as far as our defence commitments are concerned and it is not unreasonable to suggest that the time is more than ripe for an inquiry into the whole question of national defence expenditure.  This is a plea I have made in the House on a number of occasions and, by the look of things, it is a plea I will be making for quite a while if I am here.  When it comes to the expenditure of millions, this House does not seem to care how it is spent, but when it comes to social welfare or an extra halfcrown for the old and crippled there is a hullabaloo that the country cannot afford the expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make it quite clear that in the remarks I make I am making no criticism whatever of the personnel in the Army.  I think they are first-class. They are highly efficient, highly disciplined and we can be proud of them but we need something else.  Because I criticise our defence expenditure, it <Col N="1410" /> should not be taken that I am critical of the men who compose what we describe as an army at the present time.  On other occasions less conscientious Ministers sought to suggest that it was my intention to demean the members of the Defence Forces and, by side-stepping the issue in that way, remove any public criticism that might result from my remarks on defence expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in this House in thinking that the time is ripe for an inquiry into defence expenditure.  I remember Deputy Booth getting quite critical of our whole expenditure on defence last year.  There are other Deputies like Deputy Booth who were in the Army during the emergency and if they are serious in making a contribution to this debate, they will tell the House of their worries with regard to the manner in which the money is being expended.  We have no defence policy at the present time and yet we are spending nearly £12 million on defence per year.</P>
    <P>After the last war, some kind of defence arrangement or defence plan was laid down in 1946 and 1947.  At that time our Army authorities planned on the same basis as every other army, on the basis of what had taken place in the previous war.  That is always the case.  They never show any foresight or advanced ideas but base future activity on what has taken place in the past.  That is inevitable and we cannot criticise the individuals involved.</P>
    <P>At that time provision was made for a standing Army of approximately 12,000 men.  The idea was that we would have a trained, professional standing Army of that size and if an emergency arose, we could easily expand it and use that highly trained force for the purpose of organising a much larger force in a short space of time.  Our whole defence expenditure was based on such a standing Army and what it could be expanded into to meet certain eventualities.</P>
    <P>What has happened since 1947?  Is it not a fact that on not one single occasion in the 17 years which have elapsed have we had 12,000 men in the force?  Is it not a fact that at present we are short by 6,000 men of <Col N="1411" /> that figure?  Does that not pose the question that for 17 years we have been aiming at a standing Army of 12,000 men and in not one year have we come within 4,500 or 5,000 of that figure?  Does that not make nonsense of the so-called plans for defence we are supposed to have prepared?</P>
    <P>If ever there was a job in this country in which frustration is rife, it is the Army.  From my own experience it was necessary, particularly for a young officer, to have a very vivid imagination especially when on what are known as manoeuvres. Instructions and detailed orders were given by very important brass hats to junior ranks and questions of strategy were posed.  Questions on landings by enemy troops were also posed and various plans were prepared to defend positions or attack localities during the period of manoeuvres down the years and I am quite satisfied that what took place when I was in the Army is still going on.</P>
    <P>I remember once having responsibility for laying down a large number of anti-tank mines.  I was detailed to get about 100 or 150 tree stumps sawn specially and these were used as pretence antitank mines.  Soldiers were busily drawing red crosses on top of these blocks of timber.  At the same time, no real mines were available but we went through all this type of nonsense supposedly for the benefit of troop training.  No mention was made of the thousands of pounds spent on petrol and oil in running around the country where the local people treated this as something like a show one might stage for the children at Christmas.  Today in the Army they still talk about brigade manoeuvres and divisional manoeuvres and still pretend that a platoon is in fact a battalion for the purpose of defence or attack, while we know there are not more than five men even to represent a platoon in various exercises which are being undertaken but the same amount of time is being wasted and the same amount of material, and it is all based on what somebody read or heard about warfare in other days.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> Let us be frank about this.  This is the space age and whatever planning may have been appropriate in 1945, 1946, 1947, or 1948 regarding defence is certainly not appropriate today.  If it was right to spend money on certain lines in those years, it is not unfair to suggest that we should now examine carefully whether it is desirable or wise to continue spending money on precisely the same lines in 1965.  It is for that reason I ask for the setting up of a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann to examine the whole question of expenditure on defence.  I can only give my views in the House; I do not suggest they are absolutely correct but I hold them and I have had no cause to change my views on this subject for years.  I still see no rebuttal of my arguments.</P>
    <P>The case has been made by other Ministers for Defence over the years that the matter of defence is not the responsibility of this House.  The question of expenditure on defence is the responsibility of the House and there is no suggestion by me of squeezing out of the Army or the Department of Defence particulars about plans for defence.  There is no suggestion of trying to find out whether the Army has a secret weapon which it could launch in case of attack and there is no such thing as allowing it to be accepted that the Army as such has a vested interest in existing on the present lines.</P>
    <P>I think a Committee of this House, fully equipped to examine the whole question of how our money is being spent in conjunction with the defence chiefs, is called for.  I am not accepting, and I do not think the public will accept, the nonsensical argument that defence is a matter for the Army and Government only.  We know the taxpayer is going to pay and he knows perfectly well the Army as it stands today is make-believe.  The taxpayer must be given the facts if he is to foot the bill; he is not prepared to continue being milked for make-believe or prestige purposes.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has given his views on this before but I am afraid that it appears to me his attitude is <Col N="1413" /> that so long as things are all right and carry on from day to day, he will not stir himself.  He has no intention of bringing a hornets' nest about his ears, no intention of standing up to the people who I believe are barring the way to progress and nothing will be done on the lines I suggest until there is a change of Government.  In the meantime, it is no harm to have the views of the various Deputies on very important expenditure like this.</P>
    <P>I shall say no more on the broad issue of defence but I come now to some of the details which I think need to be discussed.  I believe the Minister has power to intervene on these if he is anxious to prove himself a man interested in the personnel of the Army rather than a man prepared to sit there having an easy time and getting away with doing as little as possible.</P>
    <P>If we are to ask young men to join the Army, steps must be taken, apart altogether from the Select Committee to which I have referred, to modernise the Army and bring it up to date.  In saying that, I have in mind the way in which the ordinary soldier is treated in the Army.  There was an example of it here today.  There was a question put by Deputy Ryan concerning the situation in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  I was very glad that the Leader of the Labour Party should have intervened so ably.  Without delaying the House too long, may I say that that case highlights the mentality of those responsible for the welfare of the soldier?  Nobody gave a twopenny tinker's damn for the fact that a soldier's wife had not a plug in the house which would have enabled her to use an electric iron to iron the children's clothes. Not a member of the senior staff in the Army, not a member of the civilian branch which is supposed to be weeping tears over the welfare of the soldier, gave a damn when that barracks was being wired but all these gentlemen's homes are fully equipped with power points, one can be sure.  The outlook of the senior members and the civilian branch is: &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack.  To hell with the private&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> I do not think any Minister for Defence is worth his salt if he does not crush with his heel the heads of these people into the ground.  That type of society should be gone long ago.  It exists outside, but why should we allow it in the Army and then have the audacity to ask people to join and allege that they will be treated as human beings?</P>
    <P>The mentality in the Army today is that a private soldier comes in on the same basis as those who were pressganged 100 to 150 years ago.  There is the greatest distinction between the non-commissioned ranks, the private and the NCO and what goes for the officer personnel above.  There is only one way to deal with that, that is, to give negotiating powers to the rank and file on the same basis as applies to the Civil Service.  There is no good in a private soldier, or a group of soldiers, having a complaint to make having to go right up through the ranks to his commanding officer and then to the Minister for Defence.  The document of complaints is dog-eared by the time it reaches the Minister.  It is well known that it is only rarely that a private soldier will have the strength, the courage and the will to risk the unpopularity of going right through the ranks and causing a stir the whole way up. He knows it will be taken out of him afterwards.  There is only one way to deal with this problem, that is, to set up an arbitration board that will deal with grievances of the non-commissioned personnel.</P>
    <P>This is 1965.  We all take credit and our breasts swell with pride for the achievements and the conduct of our troops in the Congo and in Cyprus but we do not translate that pride into thanks for the men who have caused it.  We are still prepared to give them poor pay when they come home, poor conditions, to segregate their children with regard to educational facilities, to separate them from the officers as if they were two different types of people. There is an apartheid in the Army here as bad in its own way as the colour apartheid in South Africa.  I see no attempt being made to change that position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> Today, in the year 1965, the practice still remains that a group of men with no legal training whatever can administer justice in the Army in the form of courtsmartial.  What kind of power do we hand over to a group of individuals to decide that a man against whom it is alleged that he has been guilty of being absent for 28 days to see his wife or to earn a bit of money outside, can be sentenced by four or five persons who are having the time of Riley, to 56 or 106 days detention, can be deprived of his freedom?</P>
    <P>A district justice who has legal training and ability and who in the normal course deals with offences against the law would think twice about taking the freedom of a man for 56 days or two months.  It would have to be a pretty serious offence. There are two types of justice in this country, two types of court, one administered by the judiciary and the other administered on the basis of the pressgang system of a couple of hundred years ago.</P>
    <P>I want to see the man who will state in this House that the Army is still entitled to courtmartial a soldier. I want to see how far that man has progressed into the twentieth century. I am not concerned with the practice in the British Army.  In many respects it takes them a long time to learn. When starting our Army, we retained many features that have gone by the board in the British Army.  We retained the worst aspects.  Admittedly, we have changed the words of command. That will hoodwink the enemy, no doubt.</P>
    <P>Let us face it.  This is a volunteer Army.  So we are told.  There is no compulsory service in Ireland.  On that basis every recruit joins the Army because (1) he thinks there will be good pay, (2) he likes the service, and (3) he is patriotic.  His motives are a combination of those three, in any order of priority.  The man who goes into that volunteer Army does so on the basis that it attracts him. The pay must be sufficient to attract him.  Are men going into the Army? They are not.  Definitely, the best are <Col N="1416" /> not going in.  When I say that, I am not criticising the recruits but a pretty grim stage has been reached when educational courses have to be started within the Army because a number of recruits are not able to read or write properly.</P>
    <P>We pretend that it is a volunteer Army and that its prestige is high but we want to get it on the cheap.  My point&mdash;and it has taken me a while to come to it&mdash;is that if it is a volunteer Army, there should be standards of pay which will attract men and the conditions of service to which they are entitled.  The fear of dismissal from the Army should be enough to prevent misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>Take the position in the Garda Síochána as an example.  Is there any suggestion of a man going absent for 28 days or for six weeks or two months?  Supposing that should happen, does it not involve automatic dismissal?  There is no such thing as a courtmartial in the Garda Síochána and a group of senior Garda Síochána officers saying: &ldquo;We will courtmartial this guard; he is absent without leave.&rdquo;  Why cannot the same type of discipline be operated in the Army in relation to the rank and file as operates in the Garda Síochána?  If we say the Army is a volunteer Army, that it is a disciplined Army and if we are paying the men, then there should be no such thing as absence and no such thing as applying the sanctions of 100 years ago which were meant for an army which was recruited by compulsion and where life was hell on earth.  The test of an army today is that there will be no such thing as men going absent and no serious offences. If serious offences do take place, the answer is not a courtmartial, but dismissal and, where necessary, a trial in the civil courts.  That is one modernisation aim the Minister should tackle without delay.  Bring the Army up to date and come into 1965.</P>
    <P>There is one point which has been brought to my attention in the past few days by some of the non-commissioned men who have come back from Cyprus and I should like the Minister to do something about it.  This <Col N="1417" /> is in connection with the local service allowance which is given to the group on service in Cyprus, a daily rate of 9/3, irrespective of rank.  I want to bring to the Minister's notice section 4 of this directive.  It says that if this group on active service is withdrawn by the Government after less than three months from the date of departure from Ireland, the allowance will be payable on the basis of 91 days to personnel who have had full service. Personnel who joined the contingent after the arrival of the main body in Cyprus or who are withdrawn for any reason, including medical, will be paid the allowance only for the actual period of service.</P>
    <P>That means that this allowance of 9/3 will be paid even if the group is withdrawn from service before the end of the 91 days.  If any others are sent back for disciplinary or other such reasons, they will not be paid the allowance.  That is reasonable.  However, if they are sent home on medical grounds, it is very unfair that the allowance should be stopped.  A man is willing to volunteer for the 91 days and if, through no fault of his own, he becomes ill and is sent home, he will not get the allowance except for the period he was away.  I intended to put a question to the Minister on this but I thought this was a better way to deal with it.  I hope the Minister will change that.  After all illness is something over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to mention.  Other Deputies have dealt with it and I shall not detain the House.  I notice on today's papers that the President congratulated the Army on its excellent turn-out for the Roger Casement funeral.  I commend that but why not thank the Garda Síochána, who were equally involved? We love to praise the Army but we will not show our praise in a practical way by giving them something in return. High-sounding phrases about the wonderful turn-out and their efficiency are no use to a soldier unless you give him something to put in his pocket.</P>
    <P>I was present at that funeral and I <Col N="1418" /> was present at the grave.  I was very close to the pall-bearers and I have never seen a worse uniform in my life than those men were wearing who carried the remains.  I thought it was dreadful: a long overcoat streeling down to their ankles, the old bull's wool uniform, a completely shapeless outfit.  I looked at it again on television and it appeared even worse.  I compared it with the beautiful cloaks worn by the senior officers.  They looked like people from two different worlds.  That may be Ireland in 1965 but I doubt very much if the man who was being honoured would have any great regard for that kind of difference between the top and the bottom.</P>
    <P>The sum involved in this Estimate is a major sum as far as our economy is concerned.  When I raised this matter today I raised it not in a sense of criticism but in order to ensure that the best possible return is got for the money spent.  I am asking the Minister and the Government again to consider very seriously the idea which has been put forward here and supported by a number of Deputies, namely, that the time is ripe to have a calm, cool appraisal of this expenditure.  I believe the way to do it is through a select committee of the House but whatever way it is done, it must be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters which have come up for discussion in the course of this Estimate is the cost of the maintenance of Army units in Cyprus, and concern has been rightly expressed at the heavy charge which that force involves for a country of our size and resources.  There is a distinction between the principle involved in maintaining a force there and the method of financing the maintenance of that force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the Government's attitude on this matter is that they have adopted a line that the cost of maintaining the force there will be borne entirely out of public funds until the present financial crisis confronting the United Nations is clarified and put on a proper basis.  I know the attitude that has been adopted is tied up with the general question of the whole financial situation as it affects the <Col N="1419" /> United Nations, and particularly arising out of the default of certain member countries to pay their annual contributions.  While one can see a point in that attitude, this situation has now continued for a considerable time and I do not believe it can be left indefinitely in its present unsatisfactory state.  The cost of maintaining a force in Cyprus is a heavy charge on a country with our resources, a country of our size and with the limited financial and other capacities this country has.</P>
    <P>It may well be that prestige can be bought too dearly and at too high a cost.  While we have a duty to perform, and functions to fulfil, as a member of the United Nations there is ample evidence indeed that this country has discharged effectively and to the limit which might be expected, considering our size and resources, its responsibilities not merely in Cyprus but elsewhere as a member of the United Nations.  Very serious consideration must, I think, be given in the near future to the method of financing the Cyprus operation.  So far as the attitude of our people is concerned, they are anxious and willing that the country should make a reasonable contribution to the maintenance of peace in any particular area or make a contribution, adequately commensurate with the size of the country, to the efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations Organisation, whether as a contribution to the operations of the Organisation itself or to the operations of United Nations Forces operating under the direction of the United Nations in any particular situation.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a limit beyond which it would be unreasonable to expect a country of our size and our limited resources to go.  For that reason we should press for clarification at the United Nations of the future financing of forces such as those which at present operate in Cyprus. The manner in which our troops in Cyprus, as well as the troops who represented the country in the Congo and our observers in the Lebanon, carried out their duties has reflected <Col N="1420" /> the highest credit on them as well as on the country.  It has been a useful experience for the officers, NCOs and men who have been able to participate in the various missions abroad.  For that reason it is important that those who seek to serve on these missions abroad as members of units or volunteers should have a reasonable prospect of having their offer of service availed of.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been expressed from time to time, and not without foundation, I think, that the rotation is not as satisfactory as it might be.  A number of individuals have had repeated opportunities of serving abroad, while others, who volunteered, have not had their services availed of.  It is understandable in particular circumstances that those who have had experience may be preferred to those who have not.  Of course, everyone has to have a first time and many of those who have not been successful in having their offer to serve abroad availed of feel some resentment.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that the arrangements made to give officers, NCOs and men an opportunity of serving abroad are absolutely fair and equitable, designed to give equal treatment to all and ensure that those who offer their services will be satisfied that the method of selection is fair and equitable and that no preferences of any sort are allowed to interfere with that selection.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words now on the Equitation School.  I believe it is time to re-examine the whole position.  Since the war, with a few isolated exceptions, the record of the Army Jumping Teams has not been very satisfactory. It is, of course, easy to criticise presentday teams and compare their achievements with the successes of teams in the past, teams which operated in what might be described as the Golden Age of Army jumping teams, namely the late 'twenties and 'thirties, without adverting to the fact that circumstances have altered considerably since then. In most countries since the war, international teams are mixed teams and almost invariably civilian teams.  Up to recently this country adhered to an <Col N="1421" /> all-Army Jumping Team.  So far as I recollect the first occasion on which that type of team was departed from was in the Aga Khan Competition in the 1964 Horse Show.  The team which represented the country on that occasion was successful.</P>
    <P>As I say, when criticisms are expressed of the Army Jumping Team, very often no advertence is paid to the changed circumstances since the war as compared with the conditions which obtained prior to the war.  Before the last war while individual civilians competed on an international basis, as far as teams representing countries were concerned, they were all, I think, Army teams.  Since the war that situation has changed.  Up to recently this country found itself with an Army team competing against a mixed team or a civilian team, or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>The other big change in the approach to international jumping has been the development, not merely in this country but abroad, of a far greater interest in show jumping.  With that greater interest the value and, consequently, the cost of show jumpers has increased very considerably.  For a country the size of ours endeavouring to compete with other countries, that involves particular problems.  On the other hand, we have produced and still are capable of breeding horses comparable with the best produced anywhere.  It is remarkable that some of the most successful show jumpers competing, not merely abroad, but coming here from countries such as Britain, Italy and other continental countries, are Irish-bred horses trained and ridden by citizens of other countries.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise, speaking of the Army team for the moment, that in order to have a good Equitation School, it is necessary to have good horses, which in most cases cost a fair amount, competent horsemen and a third element sometimes overlooked&mdash; a bit of luck.  It is often assumed that because a team or an individual performs badly either the horse, the rider or both are not up to standard.  There is not sufficient appreciation of the fact <Col N="1422" /> that horses and riders are not machines and do not automatically perform in an identical way on one occasion as compared with another.  Very often very good horses and competent horsemen can give very indifferent performances. It has frequently happened that Army teams and individual Army riders have given their best performances at shows abroad.</P>
    <P>While satisfaction is expressed at the successes on these occasions, it has happened on many occasions, particularly since the war, that the standard shown in Dublin, especially in the Aga Khan competition, has not measured up to what might be generally expected. Consequently, disappointment is expressed in a variety of ways, either in letters to the newspapers or references to the failure of Army teams to measure up to the teams of the past without taking into account the changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>Having said that and having made adequate allowance for the changes that have occurred in post-war show jumping, I believe the time has come when the whole question of the Equitation School should be examined from the point of view of deciding at some stage whether in the altered circumstances the School can be maintained and, if it is to be maintained, that only the best will be good enough under any heading, whether it is horses, riders or the facilities available for both.</P>
    <P>For that reason the question of training and the system of recruiting new members to the Equitation School requires very close attention.  In recent years a certain number of places have been reserved in the cadet courses for those who join with the expressed purpose of becoming members of the Equitation School.  Some quite good riders have been recruited in that way. There is, however, a feeling amongst members of the School that the enthusiasm and interest which they might have expected in the School are lacking in some way or other.  Whether that is because, as I say, criticism has been expressed at the inability of the team or individual members to maintain the record built up on a <Col N="1423" /> considerable scale by the teams of the past or whether it is due to the fact that adequate training facilities are not provided, it is difficult to say.</P>
    <P>No effort should be spared to have available for the Equitation School an instructor of the very highest calibre. In fact, in recent times attention has been focussed on the need for training facilities for civilian riders by very competent riders who represented this country abroad.  One in particular expressed himself very strongly on the point.  If our riders of the future are to measure up to the international standards of today, training facilities&mdash; and I include in that instructors of the highest possible calibre&mdash;must be provided. If therefore that is considered necessary for civilian riders, whether as individuals or ultimately as representing the country as part of a team, then it is equally true for the Army team.</P>
    <P>The demand for show jumpers is increasing from year to year and although occasionally very successful purchases have been made at comparatively cheap, or indeed sometimes at bargain prices, by and large the bulk of the successful show jumpers bought in this country are bought by continental or outside buyers.  Even those purchased in the country are purchased at high prices.  While exceptions may occur of very successful purchases being made at a low price, in the main the cost of providing horses up to the required standards involves considerable expenditure.  I note that the sum provided this year for the expenses of the Equitation School at horse shows, and the sum provided for the purchase of horses, appear by past standards quite considerable. In this matter comparisons between present day values and prices and those which obtained prior to the war are no longer valid.  Generally people tend to compare the cost now by dividing it by three or four in order to see whether the figure is three or four times what it was 20 or 30 years ago, but even on that basis it gives no indication at all of the changes which have occurred.</P>
    <P>There is now in this country a much <Col N="1424" /> greater interest in show jumping and the same applies to Britain and the continent.  It is a phenomenon which is difficult to explain but in certain parts of the country, and indeed in other countries, while hunting has suffered a decline because of the erection of wire fences, the development of stud farms and the restrictions involved in the interests of eradicating such diseases as bovine tuberculosis amongst livestock, there has been, on the other hand, a resurgence in the growth of and interest in show jumping which has been far greater than anything experienced previously.  In some cases this is a genuine interest and in others it may be described by that somewhat overused phrase as one of the status symbols.  Whatever the explanation there has been a remarkable growth.  That is welcome because it ensures a market here for suitable types of horses which can be bred here and which are comparable with the best produced anywhere, and better than most.  It also makes up for the decline in the use of horses for other purposes.  It has encouraged breeding and in many cases helped to stimulate interest among people who might not otherwise be interested in bloodstock, in show jumpers as well as in hunters.</P>
    <P>So far as the Army and the Equitation School are concerned it does involve very radical differences in endeavouring to build up and maintain a team compared with the costs that existed prior to the war.  For that reason the Minister should consider the future of the School, and if it is to be maintained, adequate recognition will have to be given to the changes which have occurred and to the need for providing training of the highest possible standard and to the consequential cost involved in maintaining an adequate pool of horses and of riders.</P>
    <P>As I say, the enthusiasm and interest which some members of the Army Equitation School felt would exist in the School appears to be lacking and I urge most strongly that if the school is maintained, it should be maintained on the realisation that in the past it proved one of the best possible <Col N="1425" /> advertisements for Irish horses and I believe that that, too, would be the position in the future.  Undoubtedly circumstances have changed and publicity has been given in many ways to the successes of Irish horses, to flat racers as well as to show jumpers and hunters, but there is another aspect, that is, that show jumping is one of the sports which are seen to greatest advantage on television.  People who have watched show jumping freely admit that on television you can obtain a better view of particular fences than if you were actually at the arena, no matter how well placed on a stand.</P>
    <P>This has aroused a much wider interest in this sport and has evoked a response which indeed was reflected here last August 12 months when the Irish team was successful in the Aga Khan jumping competition.  Similarly, when teams or individual competitors from this country have competed at Wembley or the White City, the number of viewers as well as the interest shown by persons who follow these competitions on television was very considerable.  That has evoked an interest in horses far greater than anything which existed before but it has also evoked the realisation that greater expenditure is necessary than anything which existed in the past if the country is to maintain an Equitation School at the standard and up to the expectations which most people in this country would hope to see in an Irish team.</P>
    <P>Comparisons between the teams of today and teams of the past are not strictly valid because of the changes which have occurred in this and in other countries, the presence of mixed teams and the great development of civilians in promoting either individual competitions or teams to represent their countries.  With very few exceptions, it is beyond the financial capacity of individuals in this country to maintain horses and to have riders available to compete with civilian teams abroad.  In America, Britain and the continental countries, there are wealthy owners, people who are interested in show jumping and who are prepared to pay substantial sums to secure sufficient horses to represent <Col N="1426" /> them.  It is possible for such countries to have civilian teams.</P>
    <P>In this country that situation does not exist and is not likely to exist. Here people compete for the satisfaction or pleasure of doing so, or because they ultimately hope to sell a horse which has successfully competed. For that reason it is important, so far as teams representing this country are concerned, that the Army should maintain sufficiently high standards and have available from Army sources riders capable of measuring up to international standards.</P>

      <P>I move that leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to apply certain sums out of the Central Fund to the service of the years ending on the thirty-first day of March one <Col N="1427" /> thousand nine hundred and sixty-five and one thousand nine hundred and sixty-six and to authorise the creation and issue by the Minister for Finance of certain non-interest-bearing securities.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that there is an extra clause in the Central Fund Bill which authorises the Minister for Finance to issue a new form of interest bearing security.  It is really a new form of loan where the capital will accumulate and the clause gives power to the Minister to issue it.  I shall explain it more fully at a later stage.</P>
