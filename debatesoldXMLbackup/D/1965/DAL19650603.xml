    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="324" /> SECTION 13.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister the reason for the change in the wording as between section 13 in the present Bill and the corresponding section 13 in the previous Bill.  In the previous Bill, it was set out that &ldquo;extradition shall not be granted for offences contrary to laws relating to taxes, duties, customs and exchange&rdquo;. That has been condensed in this Bill to read:</P>
      <P>Extradition shall not be granted for revenue offences.</P>
      <P>Article 5 of the Convention refers to fiscal offences.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Extradition shall be granted in accordance with the provisions of this Convention for offences in connection with taxes, duties, customs and exchange only if the contracting parties have so decided in respect of any such offences or category of offences.</P>
      <P>It seems to me the 1963 Bill introduced by the Minister's predecessor conformed more closely to the terms of Article 5 of the Convention than does the more general wording inserted into section 13 of the present Bill.  It may be that the Minister has been advised&mdash; I presume that is the case&mdash;that the phrase &ldquo;revenue offences&rdquo; extends to cover offences relating to taxes, duties, customs and exchange.  But, without some explanation from the Minister, that is not immediately apparent and, therefore, I think the Minister should explain the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This really goes back to section 3 where we have defined revenue offences very specifically. The section reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;revenue offence&rdquo;, in relation to any country or place outside the State, means an offence in connection with taxes, duties or exchange control but does not include an offence involving the use or threat of force, or perjury or the forging of a document issued under statutory authority or an offence alleged to have been committed by an <Col N="325" /> officer of the revenue of that country or place in his capacity as such officer;</P>
    <P>The purpose of that definition is to make it quite apparent that this is in ease of a person who may be claiming an exception in that it makes it quite clear that it applies to a specific revenue offence and, with some exceptions, to any offence which might be regarded as a revenue offence but would really be a common law offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not make sense to me.  Either we propose to exempt from the general power of extradition all offences relating to fiscal matters, such as fraud on the Revenue or what are generally regarded as fiscal matters.  Do we intend to exclude smuggling?  What does the Minister mean to exclude from the general power of extradition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an example&mdash;&ldquo;cooking&rdquo; the books, embezzlement, which may involve defrauding the Revenue but is, in effect, an embezzlement charge in common law.  That would be an offence related to revenue matters and would come into the category of an excepted offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in understanding the Minister as saying that where the offence is one of embezzlement, or something in conflict with the common law, in which it is sought to put the cloak of respectability upon it by contending it was done primarily to defraud the Revenue, and the other was only a secondary result, that will bring the delinquent within the protection provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will determine which is the common motive?  Will any element of common law offence in what is, in fact a revenue offence make a person liable to extradition? There must be somebody who will decide somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts will do that.  That is the purpose of the provision. <Col N="326" /> We are allowing the High Court to decide on the facts what is a revenue, political or military offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the remedy for a person threatened with extradition is to go to the courts on a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> on the ground that it is sought to extradite him on the ground of a revenue offence and it will be for the courts to determine whether the grounds for extradition are, in fact, pure revenue or mixed to such a degree as would justify his extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The situation when the Bill becomes law will be that the person who is arrested must automatically go before the district court.  If the arrested person makes the case in the district court that the offence with which he is charged is an excepted offence the district justice will explain to the person concerned his right to go to the High Court or the Minister for Justice for a decision as to whether or not it is an excepted offence.  That will be the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise impossibilities for the Minister to answer off the cuff because I know the difficulty in trying to do that, but there is present in the minds of many of us a pretty famous case in which a gentleman became involved in whiskey on which he did not pay duty, or something like that, and took refuge in this country.  Suppose the authorities charge him with a traffic offence and we know well that what they are really trying to do is to get him back within the jurisdiction to clap the other charge upon him, which would be a charge of substance, do we simply surrender him, although manifestly the spirit and the intention of the legislation is that he should not be surrendered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended, I think to be in accord with section 20 but they are entitled to proceed only on the matter extraditable.  I think one has to take it more or less on faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is so. On the face of the warrant, it is a road traffic offence the person is <Col N="327" /> charged with and we will have to accept that as a matter of faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have to be a serious road traffic offence to bring him within the Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Convention provides that he will not be prosecuted for anything other than the offence in relation to which he is extradited but, if they proceed to prosecute for a revenue offence, there is nothing we can do about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why the last part of this section appears: &ldquo;unless the relevant extradition provisions otherwise provide&rdquo;.  It seems to me to be unnecessary to have that phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point there is that we will still have a number of extradition arrangements to make&mdash; eventually, we hope, with every country in the world.  These will vary in character.  As far as the immediate future is concerned, we shall have arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland and with a number of European countries which have ratified the Convention, but we hope to expand this into a scheme of extradition arrangements with every country in the world.  America is an obvious example.  Under this Bill we will have power to make such extradition arrangements as we may devise between ourselves and the United States.  These may involve reciprocal arrangements for the extradition of nationals.</P>

      <P>I should like to repeat what I said about this on Second Reading.  This seems to me an improvement on the position in that it puts this country in the position, if we so wish, of seeking that what might be regarded as the traditional Anglo-American <Col N="329" /> code in relation to extradition will apply rather than the purely continental code which is, generally speaking, envisaged in the Convention. Under this section we can have <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the case against a person being extradited or where extradition is being requested.</P>

      <P>The Minister may refuse extradition if he is of opinion that the case is one in which extradition is prohibited under any provision of this Part or under the relevant extradition provisions.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that should read &ldquo;the Minister shall refuse&rdquo;.  I do not think it should be left in any way discretionary to the Minister in a case where it is clear that extradition is prohibited.  It is only a drafting point, but I think it should be made.</P>

      <P>It may be, but I would be obliged to know what it is for.  It says that transit through the State of a person being conveyed in custody from one country to another on his surrender pursuant to an agreement in the nature of an extradition agreement may be granted by the Minister following a request to that effect made by the country to which he is being conveyed.  The person who is in custody during such transit should be in lawful custody.</P>
      <P>Is it envisaged here that this is a situation in which someone arrested in America is being brought to, say, Germany and for some reason comes down at Shannon?  While he is in this country he is transferred by bus from Shannon to Dublin and then transhipped. Is that exactly what it is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me as odd that we should provide here by statute that a person who is in custody during such transit should be in lawful custody.  After all, custody goes right to the root of <i>habeas corpus.</i> It seems an odd situation that we should envisage a situation arising in which police of a foreign country can hold in lawful custody within our jurisdiction a third party.  This seems a complete departure from the whole conception of our sovereignty which charges the Minister for Justice, as the responsible Government Minister, with the safety and protection of every individual person's liberty within our jurisdiction.  This is a very fundamental principle which we ought to be very slow to abridge <Col N="334" /> for practical convenience.  I do not know whether this is an essential element in the Convention, which we are trying to implement by this Bill, but I have an instinctive reaction against the whole conception of allowing foreign police to hold in lawful custody any person within our jurisdiction. I am sure that must be an instinctive reaction which the Minister shares.</P>

      <P>I have a certain sympathy with what the Deputy says but the facts of the matter are that in any arrangement with other countries there will be some element of a limitation of sovereignty.  If I may, I will take the practical example given by the Deputy of a person coming from America to Germany, who is detained at Shannon Airport.  If he is deemed to be in lawful custody, as we suggest here, and if he escapes from Shannon Airport, what are we to do about it if we have not ensured that he cannot be re-arrested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very thin.  I am not so sure I agree with the Minister.  If he escapes from the custody of his custodians, he is then a refugee and the State's concern for him is that he is extradited.  A person arrives at Shannon Airport in lawful custody and goes out of the custody of his custodians.  If it is then discovered that he was in the lawful custody of his custodians for an offence for which we would not extradite him and he now claims asylum of the foreign Government which extradited him, what happens?  There is no <i>prima facie</i> case against this man for that offence.  He will then be entitled to asylum.</P>

      <P>My father was in lawful custody at the courts of Clonmel. He hooked it out of Clonmel, got a boat at Bulloch Harbour and landed in France.  I have a feeling that people in &ldquo;lawful custody&rdquo; are not necessarily in lawful custody.  I am sure there is a good foundation for this. Lawful custody in this country should consist of a custody imposed under our law.  What we are doing under subsection (2) is recognising as lawful custody a custody imposed under a law for which we have no responsibility. All through this Bill, we have followed this theme.</P>
      <P>If this kind of offence alleged against a foreign citizen is generally recognised as being an offence for which he ought to be made answerable to the law, we are prepared to surrender him to a civilised Government to have him made answerable to the law, but we reserve the right to say, in respect of certain categories of offenders, that we do not feel any obligation to surrender them for the type of prosecution to which they would be submitted if we handed them back to the foreign sovereign power which claims jurisdiction over them.  So, we have always retained our over-riding right to determine the fate of anybody who is within our jurisdiction. I do not like the thought of our creating, by statute, a situation in which a person can travel in our jurisdiction in the lawful custody of police over whom we have no jurisdiction. Is there not something wrong with it?</P>

My problem is this: do we want to create a statutory situation in which a person is in the lawful custody of police over whom we have no control within our jurisdiction? I do not think we ought to do that.  If the Minister says that, for the practical application of this whole pattern of extradition, some device of this kind is necessary, I would ask him to consider whether there is not some means of saying that if a person is in lawful custody in our jurisdiction he shall remain in the lawful custody of the Garda Síochána until he goes out of our jurisdiction: if a person arrives in lawful custody, we will hold him in it until he passes out of it again but, while in our jurisdiction, that matter is for our Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Dillon is of substantial importance.  It seems to me that possibly the difficulty has arisen because of a very severe compressing in our section 40 of Article 21 of the European Convention on Extradition. It seems to me that a number of the matters which Deputy Dillon has very rightly raised were possibly envisaged in the Convention because Article 21 of the Convention contains very much <Col N="337" /> fuller provisions than are contained in section 40 of this Bill.  In the first place, it provides that the entire matter is permissive: that is brought out clearly enough in the section because the Minister may, or may not, as he himself decides, grant these facilities for transit.  It then deals with the use of air transport where it is simply a question of flying across or landing. Article 21 provides that when it is intended to land, the requesting party shall submit a formal request for transit.  This provision, if operated, could go a long way towards meeting the case made by Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>The Convention then provides that a party may, however, at the time of signature or of the deposit of its instrument of ratification of, or accession to, this Convention, declare that it will only grant transit of a person on some or all of the conditions on which it grants extradition.  The Convention further provides that the transit of extradited persons shall not be carried out through any territory where there is reason to believe that his life or his freedom may be threatened by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion.  The whole operation is a permissive one.</P>
      <P>I think it certainly should be possible for the Minister to make it clear, in reply to any request for transit, that the transit will have to be carried out under the supervision, say, of a member of the Army here or of our Garda Síochána so that we would preserve, while in transit, the position where the custody is our custody and not the custody of police from another country over which we have no control whatever. I think the fact that, quite rightly, is worrying Deputy Dillon is that we would have no control whatever.  But if we stipulate that we will grant it on conditions, one of which will be that an Army officer or a member of the Garda Síochána shall supervise the transit, then I think we would be preserving the position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 12 and 13, to delete &ldquo;to the High Court or the Minister for his release in pursuance of this Part&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for an order of <i>habeas corpus</i> or for his release under section 50,&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that it is made quite plain on the face of the section that, in addition to the statutory rights under section 50, the person detained has his fundamental constitutional rights on the application of an order for <i>habeas corpus.</i> I think it is desirable, having regard to the discussion here on the Second Stage, to have it spelled out because there might be a situation where the applicant might not come under Section 50.  Section 50 is primarily designed to deal with exempted offences but if there were something wrong with the warrant, something illegal on the face of the warrant, not <Col N="339" /> just a matter of whether or not the offence was an exempted offence, then of course the detained person would have a fundamental right to go for an order of <i>habeas corpus</i> on whatever grounds he saw fit.</P>
    <P>It is not essential to have it in.  So long as the Constitution is there, everybody has this right but I think it is desirable to spell it out there along with the statutory rights.</P>

      <P>I would entirely agree with the Minister's decision that it is desirable to spell out in the amendment we have just adopted the fundamental right of <i>habeas corpus</i>, which is inherent in the Constitution.  In that connection, I should like to be reassured that, under section 44 which forms part of this whole group protecting the rights of the individual, there is a proviso that if the offence in respect to which extradition is sought is a political offence, or an offence under military law, or a revenue offence, extradition shall not be granted, and the Minister or the High Court, on the question being referred to the High Court by the Minister, shall direct that in accordance with this section the warrant shall not be endorsed.</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear in my mind as to how the individual in respect of whom extradition is sought gets to the court.  If the Minister threatens to endorse the warrant and the individual thinks he can make a case before the court that the foreign power sought to extradite him for a political offence, or an offence under military law or a revenue offence, how does he get to the courts to get a declaration that the charge against him falls under one of these three heads and that, therefore, no endorsement should be made to the warrant?</P>

      <P>This is, if you like, a separate additional protection, apart from the basic protection in the Bill for arrested persons.  Where a person has been arrested, he must be <Col N="340" /> brought before the District Court.  On being brought before the District Court he has two remedies.  He may plead that the offence is an exempted one and he may ask that the matter be decided by the Minister or the High Court, or he may come by way of <i>habeas corpus</i> to the High Court.</P>
      <P>In section 44 there is a further protection in that, before the execution of the warrant and before it is even endorsed, I, as Minister for Justice, may have the matter referred to me by the Commissioner of the Garda.  I may then make a decision, or I may refer the matter to the High Court, on whether or not the warrant should be endorsed at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In section 14, subsection (4), page 7, line 52 to delete &ldquo;place&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;road&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the House was discussing this <Col N="341" /> Bill on Committee Stage, there were only two points of substance raised and these were both raised by Deputy Dillon.  I promised I would have another look at those points before Report Stage.  The first point concerned the phrase &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in section 14(4).  Deputy Dillon suggested that the phrase was too restrictive and that it should be replaced by the words &ldquo;public road&rdquo;.  The Deputy considered that in certain areas a small farm might be so situated that the laying of poison on any portion of it might contravene the law.  I think the Deputy has a point, and I have tabled this amendment accordingly.</P>
    <P>The second point Deputy Dillon raised was that in section 20 (1) the limit of four greyhounds permitted to be exercised or led in public by one person should be increased.  The original proposal in the Bill, as prepared by those who sponsored it as a Private Members' Bill, was that the number of greyhounds to be led or exercised in public should be limited to two.  It was also proposed that there should be an age limit below which a person should not be allowed to lead greyhounds in public.  The proposal now in the Bill was reached after consultation with Bord na gCon and the sponsors of the Bill, and I think it represents a fair compromise.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the view expressed in relation to the second point.  I think the Bill would have been improved if &ldquo;public place&rdquo; had been omitted and if it had been left as &ldquo;public road&rdquo;.  There is provision in relation to &ldquo;open park&rdquo;.  I think there will be exactly the same difficulty in relation to section 20 as there was in relation to the other amendment which dealt with the point raised by Deputy Dillon.  I agree that it is very bad to enact a law which will be broken constantly.  At the same time, I feel that members of the Garda have more to do than to go up <Col N="342" /> lanes, culs-de-sac and byroads on which dogs might be exercised in breach of section 20.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of difficulties of which the Minister would be fully aware if he represented a rural constituency.  There may be one person living at the very far end of a road but from the point of view of the local authority taking it over, the case is always made that the public go up the road, that the postman, the priest and the doctor go up that road. I think the Minister might find himself in exactly the same difficulty.</P>
      <P>However, the Bill cannot be amended any further now.  The one point where it was amended is an improvement. It is quite clear that the Bill was substantially improved during its passage through the Seanad.  The original Bill, while it was desirable in many aspects&mdash;and its desirability is proved by the fact that we are now passing it &mdash; was undoubtedly too narrow in some aspects.  We must always endeavour in dealing with matters like this to keep a proper balance.  We all know the trite cliché that nature is cruel, or that parents have to be cruel to be kind.  We must endeavour to ensure that unnecessary or wanton suffering is not caused while, at the same time, not hampering the farmers in their difficult battle to win from nature the fruits of nature.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Sweetman that we have now got a very workmanlike Bill which makes very great advances in the whole sphere of the protection of animals, particularly in view of the fact that it covers all animals, including wild animals.  Government Departments have been most helpful and co-operative. I know the Society would wish me to pay tribute to the officials and Ministers of the Departments of Justice and Agriculture for taking such a kindly interest in the Bill since its inception.  We can look forward to this Bill being enforced by public opinion rather than by Garda intervention.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned the difficulty the Garda would have in keeping an eye on how many greyhounds were being exercised down a boreen.  I do not think that is the way this Bill, when it is an Act, will be worked.  Members of the public will now know that they are entitled to report cases which are breaches of the Act.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate all those who worked so hard to draft it, and also Senators who worked so hard to make it a more practical Bill than it was originally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the question was posed to the Minister by another Deputy last week as to whether there would be some person in the Government, either a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary, who would take full responsibility for the fishing industry. I do not know what duties have been assigned to the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary.  It is possible that he may be in charge of Fisheries.  I think the fishermen of this country, both the sea fishermen and the inland fishermen, are entitled to be displeased with the treatment of this industry in recent years.  Sometimes it is the responsibility of the Minister for Lands; for a time it was the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture; and sometimes it is given over entirely to a Parliamentary Secretary.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that he has enough on his plate in dealing with the vast problems of what I would call pure agriculture. I do not question his ability to administer and preside over either the Fisheries Section or the Department of Agriculture but I suggest that there is such great potential in the fishing industry, it is a full time job.</P>
      <P>The two <i>Programmes for Economic Expansion</i> envisaged great things for this industry but the progress forecast certainly has not been achieved since the two Programmes were announced. Therefore, the Minister should say whether he will be in charge of the Fisheries Section as Minister for Agriculture or whether he will delegate this responsibility to his Parliamentary Secretary, because, again let me stress it, this is a full-time job and I think it is due to the fishermen, inland and sea, that there should be somebody with full-time responsibility in charge of the Section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister seemed optimistic about the fishing industry. He seemed particularly optimistic with regard to the sea fisheries.  The White Paper published in April, 1962, envisaged rapid and effective expansion and stated that the fishing industry would contribute to a greater degree to the expansion of the economy.  To say the least of it, this has not happened.  We were furnished in 1964 with a Progress Report on the <i>Second Programme <Col N="345" /> for Economic Expansion.</i> At page 44, in which there is a table showing the landings of sea and shell-fish from 1960 to 1964, there is evidence pointing to a decline in landings and, of course, consequently in the sea fishing industry.</P>
    <P>This must be disturbing because we have always regarded the fishing industry as having great potential.  Apparently that potential has not been exploited.  The table on page 44 of the Progress Report on the Second Programme shows that the value of landings of sea and shell-fish in the years 1960 to 1964 dropped somewhat. It seems to me, therefore, a greater effort must be made by the Minister for Agriculture or whoever will be in exclusive control of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Second Programme was that the landings of sea fish should be doubled between 1960 and 1970. We find that the landings of fish between 1960 and 1964 have fallen and therefore it seems that the task between 1965 and 1970 is to treble the landings of sea and shell-fish.  Whether we can achieve the targets set by the Second Programme is, to say the least, very questionable.  The Minister referred&mdash; if he did not, the 1964 Progress Report did&mdash;to the big decrease or, as it is described, the dramatic drop, in the landings of herrings at Dunmore.</P>
    <P>Most Members of the House who take an interest in sea fishing know the reason, or part of it, for the dramatic drop in the landings of herrings at Dunmore.  Whether this problem in Dunmore will be resolved, I do not know.  I am sure Members of the House will be pleased to hear some comment from the Minister as to whether it can be resolved.  I do not know what effect it has had on the fishing industry generally but it appears from the Progress Report to which I have referred that the imports of canned fish have increased since 1964. I suggest the Minister should inquire into this and consider the desirability of cutting down imports of canned fish instead of allowing them to increase as they did in 1964.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister&mdash;this would be a good criterion as <Col N="346" /> to the success of the aims of the Second Programme in regard to fisheries&mdash;how many people are engaged in sea fishing. I know it is difficult to say because of the fact that sea fishing is a seasonal occupation, that employment varies from season to season, but it would be revealing to the House and the country if the Minister could give us some idea of how many are getting an adequate livelihood all the year round from sea fishing.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the training of boys as fishermen.  I suggest we need greater detail as to what has happened since this training scheme was inaugurated, as to what response there has been and whether the Minister is satisfied with it.  I know how difficult it is to induce boys to train as fishermen.  It is an arduous occupation and, I suppose, if the money is not good, not too attractive. I suggest that if we are to attract boys into training as fishermen and fishermen into training as skippers, there will have to be greater inducement than there is at the moment.</P>
    <P>Another problem I should like to refer to is the question of responsibility of the Minister or Bord Iascaigh Mhara for defective boats and engines that have been supplied to fishermen through the Board.  I raise this matter because I have experience of a particular case.  The suppliers of boats or engines have been approved by the Board but the evidence as I see it is that the Board take no steps to protect the boat owners when it has been shown that the boats are defective or, as in the case of which I have some knowledge, the engine is defective.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara insist on repayments for the purchase of engines or boats but the fisherman seems to have no protection if he discovers after a short time that the engine or boat which he got through loan from the Board is defective.  I brought one case to the notice of the Board and the Fisheries Section, which was under the Department of Lands then.  The unfortunate fisherman had no redress. His engine was proved to be defective but the Board did not seem to mind. They told him it was a matter between him and the suppliers of manufacturers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> I do not think that is good enough. This boat owner&mdash;I am sure it has happened in other cases&mdash;was left to battle out his dispute with the suppliers &mdash;I cannot remember their names&mdash; who had been approved by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, or the Minister, or both.  If that is so and if the Board advanced the money for the purchase of the engine or boat, I submit they have a responsibility to protect the boat owner who finds himself saddled with a defective boat or engine.</P>
    <P>One of the great complaints of the fishermen down the years has been that their boats have not been big enough to enable them to fish beyond what is regarded as the inshore fishery area.  The <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisaged the provision of 65-foot boats.  I wonder could the Minister tell us what progress is being made in regard to providing that type of boat and how many have been built over the past few years.  It must also be obvious that many of these bigger and, indeed, better boats, will be needed by the fishermen in view of the new field of fishing that will be available from the final extension of the fishing limits. This new area will be in the main exclusive to Irish fishermen.  It would be a pity if, for lack of proper boats, they could not exploit this new fishing ground.  There was a recommendation in the White Paper in regard to the provision of more boats of 32-feet for shell fishing because it was believed that there was a good market for this type of fish.  Perhaps, when the Minister is replying, he will also indicate what progress has been made in regard to the provision of the 32-foot boat in view of what has been said about the excellent market for shell-fish.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister for Agriculture should ignore the development of the smaller harbours.  Certain large harbours have been earmarked for major development and reconstruction schemes but it seems to me that many of the smaller harbours are being neglected.  There are some in my own constituency.  To mention one, there <Col N="348" /> is Kilmore which has a good number of boats.  The fishermen have been waiting for years to have the Kilmore Quay harbour put into proper condition. It is true that work is to be commenced on the reconstruction and development of Kilmore Quay harbour this summer.  I suppose it is a good thing that it will start this year but the question has been discussed for many years by the Wexford County Council, the Board of Works and the Fisheries Section of the Department of Agriculture.  These delays are most frustrating and annoying to the fishermen, to say the least, and they cannot afford to wait for a period of five to ten years in order to keep their boats in the water and obtain a decent living.  Whilst I do not disagree with the development of places like Dunmore, Galway and other places which were mentioned, I believe the Minister should concern himself with the development and the maintenance&mdash;that is probably a matter for the county council&mdash;of the smaller harbours and concentrate on that aspect to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to marketing. This is I suppose one of the biggest problems in regard to improving the fishing industry.  I do not know whether it was stated by the Minister or whether it was said in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> that the effort must be made to improve distribution and encourage increased consumption.  I do not know whether we have improved distribution.  I know that steps have been taken to encourage the consumption of fish and there have been fish cooking competitions and displays.  I was particularly attracted to a suggestion made by Deputy P. O'Donnell from Donegal.  I did not get to see the Spring Show this year but Deputy O'Donnell mentioned the excellent stand which Irish Sea Fisheries had.  He thought it would be a good idea if that were copied in provincial areas.  If that is a worthwhile suggestion, the Minister should seriously consider it.  It must be acknowledged that we are not a fish-eating country.  There may be a particular reason for that, which I do not think needs to be mentioned, but a <Col N="349" /> greater effort will have to be made to ensure that the fishermen will obtain a greater income from the consumption of fish here.  There does not seem to be any dynamic effort being made to promote a sales campaign or to do any of the things recommended in the White Paper of April, 1962.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know if there are statistics available to show how we rate as fish consumers compared with other European countries. My belief is that we fall behind other countries in this regard but it would be interesting if the Minister had figures to give us.  That sort of information would give us some idea about what our targets should be in trying to extend the home market.</P>
    <P>The Minister or the White Paper also referred to assistance to retailers. It is difficult to see what effective assistance is being given.  It is not the Minister's responsibility but I am aware of one retailer who was anxious to sell fish caught off the Wexford coast and the unfortunate man had to wait for months to get a telephone installed. I do not know whether or not there is liaison between Departments but I feel that if we wanted to increase consumption and distribution a retailer could have been facilitated in a small matter like that.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I wish to refer and that is the subject-matter of a deputation we had to the Minister last week regarding monofilament nets.  I can understand the anxiety of the Minister and his officials to protect the inland fisheries particularly in regard to salmon.  I do not know whether we have a proper balance in respect of salmon fishing.  It is alleged on the one side that the net fishermen are being allowed to get more than their share of salmon in the river estuaries and, on the other hand, it is alleged by net fishermen that the rod fishermen are getting an undue proportion of salmon.  I do not pretend to know what the proper balance should be.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the importance of the inland fisheries and I appreciate their importance to the tourist industry but, <Col N="350" /> equally, I appreciate the importance of fishermen getting a decent livelihood. These monofilament nets have proved successful as far as the net fishermen are concerned, too successful, according to the Minister and those who are interested in rod fishing of salmon.  The Minister recently took steps to ban the use of this monofilament net.  I think neither he nor anybody else could say now whether he was right or wrong because these monofilament nets have been on trial for the past three or four months and I doubt if anybody can say what, if any, damage is being done to the rod fishermen of salmon rivers.  The Minister suspended the ban on these nets for a period and allowed them to be used until, I think, last Monday when the net fishermen had to revert to the nets they had been using for years and years.  I do not think net fishermen made any secret of the fact that they were doing fairly well with these nets but they have had many lean years for the past 15 or 20 years and so far as the estuary of the Slaney is concerned, they have had very lean years.  Incidentally, they do not use these monofilament nets in the Slaney Estuary but in Dunmore they seem to be particularly successful.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised an inquiry to decide whether or not these nets should be used and that inquiry may be held in the autumn.  It seems to me the decision has been more or less given.  The Minister has expressed a view that these nets should not be used.  I suggested to the Minister&mdash;I do not expect him to change his mind now &mdash;on that deputation that these nets should be allowed until the end of the season and then have the inquiry.  Now it seems the monofilament net is condemned before the inquiry.  There cannot be a proper assessment of the effect of the use of these nets over a period of two, three or four months and nobody could say what the effect on rod fishermen would be.  That could be done, not in one season, but only over a number of seasons.  The Minister, however, seems to have made up his mind but I must assure him that there will be hardship among net <Col N="351" /> fishermen who believed, and who had evidence, that the monofilament net was good for them and would enable them to catch more salmon.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to have the inquiry as soon as possible and I also ask him if there is any scheme of compensation, or if there could be one instituted, in his Department to compensate these net fishermen who went to some expense prior to the regulation being made in January in purchasing these monofilament nets.  They cannot afford to spend £150 or £160 and then be told by any Minister in a regulation that these nets are banned.</P>

    <P>I ask this because, as the Minister is probably aware, the River Boyne is to be drained under a scheme which is to start some time in 1966.  For generations there have been living in Mornington, at the mouth of the Boyne, fishing folk who derive their livelihood entirely from the river.  They fish for salmon during the salmon season and pick mussels during the off-season and never seek anything from the State or anybody else.  It appears <Col N="353" /> these people would gain very considerably if the fishmeal factory were established on their doorstep but if the Boyne is to be drained and if there is the same result as in the case of other big rivers that were drained, if, in fact, for a number of years the salmon and mussel fishing is to be completely wiped out, there must be some other way by which these people will be allowed to earn their living.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that this is of vital interest and that an early statement from him would be welcome.  Whether the factory is going ahead or not, there must be some compensation arrangements for the people who will, I might say certainly, lose their entire income because of progress.  Nobody will object to the arterial drainage of the Boyne because it will benefit so many people further down the river but I am sure everybody agrees that it will be just too bad if this community of roughly 40 families were put out of business for a period of years because of this work, without any compensation being paid to them.  If it happened in any other line of industry &mdash;at present we hear a lot of talk about redundancy compensation and all the rest of it&mdash;the matter would be attended to by the State.  Here is a case where it should also be attended to by the State.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Corish's comments on the question of monofilament nets.  We have not got them down there yet.  We are still using the old type nets.  But, over the past few years the amount of salmon being caught by the nets has been increasing, as the Minister is aware.  I make no apology for stating that the first people entitled to consideration as far as salmon fishing is concerned are those who make their livelihood by salmon fishing and that their interests must come before those of persons who fish for pleasure.  That cannot be denied. It is not as if there were nets stretched across the river for 24 hours of the day to prevent salmon from getting up, because salmon, as those of us who have any little knowledge of them know, are contrary creatures and <Col N="354" /> travel in types of water which other fish may avoid and even at very low tide sometimes salmon find their way up, with the result that quite a considerable number of salmon go up whether fishing is carried out by local fishermen or not.</P>
    <P>As far as the catching of salmon is concerned, of course, the Minister has still got the penal clause of twopence per pound which he collects and he states in his brief that he is able to give adequate assistance to the boards of conservators for protection, <i>et cetera.</i> Two things should happen.  The 2d. per lb should be discontinued&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we should refund quite a considerable amount of money to people who may on one day have caught half a dozen salmon and for six weeks afterwards have caught nothing at all.  It is just too bad that they should be fined for their catch, which is in effect what happens.  Do not forget that those who are engaged in salmon fishing depend a great deal on skill but also depend to a great extent on luck.  I have watched those people fishing for salmon.  I have seen one boat going out and getting a netful of salmon and half a dozen of other people getting nothing at all.  On the following tide the people who got the netful of salmon the first time got a netful again.  It is pure luck.  There are many people who will spend the entire season salmon fishing who will hardly get enough to exist on as a result of their labours.  For that reason it is unfair that there should be any penal clause whatever in respect of salmon which is caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to river protection and to the protection staff's wages, and to a pension scheme.  The wording is pretty peculiar.  It would appear that it is only the senior staff who are to be included in the pension scheme.  I distinctly remember having an interview with the Minister's predecessor, meaning the person who was then in charge of the Fisheries Section, when a solemn assurance was given that a pension scheme for all fishery protection staff under the Inland <Col N="355" /> Waterways was to be introduced without delay.  If the suggestion now is that the supervisory staff and those higher up are to be included in a pension scheme and the ordinary staff, the people who have to control the rivers and who do the major portion of the work, are to be excluded, the Minister should have another look at it.</P>
    <P>The water bailiff, as he is usually called, is not the most popular man in a country district because of the fact that it is his job to see that those who have a taste for salmon and have not got a licence do not get any salmon. It has been known on occasions that those people have been attacked and in a number of cases severly assaulted. I know of one case where a man engaged on that work was assaulted very severely and where the culprits were taken to court.  Not alone had the man, who had spent some time in hospital, to pay his hospital fee but he had also to pay court charges because of the fact that the local board of conservators had no authority to pay them for him.</P>
    <P>If it is suggested that such persons are not entitled to any type of pension after their years of service, I say that that attitude is entirely wrong.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter very fully.  If a pension scheme is introduced, as I hope it will be, then it should apply to all the protection staff from top to bottom.  The amount of pay they get varies from board to board but there is still the fellow who is being paid an honorarium of something like £5 or £6 a year, I understand.  That is ridiculous.  Personally, I consider it is waste of time. What you can expect a person to do for £5 or £6 a year at the present time is too ridiculous for words.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that people who have to work at all sorts of awkward hours, who have to go out at night, particularly during spawning season, and to stay out in all weathers because the poacher is particularly active when the weather is bad, should be paid a rate which is based, usually, on the local farm labourer's rate.  The reason why the farm labourer's rate is selected is <Col N="356" /> that it is the lowest that could be quoted.  If there were a lower rate, no doubt it would be selected.  When the Minister talks about being in a position to give adequate support to the boards, he should insist that the persons employed by the boards are paid a fair rate of wages for the type of job they are doing.</P>
    <P>A few years ago there was a grandiose scheme for fishery protection.  It was to be made a national affair. Uniforms were to be issued.  Various types of protection were to be given to the staff, and so on.  Indeed, some boards were discussing the question of walkie-talkies, and all the rest.  That scheme appears to have been abandoned.  When it is considered that men are still being paid at such a low rate it is not surprising that there has not been much enthusiasm for such innovations.  I am quite sure that the men would prefer, in the first place, to be paid a decent rate for the job.</P>
    <P>There are a number of boards and I consider there are two things wrong with them.  One is that there seems to be a very haphazard system of election, even under the Consolidation Bill. There should be some other way of electing people to fishery boards. Secondly, I consider that until some compensation can be paid to those who have to leave their place of work to attend board meetings, it will not be possible to get the best type.  I was a member of a board at one time.  I am no longer.  I left of my own accord.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the one I am <Col N="357" /> talking about, the fishermen live about two miles from the town.  As regards the people who travel 30 or 35 miles, I do not think the expenses would worry them a whole lot.  Something should be done about that.</P>
      <P>The amount of salmon being caught, of course, depends entirely on the way the river has been dealt with over the years by the local board.  We should all pay tribute to the efforts being made to increase the stocks of salmon. It is a well-known fact that the salmon returns to the river out of which he goes and the result is that when a proper system of planning has been adopted, there will be a big return of salmon in the years to come.  Most rivers on which this planning system has been carried out have the evidence that the number of salmon coming back has increased immensely.</P>
      <P>There is always the thorny problem as to whether the fishing season should open early or close late.  My personal view is that it should open as early as possible because while the amount of salmon caught late in the season is far greater than early on, the price paid for salmon at the beginning of the season is far in excess of that paid in the summer and at the end of the season and that more than compensates for the smaller quantity.  The season should open as near as possible to 1st January.  In my area it does not open until 12th February and it closes on 12th August.  In the last couple of weeks a tremendous number of small salmon can be caught but the price at that time drops down to rock bottom.  Sometimes in the shops I notice tinned salmon being sold and I wonder if it would not be an idea to encourage the tinning of salmon here. One sees John West Middle Cut, other salmon from Canada or from some other outfit in Japan, but we do not seem to be able to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early years of the life of the Fianna Fáil Government, the early thirties, the provision of a purification tank for mussels was suggested for my area.  The town of Drogheda is built on the Boyne and the people who planned it were not too careful as to where the effluents from the sewage <Col N="358" /> went.  The result is that Boyne mussels, while they are excellent in substance and size, do not appear to be the safest mussels to eat.  The local people will eat them without any ill effects because they may be immune to such ill effects.  However, would the Minister consider at this stage the question of providing a mussel purification tank?  I am sure it would more than compensate over a very short period for the amount of money involved in having it established there.  It would mean that instead of having mussels sold as bait, as is done at the present time, and having them taken across to England, Wales or somewhere else, processed there and sold as choice mussels, the local people in Mornington would get some of this fat which appears to be so easily available to other people.</P>
    <P>In the fishing villages, there is a tradition that people build their own boats.  Has the Minister considered the question of extending this industry? He may say it is a matter for a different Minister but in view of the fact that it applies entirely to fishermen and that at the present time there seems to be a very big demand for boats of this type, particularly on the inland lakes, the Minister might consider the problem and see if some encouragement could be given to the building of these boats and to the creation of some channel through which they could be marketed.  It would add considerably to the income of these people particularly in the off season when they have a lot of free time.</P>
    <P>Down through the years, there have been discussions in this House as to who should own the inland fishery rights.  The Minister should have another look at this problem.  There should not be, and there cannot be, any argument against the right of the farmer to own his own fishing rights. It had been the system for some years that the old landlord, when land was divided, held on to the fishing and shooting rights.  Then the Land Commission got wise to it and they decided they would take the fishing rights from the landlord and hold on to the rights themselves.  The fishing rights <Col N="359" /> of a farm should belong to the local farmer, particularly when one sees that if it is reported to the local board of conservators that a salmon has been caught on a farmer's land, he will get a fishery rate added on to his normal rate in the next season.  Many people who have nothing to do with the fishing at all or with the fishery rights on the river passing through their land have had to pay a substantial amount of money by way of fishery rate.  If they had the satisfaction either of using them themselves or renting them to somebody else they might be able to recover some of the money concerned.</P>
    <P>The amount of the rate is another problem the Minister should examine. There is no point in his saying he is able adequately to help in this matter or to provide the money for these boards, if at the same time letters are sent from his Department telling the boards that if they want to raise their water bailiff's wages or provide some other amenity which is very necessary, they must do it by raising the rates. The rate is far too high at the present time and it is beginning to be something which only the very rich can afford and that is not the ideal situation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister quoting a figure for salmon exports because I do not think it is appreciated that it is such a big item in the country's export figures.  The sum of £933,500 for 1964 is a very encouraging figure but when the Minister is expending money on fisheries, he should not think only of sea fisheries&mdash;I have steered clear of the question of protection, and so on, because that has been adequately dealt with&mdash;but should see that inland fisheries get more money from his Department than they are getting.  They should not be given a small amount and told: &ldquo;You must make the best of that because that is all you will get anyway.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Tully was concluding, he spoke of a figure of practically £1 million a year represented by salmon exports.  It is the function of the Opposition to criticise <Col N="360" /> but I have had some experience of the Fisheries Branch and I want to say to the Minister for Agriculture that I know the problems with which he has to contend in efforts to promote salmon fisheries.  Such efforts are open to every sort of misrepresentation and very often the Minister responsible is submitted to practically irresistible pressures in this regard.  Deputy Tully mentioned a figure of nearly £1,000,000 a year for exports and I would ask Deputies to realise that the fundamental conflict in regard to the protection of salmon fisheries is not a conflict between nets and rods.  It is not a conflict between poor fishermen and wealthy rod fishermen.  It is a conflict between nets and the survival of the river itself.</P>
      <P>Nobody's interest is more protected than that of the net fisherman when restrictions are imposed for the preservation of the salmon population of the river the Minister seeks to protect by imposing restrictions requisite to ensure that a sufficient number of salmon pass up the river and that the estuary is not swept clean by those fishing in it.  We all know the difficulties associated primarily with the protection of the Foyle fisheries which are now the property of the Irish people, North and South.  I myself had personal experience of the acute difficulties that arose there in regard to the licensing of nets on that estuary. Sometimes I think the Minister's Department is a little too rigid in confining licences to certain categories of persons but, in so far as the Minister is advised that the use of monofilament nets jeopardises the ultimate welfare of the river itself, he ought to get the support of all those who are concerned for the welfare of the net fishermen themselves in protecting the river because, if it is not protected, it may take five, ten, or 15 years, but it is absolutely certain that, if the estuary is overfished the people who ultimately will suffer most acutely are the people who habitually get their living from net fishing in the estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing more difficult than protection of salmon rivers and when we appreciate their immense value to the State not only as a source of export <Col N="361" /> but also because of the attraction they provide for the tourist industry, the Minister is, I think, entitled to a sympathetic understanding on the part of all Deputies who have some acquaintance with this problem in the running battle he has perennially to fight, almost single-handed, for the protection of the rivers and, in the last analysis, for the protection of the fishermen themselves.  It is very difficult for a man who is fishing at this particular time to think of posterity but, if his grandfather had not thought of him, or been compelled to think of the men who are fishing today, there would be no salmon for the fishermen today.  Unless some steps are taken to protect supplies today there will be no salmon for the grandchildren of the men who are fishing today.  It is the Minister's function to think of posterity as well as of those who naturally want to get the maximum catches at this particular time when the price of salmon happily is very satisfactory. I ask Deputies who are concerned in this matter to try to propagate the proposition that the fundamental conflict is not between the net fishermen and the rod fishermen but between the net fishermen and the survival of the river itself, and there is nobody to whom that survival is more important than the net fishermen and those who will come after them.</P>
    <P>I always feel, and I felt this when I was Minister for Fisheries, a considerable uneasiness about this business of people having exclusive rod fishing rights on salmon rivers; and that became exacerbated when these rights, which are now of course immensely valuable, were sold or rented to people coming from abroad.  It is very important that we should look at this calmly and deliberately in the full understanding of what the position is.  We have power under Part V of the Fishery Consolidation Act to buy all these fisheries.  We could do so in the morning if we wanted to, but it would be an immensely costly operation and you cannot simply walk in and take from somebody a very valuable asset in the exclusive right to fish on a particular stretch of river and confiscate it.  If you want to take it over <Col N="362" /> and make it available to all you have got to purchase it from the owner at a price fixed by an independent arbitrator. It would cost many millions to do that but we have the power under Part V of the Fishery Consolidation Act if we want to do it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not mind confessing that when I was Minister for Fisheries, I mentally segregated poachers into two categories: the poacher who used explosives or who raided spawning beds in the close season was a person with whom I have no sympathy whatever or the man who used illegal methods of fishing.  But, when I hear of some fellow fishing with a rod and line on someone else's water, I cannot pretend to be moved to any violent indignation at all.  I feel the fellow who owns the fishery should protect his own interests as best he can against the man who is fishing it by legitimate methods with a rod and line.  I readily recognised my obligation, however, as Minister for Fisheries to activate and support boards of conservators in any measures they took against those who used explosives, illegal methods of fishing or raided the spawning beds in the off season.  But the person who is much the worst offender is the person who buys poached salmon and I have often thought that our efforts to identify the purchasers of poached salmon and make them liable in law were not sufficiently energetic.  There are a great many hotel keepers in rural Ireland who steadfastly refuse to touch poached salmon.  On the other hand, there are others who are prepared to traffic in them to the disadvantage of the honest hotel keeper who will have nothing to do with this trade.  I am sorry to say that on the occasions we did with great difficulty identify offenders of this class and bring them before the courts we did not get much support from the courts. The fines were ridiculous and I often thought our attitude towards persons who traffic in illegally caught salmon is not sufficiently rigorous because, if there was not a market for illegally caught salmon, the temptation to engage in that activity would not be so great.</P>
    <P>I am struck today by the fact that <Col N="363" /> I did not detect that sense of urgency that I feel appropriate to this problem of the disease that has manifested itself in the salmon population of our rivers.  When this problem related only to the Waterville area it seemed to be a limited problem, grave certainly but one which could be grappled with.  I understand now it has turned up on the Slaney and the Suir and I am consternated to be told that it is apparently impossible to identify the condition even by consultation with authorities elsewhere in the world.  I find that hard to believe.</P>
    <P>It may be true that the cultures and the examination of scales and even the examination of salmon submitted to these external authorities may have failed to identify the disease.  But I do not think that is enough.  I think we ought to invite the advice of foreign authorities and ask them to come and examine this problem <i>in situ</i>, because if this is not a bacillus or a mould, it may be related to something happening by way of contamination of our water.  It may be if we got a person with experience of salmon fisheries from Scandinavia, the United States or elsewhere to look at the situation <i>in situ</i>, some factor might present itself to a detached observer from outside which would enable him to assist us in the identification of the cause of this disease.</P>
    <P>It will be a major catastrophe if this matter is not brought under control. Quite apart from the exports of £1 million annually to which Deputy Tully referred, just imagine the loss that would be involved in every salmon fishery in the country which would become unusable as a result of the spread of this disease.  There is no use in our pretending any longer that this is a minor development and that the whole business is liable to settle itself. So long as it was in a very restricted area, that attitude was sensible; but it is no longer in a restricted area.  In fact, it would seem to be spreading through the country.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister must manifest to this House that he is taking every conceivable measure to identify the cause <Col N="364" /> of this outbreak and bring it under control.  He must, I think, satisfy everybody in the country that no vested interest will be powerful enough to prevent him from taking whatever measures may be necessary to put an end to the pouring of any effluent into our rivers or contamination of our water from any source which would operate to spread this pest any further. I know if I were Minister for Fisheries at present, I would be very reluctant to face this House unless I was in a position to say: &ldquo; Here are all the things I have done.  If there is anybody here who will suggest any other step that could be taken to assist in the control of this outbreak, I only want to hear of it.  As I have failed so far to bring the matter under control, I am prepared to give any proposal a trial if it is a reasonable one.&rdquo;  I would be glad to hear from the Minister a very much more comprehensive and detailed statement in this regard than that he has already made.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a question I have often heard Deputy P. O'Donnell speak of here, that is, fishing for lobsters. Salmon is a very valuable export. Lobster is a very valuable export and could be much greater.  The very value of an export is one of the inherent dangers in it.  I am always a little worried as to whether we are taking proper precautions to ensure that our lobster beds are not over-fished to the point of danger.  I have often heard Deputy P. O'Donnell speak of the impropriety of the catching and sale of berried lobster&mdash;&ldquo;berried&rdquo; and not &ldquo;buried&rdquo;.  I have often heard the experts tell me that that was not a matter of great consequence, that the important thing was to prevent small lobsters being captured and sold to excess.  But I will be glad to hear from the Minister his views as of today about the lobster fisheries of this country and the danger of their being over-fished to the point of destruction.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was Minister for Fisheries we started the planting of oyster beds in Clew Bay.  I do not underestimate the difficulties of establishing new oyster beds.  They are formidable, but it can be done.  As salmon and lobster exports are valuable, <Col N="365" /> oyster exports could be an immense source of revenue to this country.  It takes a long time to establish oyster beds and it takes great care to ensure they are not over-fished and wiped out.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister whether he is doing anything about establishing oyster beds, particularly on the west coast. They could be an immense source of revenue once they were established.</P>
    <P>I frequently listen to the problems of fishermen and the belief, which I think I heard Deputy Ó Ceallaigh from Clare reiterating today, that our fishing grounds were being devastated by foreign trawlers.  I will not follow that question very far because I have been listening to it for a quarter of a century; but I think it would be no harm if the Minister would say a word in conclusion on the general question as to where the real fishing grounds of this country are and to distinguish between fishing grounds for pelagic and demersal fish.  Unless I am entirely mistaken, the fishing grounds for demersal fish in this country are mainly on the continental shelf.  The continental shelf is more than 100 miles from our west coast and approximately the same distance from our south coast.  The bulk of the French and Spanish trawlers that take refuge in our southern ports and fish off the coast are mainly trawlers escaping from storm warnings which they have heard while fishing on the continental shelf 100 miles south of our coast.  They run for refuge to our ports and are tempted to fish, sometimes coming in and frequently going out.  The bulk of fishing by foreign trawlers in our fishery limits is attributable to that procedure.  It is an entirely different question when you are dealing with pelagic fish, herring and mackerel. But I think it would be a good thing if the facts of this situation were reiterated, because I think there is a great deal of false thinking on this whole problem.</P>
    <P>The problem of pelagic fish is one which very few people not intimately associated with the industry understand at all.  It is an extremely complex business.  I remember when I was Minister for Fisheries we established fishmeal <Col N="366" /> plants to take up the surplus herrings.  Yet two years after I left office, the herrings disappeared from the North Sea and there was not a surplus of herring any more.  The disappearance of the herrings in the North Sea and their appearance in abundance off our coast made all the herrings caught here worth more than a fishmeal factory could afford to pay for them.  We would have some idea in regard to the supplies of fish because any morning we might wake up and discover the shoals of herring had left our coast and turned up somewhere else.  We might discover in the morning that the shoals of herring had turned up again in the North Sea and we would find then that we had a surplus of herring here.  It is no harm for the Minister of Fisheries, from time to time, to expose these fundamental facts and remind, not only the House, but other sympathetic persons in the country of the nature of these problems.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to refer to is the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust. I have always believed you can get much more out of people by praising them when they do well than by abusing them if occasionally they falter.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, on occasions I have told Macra na Feirme my views on that subject.  I want to speak now about the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I consider, for a number of years, they have done a marvellous job, particularly in the lakes in Westmeath and Cavan.  They have done a considerable job on Lough Sheelin and Lough Derravaragh and other lakes in the area.  Some people thought what was being done by the Inland Fisheries Trust in regard to these lakes was a tragedy.  Everybody who had a pen and a bottle of ink wrote letters, columns long, to the newspapers to say that the Inland Fisheries Trust had wrought havoc on Lough Sheelin, Lough Derravaragh and Lough Belvedere.  They said it was a tragedy that such lunatics were let loose on these valuable waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About the third year, these lakes <Col N="367" /> all proceeded to yield astonishing catches of fish.  Did the scribes hasten to take their pens and bottles of ink and write that now the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust was coming to fruition?  No; they slipped off down to Lough Sheelin, Lough Derravaragh and the other lakes and caught their fish and then came back with their catches on a string to show to everybody. There was no word said about the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I remember somebody came to me with one of those catches and I very nearly hit him across the face with it.  He was one of those who had written letters to the newspapers against the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I consider the personnel of the Inland Fisheries Trust have infinite patience. They do an incomparable job of work and carry out their work despite conduct of that sort.  They have done a great job of work on the lakes of our country which is of immeasurable benefit to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a special tribute to the Inland Fisheries Trust on behalf of my own constituency.  When I first represented Monaghan, it was one of the counties to derive the least benefit from the tourist industry.  No tourists ever went to Monaghan because there was no great attraction there for them.  The Inland Fisheries Trust undertook the rehabilitation, not only of the trout lakes in Monaghan and Cavan, but the coarse fishing lakes of those two counties.  They are now reported as being model counties in regard to fishing attractions.  They attract a large volume of tourists drawn principally from the midlands of England.  They stay with local people because they do not want elaborate and extravagant hotel accommodation. They are very happy to live in guest houses to which they return year after year.  They fish for perch, tench, bream and pike.  They have discovered that fishing facilities are freely available in both Cavan and Monaghan. They have also discovered that the fishing in rural Ireland is superior to anything they can find in England.</P>
    <P>This is almost entirely a result of the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust. <Col N="368" /> This House, and the Minister, ought to go out of their way to acknowledge the good work which has been done by this body since its establishment.  I do not know the details of deep sea fishing.  I understand this is a considerable attraction but I do not think the Inland Fisheries Trust has much to do with it.  The Inland Fisheries Trust are fully deserving of every praise in regard to the work they have done.  They have succeeded in attracting tourists to fish in our lakes.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about one form of publicity in which he might legitimately engage.  The annual report of a number of Government bodies has, in recent years, become more and more elaborate.  I do not know whether that is necessary in regard to Bord na Móna or the ESB, but, in any case, these annual reports are very much more attractive than they used to be.  The annual report of the Inland Fisheries Trust is not like one of these reports.  It has the hallmarks of extremely limited financial resources.  I suggest if the annual report of the Inland Fisheries Trust were more in the form of some of the illustrated and attractively-produced annual reports of other semi-State bodies, it could, with great advantage, be used by Bord Fáilte as part of their publicity literature.  I am quite sure the contents of that annual report would come as a bombshell to thousands of people in Great Britain. Further, I feel there are few other places in the world with conditions comparable with what we have here in Ireland who have fishing anything like what we have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you tell people in Great Britain that there are parts of Ireland where trout fishing is free and that in all parts of Ireland coarse fishing is free, they simply do not believe it. It would be a useful thing if the annual report of the Inland Fisheries Trust were made more attractive reading than it is at present and if it were <Col N="369" /> more widely distributed.  It would be good for the morale of the Trust and it would be good tourist publicity anywhere it was distributed.  I offer this as a constructive suggestion to the Minister in relation to the effective and very valuable work which the Inland Fisheries Trust are doing.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, a few words about the salmon disease.  I deliberately avoided pressing the Minister in regard to this matter in the past because I recognised that undue publicity would not be good and that it would be better if it could be confined to the limited areas in which the disease had shown itself.  I considered that would be in the best interests of the salmon fisheries of the country as a whole.  I think that time is past.  It has now spread.  It has now been widely discussed.  The time is now here when we should have a very full and exhaustive <i>exposé</i> by the Minister of the position as it stands today and of the prospect he sees of bringing the matter under control.  I recognise this difficulty in regard to protecting salmon fisheries from over-netting.  I think he may expect from this side of the House the sympathetic understanding of those difficulties and support, when he needs it, for such measures as may be necessary to protect not the wealthy people but the net fishermen and their children and their children's children who depend for their livelihood on the regular supply of salmon which cannot be maintained in any river unless adequate and suitable protection is provided in every year and all the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on the fact that he did not introduce the monofilament net and did not allow himself to be influenced unduly by any deputation urging its retention.  As Deputy Dillon has so rightly said, the net fishermen on the estuaries of our rivers must, in fact, at this stage be saved from themselves and from their own avarice. Certainly, the introduction of the monofilament net was a very serious step in the life of the inland fisheries of our country.  I have been informed from what is normally a very reliable source that one crew on the estuary <Col N="370" /> of the Suir caught 592 salmon during one period in the river.  That surely is more than their fair share of salmon.  It deprives the net fishermen who fish the Suir up as far as Carrick, where it is tidal, of even a meagre chance of catching fish while the anglers at Cahir, Golden and Cashel who pay the angling licence fee might as well have a dog licence. Salmon was caught in very meagre numbers by the rod fishermen.  It militated against the tourist and the tourist season generally from the point of view of those who would otherwise gainfully be employed by reason of tourists coming into the constituency of South Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The net was banned in England.  I am sure we can learn much from the experience they have gained there.  I am sure, too, that when the Minister holds this inquiry at the end of the year, he will take into consideration the fact that something in the region of 80 per cent of all salmon which come up river are either caught or die from natural causes and that only the fry come back out to sea again and 20 per cent of the old salmon.  With the natural hazards of rivers and of the odd poacher that still prevails, these things are serious enough but the monofilament net, unlike the ordinary net, can be fished 24 hours a day even under the brightest skies and is completely invisible in water. The fish have not a sporting chance of getting free and the estuary was barricaded between Cheekpoint and Dunmore East.</P>
      <P>Peculiarly enough, the men gaining most out of it and now crying for its retention are the men who, a few years ago, wanted the net banned.  At that time, they had not this monofilament net themselves.  Since then, they have been able to procure it and now they are loath to give up what to them is a very rich harvest but which will not last if the net is allowed to continue in operation for four or five years.  It probably will make salmon fishing on our rivers not worth while.  It may even be the cause of extinguishing salmon altogether from our rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Inland Fisheries <Col N="371" /> Commission was indeed very comprehensive. It stated categorically the beneficial results which would accrue from adequate protection of our fisheries.  The wisdom of their deliberations is now being borne out when one considers that angling tourists from the continent and from England are coming here in vast numbers because of the facilities which are readily available to fish on practically every river for the price of the subscription to the local angling club or for a moderate fee even on what are termed private stretches.</P>
    <P>I am not unduly disturbed about the disease which is at present in fish in some of our rivers.  This is not the first time it has happened.  A disease very akin to it appeared in our rivers in the 1880s.  The authorities at that time could not find out the cause of it and, indeed, its disappearance was equally unaccounted for.  However, it did eradicate itself and vanished from the fish.  I think possibly it may have been just one of nature's ways of controlling the numbers of fish or some such thing as that.  It is a well known fact that in the animal kingdom these cycles occur.  When fish or reptiles become too numerous, nature destroys many of them to ensure that the feeding and the resources they would normally require will be in plentiful supply for those that survive and that there will be a healthier species of the particular animals, fish, and so on, involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to convey to the Minister the thanks of the net fishermen of Carrick who received enthusiastically his decision to ban the monofilament net&mdash;which, incidentally, is also known as the killer net and that adjective must surely bear a significance to its effect.  Their livelihood was seriously being jeopardised.  Eighteen families are involved which is no mean number for a small town such as Carrick-on-Suir.  I trust that the inquiry which is to be held at the end of the year will pay adequate attention to the needs not alone of a few vested interests which may be on the estuaries but also of those up river, the <Col N="372" /> angler, the net fisherman up river who has the right to fish with nets as far as tidal waters and the conservators who, down through the years have done a very thankless job in the best interests of the community at large with an efficiency and a degree of fairness which it would be very hard to equal.  To them, I should like to pay a special tribute, the men who have absolutely dedicated themselves to this job which requires getting up in the morning and staying out late at night in inclement weather conditions when the poachers are at their best.  These men deserve the thanks of the community and the thanks of each angler, be he plutocrat or pauper.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I discount this suggestion that fishing and angling as such are the rich man's prerogative.  In my area it is the reverse, in fact.  It is a poor man's sport, an inexpensive sport which can be enjoyed for the price of a rod and line and it may give untold pleasure to the angler and to his family if he is quick enough to catch a fish, and if he is not, he can always tell the good story about the one that got away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>South Tipperary</i>): My remarks will be limited on this subject as I am not an expert on fishing or fisheries.  I would exhort the Minister to make a greater effort to get to the roots of this fish disease problem. Apparently he has called in an expert from Scandinavia to advise on it but if some solution is not forthcoming, I see no reason why he should not look for experts further afield.  I would suggest he might consult the biological section of the Department of Agriculture in the United States.  It it a very highly skilled organisation and I am sure the Minister will be able to secure advice from other sources as well.  Nobody seems to know what the nature of the disease is or whether it has bacterial, virus or physical cause.  The time has now arrived when the Minister should take more active steps than he appears to have taken so far on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a letter of which I think the Minister may already have received a <Col N="373" /> copy.  It is from a tourist who has been in Cahir recently&mdash;a Mr. Auriol.  He is associated with the Franco-Irish Association and is interested in promoting the introduction of visitors here.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>I have just spent over a month here and, to my great disappointment, apart from the trout which are plentiful, I did not have the pleasure of landing one single salmon.  According to local reports from Cahir, Ardfinnan, Golden and Newcastle, the season was one of the worst ever seen.  I quite believe it. I have heard, too, reports concerning diseased fish&mdash;all along the Suir. After a personal enquiry it seems that the fish (some of them caught only a few miles from the river mouth) are diseased as they come from the sea.  Therefore, it is likely that such a situation will not be found next season but, what is quite sure is that nearly all the fish caught by anglers had traces of nets.  I personally went to Waterford and I will say I was somewhat distressed when I saw the river &ldquo;Black with Nets.&rdquo;  I wonder how a single fish can reach Ardfinnan or Cahir.</P>
    <P>This situation has already been drawn to the Minister's attention and I think he has received deputations putting forward reverse views.  I did understand from him that he extended the estuary net fishing period, in one river, if not in all of them, from January to June at the behest of Deputy Corry. I may not be correct in my interpretation of his statement but that is what I gathered.  That was probably a mistake, and I should like the Minister to tell us what his policy in the future in that particular respect will be.  It is important for fishing around Cahir.</P>
    <P>One other small point which I should like to mention again in reference to salmon fishing in my own locality, particularly Cahir and district, is the local fishing rights.  There was a small fishing right there some years ago associated with Cahir estate.  The local fishing organisation are anxious to get control of these fishing rights but the Minister's predecessor leased these rights to a London fishing syndicate. <Col N="374" /> Naturally, there was local annoyance and disappointment when the people did not secure these fishing rights.</P>
    <P>I made representations to the Minister's predecessor and he told me he had given these rights on the understanding that the group who got the rights were prepared to build a hotel in Cahir and if they did not get this concession, this tourist hotel would not be built and the Minister thought it very desirable to have a hotel built. This group got the concession and apparently that is all that has been done since.  I should like the Minister if he has information readily available, to tell us what the present position is in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on this Estimate because I feel our sea fisheries have great potentials for the type of industrial employment which can be provided in isolated areas such as we have along our western seaboard near my constituency of west Galway.  In the fishing industry, we have natural wealth on our doorstep, wealth which other nations are well aware of and only too keen to avail of.  Indeed over the past number of years, it has been common to hear Irish people make this remark and agree that there is this tremendous wealth on our doorstep.  They shrug their shoulders and say that other nations are more aware of it than we are, and do not bother to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of remark had been common over the years but I think it is becoming less common nowadays.  This is mainly because of the new approach in the last few years by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and because of the encouragement and assistance the Board has been receiving from the Government. There is of course a lot of leeway to be made up in educating all sections of the community in the efforts being made to tap this lucrative industry and on the part the ordinary person can play in this effort.  It should be recognised that Bord Iascaigh Mhara today is doing a first-class job in expanding this fishing industry.  More publicity should be given to the work <Col N="375" /> of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  This would create goodwill for the fishing industry amongst the people generally.</P>
    <P>It should be recognised that Bord Iascaigh Mhara has faced up to the problems which confronted the industry down through the years, and the progress and expansion of recent times are, I feel, heading for a spectacular take-off.  In the years ahead the increase in the returns from the fishing industry will cause greater recognition of its contribution to the Irish economy. We will feel proud and will hold our heads high when there is reference to our fishing industry.  I hope the progress taking place will continue and I feel a spectacular take-off is coming and that the future of the industry will play a tremendous part in our economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out, however, that we must remember that we here in Ireland are living in a developing country.  In urging, as I now do, an increase in capital expenditure on this industry I should like to remind the Minister not to make the mistake which was made by other undeveloped countries, by the overcrowding of capital investment into a few sectors of the economy to the neglect of other sectors.  We are inclined to consider the fishing industry as contributing only in a small way towards our gross national product, and because of that it is not really receiving the proper attention which it deserves.  It could contribute a great deal if it got full co-operation. More money will have to be spent to bring about this development.</P>
    <P>I should not like the impression to go out that the Fisheries Section is the small fry of the Department of Agriculture simply because it is an added responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture.  Any Deputy who has studied the Progress Report for 1964 on the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> will have noticed that the only industry not living up to the forecast of that programme is the sea fisheries industry.  This may be due to the danger I mentioned of overlooking the importance of some industries of which, because of their present small <Col N="376" /> contribution to national production, the great potential is not clearly seen.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to state, as the Minister has pointed out, that the heavy fall in landings has been due primarily to the smaller landings in Dunmore East&mdash;from 280,965 cwts. in 1960, to 62,237 cwts. in 1964.  It must be remembered when these figures are quoted for 1960 that that was an exceptional year for fishing, and the figures for 1962, 1963 and 1964 show an increase over 1961, which was an average year.  That large drop was due to the unrest at the port resulting in the withdrawal of Northern Ireland boats, and also of Southern Irish boats by fishermen who did not wish to become involved in the dispute.  The number of boats working into Dunmore fell from 96 in 1960-61, including 27 Northern Ireland boats, to 24 in 1964/65.  The important thing to remember, however, is that the average landings per boat increased.</P>
    <P>This dispute was an unfortunate occurrence, but we must be mainly interested in fish landed by Southern Irish boats.  Those are the true figures. Of course, we in this Chamber have jurisdiction only over people living in the 26 Counties, due to another dispute of greater vintage.  The potential benefit to the Irish economy of a thriving sea fisheries industry is unlimited. I welcome the step taken by the Taoiseach of coupling fisheries with agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture is responsible for the production of food and the production of fish comes under the same heading. Whether the food comes from the land or is taken from the sea, it should be the responsibility of the same Minister.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Governments have always striven to serve all sectors of the community, and they have done so with great success.  I am confident that under the Minister's able leadership greater impetus will be provided to bring the fishing industry into line with some of the other great industries which have been developed under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer specifically to my own area.  In Galway city we are surrounded by fresh water and <Col N="377" /> sea water, and we have sea fishing and inland fishing.  Salmon and trout fishing attract the tourist angler to the area and is at a highly developed stage. There are many lay associations looking after its interests. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the great spirit of co-operation which has existed in the past between the Fisheries Section of his Department and these associations.  I appeal to the Minister to give them all the assistance he can, because no more dedicated group of men will he find in the whole of Ireland than the men who carry out the work done by these associations.  They are bringing about wonderful developments in fresh water fishing.</P>
    <P>They have a grievance over the withholding of the licence for the Oughterard factory in Galway.  This difficulty is not insurmountable, and I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for the prompt way in which he has dealt with the problem.  There was a certain feeling that the Minister was not prepared to co-operate, but I should like to deny that statement in this Chamber today.  There was a difficulty connected with this hatchery and probably political capital was made by some people. If the fish coming from the factory were diseased it was not possible for the Minister to permit the renewal of the licence.  However, he has said that he will renew the licence for one further year on the condition that the fault is rectified and he has sent his inspector down to Galway to find and try to rectify the fault.  There is nothing more the Minister can do to solve this problem, and I compliment him on the swift and prompt way in which he has dealt with it.  I hope the inspector will quickly find the fault and that this hatchery which was built by voluntary subscription many years ago will continue to provide the tremendous service it has provided towards stocking Lough Corrib and the surrounding rivers with trout.</P>
    <P>We are very anxious to see progress in the development of sea fisheries around Galway, and progress at a much faster rate.  The Government have made a considerable investment through the erection of the Bord Iascaigh Mhara fish processing factory at Galway Harbour. <Col N="378" /> This factory has proved a tremendous success, and it justifies the Board's faith in Galway fishermen.  It employs up to 70 people and it pays out over £500 a week in wages.  I should add that not a week goes by that we do not see an advertisement in the local papers looking for additional staff.  The factory is not big enough to handle the business it could do and I hope it will not be too long before an additional blast freezer is installed.  I understand negotiations are already well advanced, and I hope it will be installed within the next 12 months.  The sooner it is installed the better, because when we get large catches of fish the Galway factory is limited in the amount of fish it can take because of a lack of storage facilities.  The answer to that problem is the installation of additional blast freezers.</P>
    <P>The market for fish fingers and crumb fillets processed in the factory is unlimited.  They are sold mostly for export.  Indeed, Galway fish are eaten and enjoyed as far away as Australia. I state these facts here because the public at large are not aware of the position and because some attempts have been made to smear the activities of this factory in the past.  I admire the policy of the Board that this factory must be kept at full production throughout the year, and even if because of the great fluctuations in the catching of fish it finds itself short of fish from the local fishermen, it should scour the horizons until it gets the raw material necessary to keep the production line moving and the people employed there content and permanent in their jobs.  It speaks very highly indeed for the very great progress being made in Galway and of the industry of the fishermen there that they only had to call on foreign boats on three occasions to supplement the catches of local fishermen and maintain production at a level rate.</P>
    <P>That is my reason for stating all these facts, which one would think would be of local interest only.  There have been attempts in the past to make white elephants and political capital out of places where good, solid employment was given.  Here, the people <Col N="379" /> of my city are being given employment and I shall not stand for any smear campaign against the activities in that factory.  I am glad to see it there, to see so many people employed in it.</P>
    <P>I stated earlier that we should all help in the development of our fisheries and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I am not speaking just of the members of this House.  I appeal to everybody in the country, from the Minister down to the smallest schoolchild, to ensure that the industry reaps the harvest available in our rich waters.  Business people in particular throughout the country are very anxious to entice industrialists into their respective areas to set up factories.  It is very worthy work.  It has been done largely by chambers of commerce and development associations.  I suggest to those people that when they sit down at their meetings and make up their brochures to send to foreign parts, especially in Galway, they do not have to look much further than their own shores to see a potential industry in which they should be investing money.</P>
    <P>Without the infusion of private capital into our fishing industry, it will not grow quickly enough.  Too much is being left in the hands of Government Departments in our efforts to develop fishing.  I am a firm believer in private enterprise, private investment, and I am sorry that up to now very little private money has been invested in an industry already there.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made to the proposed development of Galway as a major fishing harbour.  I understand the proposal awaits further investigation. I can only state that with the development of other kinds which is taking place around Galway harbour at this time, it might be as well if no definite decision were made at the moment.  In this regard, I suggest to the Minister&mdash;I am not aware of what development plans have been decided on&mdash;that he would consider developing the harbour at Rosaveel.  Anybody who is aware of what is going on at Galway harbour these days knows of the tremendous development there, knows there is very little space around the harbour for subsidiary factories.  If major development occurs at Rosaveel <Col N="380" /> there would be safe anchorage in all weathers for our fishermen and no difficulty about sites for subsidiary factories.</P>
    <P>Another point in favour of development at Rosaveel is that it is two hours nearer to the furthest fishing grounds than Galway.  That two hour period can be built up to four if you add the return journey which, to my mind, is a complete waste of good fishing time.  If no definite decision has been made yet in regard to Galway I suggest that Rosaveel should be seriously considered for major development. I feel sure the Minister will look into this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken over control of the Fisheries Section which heretofore was administered by a Parliamentary Secretary. In other words, the Department of Agriculture are moving into ground where they do not sow and where only fishermen reap.  However, it is a field in which the Minister could do a lot more than has been done.  For many years I have agitated&mdash;it is on the records of the House&mdash;for proper provision at Aran for our trawlers.  I was pleased to learn recently that the matter had come to a head but I am sorry to say that another crowd are trying to muscle in on the pier there. I refer to CIE.  It is strange to see CIE having a connection with Aran even if they do provide a ferry boat to the islands.</P>
      <P>Aran fishermen were allocated a grant, a Gaeltacht grant designed only for Irish speakers, to improve the pier and provide proper berthage for trawlers off the west coast.  Now CIE have moved in in an endeavour to have the pier designed strictly to suit their own requirements.  I have no objection to CIE getting certain requirements there but if the work is being carried out through a grant aimed at helping Irish-speaking people I do not see why CIE should be allowed to monopolise it.  For years the fishermen there have been asking to have an elbow on the pier.  I have a letter here, written on behalf of the Aran Island fishermen, which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several years ago the fishermen of this island proposed an extension to <Col N="381" /> Kilronan Pier, incorporating a westward turning elbow to ensure safe mooring and increased berthage for their growing number of modern fishing vessels in all weather conditions, the westward elbow being imperative to eliminate the considerable force of weather exerted by the prevailing West to South-West winds during the severe winter storms experienced on the West coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The letter is addressed from Gortnagopple and it could have been written in Irish as freely as it has been written in English but those people are beginning to lose faith in Gaeltacht grants because they can be pushed to one side by people like Tod Andrews, who can twist the tail of the Department.</P>

      <P>We hear a lot of talk about saving the Gaeltacht but I should like to know what steps are being taken to protect our fishing fleet from the weather conditions which can blow up overnight.  This plan has been foisted on the people and on their behalf, I can say either do it as they want it or forget about it.  I have been long enough agitating for this grant and now we have this other group going to muscle in.  That is what it amounts to.  I do not mind their getting certain facilities but the provision of this elbow is not too much to expect to help ease the hazards these men have to face from Atlantic storms with blow up overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by my colleague to a smear campaign about the fish plant in Galway.  That Deputy was not a member of this House when I raised this question.  I offer no apology to the Taoiseach, the Minister, or anybody else in this House for what I said and I will repeat it.  Fish belonging to Galway Bay trawlers was <Col N="382" /> left to rot on the quays while Spaniards were employed to take in fish.  If that is a smear campaign, I am glad to have the taint of that smear.  I have evidence: I have photographs and I can prove that the finest fish was left on the quays.  If Deputy Molloy wants to deny that, he can do so, but I will bring him before the fishermen of Galway and we will have it out toe to toe.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that there had been only three landings from foreign trawlers in Galway.  Three trawlers were landing fish while fish was being refused from the Galway fishermen. How is it that the factory is kept going today?  Is it not kept going by the Galway fishermen?  What I did was to protest against fish belonging to Galway Bay trawlers either being left to rot or sent to the fishmeal plant.  If Deputy Molloy wants to stand over that sort of thing, he can, but he need not refer to a smear campaign.  I want no red herrings pulled across my path.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Molloy in regard to the improvement of Rosaveel harbour.  To make it a major harbour would be another day's work.  Improvements are required there in regard to berthage and to help these men to face the hazards they encounter and make life easier for them.  The Minister has expressed appreciation of the skippers course in Galway.  As one who has been accused of organising a smear campaign, may I say that I have one small boast, that is, that I was one of the Galway Vocational Committee who always assisted in these courses for trainee skippers. That would hardly be the mentality of a man out to smear any of our fishery efforts.</P>
    <P>I see in the Minister's statement that an alternative site is being sought for the Fishery Research Station at Galway. I should like to know why an alternative site is required as there is a vast site on the Renmore side of Galway.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know what further steps have been taken to extend the fishery harbour at Galway.  Is this pie in the sky or one of the baits thrown out at election time?  Recently <Col N="383" /> a deputation went from Galway to the Minister to consider the licence for the trout hatchery on the Corrib.  The Corrib Anglers Association have done trojan work and I can assure the House that the greatest things in this country have been achieved by voluntary effort&mdash;our freedom was achieved by voluntary effort&mdash;and now the work these people have done is to be thrown overboard by the Minister.  It is rather galling that a deputation headed by some of the Minister's colleagues should be highly insulted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is not here, I would give him word for word what is quoted in our local press about what the Minister said to this deputation. When they gave the Minister a document, he threw it down on his desk and said: &ldquo;If you think I am going to read that, you have another guess coming.&rdquo; If that is the way the Minister is going to approach the people, I must say that he is a rather haughty Haughey.  He will not get away with that kind of treatment.  I would advise the Minister to take his hands off the Corrib.  If he thinks he is going to deprive Corrib anglers of what they have built up, and of something which is a great asset to the tourist trade in the west, he is making a big mistake.  If the Minister wants to tie up the Corrib for the Taoiseach and his Dublin tycoons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Corrib is known as one of the best free fishing rivers in Western Europe.  For the Minister to treat a deputation in such a fashion is a disgrace and I want to protest.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to take a second and final look at the question of Kilronan harbour.  I raised this question in this House on occasions during the past ten years, long before my colleague left the infants' class, and I should like to see it brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  I hope the Taoiseach will take particular notice of the Corrib question.</P>
      <P>Finally, it has been reported that there have been very poor salmon catches in the western rivers.  There is a view that the western coast is being gutted by Danish drift fishermen, and if that is correct, they can play havoc with our greatest industry, tourism, in the west.  I should like to see this matter being investigated and if it has to be taken up at international level to have it straightened out, the Department should do so right away.  That is all I wish to say.  I hope the Minister will take note of my two points in regard to the Corrib and to Kilronan harbour which will be rather sore points before very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Minister issued a public notice banning the use of the monofilament net, with which we all agree, but unfortunately one newspaper published the heading &ldquo;Minister Bans Drift Net Fishing&rdquo;. In my area, in Ringsend, there are a number of drift net fishermen and when they read this, they thought the Minister had gone mad.  Despite the fact that through the board of conservators, we asked the newspaper to correct their report, it has not been done and I have had to write to the fishermen to tell them what the Minister has done.  He is banning the use of the monofilament net but they can get the annual licence to fish from now <Col N="385" /> until 15th August with the ordinary hemp net.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the Minister has power to deal with the preservation of rivers, particularly the Liffey.  Dublin is probably unique: it is probably the only European capital with a salmon-bearing river running through its centre.  Despite the damage done by hydro-electric works in the upper Liffey and pollution, a sizeable number of salmon is caught by drift net fishermen and anglers.  Last year a factory on the upper Liffey, through a mistake, discharged a huge amount of cyanide into the river.  This would be fatal not only to fish but to any form of animal life coming in contact with it.  The board of conservators, which is a voluntary body endeavouring to preserve fish in the river, find that it is almost impossible to bring a prosecution against people who do this kind of thing.  You may have great evidence but whether it is because the law is archaic or not, we find it very hard to bring these people to justice. Perhaps the Minister would consider this point when introducing future legislation.</P>
      <P>Finally, I see the fishery research vessel, <i>Cú Feasa,</i> very often lying at Ringsend, which is part of my area, and I should like to know if there is any publication setting out the work which this vessel has carried out since she was assigned to this task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Having heard Fine Gael speakers refer to Danish drift fishermen poaching&mdash;I suppose that is what it is&mdash;on Irish fishing grounds, I wonder why there is not a heading for fishery protection in the Fisheries Estimate.  However, I did see in the booklet <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1964, that fishing limits have been extended from three miles to 12 miles, exclusive within six miles and with limited rights from six miles to 12 miles.  Before this Act, we had to cover some 7,000 square miles but now, as a result of the Act, the mileage to be covered is considerably greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not being an expert on fisheries&mdash;<Col N="386" /> my colleagues may be able to help me in this respect&mdash;I believe that the problem is largely one of equipment and personnel.  May I suggest to the Minister in regard to fishery protection that he should purchase in future small warships of the motor escort type?  These ships would have the speed and I believe they would have the weapons and equipment required: they have reasonable accommodation and endurance and reliability to enable them to carry out lengthy patrols. Such ships should carry out regular patrols dictated by reports from all reliable sources.</P>
    <P>The number of ships would depend on the type of coverage required, but in present conditions, it is difficult to see how an efficient patrol could be maintained with fewer than four or five.  I agree that we have other priorities and that this is for the future.  The unpalatable fact is that such a force cannot be provided without considerable expenditure.  The fact must also be faced that if the fishery industry is to develop as it should, the protection should be forthcoming.  Our fishing grounds must be given adequate protection.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of interesting people in our fisheries.  It will be generally agreed that visitors, such as tourists, have often commented on how little is the interest we take in the sea and the benefits and harvests to be derived from it.  It appears to me that the place to begin to interest our people in fisheries, fishery protection and the naval service, is the schools.  If the Minister appointed mobile teachers qualified on the subject of fisheries in every respect and if they went through the schools and spoke to fifth year and sixth year students, outlining the great career the sea offers&mdash;and it is a healthy career and I believe one with a great future, taking into account modern equipment&mdash;I think those boys would be very keen to know what is available to them in this way.  If ten or 12 such teachers were appointed, they could give information drawn up by the Department and it would be a tremendous benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> We have a good deal to learn from religious orders.  When I was at school, one of the great religious orders regularly sent around recruiting sergeants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not very successful in your school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>They were, in fact, although not in my case.  In this regard I think we should take a leaf from the book of the religious orders. Another very good effort could be made through the schools by establishing a troop of sea scouts in every sea-side village.  There is no better way of interesting young boys in seafaring. Apart from other considerations, the sea offers a tremendous source of pleasure and recreation and it has been said, and will be said again, that recreation in the future will be a problem not merely for juveniles but also for adults.  It would have tremendous results if the Minister invoked the aid of the schools to establish sea scouts. The amount of equipment required in the way of boats and so on would be very little and it would be a great stimulus to interest in the sea.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that I am a member of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I do a lot of my fishing on Lough Sheelin. Here they are to be congratulated. They have done a first-class job on this lake.</P>
      <P>I notice that the estimated income from angling tourism rose to over £3 million in 1964 as compared with £1,760,000 in 1963.  What has been happening over the years?  Why have we not been giving more consideration to the question of angling tourists?  I am glad to see now that the Inland Fisheries Trust and its concomitant bodies, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Fáilte, are all doing a great deal in this respect.  It is a new realisation, a new awareness, under the heading of angling tourism.  I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the report on manpower policy by the National Economic Council and would refer the Minister <Col N="388" /> to page 19 paragraph 26, which is the fourth point therein.  It is set out in that paragraph that more attention should be paid to vocational guidance to ensure that the worker finds a job for which his qualities and capacity best suit him.  I use that recommendation in support of my point in relation to career guidance in our schools.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister favourably to consider and, no doubt, seriously, the points I have made.</P>
    <P>Again, may I congratulate the Minister on his appointment?  Not being a member of an agricultural constituency, my opinion is that he is doing a great job and putting a lot of energy into his Department.  I am sure that under the heading of fisheries he will work with equal vigour and energy.  I thank the House for listening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I welcome the manner in which the House in general has received this Estimate and I want to thank all those Deputies who have spoken and who have put forward constructive suggestions of one sort or another.  I may not deal with them all in my reply now but I should like to assure all the Deputies that, although I may not actually refer to them, nevertheless, everything that has been said will be carefully considered and all the suggestions put forward will receive serious consideration.</P>
      <P>May I mention a few specific points which have been raised by individual Deputies?  Possibly, I may take the last one first.  Deputy Andrews referred to the Inland Fisheries Trust and the work which is being done by that body. Deputy Dillon also drew attention to this aspect.  I want to say that it is very encouraging to know that the magnificent work which is being done by the Inland Fisheries Trust is appreciated by Deputies and I am sure that fact will be a source of encouragement to the Trust in the work they are doing.  I, personally, simply want to associate myself with the tributes paid to that body by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned the question of protection of our waters. This, of course, is primarily a matter <Col N="389" /> for the Minister for Defence.  It is the Minister for Defence who must provide the wherewithal to defend our territory, whether it be land or sea and in this regard as Minister responsible for fisheries, I rely on his Department to provide our fisheries with the appropriate protection.  As has become clear in this year on many occasions, there are great difficulties in this whole problem and the Minister frankly admits, I think, that he does not cope with this matter as adequately and as comprehensively as he would like.  Of course, the extension of our territorial waters by the Act of 1964 has made the problem even greater in scope.  This is as I say, primarily his responsibility but it is one in which I also have an interest and we shall have to continue to see in future what we can do to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The question of the use of monofilament nets has been raised and, of course, as in most fishery matters, two diametrically opposite points of view have been expressed.  In this regard, I feel I should reiterate and emphasise what Deputy Dillon has said that, ultimately, if we were by negligence of any kind to allow the salmon stocks in any river to depreciate it would be the net fishermen who would be the real losers and when we introduce measures of one sort or another for the protection of stocks in rivers it is, in fact, in the long term for the benefit of all concerned that these measures should be taken.</P>
    <P>All that has happened in regard to these monofilament nets in this year is that we have introduced a short term ban which will run from now to the end of the season and between now and the end of the season, and immediately on the ending of the season we will instigate a series of public enquiries to determine what is to happen in future.  These public enquiries will enable all interests concerned to come forward and give their views and on the basis of all the views that are put forward and the assessment that we make of those views, decisions will be come to for the future.</P>
    <P>As Deputy James Tully is in the House now, I shall refer to the question which he raised about the fishmeal <Col N="390" /> factory at Mornington.  This project is still on the mat.  There is a project to have a fishmeal factory at Mornington developed by a private concern.  There are a lot of points which have to be cleared in regard to the project.  Some differences of opinion as to the size that it should be and other matters of that sort are still under examination and discussion and I am not in a position to say at this moment when the project is likely to come to fruition but I just want to inform the Deputy that it is still on the stocks.</P>
    <P>Deputy James Tully also mentioned the question of the reorganisation of the staffs of boards of conservators and of providing a proper system of remuneration and pensionability for them.  I fully agree with Deputy Tully as to the necessity to get on with this job because in a modern community I do not think we can contemplate the present archaic sort of staffing arrangements continuing.  We must proceed as quickly as possible to get these staffs reorganised and put on a proper basis. I understand, however, that this task will have to be proceeded with in stages.  Apparently the first stage is to get the supervisory staffs on a proper footing and then proceed to the next stage of dealing with the problem of the temporary staffs, the inspectors, and so on, who are employed on a part-time basis.</P>

      <P>Mention has been made of Dunmore East.  Works are contemplated for Dunmore East at an <Col N="391" /> estimated cost of £250,000.  As well as that, a comprehensive piece of legislation is in the course of preparation which will give the Minister full power to control and manage the major fishery harbours.  This is a very important corollary to the development work which has been undertaken in regard to our fishery harbours and I hope that when the development work at Dunmore East is completed, there will be ample scope and facilities there for all sections concerned and that any disagreements which exist at present will disappear.  I think it would be the wish of Deputies on all sides of the House that the situation in Dunmore East should be resolved, and I would welcome the constructive efforts that anybody would make in this regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of the present worrying outbreak of disease in some of our salmon rivers. I want to assure him that this problem is engaging our full and anxious attention at the present time.  We are doing everything we possibly can to find out the cause of the outbreak. However, I should like to emphasise that so far nobody has developed a method of dealing with an epidemic or a disease in fish.  It is difficult to see in what way this sort of disease or epidemic could be tackled.  Most of the remedies that one thinks of in regard to the outbreak of disease in livestock on land do not apply to salmon, trout or other fish.  In any event, a variety of agencies and laboratories are working on the problem, and although we have not been able to get from these people any definite conclusions, we are continuing our efforts.  Deputy Dillon suggested that we might get some experts from abroad to come and look at this problem on the spot.  I do not know that there is any benefit likely to be derived from doing that but it is something we shall certainly be thinking about, and if it appears to us that there is anybody anywhere in the world willing to come here and help us we certainly will not refuse to avail of his services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister passes from that subject, would he <Col N="392" /> like to comment on the extent of this disease?  How many rivers are affected? I am concerned about the Suir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of rivers in Kerry affected, and the Suir is also affected.  I think we could describe the situation as serious and worrying but certainly not widespread. There are indications that catches by rod in most areas have not been affected by the disease.  When it was isolated in the beginning in one river, it was the cause of some concern but now that it has been discovered in a number of other rivers, it could be described as serious.  I am a little inhibited in talking about this subject because no matter how practically or rationally we may discuss it in this House, Deputies will know that these are matters which are very often taken up by foreign correspondents of newspapers and exaggerated and I would be very much afraid that harm might be done to our tourist angling business by unduly stressing the seriousness of this outbreak.  Deputy Davern is right when he says it is not the first time this type of epidemic appeared in our waters.  It is true there was an outbreak of it in the 'eighties of the last century in England and possibly here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coogan, who has the distinction of having made the only unconstructive contribution to the debate today, mentioned the hatchery at Oughterard and my reception of a deputation which came to see me about that matter.  I do not think the deputation have anything to complain about because they asked me to take a certain line of action and I met them on their request.  They asked that their licence be continued and I agreed to that.  I also decided that an immediate inspection of the hatchery should be made with a view to assessing what reconstruction of it was necessary to ensure that it would be able to function properly, and an inspector has since gone down from my Department to make that investigation.  Therefore, the deputation got exactly what they sought when they came to me.  Perhaps it would have been more politic for me to pretend that I could understand a great deal of scientific and technical <Col N="393" /> data which the deputation wished to unload upon me, but I think they should have been satisfied with getting what they were looking for, without, at the same time, insisting on my absorbing a vast quantity of technical data which I was not at the time in a position to absorb.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell asked about the administration of the sea fisheries division of my Department and the role of the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is my idea that the fisheries industry should be looked after by the Minister personally.  I think it merits the attention of the Minister.  My Parliamentary Secretary will be mainly concerned with the problems of the west of Ireland and its development.  To that extent, of course, he will have a general interest in fishery matters but his main efforts will, we hope, be directed to the solution of the particular problems confronting the west and the small farmers of the west.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying once more how much I appreciate and value the contributions that have been made by the different speakers and the suggestions they put forward.  In particular, I appreciate the kind remarks about the Inland Fisheries Trust.  I want to assure the House now that this Government are conscious of the fact that we have in our fisheries, both inland and sea, a very valuable natural asset and we are determined, as a Government, to exploit this natural asset to the greatest possible extent. It will be our earnest desire to develop our sea and inland fisheries to the maximum.</P>

      <P>I indicated last night that my primary purpose in intervening in this debate was to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for proceeding with all possible speed towards the implementation of the arterial drainage scheme throughout the country.  Drainage is one of the primary functions of the Office of Public Works.  What can be done as a result of drainage from the point of view of stimulating agricultural production, following on the reclamation of the arable land adjoining our rivers, is incalculable.  It is a rich reward towards which to work.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the flooding of the Suir and its tributaries. Because of the proposal to carry out an arterial drainage scheme, there is a tendency now on the part of local authorities to desist from doing anything at all in relation to the drainage of rivers.  Clearly, local authorities cannot provide the kind of capital required for dredging, draining, maintenance, embankments and so on.  Consequently there is a serious deterioration and the correction of that deterioration will be very costly unless we act quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to indicate to me that we <Col N="395" /> shall not have to wait until 1970 for the commencement of work on the Suir.  My colleagues on the county council and the Clonmel Corporation have felt for a long time that the Suir should have a much higher place on the priority list because of the fact that it is one of the biggest rivers in the country.  We do not wish the priority list to be set aside but we feel the position of the Suir is unfair, having regard to the size and importance of the river and its tributaries.  I hope to see the works commence at an early date.  The preparatory work has long since been carried out and there seems to be a very wasteful time-lag now. For two years no work has been done. It is high time work commenced.  The river must be drained from the source to the sea and, when that is done, rich arable acres in Tipperary, Waterford and the Golden Vale will be reclaimed to the benefit of the hundreds of farmers along the river and to the benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the delay in the erection and repair of schools.  The Office of Public Works does not seem to be properly equipped to deal with the problem of school building and repair.  It looks as if we must have a strike by pupils and parents in order to bring home to the Board of Works the urgency of this matter.  Some of the schools are really appalling.  They are nothing more than insanitary hovels in which teachers and children are compelled to remain for several hours at a stretch.  How we can expect teachers to teach in them and children to be educated in them is something that passes my comprehension.  There is a certain emphasis now on physical hygiene.  How that can be taught in schools which have no piped water and no sanitation is something I cannot answer.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we have had a number of school strikes in recent months.  The Parliamentary Secretary will be aware of the strike at Russelstown in respect of the derelict, ruinous building there.  There is also the strike at Lisnamrock, Coalbrook, Thurles, where parents, not for love of a strike <Col N="396" /> but by reason of their concern for the health of their children, were obliged to keep them from school until such time as a deputation was forced to come up here to Dublin to the Board and have the work accelerated.  In respect of school building, it is evident we have neither the contractors nor the equipment to carry out this work as speedily as one would desire.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility for the organisation of co-operatives falls on the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Ltd., which provides specialised advice and assistance in this field. Agricultural advisers can, however, play an important part in stimulating interest in, and in influencing the development of co-operation; and many have in fact given valuable assistance in the establishment of agricultural co-operatives.</P>
      <P>All agricultural advisers have been given the opportunity to acquire a knowledge of the principles and practice of co-operation during their university training and many of them have been able to see co-operation in practice in other countries on the occasion of study tours.  The subject of co-operation has, with the assistance of the IAOS, been included in the recent in-service training course for Pilot Area Advisers and its inclusion in future in-service training courses for other advisers is envisaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports of lamb into France from non-EEC countries are regulated under a minimum price system, the operation of which is based on the price of lamb at two markets in Paris.  Under this system the French market opens automatically when prices exceed certain pre-determined levels and closes automatically when prices fall below those levels.  The difficulties which this entails for Irish exporters have in fact been brought to the notice of the French authorities, who, however, do not consider that it is possible for them to change their established system.</P>
      <P>I might add that, as the opening or closing of the French market is determined by the levels of prices in Paris in two successive weeks, those engaged in the lamb trade can normally obtain an indication about a week in advance of a possible change in the import situation.</P>

      <P>As I announced on 1st June, the cross-Border trade in <Col N="414" /> poultry, including day-old chicks, has now been re-opened following discussions between my Department and the Ministry of Agriculture of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following the first confirmed case early this year, it was necessary to embark on a very extensive programme of testing.  So far, 1,256 flocks have been tested, of which 29 gave positive results and 16 gave inconclusive results.  The remaining 1,211 flocks were negative.  A further 40 flocks have still to be tested and the 16 inconclusive flocks re-tested.  At that stage, I am hopeful that we shall have eliminated the disease, but we shall do some further testing, as a precaution.</P>

      <P>I think there must be some misunderstanding on the Deputy's part there.  I could not visualise anybody losing his trade as a result of a test.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The erection of traffic lights is a matter for the Dublin Corporation.  Traffic lights are expensive and, where an experimental scheme of traffic movement is introduced, the Garda Síochána cannot expect the Corporation to erect new or additional lights until it is seen whether the scheme is going to be a success.</P>
      <P>Right-turning traffic at the Leeson Street and Harcourt Street corners of St. Stephen's Green is not governed by the traffic lights at these junctions.  I am not aware that this causes general confusion, but on the other hand it makes crossing by pedestrians difficult. Consequently, the Dublin Corporation has, as a temporary measure, placed an order for the erection of an additional signal-light which will bring right-turning traffic under the control of the lights and work on this is in progress.</P>
      <P>This will lead to a slowing-up of the one-way traffic movement around St. Stephen's Green and, although the slowing-up may be significant, it will have to be accepted for the time being. Surveys have already been made, however, in preparation for the installation of a more comprehensive system of lights giving the effect of a &ldquo;filter-right&rdquo; provision but which will also have a phase for pedestrians who wish to cross the road.</P>

    <P>Consequently, I think it would be reasonable to allow people to bring <Col N="421" /> their arrangements into line and, accordingly, no action will be taken either as regards advertising or as regards prize limits up to 20th June.</P>
    <P>It may happen that a relaxation of enforcement until 20th June will bring no benefit to some promoters as they may have planned only a single bingo session&mdash;for one night only&mdash;and fixed it for a date after 20th June.  In such a case, the Garda will not intervene when satisfied that the arrangements for a prize fund exceeding £500 have already been made and commitments entered into before 1st June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Singing is a compulsory subject for all grades in national schools.  Furthermore, in junior classes, it forms an integral part of the teaching of other subjects, instruction being given by means of simple rhymes in song.  For these reasons, it is essential that national teachers be able to sing and I am not prepared to alter the Department's regulations in this regard.</P>
      <P>I should like, however, to add that boys who obtain 2,000 or more marks at the Leaving Certificate Examination are not required to pass the test in singing.</P>
      <P>I may also add, for the Deputy's information, that an ample supply of suitably qualified candidates is available for training as national teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ridiculous to insist on this qualification.  Singing is a talent that cannot be acquired.  Surely people who cannot sing should not be debarred from the teaching profession?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that in the case of men who are particularly talented other than in singing, they can become teachers if they obtain more than 2,000 marks in the Leaving Certificate.  From the point of view of ensuring that our children are taught singing, and particularly because of the fact that many of our primary schools are one-teacher schools, we must ensure that our teachers are capable of teaching singing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the publication of the survey referred to by the Deputy, but this survey was not submitted to the Department of Education by the sponsoring body for consideration. In the course of the survey, the writer has made comments on the present position with regard to the teaching of music rather than specific recommendations for its improvement. Where relevant, these comments have been noted and, in the main, they refer to aspects of music teaching which are under continuous review in the Department.  Measures taken in the past few years as a result of this review include the addition of courses in musicianship to the curriculum of secondary schools as an alternative to established music courses, the appointment of country musical organisers by certain vocational education committees and the provision by the Department of special summer courses for music teachers in secondary schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was adverting to the necessity of accelerating the repairs to national schools and the erection of new schools.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been good enough to admit one flagrant difficulty in the erection of new schools and the necessary repairs when he admits in his brief that the number of new schools in the course of construction has been increasing steadily, but that the time taken in actual building is often longer than one would like.  Contracts which should have been completed in six to nine months are sometimes not started for several months after the contract has been placed and frequently the time limit for completion has to be extended considerably.  We have considerable experience of that occurring too often, and I feel, without any reflection on any particular contractor as such, the Parliamentary Secretary has an obligation to ensure that he accepts tenders for the erection and repairs of these schools from reputable people who will at least keep their word.</P>
      <P>We have evidence of having had to appeal to contractors to come in and finish a school and even the outcry of a whole parish and publicity in the newspapers and on the radio had no good effect.  A school strike over a long number of weeks had no good effect either and it would seem that too many of these contractors are taking on too much work, whether it is with the Board of Works proper or with other concerns.  Certainly, they are showing scant respect for the works placed at their disposal by the Office of Public Works.  There is undue delay in the commencement of the work, and when the work is commenced there is a tendency to withdraw their labour, divert them elsewhere, and leave the completion of the school in abeyance for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that is not good enough.  I appreciate that there is an acute shortage of skilled labour in the building trade.  Admittedly, there is a boom, <Col N="429" /> and it is, perhaps, difficult to get contractors, but at the same time the Office of Public Works are a State body and should be in a position to get these works completed.  There is no indication in the Parliamentary Secretary's report that we can hope for a speeding up in the much needed work on urban, rural or minor employment schemes, and, indeed, in respect of bog development and other miscellaneous schemes which are embarked upon from time to time.</P>
    <P>When we analyse the figures for the various proposals from 1956 to date we find that, in fact, less money is being allocated towards certain of these essential services than was allocated in 1956-57.  The amount of money allocated to urban employment schemes in 1956-57 was £284,840.  This year the amount allocated is £200,000, a drop of £84,840.  In respect of minor employment schemes, again there is a deficiency.  The amount allocated towards that venture in 1956-57 was £136,074.  This year the amount in the Minister's Estimate is £124,000, a drop of over £12,000.  In all, since 1956-57 the Estimate for all these essential services&mdash;urban, rural and minor employment schemes, and bog development schemes&mdash;has increased by only a little over £87,000.  That is no indication to our people that there is an acceleration in the work which is required.  It is no cause for jubilation in the rural areas where we rely so much upon rural improvement and employment schemes to know that less money is being provided now than was provided in 1957.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the Office of Public Works which I admire very much is that whoever designed the unemployment relief schemes which are embarked upon usually at Christmas time each year was a great humanitarian at heart because he stipulated that these schemes were primarily for the relief of unemployment.  We have gone to too many State Departments seeking new employment opportunities for our people only to be told that they were not a benevolent society or an employment agency, and that it was not their function to provide jobs. <Col N="430" /> It is good that in at least one State Department we have these employment schemes in which it is stipulated that there must be a high employment content, and in which preference is given to unfortunate men who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  When those categories are absorbed they recruit recipients of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome that, but from experience I can say that the directions issued by the Office of Public Works that the scheme should have a high labour content are not being adhered to as well as the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works might desire. The direction in regard to the recruitment of those people is adhered to pretty well, but it transpires that the moneys allocated on the basis of the census of unemployment at the previous January, together with the contribution from the local authority, are very largely absorbed by the use of materials and machinery and very little is left over for the labour content of the job.  The Office of Public Works should be more careful to ensure that approved schemes have a high labour content.  To do that they will have to dissuade the local authorities from utilising high-powered machinery for roadmaking, and from using costly materials, if cheaper substitutes can be found.  When £1,000 is provided for an unemployment relief scheme in a small town or village, very often £600 or £700 goes on materials and machinery and only about £300 is spent on the provision of work for unemployed men.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have regard to the fact that it is not good enough to go on the basis of the unemployment prevailing at any given time.  This is based on the previous January, but it may be higher or lower at the time of the commencement of a scheme.  The Government should take this into account.  There are many urban authorities I know of where a penny on the rate would provide only £20 revenue.  That is an infinitesimal amount of money in these times, and clearly these urban authorities could not embark upon any <Col N="431" /> worthwhile scheme without State aid. To provide even £1,000 would mean increasing the rate by 4/- or 5/-, which is something no small authority dare attempt.</P>
    <P>Where it can be shown that the local authority is unable to embark upon essential schemes such as the repair and improvement of roadways, footpaths or bridges because of lack of revenue the Office of Public Works should take all those things into consideration and should assist the authority to carry out their functions. It is regrettable that small authorities should be denied the ordinary amenities which bigger boroughs and county councils enjoy because they have the power to garner in the necessary revenue.  It is not good enough that these small authorities should suffer a lack of adequate lighting, adequate roads and adequate sanitation due to their inability to provide money out of the rates.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which was such a tremendous advantage to these small authorities, the Board of Works are the only people we can call on for assistance in the circumstances.  I would ask that the test be not merely the employment content but rather the overall ability of the local authority to meet their commitments in regard to the provision of amenities, and that the amount of the grants be increased proportionately. The requirement that the local authority are obliged to contribute portion of the cost of such schemes, whether it be ten per cent or 15 per cent, can impose very great hardship on the poorer bodies to which I refer.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works on the great work being done in regard to our national monuments, in respect of the number already taken in charge and pretty adequately maintained in my constituency.  I mention Holy Cross Abbey and the Rock of Cashel as instances.  It is gratifying to note that Clare Castle, one of the best types of old Irish castle in this country, is now under the care of the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> It has been suggested to me&mdash;it is merely a layman's opinion and I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary for what it is worth&mdash;that some additional work might be done in regard to the Rock of Cashel.  It is suggested that King Cormac's Chapel, in particular, might be roofed and the remains of the old castle renovated to bring back some of its former glory.  What has been done in regard to Bunratty Castle and other places could surely be done at the Rock of Cashel and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary investigate the feasibility of renovating and roofing it and putting it into a proper state of repair in keeping with the traditions of the old building.  It is felt it would become a tremendous tourist attraction in that area.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the matter of ancient monuments because we have in Clonmel a monument which has been the cause of some controversy in recent time.  I refer to the West Gate.  This old gate, which stood in the original walls of this walled town, is now in a very bad state of repair and is regarded as dangerous by the borough engineer.  The question is whether it should be renovated and maintained or whether it should be knocked down and the street widened in conformity with town planning proposals.</P>
    <P>I am on the side of those who say the West Gate should stand.  While it may not be regarded as being of very great historical importance since it is not a very ancient structure, it is the living symbol of our ancient town of Clonmel.  It is the place where Irish swords beat back the hordes.  Our town would not be the same without this ancient monument and I think it is the consensus of opinion in the town that if the gate can be preserved, it should be preserved.</P>
    <P>Regretfully, the corporation would seem to be fighting shy of embarking on the expenditure involved.  The owner of the property has been generous enough to offer a grant of £1,000 towards its restoration but of course that is totally inadequate to meet the repair bill involved.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to interest <Col N="433" /> himself in this problem and see to it that the West Gate is retained, repaired and preserved as an integral part of that ancient town because if it is lost to us, part of our ancient heritage will have been lost.  I do not think it is good enough any longer in the interests of town planning, or progress, or efficiency, that these things to which we should hold fast should be swept away, thereby losing some of the intrinsic worth in the long history of our country.</P>
    <P>It is my ardent hope that the gate will be preserved and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to interest himself in the problem and assist us to retain it.  I can imagine the dismay and anger of an emigrant, a native of Clonmel, returning home and seeing a void where this old gate once stood. The thought has aroused indignation and anger and since we are unable of our own volition, through lack of finance, to meet our commitments in this respect, I earnestly beseech the Board of Works to come to our rescue.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to convey to the Parliamentary Secretary my personal congratulations on attaining this high and onerous position in the Government.  He brings to this office the youth and vigour he has at his disposal.  He has a great opportunity to do good for so many people through the various branches and agencies of the Board of Works.  In all he does for the prosperity and betterment of our people, I wish him well and extend to him my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to join with Deputy Treacy in extending my congratulation to my colleague, on his appointment to his new office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  As Deputy Treacy has said, it is an office that requires an energetic and youthful man because it deals with so many aspects of our public life.  Looking at the title itself&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance&mdash;one would imagine it would be a dull and uninteresting job&mdash;that he would be <Col N="434" /> dealing with statistics and figures&mdash;but because he is in charge of the Board of Works, he has to deal with schools, public buildings, all sorts of drainage, roads.  Therefore, the office requires the services of a youthful and energetic man to do most interesting work.  I feel sure it will thrive during his term of office because, to my mind, he is the ideal man for the job.</P>
      <P>My contribution to the debate will be very brief.  One of the two points I wish to make is in regard to schools, a matter in which I have a personal interest.  I was glad to hear that the target of 100 new schools a year is to be maintained.  I should like to compliment the architects and those in the Office of Public Works who have been designing schools in recent years.  They have given them an artistic touch and have provided them with all modern amenities such as water and sewerage facilities.  By degrees, we are getting rid of the old unhealthy and insanitary school buildings we had for years. Environment plays a big part in the education of children and the school itself should be a model and an example.  If you have an artistic, modern building, it is a lesson in itself and the Board of Works are living up to that ideal in the schools they have been designing and erecting.  I hope that trend will be continued and that in addition to having nice buildings, there will be pleasant surroundings with a playground attached to each school in which the children can indulge in healthy and active games.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to drainage and to roads.  One of the main criticisms I have to express about this Estimate is that not sufficient money is being provided for the rural improvement schemes.  As a matter of fact, any applicant who receives a copy of the rural improvements scheme will find a little note attached to the application form which reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Please note that because of the volume of applications already on hands it is necessary to put all new applications on a waiting list.  In the event of your making application now there will therefore be a delay before the case can be inspected.  It <Col N="435" /> is not possible to say how long the delay will be but all cases will be dealt with as far as possible in the order of the date of receipt.</P>
    <P>That is a warning to applicants that when they apply for a rural improvement scheme, they may experience a considerable delay even before the road or drain in which they are interested will be inspected.  In my opinion, as much money as possible should be directed to the scheme.  We should have a crash programme as far as rural improvement schemes are concerned.  I do not known whether or not the same position obtains all over the country.</P>
    <P>I spoke on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government and I made the point that in County Galway we have only two ways of getting the stop-end roads and link roads done. One way is directly out of the ratepayers' pockets and the other is through the rural improvement schemes.  At one time a rural improvement scheme was a job that lasted for only two or three years and then you had to apply again when the roads went into disrepair. Since 1962, however, the then Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Malley, made an agreement with the managers in every county that when a road was finished and when the people had subscribed to the local application for the rural improvement scheme, the county council could then take it over and maintain it for all time.  To my mind, that is the cause of this note on the application form because immediately they realised that here was something worth doing.  They said to themselves: &ldquo;We do not mind subscribing once but we do not want to be subscribing this year and then in two or three years time subscribing again and then in a further two or three years time subscribing once more.  We will subscribe now and once it has been done, the county council will take it over and maintain it for all time and we will be finished with it.&rdquo;  That is the reason for this note and that is why I am urging the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government to institute a crash programme for the rural improvement schemes grant and to put <Col N="436" /> as much money as possible into it, even if it has to be taken from bog development or minor improvements.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Treacy about minor improvements but I will show how my suggestion could still be carried out.  People look for these rural improvement schemes grants and in some cases they are not for stop-end roads but link roads.  For instance, in my area there are two or three link roads with up to 14 houses on them in which people with cars and tractors live and who are paying tax into the Road Fund.  They are living on roads which one could hardly describe.  The priest has to go there twice a year for the Stations, or visit there on sick calls, and the doctor has to visit there also, but the roads are virtually impassable. Sometimes you have a road which joins one tarred road to another and which serves 14 or 15 houses.  You have travelling shops or perhaps oil lorries, or even county council lorries, travelling on them but they have not been taken over by the county council.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the rural improvement scheme should be changed for link roads and in particular for a road joining two main roads.  I suggest that it would relieve the Parliamentary Secretary of some of his duties, and he has a lot of other onerous work to do, if he gave grants from his Department to the local authorities in each county for the special improvements schemes. I know what we in Galway could do if we got the £30,000 or £40,000 being expended there.  This was done at one time.</P>

      <P>I remember during the emergency period when the local authorities&mdash;I have been a member of Galway County Council for 20 years&mdash; carried out this work.  The local councillors could meet and they would have a say about what roads would be done, with the help of the engineers and their staff, and they would be able to expend that money, in my opinion, to the better advantage of the people, in their own areas, than it is now being spent by the Board of Works.  If we had the money, we could decide what roads would be done, take them <Col N="437" /> over and maintain them for all time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy, when speaking about relief grants, said it was a good thing that we had these grants for relieving unemployment.  I admit that it is but one of the conditions is that they only have to go for employment within a certain distance.  If the relief scheme is not within so many miles, they need not travel.  Some of these works which are carried out are of no public utility or value&mdash;that is the one snag&mdash;while you might have one a mile away that would have been of great value and if you could get some form of transport to take people to it, it would be of much more value than some of the jobs being done by the Board of Works at present because these are of no value.</P>
      <P>I was speaking to the Parliamentary Secretary and I gave him an example of the type of work carried out in bog development schemes.  A job is done, say, this year and in two or three years, a continuation grant is given.  I know of one such case.  During the emergency this bog development scheme was carried out because turf was being cut at the time by the county council.  The next thing was that the turf scheme finished but the Board of Works came along in a few years and gave an additional grant to repair this road which was of no utility because there was no house on it.  But a quarter of a mile away there was a parallel road which was of great value.  It was on that road the money should have been spent.  I have suggested that if the Parliamentary Secretary could relieve himself of the money for Special Employment Scheme grants, he could give it to the county councils who could then do the link roads and stop-end roads, making a crash programme of it, and then take them under council control.  That would be of immense benefit in my county and, I am sure, in other counties also.</P>
      <P>I hope something will be done about these two matters.  I again congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and wish him well in his post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="438" /> to the fact that the Land Commision have recently taken over the Killeaden estate outside Kiltimagh. Killeaden House has been associated with Rafteri an File with whose work no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary is familiar.  Certainly, in the literary history of Ireland, the name of Raftery is venerated.  I know the problem of preserving old houses but I think most of us would greatly regret the disappearance of Killeaden House, if it could be preserved.  It is now in the possession of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Coole, the home of Lady Gregory is gone: Killeaden House has associations with Douglas Hyde and Lady Gregory, in addition to the fact that it is the centre where Rafterty wrote a great deal of his poetry, the centre around which he lived most of his life.  I would commend to the Parliamentary Secretary the possibility of preserving this house and perhaps he would have a word with the Minister for Lands to discover what it is proposed to do about it.  It might be that if that house were put in repair&mdash;it is in pretty good repair and by no means derelict&mdash; some religous order might be able to use it for some fruitful purpose if made available at a small rent.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will look into the matter in consultation with the Minister for Lands, at least we can be satisfied that the house will not be casually destroyed and if it is at all possible to preserve it, on account of its sentimental associations, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to devise a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four or five topics I want to mention briefly.  One is that I have been agitating in this House for close on a quarter of a century for an aerial survey of the country.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, I tried to inaugurate it.  I was successfully frustrated by the Department of Defence which at that time wanted to get aeroplanes which the Minister for Finance would not provide.  They suddenly thought this was a glorious opportunity to achieve their object and they suggested that it would be very dangerous to allow the Department of Agriculture <Col N="439" /> to make an aerial survey of the country because foreign enemies might have access to it and the only persons who could safely undertake it were the Army.  If they were to undertake it, they would have to get the aeroplanes they sought.  The Minister for Finance would not give the aeroplanes and therefore the survey was never done.</P>
    <P>The result of that is that a variety of people are now participating in piecemeal surveys and in association with the town planning operations, an aerial survey is being made of selected areas.</P>
    <P>This is one of these matters which is somewhat technical and it is very difficult to get people to realise how important it is.  An aerial survey can be either vertical or angular.  A vertical survey is of no use to anybody except to a town planner; on the other hand, an angular survey is of infinite use to town planners, archaeologists, soil scientists, and a variety of others concerned with having a true aerial picture of the whole of our territory. There is reference in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement to the work being done by the Board of Works for the preservation of ancient monuments. I gladly acknowledge the debt we owe to the Board of Works for their exertions on these monuments but the tragedy is that while we are preserving certain ancient monuments, hundreds of them are being expunged every day with no record left behind, by the ordinary processes of agriculture. If we get an angular aerial survey of the whole country, all these ancient monuments in the form of ring forts and various other monuments that exist could be permanently recorded and those that require excavation before they are obliterated could be marked off and protected while proper excavation procedures were initiated by the Museum.</P>
    <P>I tried to prevail on the Government when I was a Minister with the force of this argument and it occurred to me that the best way I could do it would be to give them a demonstration. I live close to Croghan in County Roscommon, the traditional <Col N="440" /> home of Queen Maedhbh and King Ailill and an immensely rich archaeological site.  Accordingly, I had an aerial survey made of that area on the ground that I wanted it for the purposes of the Land Project.  Then I got the peripatetic survey made by the Ordnance Survey of the same area. On the peripatetic survey, there were seven archaeological sites: on the angular aerial survey there were 40 such sites the existence of which nobody knew until we made this survey on the pretence that it was needed for the purpose of the Land Project.  Those documents are in the Department of Agriculture and if the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to check, the material is there for his information.</P>
    <P>I want to renew my suggestion to him that we should take an angular aerial survey of the country forthwith because if the town planners go on with their vertical survey, a great deal of money will be spent, and properly spent on an aerial survey, but it is the wrong survey.  If we got an angular survey of the whole country, it would be of incalculable value to the Department of Agriculture, of great value to the Parliamentary Secretary in the Board of Works, of great value to the Department of Industry and Commerce in the Geological Section and of incalculable value to the Board of Works for the purpose of archaeological protection.  It would be invaluable to the Museum for the purpose of archaeological records, and I expect it would be of great value to the National Library.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that nobody is sufficiently interested in it to put the work in hands and probably if the Parliamentary Secretary tries his hand at it, he will find the Minister for Defence briefed to kick up another row.  All I can tell him is that that row was kicked up on a previous occasion and I do not give a fiddle-de-dee who makes the survey, but at least let us make it before hundreds more archaeological sites in this country are irretrievably expunged.</P>
    <P>What a great many people do not know is that this island on which we <Col N="441" /> live is the richest treasure house of archaeological sites in the world.  One would expect that places in Europe would be richer but that is not so.  For some strange reason, there has been very much less disturbance of these archaeological remains here than elsewhere but, in our time, as mechanised agriculture is becoming more and more common the tendency is for these sites to be extinguished and I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to interest himself in this matter.</P>
    <P>There was a most interesting lecture delivered only last Tuesday night to the Antiquarian Society at Merrion Square on this very subject by a professor from Cambridge who dealt with the whole question of aeriel survey and demonstrated by slides, because he has been sailing about the country doing an aerial survey on his own.  In every area where he took photographs from the air at the right angle he was in a position to demonstrate to us a vast number of archaelogical sites of which nobody had any knowledge until he had taken these pictures because for a variety of technical reasons it is impossible to detect them except through the medium of an aerial survey.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary would make the &ldquo;Gibbons Survey&rdquo; of this country his name would go down to posterity like the man who made the Griffith Valuation.  Here is a possibility for immortality.</P>

      <P>The second point I want to make falls partly under the discretion of the Parliamentary Secretary and partly under the discretion of the Minister for Education.  We are drifting back into the situation of building bandbox schools all over the country again.  The plain fact is that we are replacing all the national schools as a result of their deterioration with the passage of time.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary does not <Col N="442" /> control policy in regard to the provision of schools; he merely carries out what the Minister for Education asks him to do; but I would suggest to him that where he is asked to build three small schools in a country parish, he ought to say to the Minister: &ldquo;There are five schools in this parish.  None of them can possibly give the pupils adequate facilities.  Will you ask the parish priest who now needs to build three small schools, to let me build one central parochial school where I can provide decent amenities for the children, a swimming pool, perhaps, a recreation hall where they can have physical drill and little plays and little concerts, and so forth, where, instead of having two teachers or one teacher in each school, we will have eight or nine teachers, and into which all the children can be brought on buses in the morning and left back to the site of the old one-teacher or two-teacher school, in their immediate vicinity, to walk on home after the bus has taken them from the central school?&rdquo; Why we have not done that years ago I do not know.  This is another matter which I must have raised in this House twenty times.  I once succeeded in getting a parish priest to come forward and say that he would collaborate but that did not seem to move either the Minister for Education or the Office of Public Works.  So, I was somewhat discouraged.</P>
      <P>I return to the charge now and invite Deputy Gibbons to put his mind to this matter and to see if he can find an enlightened parish priest who would say: &ldquo;If you will give me a central school I will gladly abandon all the scattered ones and we will have one school in the middle of the parish.&rdquo;  I recognise that the Parliamentary Secretary cannot do anything unless he can persuade the Minister for Education to collaborate with him by providing the daily transport to get the children from one parish together in one school for their primary education</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that socially and from every other point of view it is a good thing to treat the local parish as the social unit of a rural community; it is good for all the children of one parish <Col N="443" /> to be educated together and I am certain that we can provide for the children a far higher standard of amenities if we gather them all into one parochial school than we can hope to do by having a multitude of one-teacher and two-teacher schools scattered all over the areas.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary operates a National Building Agency and it has been a success.  I want to make another suggestion.  Would he negotiate with the Minister for Agriculture and suggest to him that now that he has got the National Building Agency functioning for the purpose of erecting residences for Civic Guards, <i>et cetera,</i> if the farm building scheme is to be made a success the same organisation should be now authorised to build farm buildings to approved designs for farmers under the Farm Buildings Scheme?  There are thousands of pounds being wasted at the present time by people building piggeries, cow-houses and other farm buildings badly.  I wish we would work out a scheme whereby if a man got a grant to build a cow-house for six cows or a piggery for 20 or 40 or 100 pigs, he could turn to an efficient building organisation and say, &ldquo;Build me a piggery according to one of the three different plans approved by the Agricultural Institute&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Build me a cow-house for six cows&rdquo;, and that the national building institute would thereupon do it, having at their disposal a competent staff, not only to design the buildings properly but to supervise their erection and to help the farmer to choose their suitable location on his own holding having regard to the type of husbandry which his circumstances required him to operate. I do not propose to elaborate that further because the Parliamentary Secretary must understand what I am at without further elaboration.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question.  His colleague made during the Roscommon by-election one of these deplorable political gestures.  In the frantic hope that they could win the by-election, which they failed to do, he said that <Col N="444" /> they were going to drain the Shannon and they were going to spend £20 million on it.  That was a cheap, silly, political fraud.  I want to ask Deputies of this House, if there is any right reason left amongst them, do we seriously propose to spend £20 million draining the Shannon?  What are we up to?  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consult the Department of Agriculture. The plain truth about the Shannon is that the Shannon is one of many rivers in the world which, considering its geographical situation, has a winter and summer bed.  You can confine the shannon in winter and summer to its summer bed if you want to but you are daft if you do.  You can confine the Nile to its summer bed if you want to but if you did you would starve half the Egyptian population. One of the greatest sources of the wealth of Egypt is the fact that the Nile overflows its banks and, if it did not, half the Egyptian people would be driven into the urban conurbations which could not sustain them.  The water meadows of the Shannon are some of the most valuable land of this country.</P>
    <P>Did you ever see the Shannon in flood?  I have seen the Shannon in flood below the town of Athlone.  It is a most extraordinary sight to see a vast sea of water with houses sitting apparently on the surface.  That is a very improvident arrangement but those homes can be lifted out of the old ground, out of the water meadows, and put on the high ground.  There is no difficulty whatever in using the water meadows of the Shannon most providently. Even hay could be made but, of course, the hay must be taken away by a certain date.  However, nobody ought to make hay there.  The lands ought to be grazed and they are some of the richest grazing lands in the world.  The people living in the vicinity ought to use the land intelligently as water meadows.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be much better employed if he went down to these people who are blessed with this fertile land, perennially fertilised by the overflow of the Shannon, and said to them: &ldquo;Do you want to work water <Col N="445" /> meadows?  If you do not like that sort of land we will buy it from you at £100 an acre and we will sell it to somebody who does like that kind of land.&rdquo;  The Government are not seriously going down to the Shannon to spend £20 million on draining it.  They are not draining the Shannon.  They are trying to confine the Shannon in winter to its summer bed.</P>
    <P>I had this all carefully examined by an American drainage expert from the Tennessee Valley Authority at the time of the 1954 flood.  Very elaborate works could be carried out balancing the lakes on the Shannon but I am quite convinced that it is all illusory. What the arterial drainage board ought to do is to let the Shannon overflow and I guarantee the Parliamentary Secretary will find plenty of people who will be prepared to work it as water meadow.  I beg of the Parliamentary Secretary before he embarks on this crazy scheme to ask himself if for the sake of pure political codology he is going to allow the engineering and financial resources of this country to be diverted not to draining the Shannon but to confining the Shannon in winter to its summer bed.  Arterial drainage engineers are as rare as white blackbirds. One cannot go out and hire a firm of consulting engineers.  All the resources for arterial drainage are in the Board of Works because arterial drainage is a Government function. Ordinary civil engineering firms are no good at it.  Why not employ these arterial drainage engineers on the work of draining the other rivers that urgently and genuinely stand in need of arterial drainage, where there are big rock barriers, and so forth, that need to be removed?  I want to make this perfectly clear.  Anyone who knows anything about arterial drainage realises that one must take arterial drainage on the basis of the whole area. It really affects the watershed of the main river.  There is a good deal of drainage to be done in the watershed of the Shannon.  Ordinarily, the main channel is taken and the tributaries into the main channel are done as they are reached from the estuary.  What ought to be done in regard to the Shannon is to let it flood, proceed with the drainage <Col N="446" /> of the Suck and all the other tributary rivers and never mind the fact that the influx of these waters, consequent on the drainage of the tributaries, will exacerbate the present flooding of the Shannon.  A great deal of work can be done on balancing the lakes if that is considered necessary but let the Shannon flood and anybody who does not like working that type of land can sell it at £100 per acre to the Board of Works who can, in turn, sell it to people who will be very glad to buy it, and let those who want to sell the land which is perennially inundated buy land elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to raise in this connection.  We are going to spend £2 million on building a concert hall as a memorial to President Kennedy, and that concert hall will cost at least £10,000 a year to keep going.  That sum will be necessary to keep its doors open and to keep the fabric in repair, that is taking a very optimistic view.  If the money were invested in a trust fund tomorrow it would produce an annual income of £120,000 and if the £10,000 annual deficit for the operation of the hall is added, there would be an annual sum of £130,000.  That would provide 250 scholarships per annum to put boys and girls from this country through a university. If we want a memorial to President Kennedy, which is the better memorial&mdash;to have permanently available to our boys and girls 250 scholarships to enable them to do post-graduate or undergraduate work at the universities on the continent of Europe or the universities of America, or a concert hall which will cost £10,000 to £20,000 to operate?</P>
    <P>When this subject was first mooted nobody adverted to what it was going to cost.  Nobody asked.  It was only at a later stage that the figure of £2 million emerged.  I wonder if we are right in spending £2 million to erect a concert hall in Dublin having just pulled down the Theatre Royal to make way for office buildings, when we could for the same investment provide, in perpetuity, more than 200 scholarships per annum for boys and girls in all parts of the country who would <Col N="447" /> otherwise never have a chance of access to institutes of higher learning in other parts of the world to develop the gift God gave them.  I am virtually certain that a memorial based on the education of successive generations of young people, if needs be in order to maintain the existing link, in the universities of the United States of America with reciprocal arrangements for a certain number of young American students to study in the universities of Ireland, would be a far more fitting memorial to a great world figure who understood the vital value of education for the young.</P>
    <P>I am often appalled when I think of the magnitude of the task that lies before us if we are to provide our young people with the minimum educational facilities the emerging new world demands of them.  I should like to think that we would open this door of opportunity in perpetuity to 200 of our young people every year from this time on.  There is no other source from which they can get this.  Most other countries have some means of giving their young people a chance to see the world and to come in contact with foreign academic institutions. Circumstances have, I think, placed such an opportunity within our reach now.  I recognise that the Parliamentary Secretary is not primarily charged with policy, but he is Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is, I believe, the Minister charged with the operation of policy in this regard.  Perhaps he would invite the Minister to consider with him whether the hall or the access to learning in perpetuity for 200 young people every year, and that for the full period required by the particular academic work to complete their education either to degree or post-graduate standard, would be the better memorial.  I should like to believe it is not too late to think again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the other speakers in congratulating and extending my good wishes to Deputy Gibbons on his appointment and to say that I am <Col N="448" /> quite sure his many qualities fit him well for his task.  He will have a pretty high standard to follow because his predecessor was one of those who had a knack for getting things done. He brought a welcome breath of fresh air into his Office, something that was welcomed by many of us in this House. I should like to add, however, that if I want a question answered by the Parliamentary Secretary, I shall address the question to him, but if I write to the Director, or some other official, I want a reply from the official to whom I write.  I do not want letters addressed to officials replied to by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not think that is part of his job and, if that procedure has been adopted, it is wrong and the sooner it stops the better.</P>
      <P>The matters I will want to raise will in most cases be matters affecting my constituents and the queries will be addressed to the civil servants dealing with such matters.  I consider it quite wrong that matters of that kind should be brought into the political sphere.  For that reason I ask the Parliamentary Secretary now to ensure that letters addressed to his officials are answered by his officials.</P>
      <P>Most of the matters normally dealt with on an Estimate of this kind have already been debated very fully.  For that reason, I intend to stick strictly to matters affecting my constituents or matters which have been brought to my notice for particular reasons.  I am glad progress on arterial drainage has been pretty good.  It is rather a pity that something has not been done to resolve the growing problem for counties like my own in relation to rates <i>vis-à-vis</i> the maintenance of completed arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had an arterial drainage scheme in the north of the county on the Dee.  A sum of £12,000 is not just requested but demanded from the county council each year for maintenance; that represents approximately 5d. or 6d. in the £.  The Broadmeadow, which is almost completed, will be added next year.  The Inny will possibly be added next year or the year <Col N="449" /> after.  We hope the Boyne will be done shortly.  The Boyne and the Blackwater flow from one end of the county to the other.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates the situation, but it would appear now that the maintenance of the Boyne will fall almost entirely on the ratepayers of Meath.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to have this whole position investigated now.  Does he think the ratepayers of Meath will be able to carry the burden?  I understand from those who claim to be experts that the sum involved will be colossal.  A figure of 8/- or 9/- in the £ on the rates has been mentioned.  I think everybody will agree that that is more than the people in any one county can be expected to bear.  The important point is that people living in towns 20 and 30 miles from the scheme will have to pay the same rates as those living beside the rivers.  The latter will derive some benefit.</P>
    <P>Now, I am not trying to prevent any scheme from being carried out.  I believe arterial drainage will benefit a great number of people but I think we must do some rethinking in regard to maintenance charges.  Eventually the State will have to face up to the fact that the State should carry the charges as well as the initial cost.  I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would look at that aspect of the matter and let me have at his convenience at some future date his opinion as to whether or not something can be done to help.</P>
    <P>On arterial drainage and on the Shannon embankment scheme, there are quite a number of people employed.  Many of them are trained as drivers and machine operators. When a scheme is completed, the people working on the scheme are very often let go because there appears to be no more work for them.  In many cases the Board of Works subsequently have to recruit new men when a new scheme comes into operation.  I know there is a cadre of trained personnel maintained to the very end of the scheme.  They automatically pass along to any other scheme.  But that does not <Col N="450" /> solve the problem of the large number of extra trained men required.  They are not available because they have had to find other employment after being trained by the Board of Works for a long period.</P>
    <P>The question of the rates of pay for these men has been dealt with in another place.  There is one aspect that should be remembered, however.  While there is a bonus scheme operating, which gives to those in receipt of bonuses anything from 36/- to £3 per week over the basic wage, a number of schemes are not included for bonus purposes.  We are told that the type of work&mdash;the Shannon embankments are particularly referred to&mdash;does not lend itself to a bonus scheme.  We are told that the people able to assess the type of work in order to apply the bonus are not available.  That may be a fair answer to the question as far as the Board of Works are concerned.  It is no answer to the people doing the same type of work, working just as hard, just as long and in as bad conditions as their colleagues on other schemes who are getting from under £2 to over £3 a week more than they are.  This is something which, in ordinary justice, the Board of Works will have to face up to.  If they cannot introduce a bonus scheme in all their work, a plus payment of some kind must be made to the men not getting a bonus.  There is absolutely no reason why the situation should be allowed to continue just because the Board of Works, for one reason or another, are unable to put the scheme into operation.</P>
    <P>I raised with the Parliamentary Secretary's Department a number of questions concerning arterial drainage. The first concerns complaints about an excess amount of spoil being put on the land of somebody who has not much land.  Take the case of a good farmer with a relatively small farm. Spoil measuring two perches wide and 40 or 50 perches long is put on his land which is rendered useless for all practical purposes.  That man has a genuine grievance.  Since we have local authorities all over the country looking for spoil to fill dangerous <Col N="451" /> quarry holes, mines and so on, there should be some way of having this spoil taken away instead of preventing farmers from using their land.</P>
    <P>We had one very bad case of this when the Dee was being done.  It concerned a man who had one acre of garden.  With the house taken off, he was left with slightly over three roods. He tilled every bit of it and had vegetable and fruit in it.  More than half of that garden was covered with spoil.  The Board of Works were asked to take it away, but as far as I am to take it is still there.  That is one complaint to which there may not be an easy answer, but it is worth investigating.</P>
    <P>My second complaint concerns the breaking down of fences.  It is all right to say that the Board of Works have to break them down because their men must travel along the river bank, but I believe, because of the small amount of money involved, an effort should be made to replace these fences as far as possible on land the machines have passed over.  While farmers may be the best of friends and neighbours, if their fences are broken down and they cannot afford to replace them with the result that there is trespass, a feud can be started which will last long after them.</P>
    <P>My third complaint does not affect many places, but it should be considered. I have recently come across a proposal that two bridges should be taken down and widened at a very heavy cost by the local authority. Those bridges are on a river which is designated by the Board of Works for arterial drainage within the next three or four years.  There should be some co-operation between the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and the Department of Local Government to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen.  It would be a complete waste of money.  If the bridges are rebuilt now, they will have to be almost rebuilt again when the drainage work is done.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I should like to deal with in connection with special employment schemes. <Col N="452" /> Deputy Kitt said how terrible it was that his county council were unable to do lanes, even through lanes, because the money was not being made available from the Special Employment Schemes Office to have them put in order.  There is an Act on the Statute Book which most of us refer to as &ldquo;the McQuillan Act&rdquo;, which allows local authorities to take over such lanes, declare them public roads and maintain them.  Meath County Council have taken advantage of that Act almost to the full, with the result that, as far as I am aware, all through roads and practically all roads and lanes on which there are two or more houses have been declared public roads and are maintained by the county council, even if they are culsde-sac.</P>
    <P>The only snag about it&mdash;and this is something on which the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to assist us&mdash;is that they must be a public amenity.  In their wisdom or otherwise, the legal advisers to Meath County Council have ruled that while it is all right to do repairs to a lane, if there is a spur off that lane on which there is a house, and even though that house was required in the first place to qualify the lane for repairs, the council are not able to do it.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary might make an effort to have that end of the lane &mdash;it may be a matter of only a few yards or 20 or 30 perches&mdash;repaired. In that case I believe the local authority might be persuaded to take it over, and that would solve the problem for good.  I believe it is far better to spend money on lanes like that rather than spend it on main roads where one still fails to see any improvement after the expenditure of £20,000 or £30,000.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one problem which has arisen in connection with Christmas relief schemes every year.  The Parliamentary Secretary is not responsible for it, but he can assist in having it cleared up.  It is very early in the year now.  Christmas relief schemes will be notified in due course to a number of towns.  The money allocated is expended on the employment of people usually referred to as &ldquo;unemployable&rdquo;<Col N="453" /> for a few weeks before Christmas.  At least, that is the idea in theory.  The employment content must be very high. Very often, the local authority, through laziness, carelessness or for some other reason, do not submit their plans to the Parliamentary Secretary's office in time to allow them to be cleared before Christmas.  The result on a number of occasions has been that sanction has not been given until Christmas is over. It is early in the year yet and we are a long way from Christmas but it might be a good idea if the Parliamentary Secretary would ensure that the proposals from these towns were sent in in time so that they could be expended in time.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to coast erosion.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell me if it is correct or incorrect that there are a very small number of engineers attached to his Department who have the job of inspecting all schemes sent in by local authorities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

The Parliamentary Secretary may say there is a shortage of engineers and what can we do?</P>

      <P>There are no engineers available and, therefore, it is not the Parliamentary Secretary's fault if there is a delay of 12 months. If that happens, it is still no avoidable delay.  I would suggest, as I suggested last year, it might still be a better idea if the local authority engineers were held responsible for the inspection and carrying out of work of this sort.  The Minister for Local Government did not agree with that suggestion over a number of years but this year he says he is going to do it.  I suggest the Board of Works will get around to that way of thinking in a year or two.  The sooner they do that the better it will be.  At least there are enough engineers in the local authorities to see the job is properly prepared and properly done.  That is the only way to do it.</P>
      <P>National monuments were referred to by other speakers.  Here again a number of people were employed on national monument work.  They did an excellent job until the work ceased. Those people get used to that type of work and are very good at it. When work ceases on national monuments, no arrangements are made so that they can be picked up at a later date.  If the Board of Works want to pick them up at a later date, they will not be available.  There should be some continuity with regard to this work.  Perhaps I am wrong but I believe this stems from the idea that workmen should be like hedgehogs who can roll up and go into the hedge and stay there until it is time to come out again.  These workmen require a weekly wage and if they cannot get it from the Board of Works, they must go somewhere else.  They are excellent workmen who are doing their job well but they are being lost to the Board of Works because there is not some effort made for continuity of their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Parliamentary Secretary has not mentioned anything about having Trim Castle cleaned up.  I <Col N="455" /> understand it had a stormy history.  It now appears that its latter days will be as stormy as its early days.  I should be glad if an effort could be made to have it cleaned up.  While it has stood up to the years pretty well, it is not getting any younger and, like the rest of us, the years are telling on it.  At the present time some of it is in very urgent need of repair.</P>
    <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell me whether or not any effort will be made to have something done with the moats which are around the country? I do not know what they are called in other countries but we call them moats. They are mounds which are built up and which could be taken over as national monuments.  They are usually recognised as being of great antiquity. Superstition prevents people knocking them down but as things are going at present, I imagine they will be knocked down.</P>

      <P>They are certainly saving the Parliamentary Secretary so far but whether that will continue with the modern generation is a matter for conjecture.  You would not know what you would find under them.</P>
      <P>There is one final point I should like to make.  There was a great blare of trumpets about the Board of Works deciding to declare Tara as a national monument.  It must be a bad thing because it has not appeared in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief.  There has been so much cod about that over the years that it is time we had a definite statement from somebody.  I personally believe there is nothing wrong with the efforts of the man who owns Tara, which is in private ownership, to preserve it.  I do not know whether his reasons are that it is such an ancient monument or that it is good grazing land.  In fact, it has some of the best land in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally believe something definite should be done about Tara.  A plan was drawn up some years ago. All sorts of efforts were made to do something about it.  A museum was to be built there but eventually it turned <Col N="456" /> out the people who were planning to do these things did not own it.  They had no authority to go on with the work. Eventually, when a statement was asked about it from some interested people, the Board of Works said they intended to declare it a national monument. Could the Parliamentary Secretary say if it has been declared a national monument?  Who owns it? If the Board of Works own it, what do they intend to do with it?</P>
    <P>It may be, as Deputy Dillon said, that an aerial survey may throw up something very unusual about Tara. Most people who visit Tara are very disappointed because all they see there is a great mound and some sticks and stones indicating where the banquet hall was.  These are very often knocked down and it is impossible to say what exactly they represent.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to say what is the present position or what the Board of Works propose to do with it, if they have taken it over?  Do they hope there will be something built there to indicate that it is one of the oldest monuments in Europe, that it was the seat of the High Kings of Ireland as well as the Kings of Meath?</P>
    <P>Meath County Council are very anxious to do something with Tara but they are at sixes and sevens with regard to it.  Every effort they have made so far has been frustrated because apparently somebody else steps in with another plan.  We were told wonderful things were to be done with Tara and now the Board of Works say they intend to do something about it. Everybody would be happier if the matter were cleared up once and for all and we knew what was to be done with regard to it.  Will it be left as farm land which can be left there and bought or sold by anybody, provided they have the money to do so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this Estimate because it is the one which interests me most, not merely because of the fact that the constituency I represent is practically waterlogged by the Shannon and the drainage of the Shannon but because, as Deputy Dillon said, of the Government announcement during the recent by-election in Roscommon that the <Col N="457" /> Shannon would be drained under this Estimate.  I feel Deputy Dillon was a bit unfair to us when he said we made political promises out of that.  I look on that as a guarantee and I have no doubt the people in Roscommon in the area of the Shannon will become absolutely convinced that this is a going concern.</P>
      <P>There are a few observations I should like to make about this problem. Deputy Dillon made a very interesting statement about the Shannon and the possibility of its drainage.  I feel he overstated the case. We have got to appreciate one thing about the Shannon and it is that its level is artificially raised because the water is held back.  In olden times it was held back by the landlords for their own selfish interests.  Of later years, it is held back by the ESB probably for a more commendable reason.  However, the main fact is that the water of this great river is artificially held back here and there throughout its course.</P>
      <P>From time to time, thinking out the problem, I try to envisage the Shannon without any lock or stop on it.  I often wonder what happened when the river was in full flood many, many years ago.  We never seem to read of a disastrous flooding of the Shannon in olden times, particularly of its lower reaches.  That more or less convinces me that the Shannon in its natural state was capable of dealing with the amount of water that passed through it even at a time of great flood.</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that what was announced during the by-election was that a survey would start on the Shannon in the spring of 1965.  I have no doubt that had Deputy Dillon and his colleagues made the same statement about the drainage of the Shannon during the by-election as he made here this afternoon I would have arrived a few months earlier in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said that the survey of the Shannon would start.  To my mind, a survey is a seeking for facts and, having found the facts, we can then decide what to do.  If this survey reveals, as Deputy Dillon suggests, that the Shannon must continue to produce <Col N="458" /> flooded fields at various times of the year and that this is the most economic way of dealing with the problem, then I and everybody interested in this problem will accept that as the finding and then, as Deputy Dillon suggested, we will go on from there and start on the branches of the river.</P>
    <P>Everybody must agree that it is important to have this survey made.  An aerial survey would be a help, no doubt.  Probably soil analysis would be of help, too.  It would be very interesting to find if any investigation would reveal that, away back hundreds of years ago, the Shannon used to flood much wider than it floods now and that now as a result of the locks and the various structures erected from time to time, our ancestors succeeded in confining the river more or less to its present course.  These are matters I feel a survey must establish for us and until they are established nothing further can be done.</P>
    <P>We may find, when all the facts are assembled, as Deputy Dillon has suggested, that the more economic and wiser thing to do is not to bother about the main river itself but to deal with the arteries.  If that is the situation, and if we all live long enough to see it, I do not think it can then be said that what I would consider the guarantee which was given away back in 1964 in Roscommon was just political propaganda.</P>
    <P>I had hopes all along that something would be done about this problem. I do not think that the people around me or the people of Roscommon or of the various places around it would set much value on flooded land.  I was surprised to hear a value of £100 per acre put on it. When the local papers come out in a fortnight's time with this news we shall have very interesting discussions on it. I was reared not too far from the Shannon and the tradition I was reared in was that water on the land is always a disadvantage.  Down the years we all hoped to see it taken away.  I hope that in my lifetime I shall see it taken away.</P>
    <P>I should like, each year while I am <Col N="459" /> in this House, and, perhaps when I leave it, that when this Estimate comes before the House the Parliamentary Secretary introducing it and asking the House to accept it will be able to point out that, during the previous year, a certain amount of money was spent on the problem of the Shannon and that, in the ensuing year, an increasing amount of money will be spent on the Shannon.  I hope that, by gradually biting off a bit of the problem here and there, we shall in time see the level of the water reduced.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made, too, that the discharge from the bogs down in Offaly and south of Athlone is tending to block the narrow waterway there and that this discharge is artificially raising the level of the water.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment. I am sure he will maintain the very high standard set by his predecessor. One point I should like to emphasise in this debate is drainage, both major and minor.  If we are to enter the Common Market and have all our beef and mutton of sufficient quality then we shall have to take a very serious view of drainage.  It has been proved beyond all doubt that the wrong kind of food and grass is inclined to make meat tasteless and in many cases sour.  Therefore, I would emphasise that the Parliamentary Secretary should do everything in his power to activate and expedite drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two rivers, in particular, in my constituency which are subject to flooding&mdash;the Ownabue and the Bride.  The Ownabue affects over 2,000 acres.  In some cases, up to one-third of farmers' land is completely useless on account of the flooding of the Ownabue.  Last week, I asked a question on the matter and the Parliamentary Secretary told me it would be done within the next three or four years.  I have since seen the farmers there and they have asked me to emphasise to the Parliamentary Secretary how vital it is that they should get <Col N="460" /> this extra piece of land to cultivate and put into production.</P>
    <P>One thing which really pleases me in my constituency is to see the great number of schools going up and evidence of the planning and foresight that has gone into their erection.  The architects and engineers are definitely to be congratulated on those scores. I also welcome the Coast Protection Act.  Nothing but good can come from this fine Act.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on taking such an active interest in the preservation of our national monuments and parks.  I was at a meeting of An Taisce last week in Cork and the members had nothing but good to say about the efforts of the Government on this particular score.  I should like to wish the Parliamentary Secretary all the luck in the world in his new appointment.</P>

      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank Deputies who have spoken in this debate and to thank them particularly for their many kind remarks about me in my new office.</P>
      <P>Many problems were mentioned by Deputies who contributed to this debate.  I do not know whether or not I shall be able to deal with all of them in my reply but I shall try to deal with as many as I can.  If any Deputy has raised a point in the debate that I fail to mention in my reply I shall certainly write to him personally and keep in touch about the business with which he is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal items mentioned by my opposite number in Fine Gael, Deputy Harte, was the Shannon drainage.  It was also alluded to by Deputy Dillon.  While Deputy Dillon seemed to look askance at the wisdom of the Shannon drainage project, Deputy Harte seemed to take the view from the announcement made by my predecessor with regard to the project itself, that it was purely political strategy.  He seems to suspect that the Government have no real intention of doing anything concrete about <Col N="461" /> the drainage of the Shannon.  I should like, first of all, to refer Deputy Harte and his colleague to the statement made in this regard some time ago by my predecessor.  He intimated that a beginning would be made in the spring of this year.  A beginning has been made.  It is our intention to carry out a 10-year drainage programme of the Shannon.  There are seven engineers and their assistants on the job down in the Shannon area for the past couple of months, and we hope to use every available resource to carry out this 10-year programme.  We also hope that actual construction work will begin in 1969.</P>
    <P>Far from there being any diminution in the speed with which we have tackled this job, I should like to point out that £22,000 under the subhead on the Shannon investigation is practically as much as is being spent on all other schemes of this kind.  When the Estimate was originally prepared a more gradual approach was contemplated requiring the expenditure of only £2,000 but since then there hàs been a decision to accelerate, and if we cannot meet the cost of that acceleration from savings on other subheads we shall introduce a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I was rather intrigued by Deputy Dillon's parallel between the river Shannon and the river Nile.  I am not terribly familiar with the river Nile but I do not think there is ground for any close analogy between the two. I have a fairly general knowledge of the conformation and topography of our own country and I cannot accept the idea that it is a good thing to have thousands of our farmers sloshing about in Wellington boots for many months of the year.  I do not think it is an acceptable thing that there should be in many counties a quarter of a million acres of land damaged, to some degree at any rate, by the effects of flooding from the river Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might be misconstruing what Deputy Dillon said.  Deputy Dillon was referring to land which was above flood level and which could be washed each year and naturally fertilised.</P>

      <P>The projected scheme does not propose to confine the Shannon to a narrow stretch all the way, nor does it envisage the complete and total prevention of all flooding, especially winter flooding.  It is the intention to relieve summer flooding and to make the land available for summer use.  It would make thousands of acres available for summer use which are not available at the present time.</P>
      <P>I want to be careful to obviate any fear on anybody's part that this was a mere political gimmick.  I should also like to point out, before we leave the question of drainage of the river Shannon, that not only is it a matter of the drainage of the Shannon valley but a question of drainage of all the Shannon tributaries.</P>

One cannot relieve the sub-catchment area, or any other catchment area, without tackling the main river Shannon first.  I do not think there is anything more that needs to be said on that topic.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte criticised the process of the adoption of a scheme under the Coast Protection Act, 1963.  I find it necessary to remind the Deputy that this process, while it is rather elaborate, was laid down by statute of this House.  That would have been the occasion for Deputy Harte or any of his colleagues to suggest better methods.  As the situation stands at the present time, it is not possible for the Office of Public Works to operate outside that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy has given notice that he wishes to raise the matter of the steps taken by the Department of Industry and Commerce to discourage the tendency <Col N="463" /> towards monopoly, or near monopoly, in the flourmilling industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This question on the Adjournment arises from some questions I was obliged to pose to the Minister yesterday.  They were concerned with a tendency towards monopoly in the flourmilling industry, with a resultant closure of a number of mills in recent years and the attendant suffering endured by the displaced workers and their families.  That policy is now leading to the closure of another mill, the mill of Going and Smith in Cahir in Tipperary, in my constituency.  This mill is the main source of the social and business life of that town and the cessation of flourmilling there is regarded as a great local disaster.</P>
      <P>In 1960, there were 33 flourmilling industries in this country.  There were 700 commercial bakeries.  Today according to the Minister's statement in reply to my questions yesterday, there are 21 mills in operation.  Twelve have gone to the wall since 1960.  Of the number remaining, nine are independent, and eight are controlled by one concern.  Four further mills are controlled by one other concern.  The mills which have gone out of existence in the past five years alone were located: three in Dublin, two in Galway, one in Bagnalstown, one in Aughrim, one in Thomastown, one in Ballina, one in Midleton, one in Cork and one in Clonakilty.</P>
      <P>It will be seen, therefore, that a monopoly is emerging in the Irish flourmilling industry, that that monopoly has become so powerful that the small mills simply cannot survive, and that it is a battle between a pygmy and a giant.  In my opinion, very shortly the nine remaining independent mills will be forced to close and to accept the cartel which now seems to be in control.  The House is aware of this predicament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the induced closure of the Cahir mill by the front organisation for the two major milling monopolies, namely the Flour Millers Association, is yet another cynical <Col N="464" /> and barefaced tightening up of the already static market.  This market is controlled by the Rank monopoly group, and the Odlum monopoly group, which dominate the whole industry.  I should like to make it clear to the Minister and the House that I am in favour of rationalisation, provided it leads to efficient production at reduced prices to the consumer.  In this instance we see developing the worst effects of duopoly whereby the Rank and Odlum organisations, supported by interlocking company corporations such as Associated Millers Ltd. and the Merchants Warehousing Company Ltd., are inextricably locked together.</P>
    <P>The Government must now be fully aware that their activities, such as the take-over in Cahir, are far from being in the public interest.  To my mind, this is a clear case for reference to the Fair Trade Commission and I am asking the Minister if he is willing to do so.  To suggest that the Cahir closure is in the best interests of the consumer is absolutely false.  It is manifestly untrue because the Minister will recall that his predecessor only a few months ago had to beat the self-same flour millers over the head before they graciously agreed to reduce the price of flour by 3/- per sack.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to indicate also that the quota of the Cahir mill will simply vanish into thin air and that it cannot be bought in the strict sense of the word by another mill.  That seems very plausible on the surface, but the Minister knows the closure is designed to bolster up the monopoly mills' quotas which otherwise might show a fractional reduction if the Cahir mill remained open.</P>
    <P>This is a case of relatively large mills growing relatively larger by squeezing out small capacity mills.  As I said, such development seems rational for many industries but in the case of the flourmilling industry, the impetus towards rationalisation is naked monopoly and self-interest.  It is not in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>In support of my statement that the Cahir mill quota does not go up the spout or vanish into thin air, I want <Col N="465" /> now to quote from the journal <i>Management</i> of October, 1963, a statement made by the President of the Irish Flour Millers Association, Mr. H. G. Glynn, under the heading &ldquo;A Study in Rationalisation&rdquo;.  He said:</P>
    <P>Finally, it was the wish of the millers that the public should not be asked to pay for the rationalisation of the mills by an increase in the price of flour but that it should be financed partly by the past savings of the industry, together with the savings in production costs, which would accrue to the mills obtaining the trade of the closing mills.</P>
    <P>He is quite specific: &ldquo; . . . savings in production costs, which would accrue to the mills obtaining the trade of the closing mills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are further assured that the closing of the mill at Cahir would have no adverse effect on employment there. We know to our sorrow that the overall production at Cahir was 80 per cent flour and 20 per cent offal and that the cessation of flour milling there will lead to a very serious problem of redundancy.  Many of these men are of middle age and, indeed, beyond it. They cannot hope to re-adapt themselves or find alternative employment in that town or the next town.  They are simply being thrown out on the unemployment scrapheap.</P>
    <P>The kind of compensation, the pension scheme on which I questioned the Minister yesterday, is such that they will get a miserable week's wages for each year of service.  They will get approximately a half-year's pay after a lifetime of service, or, alternatively, those over 60 years of age will get a very small pension approximating to the old age pension.  So much for the oft-lauded man-power policy of the Government and the generosity of the Flour Millers Association.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that he call a halt to the closure at Cahir and to the similar closures pending elsewhere by referring the activities of the grain distributing and importing companies, the grain storage companies, in fact the whole industry, to the Fair Trade Commission for an impartial hearing.  I hope <Col N="466" /> the Minister accepts my statement and my estimate that almost 75 per cent of the total national quota of flourmilling in this country goes to the Rank and Odlum organisations.</P>
    <P>It is not in the interests of the consuming public that this sorry state of affairs should continue.  The policy of the Labour Party is well known on this issue but it needs reiteration, having regard to the sorry events we have to contend with.  We would wish that the functions of An Bórd Gráin were extended in the fields of intake and storage so that no cartel or monopoly could control the entire machinery of wheat, both home-grown and imported, of storage facilities, of brokerage, of flourmilling and provender milling. The tentacles of this monopoly have now extended far beyond all these things.  They control most of the bakeries in the country.</P>
    <P>The chances of a small-town bakery surviving in these circumstances are very slim indeed.  It is not good.  We are not merely talking about &ldquo;isms&rdquo; in this matter; we are not merely asking that the State intervene now, directly, in this essential service of the supply of the staff of life to our people.  Bread is the main diet of our people and I do not accept the Minister's statement that this whole problem has arisen because of the fall in consumption of bread. Bread is still the main diet of our people.  I submit that the 60,000 people at present unemployed cannot provide themselves, their wives and families, with anything more than &ldquo;bread and spread&rdquo; and tea three times a day.  The same applies to the aged, the sick and infirm, with the paltry allowances offered to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister would wish us to believe we have an era of prosperity and an opulent society, but we must not forget that we have, too, a large section of our people who are extremely badly off.  In this country, the poor are still with us in large numbers.  To them, bread is necessary and a Government who allow the industry that supplies that bread to perpetrate this because they form a monopoly is guilty of dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>In recent years several Deputies recorded <Col N="467" /> in Dáil Debates, many of whom might be regarded as conservative, have said that the monopoly in the flourmilling industry has taken on such serious dimensions that there is a duty on the State to intervene and take over the industry in the public interest. Such statements have come not merely from the Labour but from other benches.  The former Leader of the Fine Gael Party is on record as advocating the taking over of the flourmilling industry by the Government because of the trend of events at that time.</P>
    <P>Pending decisions of policy, the Minister ought to make up his mind soon to put the industry under the closest possible scrutiny by the Fair Trade Commission, conscious all the time that the record of the millers is by no means a clean one.  The Minister has indicated his helplessness and has stated that he cannot compel a miller to continue in operation if he does not want to do so.  His advice and guidance would be important in these matters.  If he advised these people it was not in the interests of a community such as Cahir that this mill should be closed down, it might have some effect.  The whole economic and cultural life of Cahir depends on this industry.  If the industry goes to the wall, the town becomes a virtual ghost town in a very short time.</P>
    <P>We hear about a man-power policy, re-training, re-absorption of redundant operatives and recommendations from adaptation councils.  The Minister should now indicate the policy of his Government by protecting those people in Cahir.  Until those people can be retrained and reabsorbed in alternative employment, there is a moral social duty on the Minister and the Government to prevail on the Flour Millers Association to desist in their attempts to secure the flour milling quota from Cahir mills.  Indeed the management of Cahir mills should also be asked to desist in the transaction.  I advocate this course not merely in the best interests of the workers and people of Cahir but in the best interests of the industry at large.  This is an unwholesome situation we are contending <Col N="468" /> with.  This interlocking company, this virtual cartel, controls not merely the future of the operatives dependent on the industry for their livelihood but also the supply and the price we have to pay for the very staff of life itself.</P>
    <P>The cessation of milling at Cahir will also have an adverse effect on the farmers in Tipperary and adjoining areas.  They are farmers who have been advised by the Government during the years to grow wheat and who have been supplying this mill with wheat over a long number of years. What is to happen to them?  I do not think the National Farmers Association will welcome this closure because their members have a definite interest in it.  Many of them, for years, have supplied wheat in great abundance to this mill.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister can do will be very welcome but I do not accept his attitude of helplessness and hopelessness in this matter.  He now has sufficient facts to indicate that he is dealing with a dangerous monopoly. An integral part of that monopoly is not of Irish origin, it is alien and it has no roots in this country, no regard for the ramifications or repercussions of its decisions and its only purpose is to exploit the profit motive that prevails here.  That is why we have this sorry spectacle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have all been at some disadvantage in dealing with this because the discussions on the closing <Col N="469" /> of this mill have arisen from rumours and perhaps leakages and premature assumptions.  As far as I know officially and as far as the owner of the mill referred to by Deputy Treacy is concerned there has been no announcement of the closing.  While I do not use this to deny the possibility of its happening I want to use it as an explanation of the fact that up to now we have been dealing with this on the general problem facing millers throughout the country and assuming, rightly, that this is a continuation of what has been going on for some time.  I will have to ask Deputy Treacy to accept that there is a drop, a continuous annual drop, in the consumption of flour.  I was asked how much this was and at the time I did not know but I have now found out that it is three per cent or four per cent per annum. In other words it is a calculable drop from the point of view of the miller. I already told the House that in spite of the closures that have already taken place we still have 50 per cent more milling capacity than our requirements.</P>
      <P>Up to now mills have closed because the capacity was not there but at this stage we are coming to the end of the voluntary rationalisation scheme and closures that take place are done so on the private decision of the owner of a mill who assesses his prospects in the future market, assuming a continuation in the drop in consumption. When I say there is a drop in the consumption of flour and that this has been associated in other countries as well with an increase in general prosperity, this is not to deny that bread is important to certain sections and certain weak sections of the community. In fact it is an argument in favour of producing the highest level of efficiency within the industry to say that the weak sections depend a great deal on bread because the greater the efficiency in the milling industry the greater prospects we have of maintaining a reasonable price for bread and of limiting the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that there is an understandable concern on the part of Deputies in regard to the employment in their own areas and ever since Deputy Davern put down the question <Col N="470" /> and the persistent pursuit of it since, I have tried to let them know that I am deeply concerned when there is a loss of employment.  However, the alternative offered to millers and their workers up to now was to &ldquo;close now and be compensated under a scheme of adaptation or stay open, face the competition in the market and find out how you get on &rdquo;.  As I say, this alternative has caused a number of owners to say: &ldquo; My prospects are such that I will close now and be compensated.&rdquo;  The rationalisation scheme that was in operation had finished and it was at the request of the small millers that it was revived. It is now coming to a close again and men have to take decisions.</P>
    <P>I would say that if the closing of a mill in any place were to depend on a prior decision of mine, I would give very close scrutiny and take a long, hard look at the issue on which I was asked to decide, before coming to a decision.  The possibility of a monopoly developing because of rationalisation exists, I am sure, but the confusion in the situation now is artificial.  A monopoly does not exist.  There are two big groups and there is a third section represented up to now by nine mills and possibly, if this rumour is true, will be represented later on by seven, so you could not regard a situation as being a monopoly where you have two big groups and seven small ones.</P>
    <P>A report is being made by a survey team to the Minister for Agriculture on the trends in the milling industry and a decision on policy will be made by the Government, when that report has been studied.  There is not a monopoly, nor is there a duopoly but an oligopoly.  I would like to say now that from the information which I have received since I spoke last it is clear that any benefit which would accrue from the closing of these mills, subject to the rumours, would, be to the small mills because I understand the big owners have indicated their willingness and desire to make legal undertakings not to share in this benefit.  However, as I say, I have not made any decision which would give rise to a benefit accruing to anybody by the closing of a mill and <Col N="471" /> I would give long and careful consideration before making any such decision.</P>
    <P>I have said several times in the House that I cannot require a mill to continue in operation, any more than I could require Deputy Treacy to be a Deputy, if he did not want to be.  We cannot require people to continue in operation if they make a voluntary decision not to continue.  There was some doubt raised in this House as to the voluntary nature of their opting out and I did go to the trouble of having inquiries made and I have been reassured that no pressure was put on them and no pressure is being put on them to participate in this rationalisation scheme now and to close down.  It is a voluntary decision.  The Deputy asked me to call a halt in Cahir but it is a matter for a man to decide his future prospects and if he does not decide to opt out now he faces the highly competitive situation which is ahead of all industry.  I do not know any way in which you can guarantee that everybody will survive in this keen competition.  If you want to have efficient milling, cheaper prices for flour and food I do not think the answer which the Deputy suggests, keeping the mills open, as a social service, is the correct one.</P>

      <P>It is not a monopoly; <Col N="472" /> at the worst, it could be a duopoly, and I do not see why there should not be more than that.  There are seven or nine mills, depending on the rumours, as well as the two large groups.  I do not think there is anything I can add to what I have said. I am not in a position to require them to stay open but there will be no prior decision made by me without a long and careful look at the position. There will be no decision of mine which would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would want to eat an awful lot of bread.  Unless an awful lot of people consume more bread, the market will not be there.  It is not quite natural to say that this can be solved by an Act of a Minister.  This is a shrinking market.  The Adaptation Council have put forward a scheme of compensation to help those who decide they would be better to go out with compensation for themselves and their workers than to remain for the stormy days when they might not survive.  I do not think the Deputy, if he considers the situation fully, could consider a situation where all industry was guaranteed survival for all time is feasible.</P>
