      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the present position in regard to free trade talks with Britain; if and when Free Trade will operate; and if he will make a general statement on Government policy in relation to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> The trade negotiations with Britain have been taken a stage further in the discussions which have been taking place in Dublin since last Thursday between officials on both sides.  A further meeting at Ministerial level is envisaged during the course of the next few weeks.  Only after this meeting will full information be available on the basis for a Free Trade Area Agreement.  If the outcome of these further negotiations is considered satisfactory by the Government and an Agreement is signed, it is intended that an adequate opportunity will be provided for discussion of it in Dáil Éireann before the Agreement comes into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the statement that the agreement will be signed prior to any discussion on the trade agreement by Dáil Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is an agreement, it will be signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say on whose initiative this idea <Col N="3" /> emerged?  Was it the British Government's or the Irish Government's</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it would be possible at this stage to give a history of the birth of the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will remember that in 1960 when we were discussing the last Trade Agreement, he said he proposed to the British Government that they would aim then at a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the British Government, and the Taoiseach, I think, in the same speech said that well, that was the end of that; we should never think any more about a Free Trade Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it did not prove to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that some time will elapse before the final discussions which are envisaged take place, will the Taoiseach consider granting the Dáil an opportunity to discuss the various aspects of the free trade proposals before such agreement is signed, if agreement is reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will appreciate that it would place those who have responsibility for conducting these negotiations in a very difficult situation if they had to conduct a public debate on the ideas under discussion before the negotiations had reached finality.  In my view, it could weaken our negotiating position very much.  That is why I urge that he should await the outcome of these negotiations before pressing for discussion in the Dáil on my assurance that there will be ample opportunity afforded for discussion on the earliest occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that there may be certain aspects of this matter which, while probably before the Government or have been brought to the Government's attention, nevertheless are at the moment causing some concern amongst traders and the public generally and does the Taoiseach not consider that in those circumstances these aspects might be ventilated and possibly <Col N="4" /> the hand of the Government strengthened in the negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any association, trade group, manufacturers or other economic interests that have a point of view to put forward in this connection have full access to the Government for the purpose of expressing their point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say what discussions there have been with Irish industry in general or Irish industries in particular during these negotiations?  Will the Taoiseach also say whether or not there were any discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy had better give notice of that question, when I will give him full particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach tell me whether or not there was discussed the possibility of our becoming a member of EFTA or of the EEC in the Government's talks with the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The position of the British Government <i>vis-á-vis</i> EFTA did certainly arise and will arise, but as far as we are concerned no decision in that regard has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no discussion as to whether or not we would become a member of EFTA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But there was discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not appreciate that there is a widespread view that discussion in the Dáil would strengthen rather than weaken the hands of those who are doing the negotiating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must take my view on that as being the right one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the <Col N="5" /> Taoiseach takes the entire responsibility for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me an impossible position in which to put members of the Government to have to defend here proposals in relation to a trade agreement not yet made when there is possibly arguing on the other side that these proposals are not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>From the description of it, this particular type of trade agreement goes far beyond anything contemplated before.  At least, the possibilities in it are such that it may go beyond anything contemplated before and to that extent there is widespread concern amongst industrialists and trade unionists and possibly even amongst farmers that discussion would be an advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am as anxious as he is to have that discussion and as soon as it is possible to do so without prejudice to our negotiations, I will arrange it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say&mdash;I think he was asked before&mdash; on what date it was decided that the aim should be a free trade agreement? The second question is, would the Taoiseach say whether or not there was any investigation carried out similar to the investigation carried out by the Committees of Industrial Organisation when we contemplated joining the EEC and whether or not the CIO reports arising out of our application for membership of the EEC can be related to the position in employment that may arise if we become a party to a free trade agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the dates for which the Deputy has asked are concerned, when I visited London after the imposition of the British special import charge and met the British Prime Minister and his colleagues, we agreed then that we should discuss the possibility of a new trade agreement between the two countries.  In the course of subsequent discussions at official level, the possibility of being <Col N="6" /> able to negotiate a free trade agreement emerged and, when I met the British Premier again in July, it was decided that the discussions should proceed with a view to exploring this possibility.  Of course, the CIO reports are completely relevant in this situation and the circumstances envisaged by these reports are precisely those that will arise in the event of an agreement being concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>These reports are not very encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard them as discouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say at this stage if the discussions indicated propose to remove the levy surcharge imposed last year by the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already tried to make it clear that the import levy is an independent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very relevant matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A new trade agreement does not necessarily mean the simultaneous disappearance of the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Were not certain Irish industrialists told there was no intention on the part of the British Government to remove this import levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no information in that regard except that published by the British Government themselves, who announced their intention of removing the levy as soon as possible and who have indicated only recently that it may be feasible to do that next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>At least one industry was told by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce that there was no question of the import levy going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know in what context that was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach tell us what he means by a free trade agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="7" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean an agreement between this country and Great Britain which will be accepted by GATT as conforming to the GATT definition of a Free Trade Area Agreement and, in that way, permit of our membership of GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not necessarily mean absolute free trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The GATT condition requires that substantially all the trade between the two countries should be free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in connection with the present negotiations for a free trade area with Britain, there has been any discussion or mention of a political, as apart from <Col N="8" /> an economic, connection of any kind with either the United Kingdom or the British Commonwealth; and, if so, if he will give details of such discussion.</P>

      <P>As I said in reply to a question addressed to me in this House on the 6th May, I invited a number of persons, who were associated with the events of the time, to serve on an informal committee, under my chairmanship, to assist in the consideration of the form of the ceremonies and celebrations to be arranged for next year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.</P>
      <P>The committee consists, at present, of 21 persons and is assisted by five sub-committees.  A general programme for the commemoration was approved by the committee and published at the end of July.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that it is necessary or desirable to duplicate the work of this committee by another committee comprised of representatives of political Parties, as envisaged in the question, but if the Deputy desires that members of his Party should have an opportunity of meeting the secretary of the Commemoration Committee, to learn details of the arrangements in progress or to put forward ideas regarding the ceremonies, this can be arranged.</P>

      <P>The rent inquiry for the Consumer Price Index is made at mid-November each year and extends to all local authorities.  Data for 1965 are therefore not yet available.  In compiling the average local authority rent (including rates) for inclusion in the Consumer Price Index the procedure adopted is to determine the current average rent for (i) county boroughs (ii) urban districts (iii) towns having Town Commissioners and (iv) county councils and to combine these averages using as weights the number of rented dwellings held by each group in 1953.  The averages obtained in this way were £36.48 for mid-November, 1963 and £39.32 for mid-November, 1964.  The increase between those dates was 7.8 per cent.</P>

      <P>Up to 26th June, 1965, the date of the expiration of the last mandate from the Security Council, the net extra expenditure (extra allowances paid to our troops) was £656,016.  The net extra expenditure from 26th June to the expiration of the current mandate on 26th December, 1965, is estimated at £180,000.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General has undertaken that the expenditure since 26th June will be reimbursed from the voluntary contributions for the United Nations Force in Cyprus.  He has further indicated that he is mindful of the claim of the Government for reimbursement of all extra and extraordinary costs in respect of all previous contingents from the beginning of the Force, and he has assured the Government that he will use his best endeavours towards the reimbursement of all such costs, in accordance with the provisions of the Security Council's resolution of 4th March, 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish contingent at present serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus will be maintained there until the existing mandate of the Force expires on 26th December, 1965.  A request from the Secretary General of the United Nations for the continued maintenance of the Irish contingent with the Force after that date is not ordinarily to be expected unless and until the Security Council extends the <Col N="15" /> mandate of the Force.

      <P>The Deputy will recall that as a result of the recommendations of the Commission on CIE Pensions and Sickness Benefit, I confirmed, in March, 1965, amending pension schemes to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission for interim increases in pensions of such staff who retired after 1st April, 1963.  I am informed by CIE that correspondence between the Board and the trade unions concerned on a definitive scheme, as recommended by the Commission, is proceeding.</P>
      <P>There are at present no proposals before me for the granting of increases to CIE pensioners.  Section 44 of the Transport Act, 1950, governs the preparation and approval of superannuation schemes for employees of CIE and under the provisions of this section the initiative in submitting amendments to existing superannuation schemes rests with the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensioners who retired before 1st <Col N="19" /> April, 1963, were granted increases in May, 1964, by CIE on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis with effect from 1st April, 1964.</P>

      <P>As regards haulage of cattle by road for reward to and from local fairs and marts, in addition to the facilities available from CIE and from licensed hauliers, a farmer may, by virtue of section 27 of the Transport Act, 1958, transport livestock for his neighbours resident within two miles by road, for reward, by tractor and trailer to or from a farm from or to a market, fair or mart within a distance of 20 miles by public road from the carrier's residence on the day on which the market, fair or mart takes place, provided the tractor being used for the carriage is one in respect of which the rate of duty applicable to tractors used only for haulage in connection with agriculture, i.e. £2 10s. 0d. per annum, is chargeable.  In addition, CIE have, in certain cases, plated lorries to carry livestock for reward to and from fairs and marts and are considering extending these arrangements in consultation with the managers of a number of cattle marts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to an extremely bad milled peat harvesting season this year production of milled peat for electricity generation and briquette manufacture was only about 55 per cent of requirements.  After allowing for the minimum quantity of milled peat required for the operation of the milled peat generating stations, the quantity of milled peat likely to be available for briquette manufacture will be sufficient only to permit of production on a greatly reduced scale.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna are doing their best to distribute supplies of briquettes as equitably as possible.</P>
      <P>During the past two years the demand for turf briquettes has been well in excess of production and in order to ensure an equitable distribution of the supplies available for the domestic sector the Board has introduced an allocation system.</P>
      <P>Under this system supplies of briquettes are restricted to merchants who purchased direct from the Board in the year ended June, 1963, when briquettes were freely available.  Normally the Board has been in a position to allocate to these merchants quantities approximating to what they bought in the year ended June, 1963, but this year, owing to the very bad milled peat harvesting season, rationing has had to be resorted to.  Factories and institutions using briquettes are, however, getting their requirements in full.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will take suitable action to ensure that special cases or remote areas or households are not unduly penalised by high charges if they wish to connect up with the national electricity network; and if he will make a general statement on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the subsidy arrangements for rural electrification introduced by the Electricity (Supply) <Col N="22" /> (Amendment) Act, 1962, it is possible for some 96 per cent of rural dwellers to have electricity supply at reasonable charges.</P>
      <P>The remaining four per cent are in locations remote from the supply lines and the cost of extending supply to them is very high.  In their case, despite a subsidy of £75, high charges are necessary because of the very large amount of capital which the ESB would have to lay out in extending supply to them.  Unfortunately, there is no way in which those charges can be reduced, short of an inordinately high subsidy.  The funds which can be allocated for rural electrification are limited and revision of the subsidy arrangements would tend to result in the dissipation of quite a disproportionate amount of available resources in subsidisation of a relatively small number of extremely uneconomic connections.</P>
      <P>Special service charges are a universal feature of electricity tariffs and I feel that the Government have gone as far as is reasonably practicable in reducing their incidence in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong. On the contrary, the fact is that the subsidy was only 50 per cent until 1961, when it was raised to 75 per cent.  There was never any specific decision to bring electricity to every single person in the community.  The figure of 97 per cent compares very well with the corresponding percentages in Europe.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that special charges are being imposed in cases of people who refused to take the supply two years ago but who now, under changed family conditions, wish to avail of a supply?

      <P>All the areas are being re-canvassed on a planned basis to ensure that the maximum number of people who make application can be supplied at the same time, thus reducing to the lowest level the cost of providing the attachment and thus, in turn, making the level of special service charges as low as possible under the circumstances.  That is all that can be done about it.  Otherwise, the cost to the urban consumer for subsidisation would be excessive. Under present circumstances this scheme will continue until 1968 or 1969 and then the matter can be further reviewed.</P>

      <P>As regards the moderation in the rate of expansion of credit, the advice given in May last by the Central Bank to the Associated Banks was to the effect that during the nine months ending 31 December, 1965, the aggregate amount of their lending by way of bills, loans and advances should not expand, in relation to their resources within the State, as rapidly as during the year ended 31 March, 1965.  In August last, the advice was amended so as to apply to the year ended 31 March, 1966.  While it appears to the Central Bank that continued restraint will probably be necessary after 31 March, 1966, it is too early to make any firm statement on this point.</P>
      <P>The volume of bank lending has, in fact, continued to expand this year.  In the period January to August, 1965, the monthly average of bills, loans and advances was £311,110,000 as against £271,711,000 for the corresponding period last year, representing an increase of 14.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why the Agricultural Credit Corporation have sanctioned loans to farmers for the purchase of <Col N="32" /> farms, livestock, fertilisers, agricultural machinery and implements and have not yet advanced the loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to answer questions Nos. 34 to 36 together.</P>
      <P>The State capital budget for the current year, 1965-66, provided for total lending by the Corporation amounting to £4¾ million.  This figure substantially exceeded the provision of £3.3 million in the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i>.  I recently reviewed the requirements of the Corporation in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and, despite the general shortage of capital which has made it necessary to reduce expenditure on the public programme as a whole, I made arrangements to supplement the resources of the Corporation to enable it to achieve the same level of lending as in 1964-65, namely, £5¼ million or more than double the 1963-64 figure and more than treble the figure for 1962-63.</P>
      <P>When capital is short, productive needs must have first claim; this accords with the general principle governing national credit policy.  In order to ensure that this principle is given effect to, it has been necessary to confine the Corporation's lending to projects of a directly productive nature and to exclude loans for land purchase, funding of bank debts and motor cars.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of this policy, funds are not currently being made available to the Corporation from the Exchequer to meet the non-productive purposes mentioned, except where there is a binding commitment between the Corporation and applicant which must be honoured.  There are no restrictions being operated by the Corporation in relation to loans for productive purposes and, where such loans are sanctioned, advances are being made as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no suggestion, therefore, of agricultural development being retarded by the current credit policy of the Corporation.  On the contrary if the Corporation did not restrict its <Col N="33" /> loans to directly productive purposes, it could at a time of general scarcity of capital, be charged with operating a policy prejudicial to agricultural development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister not aware that the Agricultural Credit Corporation have cancelled many loans on technical grounds, where farmers had sought these loans, where these loans had been sanctioned to buy land, and where these farmers had entered into commitments and paid deposits to purchase farms?  Does the Minister not agree that is most unjust?  First of all, does he agree that it is a fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do agree it is a fact, because the borrowers did not comply with the requirements of the loan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister aware that for years past letters offering the loan had a three months' limit, that that three months' limit was never observed and that it was honoured much more in the breach than in the observance? The borrowers were led to believe that this was a mere formality and that if the loan were accepted within a reasonable time it would be forthcoming. Without any warning or any discussion the Agricultural Credit Corporation, because they have not got the money, are now enforcing this three months' limit and are creating chaos and hardship.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to put the Agricultural Credit Corporation in funds to honour these offers of loans where farmers had entered into commitments on the strength of them.</P>

I want to know when the Minister had the consultations with the Agricultural Credit <Col N="34" /> Corporation embracing the wider aspects he has explained to us.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that where a farmer has given the deeds of a farm to a commercial bank and has a relatively small sum from that bank, which he cannot increase, and wishes to put a proposal to the Agricultural Credit Corporation in respect of a productive plan, he cannot obtain accommodation from the Agricultural Credit Corporation because of a Government direction?  The position is a small bank debt debars a farmer from getting accommodation for productive purposes from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>

In reply to Deputy Lyons, it is true that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are now pursuing a policy of lending only for productive purposes and these purposes exclude land purchase and funding of bank debts.  A considerable amount of their lending has been donated to those specific purposes hitherto but having regard to the fact that they are now more in funds than ever they have been and that these funds are required for productive purposes, I cannot instruct the Agricultural Credit Corporation to change their policy in that respect.</P>

      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospectuses of certain National Loans contain an undertaking regarding the acceptance of the relevant securities at face value in payment of <Col N="49" /> Death Duties.  The undertaking (which is in similar terms in each of the prospectuses) given in the prospectus of the 6 per cent Exchequer Loan, 1985-1990 is as follows:</P>
    <P>Stock of this issue will be accepted, at its face value, with due allowance for any unpaid interest accrued thereon, as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of Death Duties payable in respect of any property, provided it has formed part of that property continuously up to the date of death from the date of the original subscription or for a period of not less than three months immediately preceding the date of death.</P>
    <P>Effect is given to the undertakings <Col N="50" /> under the provisions of Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1953 (which is concerned with the 5 per cent National Loan, 1962-72) and Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1954 (which applies to the 4½ per cent National Loan, 1973-78 and subsequent loans).  The sections provide for the making of regulations by the Minister for Finance prescribing the conditions under which the relevant securities may be accepted in payment of Death Duties.</P>
    <P>The National Loans, the prospectuses of which contain an undertaking in the terms referred to, are listed in the following table together with the statutory reference numbers of the appropriate regulations:</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that allowances paid to certain employees such as nurses in lieu of meals are assessable for tax as additional remuneration in the hands of the employee; and that, while remuneration in such cases is reduced by deductions in respect of board and lodging, gross remuneration in these cases is nevertheless assessable; if he is aware of the inequity of this arrangement; and if he will arrange that allowances so paid are not regarded as liable for tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>All sums received from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts.  Thus, the ordinary employee who must spend a considerable portion of his earnings in securing food and accommodation nevertheless pays tax on the whole of those earnings.  Similarly, in cases where deductions are made in respect of meals or accommodation supplied by the employer, the employees are charged to tax in respect of their gross remuneration.  If allowance were to be made for deductions in respect of board and lodging these taxpayers would be in a more advantageous position than their fellow employees and I do not think that such a step could be justified.</P>

Further, is it not a fact that they applied for this tax relief and have been refused by the Government and that they stated at the time that they applied that they would not be able to continue in business if they did not get it, mainly because of fowl pest in the North and because they would not be able to compete with other firms?</P>

      <P>The accounts already presented to Dáil Éireann show that the loss incurred by Erin Foods, Ltd., in the year ended 30th April, 1965, was £611,594.  As indicated in a note to the accounts, this was the loss on marketing.  The total loss for the year incurred by Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. and its subsidiaries on the food processing project was £1,168,285, of which £551,550 was incurred by Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teo., in the manufacture of products for Erin Foods, Ltd., at predetermined contract prices and £5,141 was incurred as a trading loss by Kinsale Canners, Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering these figures, it must <Col N="56" /> be remembered that the food processing project is a pioneering venture.  It involves developing new products and breaking into new markets, mainly abroad.  The exceptional cost of such an enterprise could hardly be met out of profits in the early stages when sales are only building up and when the heavy investment in plant and marketing has not made its full impact on revenue.  The Boards of Erin Foods Ltd. and Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. are, of course, aware of my anxiety that the project should be put on a profit-making basis with the minimum delay.  Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo., as the parent company, has, in fact, engaged one of the leading international firms of consultants to carry out a comprehensive appraisal of the project.  The consultants have been working on this task for four months now and it is hoped that this investigation, which is expected to be completed within the next few months, will be of significant help both to the company and to myself in determining future policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the anxiety caused by the one week's notice of termination of employment given to employees of the Greenmount and Boyne Linen Mills at Harold's Cross, Dublin, and the reasons published as the causes of the close down of the mills, he will have immediate discussions with the management and render assistance to the firm with a view to avoiding a closure; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has already had discussions with the management of the Greenmount and Boyne Linen Company about the proposed closure of their factory at Harold's Cross.  It is clear from the information available to me that the closure arises from circumstances which are particular to this company and I regret that there are no steps which I can take which would result in a reversal of the management's decision.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that there is nothing in the proposals at present under discussion in the trade negotiations which would justify a reduction in our cotton production and I would like to emphasise that our plans for the industry envisage its further expansion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that to a considerable extent the difficulties of the firm are due to the Government's trade policy and the withholding of financial assistance for which the firm have been looking for years, will the Government undertake to compensate employees and others affected by the close down?  Having regard to the fact that 40 years ago Deputy Cosgrave's Government got the mills reopened, will the Government not now take a leaf out of Deputy Cosgrave's book and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the allegation on the Government's trade policy is to be found in a statement issued by the manager of the mills:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> It has proved difficult to obtain sufficient orders to run the factory economically.</P>

In regard to an application for an adaptation grant which has been made an excuse for the failure of this company to remain competitive, the grant was refused because the machinery which the firm introduced was secondhand and it could not be considered that secondhand machinery should qualify for such a grant from taxpayers' money.  The application was considered by An Foras Tionscal, a body independent of my Department.  I should like to say here that I was appalled at the treatment of their workers by this company.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to make provision for the repeal of section 23 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906, and section 10 of the Irish Land Act, 1909 (under which it is provided that no stamp duty shall be payable on any instruments made or issued under the Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1962, or in certain securities given by a county council) and for the payment of fees in relation to the determination by the Minister for Local Government of any doubt, dispute or question as respects the structural condition of a cottage or other dwelling under any Act of the present session to make further and better provision with respect to housing and, in particular, with respect to the provision of loans and grants by the State and by local authorities in relation to housing, for that purpose to consolidate with amendments certain enactments relating to housing, to amend certain other enactments and to make provision with respect to other matters connected with the matters afore-said.</P>

      <P>I wonder has the Minister got any information, or can he give the House any information, as to the progress in relation to the Ballymun housing scheme and the comparative costs that will arise in respect of the production of houses by that method as compared with the more conventional method of building similar sized houses?  It seems to me this is about the only point at which it could be raised.  I think the House will be glad to know what are the comparative costs of conventional-type building and system-building in Ballymun.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the progress at Ballymun, the overall progress, not necessarily the scheduled progress that was originally envisaged, it is going ahead in some degrees faster than was anticipated.  In so far as comparative costs are concerned, we can take it that at the time of the placing of the contract, they are approximately comparable, with possibly the industrialised system having the edge on the other, that is, being lower.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 19, before &ldquo;This&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Save as is otherwise provided&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason this amendment is suggested is that if we take the section as it is, the Act will come into operation on such a date as may be cited therefore by any order of the Minister.  We suggested putting in &ldquo;save as is otherwise provided&rdquo; because there are a number of amendments <Col N="89" /> later on which suggest a date on which the Act should come into force and I think the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem here in that amendments are consequential on amendments and, to some degree, I have not yet got, nor had time to go into these.  We got some of them yesterday evening at a very late hour and, with regard to others, there was not even time to circulate them. I may be misreading what is intended in the amendment now before us.</P>
      <P>In so far as certain parts of this Bill are concerned, there are a number of these of some significance already in operation, even if the law has not yet been passed.  I gather what is being suggested here is that the coming into force of the section dealing with supplementary grants for new houses should commence at the time the Bill becomes an Act.  Certain parts of it are already operative, such as the farmers' grants payable for 1963, and in fact for nearly two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Over two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 1st October, 1963. Just to recall another part of it: there are the new income limits in regard to the supplementary grants for the purpose of facilitating local authorities in providing and determining their scheme of supplementary grants and which, in fact, is operated by some councils with effect as from 1st July last.  In the light of these two instances, the amendment does not readily make sense to me and possibly the Deputy could elucidate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this amendment could not tie the Minister's hand in any way?  Surely his case is strong enough to prove that it did not provide in certain instances and then there is no necessity to put in the date.  There are certain sections under which, if this is not put in, it could in fact be put into operation on a date hence which might seriously affect the whole Bill.  I think the Minister should accept that there is no ulterior motive involved and that the whole lot should go back to 1st November, <Col N="90" /> 1963.  I would suggest that the Minister accept the amendment simply for the purpose of ensuring that in respect of certain parts a specific date will be laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better, in view of my own doubts and those of other Deputies, that we should leave over the consideration of this until we come to the sections said by the Deputy to be relevant sections when we could more readily see what is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the acceptance of the amendment by the Minister will in any way prejudice what he has already done and been given power to do.  On any section where he feels this amendment might prejudice his particular power, that can easily be dealt with in the Bill but it is felt that bringing in this amendment here will enable us to deal with other matters on other sections of the Bill which, if it is not provided, we could not raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I now understand that the main purpose of this is not really to change, to add to, to subtract from or to make any difference to the Bill but merely to provide a vehicle by which, if it is accepted, sections may be discussed that could otherwise not be discussed?  Again, I am sorry, but I cannot see how that arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not have this accepted, there are certain sections in respect of which, if they were discussed, the Minister could get on his feet and say: &ldquo;There is no provision for making this alteration at this stage.  Section I says that `the Act shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefor by any order or orders of the Minister ...' and, therefore, we are completely out of court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the view of the Deputy and the view of the Labour Party in putting down these amendments&mdash;whatever they are&mdash;basically, <Col N="91" /> that they are afraid that, having dealt with the Bill, whether they agree or disagree with all or part of it, it ultimately becomes an Act but in fact may not become law soon enough for their book: is that the idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking it another way, if, in fact, a credit squeeze in regard to any part of the outpayments of public money will have the effect that it is such that it can be found it is not there then does it matter a damn whether or not you have the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a second part to this amendment.  It gives this House an opportunity, when the discussion of the Bill is completed, of having the date for the Bill to come into operation generally.  That also is important. While the Minister has, in the past two or three years, exercised power to introduce matters that are now being dealt with in this Bill, nevertheless a Minister could defer the operation of the Bill as a whole and bring it in only section by section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you are doing yourselves and myself much less than justice.  Why are we here with the Bill on the first day we have come back after the summer recess?  At your conference, you have said you wished to give it priority.  Before your conference, this was the date I proposed to take the Bill.  I was not forced to bring in the Bill here today.  Neither was the Labour Party forced to make the pronouncement from their conference that they wanted it brought in with the greatest haste.  We are both going in the same direction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely unnecessary. Whatever the legal men in <Col N="92" /> this House may think, surely one of the greatest objections of the layman in this House to all enactments is that there are far too many words in them? We are advised that this must go in and that that must go in and yet it is still not right because the courts upset it five years later.  Here, I believe it is a completely unnecessary addition to the Bill in the form of words: it makes no sense in the context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will probably compensate by asking you to delete words further on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave it as it is and do not shift them at all.  It does not follow that by adding words in one place you make sense of it by deleting words elsewhere.  Again, without any commitment on my part as to its acceptability or not to me, but if your fear, in forgoing this particular amendment, is that you may be out of court on other amendments would you consider a simple amendment to the effect that, if the House so agrees, changes should be made in the others to conform with your wishes on the amendment&mdash;an amendment such as: notwithstanding section 1, the section shall commence on whatever the date may be?</P>

Take an ordinary person who writes to the Government Publications Sales Office for a copy of the Housing Bill in order to get some information from it.

The peculiar fact about these Bills is that, despite the <Col N="93" /> volume they take up and the care that is taken, we often find that the legal people do fairly well from them when they are arguing different sections before the courts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 38 and 39, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The passing of a resolution by a housing authority shall be a reserved function.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with a matter on which we all have very definite views.  A number of us have for some time been trying to prove to the Minister&mdash;indeed, to the general public&mdash;<Col N="94" /> that one of the reasons, before finance became a big problem, why housing was so slow was because the decision to build houses was an executive function or was claimed to be an executive function of the county managers and not a reserved function for the housing authority.  We suggest that this is an opportunity of placing the responsibility back on the shoulders of the elected representatives.  That is why we have proposed this amendment&mdash;&ldquo;(5)  The passing of a resolution by a housing authority shall be a reserved function.&rdquo;  There is no reason at all why the Minister should not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a look at this one, a very short one, I must say. I am still not saying whether or not I agree with the intention expressed by the Deputy but it immediately appears that the amendment as circulated here just would not mean anything &mdash; to make the passing of a resolution a reserved function.  That is what seems to be implied.  It may be that there is something omitted in the form of words I have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment is very clear in its terms: it is to give to the elected representatives the power of determining the size and extent of any housing scheme proposals that come before the council. We feel that the elected representatives are better able to deal with the housing questions than the county managers. They are in closer touch with the people and know their housing needs. I understood from earlier pronouncements of the Minister that he was in favour of an amendment of the County Management Act and that in any legislation for which he would be responsible in future he would make it a reserved function so far as local authorities are concerned.  It is to the councillors that members of the public who have housing problems make their case and come to discuss their problems. The members of local authorities, who have the confidence of the electorate, should determine all questions of housing at local authority level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> There is also the consideration that if people are dissatisfied with their local representatives in relation to housing or other problems they have an opportunity of removing them from office at local elections.  Once a local authority is saddled with a manager who does not measure up to the problems of the council, he remains until he is 65 years of age and nothing can be done about him.  It is quite an easy matter to get rid of a member of a local authority but it is not so easy to get rid of managers.</P>
    <P>The time is at hand when increased powers should be given to elected representatives.  Definitely, housing functions should be carried out by the elected representatives.  If the Minister is not satisfied with the wording of the amendment, we are prepared to reword it to meet his requirements so long as he accepts the principle of the amendment that such functions shall be reserved and not executive functions.</P>

      <P>This is a very simple amendment.  What we want is that the elected body should determine all questions relating to the housing needs of the area under their charge and that that should be a reserved function and not a managerial function.  There is no one in a better position to judge on matters in relation to his own district than the local councillor who has close contact with the people. There should be sufficient confidence in elected representatives to allow of <Col N="96" /> their being given that power and authority.  Within the next eight or nine months local elections will take place.  What is the use of going to the expense of elections if all the powers are withdrawn from the elected bodies?  The housing problem represents one of the biggest national problems, particularly in the more populous areas, and it is a problem that should be dealt with by elected representatives.  The purpose of our amendment is quite clear.</P>

      <P>The present system is working very well.  If Deputy Murphy's suggestion were carried out I do not know that it would have the effect of getting more houses built.  It is a very easy matter for council members to pass resolutions at council meetings and cover on paper the whole local authority area with beautiful housing schemes.  That is not where the delay occurs.  I think we do need the present system whereby resolutions are tabled regarding housing schemes that are required and the proposal is investigated, first of all, by the health authority, to discover the number of houses required in any particular place and then by the engineers in order to find where suitable sites can be obtained, and so on.  It is in these stages that delays occur.  The fact of getting a resolution passed by the county council does not mean that more houses are built or that houses are built where they should be built.</P>

      <P>The passing of a resolution by a housing authority shall be a reserved function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is important is the initiation of a scheme or the decision on the building <Col N="97" /> of houses and the number of houses to be built.  What is being sought in the amendment is that the members of the local authority should have the power to make that decision, that it should be a reserved function. It is extremely important that the elected representatives should have that authority and that power of decision.  I know from ten years' experience on a local authority that we could not get built houses that were badly needed although the members of the council without exception at all times tried extremely hard to push the manager, to push the engineers, to push every member of the staff who had anything to do with the building of houses.  We failed because we had not the power to insist that a certain number of houses should be built in an area and that a scheme should be commenced at a certain time.  It would be desirable to have an amendment such as that moved by the Labour Party included in the Bill if that is possible.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of the interpretation of the Act.  We are simply asking that in the interpretation of the Act the passing of a resolution by a housing authority shall be a reserved function.  At present the decision taken by a housing authority is an executive function.  In fact, the county manager is the housing authority.  The Minister knows that. A resolution cannot be passed or, if it is passed, it has no effect.  If this Bill is passed, any section or subsection in it, as in the case of any Act of Parliament, taken on its own does not mean anything.  It must be taken in relation to that part of the Bill in which it is contained.  In this case we are quite sure that the amendment does what we want it to do, that is, restore to the members of a local authority the right to decide the housing needs of the area in which they operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that the suggestion has been made by a member of the Minister's Party that there is no holdup and that it is only a question of what the engineers or the officials are doing; that it is a normal thing.  We all <Col N="98" /> know that that is not correct.  The position is that a county manager would decide whether or not he wants houses built in an area.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made by Deputy Moore that section 4 of the Local Government Act can be invoked. Surely, we should not be in the position that in order to get something done we would have to threaten to sack the manager on every occasion?  We have had to do it in some counties often enough.</P>

      <P>Wait a minute.  I have no doubt it could not alter it.  With regard to the intention, as distinct from the actual wording of the amendment, reserved functions are defined in section 2 of the Bill and, if we want to make a function a reserved function, then we should so state in the relevant section and not by a sort of global attempt at this or any other stage in <Col N="99" /> an endeavour to cover everything in an omnibus way.  I do not think that would get us where we want to go and, even if it did, it might bring in more than was intended.  Furthermore, in my estimation changes from executive to reserved should be dealt with properly, and not necessarily in a Housing Bill, or any other specific measure, but rather in a management or local government Bill.  This is what may be the fundamental drawback.  It is this that may require revision and I may tell the House that a management Bill is the next major operation I hope to tackle so soon as we finish with this housing legislation.  I do not make any promises.  The examination I hope to make has not yet really commenced and no conclusions can, therefore, be drawn by me but it is my firm intention to have an investigation into the matter and to follow that with a revision of the Management Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note the Minister has in mind an amendment of the Management Acts. It would be desirable to make these amendments before the next local elections.  Coming back to the matter under discussion, I cannot see any justification why he should refuse to accept what this amendment asks him to do.  It may be that the amendment would be more appropriate to some other section.  It may be that it should be worded differently to meet the <Col N="100" /> requirements of the Minister's advisers. We are prepared to co-operate with the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>We are not reflecting on managers. We are reflecting on the system.  To give an instance: suppose a local authority decide by resolution to build eight houses for eight tenants the manager has power to say that three houses are sufficient.  He has power to say that none is required.  We believe the elected representatives should have specific powers in this regard.  In the Dublin Corporation area it is Deputy Moore and his colleagues, the aldermen and councillors of the City of Dublin who have the best knowledge of the housing requirements of Dublin. They come from all parts of the city. They know the people intimately.  They have a better knowledge of their requirements than the manager or some executive officer.</P>
      <P>There is another point the Minister should bear in mind.  There has been a good deal of public discussion about this of late.  If a person requires a house he does not go to the manager. It is almost impossible for an ordinary individual to meet the manager. It would be impossible for the Dublin City manager to meet all the people who have housing problems.  The same is true of Cork and elsewhere.  But a person who requires a house can meet his local councillor.  What we want to do is to give effective power to the local councillor to deal with this problem.  All he can do at present is pass a resolution and, under existing legislation, the manager can throw that resolution in the wastepaper basket. We want effective control in the hands of the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is quite clear as to our intentions.  I understood from the Minister's own statement that he is in favour of giving powers to the elected representatives.  If we are not prepared to give powers to the elected representatives, if we have no confidence in their ability to judge the different problems arising under local administration, then we should go the whole way and abolish local authorities altogether.  We should not go to the expense of holding local elections next year unless some powers are given to <Col N="101" /> the elected representatives.  Housing is one of the main problems confronting local authorities and it is the local representatives who should decide.  I have sufficient confidence in the Irish people to believe that the members they elect will scrutinise all applications closely and carefully and that there will be no wanton waste of public funds as a result of giving power to local representatives.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reexamine the position now and not wait until 1966 or 1967.  I appeal to him to give the elected members of local authorities effective control now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, it is the councillors who initiate schemes by way of resolution.  Ultimately the schemes get under way.  At the moment, when a resolution is passed requiring ten houses to be built, who does it for the respective local authority? It is the manager and his staff, the engineers and so on.  They must carry out the wishes of the local authority, provided those wishes are capable of implementation.  Assuming local authorities get what is sought here, and assuming that they have power to make a resolution dictating absolutely that ten houses are to be built, again who will carry out the work?  I will not ask who will do it for them.  Is it not the manager and the staff of the council?  If he does not do it in the one case, is he going to do it in the other, and I am now asking you what are you going to do about it in either case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the Minister.  Suppose a local council passes a resolution to build ten houses in a certain town.  That resolution goes on to the manager and he can do what he likes with it.  Legally, he can say ten houses are not required, that eight will do and that in any case he will leave the matter over until next year. If the members of the council ask questions all he is obliged to do is to give them information as to what is happening.  He can tell them the matter is under consideration, and he is legally entitled to take whatever time he considers necessary to consider the <Col N="102" /> proposal.  The matter could drag on year in and year out.</P>
      <P>However, if eight councillors could say they want ten houses built in this town, the proposal would be handed over to the manager and his staff and in two months' time the council could come back and ask what steps the manager had taken to implement the proposal.  He would have to say what he was doing.  In this way the council would be the boss and the manager, like any other public servant, would have to do the job entrusted to him. At present, the manager is the boss and he can take his time.  If circumstances were changed, he would have to account for his stewardship, because the members' functions would be entirely different.  At present they are merely advisory bodies passing pious resolutions that this and that should be done.  The manager can accept some proposals and reject others.  We want to give effective control to the members so that when they pass a resolution to build houses that proposal must be implemented, subject to Departmental approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an open mind.  That being so, I would like to throw whatever weight I have behind Deputy Murphy.  In our county we have passed resolutions time and again requesting the manager to build houses in certain towns.  The town of Milford comes to mind immediately. Nothing has come of these resolutions. The only reply we can get from the manager is that he is not satisfied yet that so many houses are necessary in this locality.  We get that reply day in and day out.  We have three members of the council present and I think they will agree that all these resolutions <Col N="103" /> were passed unanimously.  Yet nothing is being done.</P>
      <P>Local councillors do not advocate the building of houses in their own towns simply to give employment. They know the need for the houses in the particular locality; otherwise they would not have advocated the building of them.  No person knows better than a local councillor when houses are required.  We find, when a resolution proposing the building of houses in a certain area comes before a council, it is generally the local councillor, irrespective of politics, who sponsors the resolution and makes such a case for it as to convince the entire council as to the necessity for the houses.  The only time we find disagreement is when some other town is looking for preference.</P>
      <P>We find we are frustrated by the action of the manager.  The manager simply says he is not satisfied that a particular number of houses should be built and sets up inquiries.  We have proved to him time and again that when a cottage becomes vacant in that town there are ten or 20 applicants for it.  Surely, if there is that number of applicants for a house, there is a necessity for more houses there?  It is only by experience we find this out.  Any Deputy who is a member of a local authority will agree that the decision to build houses in a particular locality should be a reserved function exercised by the members of the council and it should be the manager's job to get on with the work.  For that reason I support this amendment.</P>

      <P>In Donegal at present several housing schemes have had to be advertised for tender three or four times.  That is one cause of delay.  The acquisition of the site, the legal process of transferring the site from the owner to the council, the inspection of the site and the determination of the number of people eligible for houses in the area&mdash;these are all matters that could hold you up even if you had power to pass such a resolution.  We have schemes with building contractors for a long time and they have not yet started.  Even <Col N="104" /> passing this resolution and inserting this subsection will not get rid of the delays encountered at the various stages of house building.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Cunningham said that the passing of this resolution or the implementation of the idea behind it will not get rid of all the delays.  That may be so, but it will get rid of the most important one, that is, the decision to start to build houses.  I know what the Labour amendment has in mind and I think the Minister knows also.  I am inclined to agree with the Minister that the exact wording of the amendment is not wise.  After all, nobody can pass a resolution but the housing authority. The county manager cannot pass a resolution.</P>
      <P>If the Minister accepts the idea behind the amendment, he can, with the assistance of his officials, bring in an amendment on Report Stage which will put the matter in order.  Even if the local authority is to be given the authority to build houses, their decision will be subject to Ministerial approval.  If it is an unwise decision, or if it is a stupid decision, the Minister can refuse sanction, but at least the decision will rest with an elected representative in so far as the Minister is answerable to the House and to the country.  At the present time we can have the whole thing held up by the county manager saying he is not satisfied that more houses are necessary. As some of the earlier speakers said, we can get rid of an elected representative, we can get rid of the Minister, but we cannot get rid of a county manager until he is 65 years unless he does something very much out of the way.  I would strongly urge on the Minister that he should accept the idea behind this amendment, and that on Report Stage he should bring in amendments here and there throughout the Bill, where necessary, to give effect to it.</P>

I am rather surprised that Deputy O'Donnell does not know that since he was Minister for Local Government for a while. The power is there already in the hands of the council.  If the manager refuses to do what they want him to do, they can proceed under section 4 of the County Management (Amendment) Act and compel the manager to do it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should recognise that in many areas there is this difficulty between the local authorities, the local councillors and the county managers.  To a great extent this amendment is put down because of that difficulty.  In many parts of the country the situation has been that the county managers were not prepared to carry out the wishes of the local councillors. Section 4 of the County Management (Amendment) Act does not, in fact, give satisfactory power to the local councillors because the very method by which section 4 must be operated itself imposes delay, and that is one of the weaknesses.  So far as my local authority are concerned we have had no problem in this matter.  We have never had occasion to use section 4 in order to get the manager to <Col N="106" /> deal with the housing problem.  We have had decisions on housing by the local authority and the manager jointly.  Nevertheless, there is still a weakness because a manager operates on the basis that he may consult with the local councillors and with the corporation, and then take a decision, and that he can make or not make his decision in accordance with the recommendations made to him.  In that event the council would require to fall back on section 4 of the County Management (Amendment) Act.</P>
      <P>We in this Party feel that the method in this Housing Bill is not fast enough, and that the method of dealing with the question of making decisions as to the number of houses or dwellings that are required is not satisfactory. Consequently, this amendment was put down to a section, which is mainly a determining section, to indicate what our desire is.  It may be that from the point of view of the Parliamentary draftsman it is not neat or clear enough.  If the Minister would indicate that he is prepared to accept the amendment in principle we would be prepared to agree to a redrafting of the amendment.  The Minister has indicated that he has in mind the introduction of amendments to the City and County Management Act at a later stage.  That is all very well.  We do not expect the Minister to enter into commitments at this stage as to what he will write into that Act, but we are concerned with local representatives in both urban and rural areas being in a position to determine their housing needs, and being in a position by resolution&mdash;not just of a subcommittee but of the authority&mdash;to determine how many dwellings should be provided when they have ascertained what the need is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We think the way to do that is to write specifically into this Bill that it is a reserved function of the elected representatives. We are quite well aware that, in matters which are reserved functions at the present time, when decisions are taken there may be delays in their execution.  That is another matter.  It is not the matter we are arguing here.  We are seeking to ensure that for the purposes of this <Col N="107" /> Housing Bill the city manager or the county manager shall become an executive officer of the local authority, exercising executive power.  We want to remove from him what might be called the legislative power which we think the authorities should have to deal with the problem of housing in city and county.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at this matter.  He may think the amendment is not tidy enough or the wording is not suitable to attain our object, but I would ask him to accept the principle of the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham seems to be putting the whole thing on the basis that each council would write down a number, place in in a hat and somebody would pick out one of the numbers and that is the number of houses allocated for a particular area.  That is not true at all and it is not what is suggested by the Labour Party.  What we are saying is that there are technical people available to local authorities and they can advise them as to what is feasible, but as to what is needed we are saying the best people to judge are the people who are elected by the people in the area to represent them.  When a local councillor or a group of local councillors for an area or a town suggest that ten or fifteen houses should be built, they have to make a case before the whole council or at least a majority of the council have to vote in favour of the case they are making. If that is passed, then we claim that the onus should be on the city manager to proceed with all possible speed to build the number of houses as embodied in the resolution that was passed.  It all has to go to the Minister for Local Government and, as Deputy O'Donnell said, rightly so.  He can determine whether or not they should be built or whether they will be built. He is answerable to this House and also answerable to his own constituents&mdash;he is an elected representative&mdash;and all that we ask is that the authority should be given to the elected representatives and not to an individual in a county or in a particular area.</P>

      <P>He did not go far enough.  He did not go all the way and it is necessary to go all the way in this regard; otherwise there could be a repetition of the City and County Management Act of 1956, when we were promised a whole lot of things but when we looked for them we found we had not the powers at all. I will go this far with Deputy Murphy. The local authority has the power to pass a resolution and ask the manager to build ten houses in a particular area.  In two months' time Deputy Murphy asks what progress has been made and the manager can say: &ldquo;We are looking into the matter.&rdquo;  In another two months Deputy Murphy asks: &ldquo;What about that housing scheme about which we passed the resolution?&rdquo;  And the answer may be: &ldquo;We are looking into the question of a site.&rdquo;  Then in another six months the manager says: &ldquo;We think eight houses will be sufficient to cover that area.&rdquo;  The councillors said ten and he says eight.  What are they going to do about it?  They must either sack the manager or refer the matter to the Department of Local Government for the Minister to decide whether eight or ten houses should be built.  Looking at this from the point of view of councillors, they like to think that by passing a resolution they are getting something done.  I do not think you are getting anything done.  If you pass a resolution and the manager does not agree with it he need not implement it.</P>

      <P>It entirely depends on where the responsibility is placed.  If the responsibility is taken off the manager's shoulders he does not mind whether you build 100 or 150 houses but as long as he is held responsible for deciding the number of houses to be built he will decide always on the cautious side.  It has been my experience that when a scheme of houses is ready to be allocated we have always had twice as many people as we had houses.  That is a reflection on the county manager's estimate and on the estimate of the officials who are involved.  They will always err on the cautious side.  If the public representatives have this power they have two sets of people to meet: they have to meet the people who need the houses and to answer to them if insufficient houses are provided; and they have to meet the ratepayers who contribute quite a considerable amount towards the provision of these houses; if they build houses in excess of those required and houses are lying idle, the public representatives have to answer to the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is relevant in discussing this amendment to draw attention to the fact that last May the Minister sent out a circular letter to each member of every local authority drawing the attention of each member to the personal responsibility which he had in expediting the building of houses, in wiping out arrears and in ensuring there will be no backlog in future. How does the Minister say that it is proper to place this responsibility on the shoulders of the elected representatives if at the same time he does not give them the authority to say: &ldquo;We want 250 houses in Swords.  We want so many houses in certain other places.&rdquo;  County managers' estimates have been wrong.  I have seen the Department of Local Government cutting our estimate in two and being proved deplorably wrong.  They may have had a different reason for doing it.  They may have had the reason that <Col N="111" /> money was not available but they gave us another reason at the time, that they could not justify this number of houses being built.  The Minister is pleading with councillors to accept this responsibility, to ensure that arrears in housing are wiped out and at the same time he says they should not have the responsibility of deciding the number of houses to be built in any particular area.</P>

      <P>This amendment by the Labour Party has achieved one very good and significant thing.  Apart from the inference that the wording was inadequate and that it would not meet the requirements of the Department, it has drawn from the Minister a very positive statement that he is at one with the Labour Party in seeking an extension of the powers vested in members of the local authorities and a curtailment of the power vested in county managers.  It is heartening to know that he does regard it as one of the major functions of himself and his Department, when this measure has been dealt with, to tackle the problem of the County Management Act and the powers vested in county managers. We differ with the Minister in this regard; we feel that now is the time to determine this vexatious question.  I believe that this Housing Bill will not serve the purpose for which it is intended unless more power is given back to the members of local authorities. The sense of this motion is that we cannot make progress in housing unless this is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some managers are very efficient but others are overbearing, tyrannical and dictatorial.  Many young men would be happy to serve their communities were it not for the fact that it has gone abroad that all power is vested in the county manager.  That is very largely true and when many of us in local authorities stand up and make a positive proposition in regard, say, to housing, we are told curtly that this is an executive function of the county manager and that we as a corporation, a county council or an urban body have no say in the matter.  I think the Minister is at one with us that it is <Col N="112" /> fundamentally wrong in a democracy such as ours that such vast power should be reposed in any one man. There might have been some reason for this some years ago at the inception of the new State when perhaps we did carry over some allegedly corrupt practices from another regime and it was necessary to place men in authority in a community and give them these vast powers and responsibilities, powers and responsibilities which very largely negative the influence of local authorities.  In my opinion, it is a negation of democracy.</P>
    <P>Much has been said here about section 4 of the County Management (Amendment) Act and that it was sufficient to force the county manager to do certain things.  The County Management (Amendment) Act is totally inadequate as most members of housing authorities must know because it only empowers the local authority to direct the manager to do a specific thing.  Under section 4 you cannot direct the manager to conform to a matter in respect of broad principle or outline, you can only direct him to build a house for Michael Pat Murphy, you cannot ask him to build houses for a number of people.  That is not in order under the Act and, therefore, it is totally inadequate for our purposes. I would appeal to the Minister, since he is thinking of curtailing the powers of managers and of amending the Act, to do it now in the context of this measure and make it an effective and fruitful measure.  Now is the time to concede to the Labour Party that however inadequate the amendment may seem to the Minister from a legal point of view, that the sense is clear to the whole House that this Party are wholeheartedly for a curtailment of the power vested in county managers.  We say that it is high time that these vast powers were conferred, where they rightly belong, on members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the necessity of accelerating the housing drive there is a matter which is causing alarm throughout the country and in which county managers are directly involved and indeed for which the Minister is directly responsible and that is the <Col N="113" /> question of the proposed increases in the pre-1950 rents.</P>

If Deputy Moore feels there is no necessity for this section in Dublin city he is perfectly entitled to have that view because he is on Dublin Corporation but if members of local authorities throughout the country feel such a power is needed <Col N="115" /> they are entitled to express their view here.

Those of us who have spoken to the Minister both inside and outside the House believe&mdash;I hope I am not being unfair to him&mdash;that he is not entirely satisfied with the present system whereby either the county or the city manager is entitled to say X houses are required even though every member of the local authority believes he is only giving one-fifth of the number really required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from justification, we have all come up against the obstacle that the county manager blandly states that a certain class or category of persons is not entitled to houses.  He says so and that is the end of it although every member of the local authority believes the class is entitled to housing.  We can work under section 4 anyway we like but by the time the matter is finally dealt with and goes to the Minister some kind of twist is put on it that prevents any harm coming to the official.  Those who stand for election to local authorities and accept responsibility in that respect should be men enough not to hide behind the broad shoulders of any county manager who is able to say: &ldquo;That is an executive function. I shall decide.&rdquo;  So far it has been interesting to hear three Donegal representatives&mdash;I almost included the <Col N="116" /> fourth, yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;expressing different points of view, the Minister, Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Cunningham.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>But the provision of a house for a worker, a house that was <Col N="117" /> occupied by the county manager does. I know that Deputy O'Donnell built too many houses and as soon as a manager went up he had no bother but to walk into it.</P>
      <P>In regard to this amendment I am afraid we are tackling the problem at the wrong end.  Up to a few years ago the Department of Local Government decided the number of houses to be built.  They then transferred that responsibility to the county manager with an overall proviso.  What happened was that when the county manager sanctioned an application to have, say, fourteen houses built in an area, these were built and the manager was then informed that nine of those were entitled to the full subsidy as they were slum clearance or overcrowding cases but that the other five were not and that, therefore, he would not get the subsidy for them.  That power remains in the Department and not with the manager.  The poor manager is shaking in his shoes wondering whether Mary Kate will pass for the full subsidy.</P>
      <P>That is the snag and that will remain.  Whether or not you arrange that the council shall have the last word, it will then go for the sanction of the Department of Local Government; when you have an overcrowded department like the housing section, something will be found to keep it going.  They will certainly find a means of keeping the file going by saying that Mary Kate does not qualify and is only entitled to one-third subsidy.  This or no other amendment will change that position.  What has to be changed is over in that corner.  I am speaking with 42 years' experience as a member of a local authority and I know where the manoeuvres are made.  No amendment shifting responsibility from the manager to the local authority, to the elected representatives, will change the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from an area in which, due to industrial progress, you will always have need for further housing.  As a matter of fact, during the past 12 years, just outside the town of Cobh, the county council have built 168 <Col N="118" /> houses to relieve local distress.  The same thing has been done in Midleton and Youghal. The trouble is that if 500 houses were built tomorrow, they would be occupied the same day.  That is the unfortunate position.  Recently I was responsible for a proposal to build 20 houses in Riverstown.  When we went through the applications, we found that 15 of the 20 successful applicants will be from the list for the last group of houses built by the local authorities.  The position was that you had boys and girls who could not get houses because they were not married.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is described in its Long Title.  The main reason we are moving it is to give statutory effect to a decision of the Agricultural Wages Board adopted on 4th April, 1963, advocating legislation to give agricultural workers a statutory right to public holidays or alternatively Church holidays with pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Board, set up many years ago, have carried out a reasonably useful function but there are a number of anomalies attached to the operations of the Board and for that reason, when the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961, was being introduced, the Minister responsible for it, for some extraordinary reason, decided that instead of trying to straighten out some of the anomalies, <Col N="119" /> he would take the easy way out and leave agricultural workers out of the Bill and introduce later a Bill covering holidays for agricultural workers.  The result is that every worker in the country is entitled to a minimum of 18 days holidays by law but agricultural workers are entitled to only 12.</P>
    <P>Recently the Agricultural Wages Board took a decision which resulted in two extra days being given to agricultural workers&mdash;St. Patrick's Day and Christmas Day.  In a recent board order there was an extraordinary paragraph which stated that if it was the practice of agricultural employers in any area to give agricultural workers Church holidays with pay, that arrangement should continue.  That order leads one to assume it had legal effect in a particular area.  If workers were not in a particular area, they could not get anything more than their annual holidays.  For that reason, the terms of employment of agricultural workers compared very badly with those of other types of workers.  It has been the practice throughout the years that agricultural workers do not work on Church holidays and on feast days. Therefore, they had the days off. According to law, they had those days off without pay.  In other words, they and their families must fast on feast days and I do not see how that can be regarded as a Christian attitude in a Christian country.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, 1961, relates to annual holidays only &mdash; two weeks annual leave&mdash;but not to Church or public holidays.  The Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961, applies to farm workers employed by the State but not to agricultural workers generally.  It is rather strange this should be so but apparently under the Agricultural Wages Act, State employees, even if they are employed in agriculture, are not regarded as agricultural workers.  Legal opinion has been expressed to the Agricultural Wages Board that they have not powers to prescribe public and Church holidays in conditions of employment.  Despite that advice, the board in fact prescribed two Church <Col N="120" /> holidays with pay &mdash; 17th March and 25th December.</P>
    <P>As we all know, agricultural workers in private employment are the only workers in the State who have not a statutory right to public holidays or Church holidays with pay.  It appears as if we consider agricultural workers as second-class citizens.  All workers except those engaged in agriculture are entitled to certain holidays and farm workers are entitled to considerably less, one-third less than other workers.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed, farm workers will qualify for holidays based on an Act passed 29 years ago and catering for other workers.  I do not think it is too much to ask that this be done. A Bill passed in 1946 in relation to paid holidays was debated on 29th March, 1946, and the Minister for Agriculture of that day expressed the view that the Agricultural Wages Board had power to make provision for holidays with pay.  At column 901 of the Official Report for 29th March, 1946, the Minister for Agriculture is reported as having said:</P>
    <P>If the Agricultural Wages Board make any decision with regard to holidays, it will certainly have my co-operation, if that is necessary. There are certain decisions that I do not come into but if it is necessary to give legal effect to any decision come to, I will certainly co-operate as far as I can to bring the matter before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Later in the debate, the Minister emphasises the fact that he was sympathetic to legislation because he said:</P>
    <P>All I can say is that whatever the board may decide will have my cooperation and if any legal action is necessary, I am prepared to bring the matter before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>That was column 904 of the same date. It may seem extraordinary that I should be here asking the Minister for Agriculture to get the agreement of the House 20 years later to what was apparently all right with the Minister for Agriculture in 1946.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the House is aware of the set-up of the Agricultural Wages Board.  The central board consists of 12 members.</P>

      <P>With respect to you, Sir, there are busybodies apparently still about.  This central board consists of 12 members, four employers, four workers, three neutrals and a chairman.  They have unanimously requested providing public holidays for farm workers because the board was advised it had not the legal power to prescribe what was behind the statutory order.  It is interesting to note that the board has been sympathetic to workers who have to work on public or Church holidays.  As a matter of fact, the board considers it unfair that a farm worker who is obliged to work on St. Patrick's Day or Christmas Day should be paid the ordinary flat rate, the very same as the man who did not work on those days at all.  They made a special order making those two days days of special holiday.</P>
      <P>The legal adviser to the board claimed they had no power to do this under the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936.  I would point out if they have offended in this and another matter&mdash; they have reduced the working week to an average of 46 hours by working the two periods winter and summer&mdash; and if they have in fact been doing things which are not quite legal, they have been doing them with the consent of the Dáil because all orders made by the board are laid before this House.  Therefore, we would be a party to any illegal act which has been carried out.  I hope that will excuse the board if they have in fact been doing something which was not quite correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill before the House provide for alternative ways of granting holidays for Church holidays which farm workers have to work.  The Labour Party will accept <Col N="122" /> an amendment of the 1961 Act and 1950 Act, if the Minister so desires, to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 4 proposes an extension of sections 43 and 51 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 so as to give farm workers a legal right.  The Agricultural Wages Board has no power to prescribe a 48 hour week, according to the lawyers.  This section would give farm workers the right to overtime after 48 hours.  As a matter of fact, the overtime rate given to farm workers&mdash;this has nothing to do with the Bill&mdash;is more generous in the Conditions of Employment Act.</P>
    <P>Extended powers for the board are proposed in section 5.  Subsection (1) proposes to give the board the same powers to prescribe conditions of employment to farm workers as are prescribed in the joint labour committee which functions in respect of industrial workers.  The whole idea is to try to get down to a situation where farm workers will be treated as ordinary workers and not as others. The system in this country is that there are two types of people, we and they. Apparently the farm workers have been &ldquo;they&rdquo; so far.  We believe it is about time the situation was changed and that they were treated as ordinary people.  They deserve a lot better from the community than they have so far been getting.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that farm workers work longer hours than any other type of worker, nor is it any secret that the minimum wage laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board for farm workers is the lowest paid to workers in any job.  As a matter of fact, the rate was based on the 50 hours which they work and it is very much lower than that paid by even the most menial type of workers in the State.  This Bill is an effort to do even partial justice to those people.  We do not expect that the Government will oppose the Bill and we hope that it will be dealt with in a responsible way.</P>
    <P>One of the extraordinary things about the Agricultural Wages Board, as it stands, is that while it has power to give overtime rates, the lawyers and <Col N="123" /> legal advisers of the board say they have no power to define what is overtime employment.  This may sound a little extraordinary but this is, I suppose, the shortcoming of an Act which has been in operation for a long time, rather hurriedly thrown together. Because of the time it was drawn up, and because of the type of worker referred to, it has not been amended in any way since then.</P>
    <P>New Members of the House and those who have been here for a long time will remember what happened when farm workers got a legal right to a half-holiday without loss of pay. Subsection (5) proposes to fill the gap by re-enacting what was done on 10th May, 1918 for the purpose of straightening out the anomaly which arose at that time.  Subsection (2) proposes to remove a vexatious anomaly which at times has frozen wage-fixing machinery for two months.  This is what happened to regulations made by the Minister for Agriculture on 21st July, 1957, Statutory Rules and Orders, No. 200, which provide that the chairman may not vote at an arranged meeting of the committee.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is a central committee consisting of four employers, four workers, three neutrals and a chairman. Where there is, at that committee, a total of 12, the chairman has a vote, but there are five area, or regional, committees which consist of four employers, four workers and the same chairman but the chairman has no right to vote.  This has resulted in the extraordinary situation, that if the central board decide to ask for a revision of wages and submit the matter to the regional board for an expression of opinion, if the regional board vote 4:4 or any other even number for or against the proposal, the chairman may not vote.  When the report is made to the central committee, it means it is accepted that no recommendation has been made and, no recommendation having been made, no decision of the central board can be carried out.</P>
    <P>This is one of the really extraordinary things which should have been remedied a long time ago.  The <Col N="124" /> board may not make an offer, therefore, for two months following that abortive meeting.  I can see no reason why, if a proposal is made, either the chairman should be entitled to vote or better still, the central board would note the fact that no recommendation was made and make their final decision without any further reference to the regional board.  It is right to note that the central board do not have to take account of the decision.  Supposing the five boards decided against an increase in wages, the central board can in fact order an increase in wages, but if, say, four boards recommend in favour of an increase and one of the five does not reach a conclusion, then the situation is that no decision on an increase can be taken for two months. It seems so desperately stupid, particularly when we have brought our wage-fixing machinery in all other sections up to such a high standard.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Murphy's question about status pay can be applied to agricultural workers. I think nobody can deny the fact that the status of agricultural workers has been raised very considerably over the past couple of years.  Practically every farm worker must be an expert on machinery; he must know not alone how to operate the machinery but also a lot about running repairs.  This should raise his status considerably and possibly agricultural workers' pay might be a recommendation which the Minister might consider very favourably.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 5 makes it clear that the period of two months shall commence on the day on which the board adopts a resolution to revoke or amend an order; in other words, the date on which the board decides to set the machinery in motion.</P>
    <P>There was one set of circumstances less than two years ago where the board met and decided to recommend an increase.  They then took a considerable amount of time to send out the notices to the regional boards, with the result that a very considerable delay occurred.  Because of the failure of one board to reach a conclusion, the delay which finally occurred before the increase in wages was <Col N="125" /> granted was altogether out of the ordinary and we are anxious to prevent something like that happening again.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of section 5 provides for the making of a draft or a draft amending order.  The reason for this is that we have had a situation where, while the board appear to have this power already, it has been alleged by some of the legal people that they have not got that power.  The result is that if the board publicly notify that they propose to increase wages with effect from a date, very many good employers will in fact increase their workers' wages with effect from the date on which the notice has been published but, in fact, the general run of agricultural workers will not see any increase until a date which is two months later.  We suggest there is no reason at all why the board should not have power, if the circumstances so require, to grant an increase within, say, a week of the date on which the decision is taken.</P>
    <P>Section 6 proposes to enable the Minister to increase the membership of the board.  The Northern Ireland board has six workers and six employers but there are only four workers and four employers on the board here. For some extraordinary reason, the members of the board here are selected by the Minister and no effort is made to try to find out whether or not those appointed to the board are in fact representative of agricultural workers. We feel that the right to nominate should be given to the organisations representing the agricultural workers. For some extraordinary reasons that is not done.  There have been some cases where even the people elected to the board have been out of the country for a considerable period and this has not been rectified.</P>
    <P>There is also on record a situation where somebody who is a big employer of labour in an area and whose rate of wages is affected by the agricultural rate generally in the county is a neutral representative on the board.  We believe the Minister should be very careful when selecting his &ldquo;neutrals&rdquo; to ensure that they are in fact neutrals because this business of neutrals sometimes goes a little too far.  We are all <Col N="126" /> human enough to feel that if we can help ourselves by doing something, we might be tempted to do it.  However, I could not blame that particular individual because on an occasion when this could have been done by him, he did not do so but the temptation is very great.  In fact, a large number of workers over which that particular employer had control were being paid a rate which was based on the agricultural rate in the area.</P>
    <P>That is not the way these things should be done.  We feel that an employer on the board who has with him either a local small farmer or agricultural worker as a workers' representative is not the ideal representation. We believe that tends to leave things open to a little bit of pressure.  A farmer who is the employers' representative and a neighbour who is the workers' representative &mdash; that neighbour having to depend on him for borrowing machinery&mdash;or one of his own employees, over whom he has almost a life and death right, as the workers' representative is not the ideal situation.</P>
    <P>We think it would be a very good idea if a lot more care were taken to ensure that the people who are selected to represent the employers and workers on the board&mdash;and, in particular, in the case of an individual&mdash;should be neutral.</P>
    <P>There is another extraordinary situation with regard to the board, that is, if a meeting is properly convened of the central board and nobody turns up but the chairman, due to weather conditions or anything else, the chairman is a quorum and he can make a decision, which seems quite remarkable. There is also a stipulation of the board that if all the members of the board except one vote in one way and only one member disagrees, the chairman and that one member are a majority.  It would be pretty hard to find the beating of that anywhere in the country.  I know that the Bill has had a battering since 1956&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no exaggeration. The rate being paid in State employment, even the Minister's Department, though there is a differential, is related to that.  The agricultural worker's rate is recognised as being the lowest rate the law will allow the poorest employer in the area to pay the worst worker he employs.  That is the minimum rate and that is the standard rate in this country for farm workers and it is recognised by the State.  I think that should not be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully has gone into the details of the Bill very fully.  It seems to me that the provisions set out are of such a nature that the Minister should have no difficulty in accepting the minimal changes in the existing position.  One might very well talk of the vanishing farm labourer. In the past 15 years the number of people working for wages on farms has been reduced by about half.  This is not something of which the country was not warned.  Over a long period, individuals have interested themselves in the condition of the farm labourer. For those who did pursue the cause of the farm worker over the past 20 or 30 years, the results of their efforts have not been satisfactory, have not produced any revolutionary changes but inevitably and invariably have <Col N="128" /> called down the obloquy and the condemnation of the powers that be, the Government of the day and all other parts of the establishment, upon themselves for taking up the case of the agricultural worker.</P>
      <P>At one time, it was almost tantamount to preaching red roaring Communism if you spoke up for the agricultural labourer.  Indeed, in some places in the remoter fastnesses of rural Ireland, one often took one's safety in one's hand in raising one's voice outside the chapel gate on behalf of the down-trodden agricultural labourer. His condition was such and, indeed, is still such that the wholesale flight of agricultural labourers from rural Ireland was inevitable.</P>
      <P>There has never been by any Government an appreciation of the importance of this man, the farm worker.  It has often struck me, as it must have struck many others, travelling around this city or any town in Ireland and looking at the superstructure of business and people who do not seem to weave and neither do they spin but who live very well&mdash;this vast parasitic superstructure which we seem to have developed in the last number of years&mdash;that, somewhere, somebody was working to keep all this going and away down, underneath it all, the man who was working and who is working to keep it all going&mdash;and all of us going too: none of us can opt out of this&mdash;was the agricultural labourer at the very lowest level. Other grades, the small farmer and the middling size farmer, the working farmer, were there but, down at the very bottom, the real producer is the agricultural labourer.  Just consider for a moment the reaction of any young man of imagination today who looks at the rewards available to him for working for a farmer.  Remember that they used to say during the war&mdash;I think it was in the National Army&mdash;&ldquo;Would you work for a farmer?&rdquo;  It was the last refuge of the damned. Ex-soldiers will remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No young man who is living in a rural area and who, perhaps, because of his background, is fitted only for manual work would voluntarily want <Col N="129" /> to work for the rate of wages he can get on the farm today when all he has to do is to get his fare to England or perhaps get his local TD to get him a job in Dublin, through some of the Cumainn in Dublin, perhaps, or some such fashion.  That is a bad situation because it means the continuous denuding of the countryside of the essential youth to create families and to keep the rural population growing. In my view, this situation is due to continuous, callous, unmindful and selfish neglect on the part of the establishment, but particularly the Government, of the agricultural labourer.</P>
    <P>It can also be said, of course, that the agricultural worker has lagged behind the industrial worker in wages and in conditions of employment because of the peculiarity of his employment which makes it difficult for him to become trade unionised. There is no question but that the workers in Dublin city and in the cities and towns through the country have had their standard of living improved tremendously in the past half century by the actions of the trade union movement and by the effectiveness of the trade union movement. Because of the difficulty of organising the agricultural worker, usually because he is a lone figure working on a farm in very close contact with his employer, perhaps eating at the same table, perhaps living in the same house, he is not trade union potential in the same sense as is the city or town worker.  This fact also has contributed to his low standard of living. It is fortunately true that employers in the mass, wherever you find them, give the workers only what organisation compels them to give&mdash;with exceptions, of course.  There is the odd decent man who will do the right thing no matter what the cost, without any pressure, but, in the main, employers are not built that way.</P>
    <P>The fact that agricultural labourers have not had the benefits of trade union organisations to the same extent as industrial workers has also been responsible in some degree for present conditions.  It should be a matter of Government policy, it should be a matter of priority with any Government, <Col N="130" /> to take whatever steps can be taken to get as many of those men in the rural areas as may be persuaded to stay there and the form of persuasion that is the most eloquent form of all is to pay them sufficient to enable them to live there, to marry, to have decent houses to live in, and to bring up their families, to give them decent conditions of employment comparable with what they can find elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes very mild steps in that direction.  It is not a Bill of a kind that could in conscience be rejected by any Government.  It proposes that agricultural labourers should be paid for Church holidays and bank holidays.  It is a modest proposal.  In a number of county council areas, council workers are able to enjoy both bank holidays and Church holidays.  This Bill sets out to secure for farm labourers either one or the other.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Bill seeks to create a definition of overtime for farm working, the time at which overtime begins and at which payment should begin for overtime.  It is proposed to define overtime as hours worked after 48 in the week.  That, surely, is a reasonable proposition and is not asking too much of the employing agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I note from the newspapers that farmers are organising in strength and it would seem to be possible to get vast numbers of farmers to come together in certain towns.  Last week it was stated that there were 10,000 west of the Shannon.  In the area which I represent and certainly around the counties of Leinster, the farmers are not doing too badly.  I recall a time when one would see at the chapel gate the odd ass and trap or pony and trap or, perhaps, a Ford car.  You will not see them now.  You will not see Ford Prefects or many Morris Minors.  At some chapel gates, there are so many Mercedes cars to be seen that one would almost imagine that all the Cabinet were attending Mass there.  I am excluding the Ford car used by the Minister for Finance, Mr. Jack Lynch.</P>
    <P>Farmers are doing fairly well now, <Col N="131" /> certainly in the areas to which I have referred.  Undoubtedly, in the west there is that chronic situation of poverty, or near poverty, which has existed there since Cromwell drove the people across the Shannon, a situation which Father McDyer and others are making valiant attempts to remedy.  On good land farmers seem to be able to do well.  In this Bill what is asked of them as employers is very little.  The Minister should accept without question what is contained in the Bill as a very small gesture towards the vanishing farm labourer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I have to move that this Bill be rejected.  The Bill contains a number of provisions which, unfortunately, I cannot accept.  I propose to take these provisions seriatim and to let the House have my views on them.  Before doing so, however, perhaps I should say a word about this vexed question of the level of wages paid to the agricultural labourer.  I readily agree that this level of wages, to say the least of it, affords very great room for improvement. Of course, the really relevant factor in this matter all the time is the capacity of the farmer to pay. This is a factor from which we can never get away and is one to which we must always have regard in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ideal situation, of course, would be that the farmers could be put in a position in which their level of income was such that they could afford to pay the agricultural labourer and give him conditions which would be on a level with those enjoyed by his counterpart in industry and other sectors of employment.  Undoubtedly we should set ourselves the objective of bringing farm incomes up to the urban level and in doing that, bring about the position in which the farm labourer could progress with his employer and could be brought up to a level which would equate with that of his counterpart in urban circumstances.  These, I am afraid, are ideals.  They are something which we are aiming at and striving to achieve.  I do not suppose <Col N="132" /> there will be any real disagreement in this House about them as ideals, but, as in most forms of human activity, the ideal is somewhat removed from what is practical.  I feel that I should say that whereas we hope that this situation will come about, I am afraid we have not got it at present and we have to be realistic in this matter of the level of agricultural wages and deal with the situation as we find it. In that context, I suppose there would be reasonable agreement, at any rate, that the board has not done a bad job down the years.</P>
    <P>In the Long Title, the Bill purports to give effect to a resolution which was adopted by the Agricultural Wages Board at a meeting in April, 1963.  I should, however, point out to the House that the board's resolution dealt with a question of public holidays and Church holidays and did not refer to any of the other matters which are contained in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We made that clear.  We are not claiming that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision to give effect to the board's resolution is, as Deputy Tully pointed out, contained in section 3 of the Bill and that section proposes that agricultural workers should be entitled to six public holidays each year or to Church holidays in lieu thereof.  My information is that at present many employers allow their workers some Church holidays and/or some public holidays and that the practice varies almost infinitely in various parts of the country.  Having regard to the close personal relationship of an informal kind which traditionally links the agricultural employer with his worker and the undoubtedly peculiar circumstances of farming as a profession, great care is necessary if we endeavour to set out in legislation precise obligations and entitlements for both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment to give effect to a proposal of this kind was put forward in 1961 during the passage of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act and was, in fact, at that time rejected by the Dáil.  However, I do not want to be taken as saying the last word on this matter at this stage.  I have <Col N="133" /> been having it examined and I propose to continue that examination.  I assure the sponsors of this Bill that, if I can be satisfied that new legislation is merited, and possible, then I shall recommend to the Government that such legislation be introduced.  That is on the specific proposal now in section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is designed to provide pay at overtime rates for work in excess of a 48-hour week for agricultural workers.  This is similar to the provision in relation to industrial workers.  The Agricultural Wages Board in May of this year made an order which increased the minimum rates of wages as related to a 44-hour week in the months of November to February and to a week of 50 hours in the remainder of the year.  Agricultural workers, therefore, are paid overtime for hours worked in excess of those I mention and have, in effect, an average annual working week of 48 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed the point.  The legal beavers say the board are not legally fixing agricultural workers' overtime rates.  We are asking that this should be cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that is, in effect, what happens because the board fixes a minimum rate of wages related to a certain minimum working week and the rate of wages is, therefore, fixed for a working week of an average annual of 48 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 5, the sponsors of the Bill propose a number of changes in existing legislation.  The first of these is that the Agricultural Wages Board should fix the conditions of employment of agricultural workers.  I do not think such a provision would be capable of implementation.  There is a general reference in the Bill to conditions of employment, but I do not think that would suffice.  Remember, in the case of the industrial worker, it takes the whole of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, to set out conditions.  It is also significant that there are other workers whose conditions are specified in legislation and <Col N="134" /> who are not left to the discretion of a State Department or a State board. In other words, the conditions are specifically set out in legislation.  I am not at all satisfied in relation to the agricultural worker that it would be practicable, or even desirable, having regard to the widely varying pattern of farming and farming practices&mdash; practices which differ, indeed, from farm to farm&mdash;to try to prescribe detailed, uniform conditions of employment. There would be very difficult problems of enforcement.  It seems to me that the wisest thing to do is to leave these matters as they are, matters to be arranged between the farmer and his workman.  There is a traditional relationship of give and take between them.</P>

      <P>I have promised to have a look at the holiday provisions. There is another aspect.  If you were to lay down some sort of general conditions, there is no doubt they would not fit every area and every type of farm.  It would be humanly impossible to devise something that would fit every type of farm and every area and you would, therefore, be prescribing conditions for certain farms and farmers which would be unsuitable elsewhere and possibly inadequate.  That would leave the farmer less inclined to take on an agricultural labourer.</P>

      <P>He would probably try to do without him.  It is a question of striking a balance and keeping that balance.  We have to be fair to both sides.  The farmer has problems and difficulties.  The agricultural labourer has rights.  By tying these, we might easily upset the whole situation.  I am not sure that the necessity is as real as the authors of this measure make out it is.  I am opposed to it because it seems to me to be practically beyond human capacity to devise conditions suitable and applicable to all the different types of farming we have.</P>

      <Col N="136" /> In subsection (2) of section 5, it is suggested that an equal vote at a meeting of an agricultural wages area committee shall be deemed to be a recommendation in favour of the board's proposal.  It would be illogical, I think, to provide that, if the employers' members or the workers' members put forward any particular proposal at a meeting of an area committee, upon which there is equality of voting, such a proposal should be deemed to be carried and thereby constitute itself a recommendation to the board in favour of the proposal.  The present position is that, if there is equality of voting, no recommendation is made by the committee to the board but the board gets the result of the vote.  That seems to me a reasonably logical way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>In subsection (3) of section 5, it is proposed that the period of two months given to a local wages committee within which to make recommendations to the board in relation to a proposal by the board to revise minimum rates of wages should commence as and from the date of the meeting of the board at which the decision to make the order was taken. Deputy Tully spoke about this.  At present the period of two months begins on the date on which the notice is given to the area committee of the board. The issue of the notice is a matter for <Col N="137" /> the board itself.  There is nothing in the existing legislation to prevent the notice being issued on the day the board take their decision, if they so wish.</P>

On this point I am told there is not any significant delay in the issue of these notices.  Would Deputy Tully agree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime, I will maintain my position.  Subsection (5) of section 5 of the Bill is designed to compel the board to define overtime employment.  I have already said on the other section that agricultural workers do receive overtime payment for work which is done in excess of 50 hours for part of the year and in excess of 44 hours for the remainder of the year.  I do not see in what other way overtime should be defined.</P>
      <P>In section 6 there is provision for enabling the membership of the board to be increased.  There are already 12 members of the board&mdash;four employers, four workers, three neutrals and a chairman.  That would seem to me to be reasonably adequate for a board of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt the idea of putting in &ldquo;at least&rdquo; was to increase the membership.  There again, I would have thought 12 was sufficient.  There is no real need to increase the size of the board.  These are my objections to <Col N="139" /> the Bill as it is drafted at present.

      <P>I never heard a Minister for Agriculture make a greater confession of failure in relation to his agricultural policies.  I was amazed by the Minister's opening remarks.  I thought that at least he would have tried to cover up his failure and not openly say at the beginning that the whole cause of his objection was that he had failed to put agriculture in a reasonably prosperous condition.  The fact, of course, is that the Government's agricultural policy has been a <Col N="140" /> complete failure and that the farmers at present are in an extremely parlous position, partly because of the failure of that policy, partly because of the manner in which the bottom has fallen out of the cattle trade and partly because of the weather.  I know the Minister has no responsibility for that but he made no real effort to counter the disastrous farm weather conditions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We must at least touch on the various aspects of the Minister's self-confessed failure, Sir. The fact, of course, is that the choice here in relation to agricultural workers is not as simple as the Minister would try to make the House believe.  If the farmers have not got the capacity to pay&mdash;on that I agree with the Minister &mdash;it is the Government's job to ensure <Col N="141" /> they have that capacity.  Unless they are given the capacity to make an improvement in agricultural conditions, there will not be any agricultural labourers at all left to work on the land.</P>
      <P>The fact is that at present&mdash;and in this the Minister was right&mdash;there is the gravest difficulty in obtaining skilled agricultural labourers.  The fact also is&mdash;notwithstanding what was said by Deputy Dunne&mdash;that nine-tenths of the farmers do give conditions akin to those suggested in this Bill.  In fact, I think, if I may say so, that the approach by Deputy Dunne to this matter was rather different from the approach by Deputy Tully, and did not assist the Bill as much as Deputy Tully's approach did.</P>
      <P>I know of no case of an agricultural worker in County Kildare who is not paid for a Church holiday on which he does not work.  Of course, he does not work.  No agricultural worker works on a Church holiday in my county.  I admit frankly that I do not know what the practice or procedure is in other counties.  I have yet to hear of a case in Kildare where a worker has his wages docked because there is a Church holiday in the week and he does not work on that Church holiday. So far as that is concerned, to put it in this Bill would be merely writing in something that is already, in fact, the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is one exception in the Deputy's constituency, in the racing stables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The case of the racing stables is rather akin to Sunday work which is not the ordinary type of work which must be done during the week.  There is also an exception in relation to dairy work&mdash;cows have to be milked, and the Minister has failed in that he has not yet produced a five-day cow.  I am not counting that type of agricultural work which is obviously quite different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point in this Bill is to ensure that agricultural workers get as fair a crack of the whip in relation to holidays as the industrial workers. The fact of the matter is that if they <Col N="142" /> are not given it, there will not be any of them left.  If the farmers are not &mdash;and I believe they are not&mdash;in a position to pay, it is up to the Minister and the Government to provide a system by which they would be able so to do.  There are a variety of ways in which that could be done.</P>
    <P>For example, it could be done by an extension of rates relief for farmers. It could be done by way of direct subsidy.  It could be done by way of an increase in prices.  There are a great number and variety of ways, but the fact remains that the Minister has himself admitted he has not got sufficient confidence in his own agricultural policy, or in his own ability to ensure that the Government will make up the difference in one of these ways.  That is why he is opposing this Bill.</P>
    <P>At present the farmers, to put it mildly, are in an extremely difficult position.  The credit squeeze in England, as well as the credit squeeze here, has had an immense effect on their market.  The reduction in cattle prices is probably largely due to the credit squeeze in England as well as the credit squeeze here.  Yet we see no sign of the Minister making any effort to right these things.  All he does in relation to a Bill like this is to say that the farmer has not got the capacity, and, therefore, he is opposing the Bill.  That is the wrong approach for a competent and constructive Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke in this House on two Bills moved by the Labour Party designed primarily to improve the status and conditions of the agricultural worker.  The first Bill was introduced some 12 months ago and its intent and purpose was to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, and to give the agricultural worker the right, which every other worker in the country has, to go to the Labour Court and have his conditions of employment, his wages, and all things appertaining thereto, decided by that State tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that occasion I seconded that <Col N="143" /> Bill which merely sought to give the agricultural worker the same right as that enjoyed by every other worker in the country, the right, when in difficulty in respect of his wages or conditions, to bring his case to the Labour Court.  That was repudiated by the then Minister, Deputy Smith, and we had the spectacle of the Government Party and the Fine Gael Party marching shoulder to shoulder into the Lobby to oppose the Bill which we proposed to secure that advancement for this category of workers.</P>
    <P>Tonight we have another Bill before the House which seeks to concede to the agricultural worker the right to public holidays which all other workers enjoy as laid down by statute, and to concede to them appropriate rights of overtime pay for night work, Saturday work, or Sunday work, as the case may be.  We also seek some change in the autocratic Agricultural Wages Board which by their very composition, and by the mind and attitude of the personnel of the board, are as incapable now, as they were in the past, of doling out anything like justice to the workers directly under their control.</P>
    <P>When one considers that this Bill merely seeks to give to these workers the rights that have been enjoyed by other workers for a long number of years in respect of payment for public holidays, overtime rates, and the engendering of some element of democracy in the Agricultural Wages Board, one would expect that this Bill, which I might call a compromise measure, would have the support of the Minister for Agriculture.  I was shocked and disappointed by the attitude of this new, and as we thought, progressive-minded Minister, when he decided tonight to carry on with the same outlook, the same policy, and the same philosophy as Deputy Smith.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party and in the trade union movement were aware of the bias engendered by him against the trade union movement which came to a head in the crisis of his resignation when he told the country at large, and the workers in particular, what he thought of the Irish trade union movement. He is on record as saying that <Col N="144" /> they were something intrinsically evil and should be put down.  We had hoped that when that kind of mentality had passed from the office of Minister for Agriculture, we could look for a squarer, a better, and a more honest deal, but the Minister has done himself a great disservice, and he has done the agricultural community at large a very great injustice, by the attitude he adopted here tonight in opposing the simple measure which the Labour Party put forward as the minimum required to confer some dignity and some status on the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>He has taken up an attitude here tonight as the defender of the agricultural community in particular.  He has forgotten that an integral part of that community are the workers, the main producers without whom agriculture would come to nothing.  He says he is concerned about the capacity of the farmers to pay.  The farmers, like any other section of our community, realise full well that any commodity they require for the purpose of accelerating production on the land has to be paid for.  They like to buy what is best, whether it be fertilisers or farm machinery.  They must realise, and I am sure many good farmers do realise, that the most important commodity, labour, must be well paid for, particularly if they are to get the kind of intelligence, outlook, technical know-how and experience which are required for agricultural science today.</P>
    <P>The Minister has purported to represent the big rancher of this country tonight, the man who is so highly mechanised that he does not need to labour on the land.  He has spoken of the man with the bullock, the stick and the dog, and he would surely mechanise the dog as well.  In these times of economic crisis and with the impending threat of free trade and the kind of redundancy and unemployment which we envisage, we have a right to look to agriculture, which it is thought will be getting a better deal in the present negotiations, to absorb some of our redundant and unemployed personnel. We cannot hope to attract people to the land unless we are prepared to give them decent conditions, <Col N="145" /> at least conditions comparable with those of their industrial brothers and sisters.</P>
    <P>This, if I may use a vulgarism, is a rotten deal which the Minister is proposing for agricultural workers.  He still regards them as second-class citizens. Clearly, they are the most abused and the most downtrodden section of our working classes, the most under paid and underprivileged workers in the western hemisphere.  It is inconceivable that there should be a denial here tonight, in 1965, of payment to them for public holidays, of the demand for overtime rates and some better deal instead of this board which we regard as autocratic and dictatorial, a board, as Deputy Tully pointed out, comprising four employers' representatives, four workers' representatives and four so-called neutrals who invariably vote with the employers' section when any vexatious matter has to be determined.  Imagine a board in which, if the employers' and workers' representatives and the neutral members do not turn up, if no one turns up at the meeting except the chairman, then the chairman constitutes the meeting; he constitutes a quorum and he may determine business there and then.  This Government stands over that sham and hypocrisy as far as the agricultural workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>This fraud should not be tolerated. How can one expect workers to remain on the land in these conditions? Remember, the agricultural worker is no fool.  You are not dealing with some kind of ignoramus or moron who does not realise the age in which we live or the kind of conditions which obtain in Britain and in the countries of the Common Market and the standard of living which agricultural workers can and should enjoy.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that the agricultural worker, his wife and family, are kept to a subsistence level of existence?  Is it any wonder that they are flying from the land and that since 1958, almost 50,000 persons have fled from the land of Ireland to the urban areas and beyond to Britain?  I cannot understand the mentality of the Minister in <Col N="146" /> opposing these minimal demands of the Labour Party, especially when people outside the realm of politics altogether are vitally concerned about the position of the agricultural worker in particular. The Minister may be biassed because this motion was sponsored by the Labour Party, by an officer of a national union, as Deputy James Tully is, who has a bounden duty to do all in his power to upgrade the status of these workers.</P>
    <P>Other people have spoken, too. Conscientious men on the land are concerned, and many farmers do pay something over and above the minimum rate.  The Church is also concerned in this matter and Dr. Birch is on record as making a strong appeal for a better deal for the agricultural worker.  We echo his sentiments when he said that having regard to all the lavish subsidies which this Government conferred on agriculture down the years, it was high time that some kind of subsidy be conferred on the human beings on the land, on the labourers on the land in order to assist them to remain there and to live in at least frugal comfort.  If the Minister is opposed to a decent wage and reasonable conditions, will he please consider conferring a subsidy on these human beings such as is done in respect of the heifer and the calf, in order to keep the workers there and to stimulate some worthwhile increase in agricultural production?</P>
    <P>While this archaic, outmoded and niggardly-minded attitude of the Department of Agriculture continues, there can be no worthwhile increase in production.  There can be no improvement in the land of Ireland unless regard is had first of all to human beings.  At a time when there have been status increases amounting to thousands of pounds per year to higher civil servants attached to the various Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, it is particularly galling that we should have the Minister saying he rejects these simple proposals of ours here tonight to improve the lot of the most neglected section of our community, agricultural workers.  We must pose the question: where is the sense of justice or fair <Col N="147" /> play when this kind of thing can come about?</P>
    <P>As I said in my earlier remarks, it has been my experience to be associated with the two Labour Bills to improve the lot of this category of workers.  We were not altogether surprised at the opposition we met on the last occasion when we sought for the agricultural workers the right to go to the Labour Court, and to abolish this Agricultural Wages Board which is nothing but a farce, a dictatorial, autocratic board which can never confer justice on the agricultural worker, as the Minister knows.  We have sought in this measure to make that board more democratic and our endeavours have been rejected.  No attempt has been made by the Minister to compromise or to accept in any way the things which he must know are right for these people.  He has offered from this House to the agricultural workers a colossal insult and that kind of attitude certainly is not conducive to the climate which we all want to create, to accelerate the wheels of industry and to stimulate agriculture in these trying times.  While we have misgivings on possible free trade with Britain, on full entry into the European Economic Community, it would be a good thing if at least we were forced into an amalgamation with a number of countries which could impose on the Government what the Labour Party has failed to do to-night, to give at least these minimal conditions to the most productive workers in the country, the agricultural workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been withdrawn yet.  This, to my mind, is a very important amendment and its importance has been stressed for two hours.  The net question at issue is whether it will be the elected representatives of the people or the county manager who will determine questions arising from this Bill.  It is the very strong feeling in these benches that the elected representatives should have that right.  So far as we are concerned, we are forcing this issue because, as previous speakers have pointed out, we feel that the elected representatives are the best judges of housing situations in the different administrative areas.  In addition, it cannot be over-emphasised that if a person has a <Col N="149" /> housing problem, it is not to the county manager that he goes.  It would be physically impossible for the county manager to deal with representations from the people within his functional area and it is to the local authority that the person with the housing problem goes and if anything goes wrong with housing, it is not the manager who is blamed but the members of the housing authority.  How can these members live up to their obligations when their powers are so limited?  What we want to do is to give them wider powers, give them effective control of all housing matters arising from this measure.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to another matter. This Bill is a bulky document containing numerous sections, and is it reasonable that the Minister should come along with fixed views, and irrespective of what debate may arise on section 2, section 3 or section 4, bull-doze it through the Dáil?  If that is so, discussions on Committee Stages of Bills have little effect.  The primary purpose of the type of discussion which we are having here on Committee Stage is to have some flexibility so that if points of view are expressed by any member, they will at least get reasonable consideration.  That can only happen if the Minister is not inflexible and is open to accept changes.  I feel that the Departmental officials behind the Minister say that this is going to stand and that the other thing is going to stand and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must repeat that the assertion of the Minister and the Government on this amendment is that they have no confidence in local representatives.  If we were to bring that to its logical conclusion, we should say that there should be no confidence in the representatives of this House because we are elected on the same basis as local representatives. When we come to the House, elected by the people, we elect the Taoiseach who in turn selects the Government. In their own way, local authority representatives have just as much right to legislate on local matters as the Government have to legislate on national matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to drive home that in the big question of housing which is of paramount importance and which requires a great deal of public expenditure, we feel that the people democratically elected are the best judges of housing needs arising in their administrative districts.  If members do not respond to their duties or do not give them the diligent attention such functions as housing require, the <Col N="151" /> public have the right to remove them from office as elections are reasonably frequent but it is almost impossible to remove a manager from office.  He has not the same tie with the people as public representatives have because they can hold office only so long and they have the confidence of the people. Naturally, they must keep in touch with the people's needs and their actions at local authority level must be in accordance with the expressed views of the people in their areas.</P>
    <P>What obligations have county managers?  I am not reflecting on them as individuals or as a body, but on the system.  Once appointed, as one speaker suggested, a manager is a sort of faceless person whom the vast majority in the area never know.  He works within his office, legislating on very important matters, and he is given power by this House to ignore, if he so wishes, recommendations of elected members.  We know that we have a body which in its own way has as much power as the Government, that is, the County and City Managers Association.  That body, which is not elected in any democratic way, are not entitled to have that power.  It is about time to start to break the grip that body has on local government affairs which in a way are as important as national administration, dealing as they do with housing, health and such matters.</P>
    <P>We also tabled this amendment because we felt from earlier statements by the present Minister that he had a democratic outlook regarding local government administration.  I think I once heard him say he felt that more power should be given to local authority members and I am also bearing in mind what the Minister said about the managerial system, that it was a system that led to back-scratching by the managers of the Minister and by the Minister of the managers.  That is the Minister's own term.  I think that was the gravest reflection that I heard made on the system since I came into this House.</P>
    <P>I think we have made the case very firmly.  We set out to do so with the hope of convincing all sides of the <Col N="152" /> House that to leave the power in the hands of the local representatives would be best for the people who are so vitally interested in housing.  If such amendments as this are not accepted, if it is felt that local authority members are not fitted to have such powers and are incapable of exercising them and if it is felt the authority we seek is too much for them, the best thing to do is abolish local authorities altogether.  Why hold local elections next year or why bother with the present system if it is the opinion of any Government or of the present Government that the local managerial system is the most effective system of local government?</P>

      <P>Under section 3, notice may be served on a person whose address cannot be ascertained by a reasonable inquiry, by delivering it to some person over 16 years of age resident on or employed on the land to which the notice relates, or by affixing it on or near such land.  Where notice is served by affixing, the local authority is required, within two weeks, to publish the effect of the notice in a newspaper circulating in the area in which the person is last known to have resided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections dealing with the service of notices are sections 4, information as to ownership; 62, notices to quit; 64, <Col N="154" /> particulars as to occupancy; 65, overcrowding notices; 66 (1), (4) and (14), unfit houses; 69, notice of intention to enter on land; 70, recovery of expenses; 77, confirmation of compulsory purchase order; 78, notice to treat; 79, notice of entry; 80, vesting order; 103, notice of recovery of house where tenant cannot be found or is in breach of conditions; 112, entry on land; and Article 4 of the Third Schedule, notice of intention to submit compulsory purchase order.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question here in relation to subsection (6).  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Minister is satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for <Col N="155" /> dispensing with the publication, serving or giving under this Act or under any Order or regulation made thereunder, of a notice, copy of an order, or demand and that dispensing with the publication, serving, giving, or making of the notice, copy or demand will not cause injury or wrong, he may dispense with the publication ...</P>
    <P>Could the Minister give us an example of the circumstances he has in mind or envisages where it might be desirable and reasonable for the Minister to dispense with such notice?  Does he believe it to be correct that a Minister should have the power to dispense with a notice to the effect that a certain development will take place in a particular area and that that development should proceed without the residents in the area knowing it is to proceed?  It might be in the Minister's mind and perhaps from a national point of view it might be considered by the Minister to be a desirable development but as far as the local people are concerned it might be most undesirable. Here the Minister could step in and say: &ldquo;We shall get this thing through quietly and it will be all over and done with before the people have a chance to rise up and object or organise public opinion against it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) states that a dispensation under subsection (6) may be given either before or after the time when the notice or copy would, but for the dispensation, be required to be published and before or after the doing of any act to which the notice or copy would, but for the dispensation, be a condition precedent.  That subsection is to my mind even worse.  Here is a case where perhaps a friend of the Minister gets into trouble and he proceeds in a hurry with development without complying with the law.  Pressure might be brought to bear on the Minister to save such a character or such a firm and the Minister has power to step in. I can foresee an immense amount of pressure being brought to bear on Ministers.  Why is this power being sought and why is it considered that it may be necessary in certain circumstances? Could we get some indication <Col N="156" /> of what the circumstances might be?</P>

      <P>The Deputy at first asked me to instance the sort of circumstances and I would immediately suggest the case of a husband and wife where only the husband or only the wife might be given notice.  Another case which is obvious is where the owner was aware of the proceedings, where the owner turned up at the proceedings and it could be taken as obvious that he knew about the proceedings. As far as I understand it, the provision has been in existence since 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 11, line 1, to delete &ldquo;fourteen days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one month&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down the amendment in order to extend the time from two weeks to a month.  I foresee quite a number of circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to expect that this provision could be complied with in 14 days.  Section 4 states that a housing authority may by notice in writing require the occupier of any land or any person receiving, whether for himself or for another, rent out of any land, to state in writing to the authority within a specified period, and so forth.  It is quite easy to foresee a case in which a man might be away for a week or 14 days.  If he were away for a week he could have very pressing business for another week.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that <Col N="157" /> there should be at least a month within which any person should comply with the regulation.  I feel sure the Minister will concede this, that he will not quarrel with us for asking for a month instead of a fortnight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Clinton.  In practice, a period of 14 days has meant ten working days since the advent of the five-day week.  In all legislation we should extend the number of days in which a person is required to perform certain statutory duties.  This, particularly, is a case in which we should realise the paractical difficulties now existing for persons in complying with demands of this nature within ten days.  If a person gets a query on a Monday or a Tuesday morning, it may take him to the end of that week to ascertain the information required.  By the time he gets the information from the local authority, certainly more than 14 days will have elapsed.  I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment and agree to one month.  If the Minister feels he cannot go so far, let him split the difference and make it 21 days.  We have, at the moment, a statutory right of 14 days holidays for all people in the State and I believe in the not too distant future, we will have longer holidays of 21 days.  A period of a month, in those circumstances, is not excessive.</P>

      <P>The type of information likely to be sought is quite obvious. He might possibly be querying the rent he is paying the landlord under the terms of the tenancy agreement and matters of that kind.  That type of information should be readily available to the tenant and there should not <Col N="158" /> be any great difficulty in getting it within 14 days.  Of course, if he were away on holidays for that time, it is quite understandable it could not be done but there is a reasonable time given for securing the type of information sought.</P>

His title deeds might be lodged in the bank or some such place and he would have to wait until they were available to his solicitor.  I consider 14 days, in those circumstances, is far too short.  The period should be at least one month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I would add to what has already been said on this is that the information sought is very likely to be information that is actually readily available and the person would not have to have recourse to legal advice with regard to it.  It also should be pointed out that the subsection says &ldquo;not less than 14 days&rdquo;.  If extraordinary circumstances did arise in which it could be held that it was unreasonable to insist that this information should be provided within the time specified, then the local authorities would not pursue it and, if they did pursue it into the courts, they would get very little change there if it was shown that it was an unreasonable time and that the information was not being withheld deliberately.  No court or counsel would want to harass a person to give information in an unreasonably short time in that particular instance.  Probably, from that point of view, the Deputy is not taking into account that it says &ldquo;not less than 14 days&rdquo;.  It is counsel who would have to go after that individual and who would have to pursue it.  If they knew that it was not unreasonable to withhold the information, they would not go into court with regard to it.</P>

      <P>It means if this goes through that some officious official could follow up somebody and insist on this 14 days.  He could insist on getting the information in that time and even bring the person to court <Col N="159" /> and involve him in all this unnecessary litigation simply because he did not do something in 14 days when, in fact, he might have been on holidays. Surely it is most unusual to specify 14 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this section which worries me.  A solicitor is under obligation not to disclose any business or affairs of his client without his client's permission. This is a duty imposed upon a solicitor, not for the convenience of the solicitor but to protect the fundamental rights of the individual.  This section, as it stands here would put the solicitor, who did not have his client's permission, in the dock, to release the information. I would ask the Minister to have regard to the serious obligation which lies on a lawyer not to disclose the affairs of his client without his client's permission.  For instance, a solicitor could be in receipt of rents out of a holding.  This is quite a frequent practice and not infrequently the tenants are not aware of who the real owner of the property is.  The solicitor, <Col N="160" /> the auctioneer or the estate agent may act as agent of an undisclosed person. The solicitor, in those circumstances, would not be free to disclose who his client was or to give the name or address of the client without the client's permission.</P>
      <P>The solicitor, under subsection (2) of this section, could be convicted of an offence and fined up to £25 for accepting his serious obligation of not disclosing his client's affairs without the client's permission.  It is difficult in some cases, if one can refer to the principle of the amendment, to get the client's permission within 14 days.  It is necessary to qualify this so that the person will not have imposed upon him the obligation of committing an invidious offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with regulations and I am a little perplexed about a particular regulation. I am availing of this opportunity to solicit some information.  I shall give the facts.  Two workers had a mind to provide houses with a view to getting married and setting up their own homes.  I advised both to apply for grants and I told them it might be better for them to erect their own homes as they would be waiting for some time for local authority houses. Both of them would qualify for local authority houses but the county council try to get as many people as possible to provide their own homes rather than wait for the local authority to provide houses for them.  The increased benefits made available from 1st October 1963 would entitle them to £900, £450 from the Department of State and £450 from the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They agreed to go ahead with their application for housing grants to the Minister.  They both built the same type of house and both were approved <Col N="161" /> at £450 each, the maximum grant available.  They proceeded with the work and after some time had elapsed one of them got a letter from the Department saying: &ldquo;You are now qualifying for only £300; we are taking £150 from you&rdquo; which, of course, automatically disqualified him from the £150 local authority grant as well, which meant a reduction of £300 in that grant.  That man would not have proceeded with the building of the house at all, were it not for the assurance in writing he got from the Department that he qualified for a grant of £450.  The other man, with circumstances completely similar, was paid £450 by the State and £450 by the local authority without any question. They were similar cases in every respect.</P>
    <P>I made frequent representations to the Department and was told that, under the regulation, the grant could not be paid.  There was a mistake made in the first place and this man had to do with the reduced grant.  I submit that if a mistake was made in one case, it should have been made in both.  The Minister will appreciate that the enforcement of this regulation in this particular case is, to my mind, a very harsh decision.  Were it not for the written assurance this man received from the Department that, under the regulations made by the Minister in anticipation of the passage of this measure through the House, he would qualify for a grant of £450, he would not have proceeded with the building of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be more appropriate that this should be mentioned on section 16 but this is a type of regulation I cannot understand. What type of regulation allows a Department to write to a man and say: &ldquo;You will get a grant of £450,&rdquo; and some time afterwards write to him, when he has undertaken the work, and say: &ldquo;You are not now entitled to more than £300 of a grant,&rdquo; while, at <Col N="162" /> the same time, saying to another man: &ldquo;We can give you the full grant&rdquo;? I think there is something wrong with this regulation.</P>
      <P>Regulations are very important and I would like the Minister to look up the regulation under which this man has been deprived of £300, a working man who has only recently got married and to whom that is a formidable sum of money.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has done so, he should be a little more specific. I am not aware of letters of assurance; the only notification that goes from the Department is the allocation of the grant, according to the general conditions of the plans.  Furthermore, no regulations have been made in respect of these matters which the Deputy has mentioned, for the very good reason that we are now only dealing with the Bill which will ultimately create the law under which regulations can be made.</P>
      <P>A letter of assurance&mdash;whatever sort of letter that is&mdash;sounds very strange to me because the only real authoritative document that issues from our Department is in regard to the allocation of the grant, provided you have submitted your plans and agreed to have the work done according to the specifications and complete it to proper standard. I do not know what the details of this particular case are but the Deputy says he has discussed them with the Department.</P>

One <Col N="163" /> has been paid by the State and by Cork County Council and the other man's case is under discussion at Departmental level.</P>

      <P>Section 5, subsection (2)  says: &ldquo;Every regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made&rdquo;.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to have regulations circulated, because it is all right to lay these regulations on the Table of the House but it is very easy for a busy public representative to miss a very important regulation and a regulation could be in existence for quite a time before a Deputy would become aware of it. Important housing regulations were made in the present year and there was no reference whatever to them in the House.  I know they appear on the Order Paper in a vague sort of way, in a way which might not attract the attention of Deputies generally and I would say many Deputies could miss important regulations. I rise merely to appeal to the Minister to consider in future circulating these important regulations made by him from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do something about that.  I am rather inclined to agree that the bundle of documents laid before the House very often means that they are there for a day or two, and half the Deputies may have got them but the other half may not.  It is purely administrative and I would suggest that we might seek ways and means of putting them in pigeon-holes for the Deputies in the House.  I will look into that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's undertaking to look into this matter because it has become increasingly difficult to keep abreast of the various regulations.  On today's Order Paper, we have no fewer than 97 papers placed on the Table of the House and I am sure if we were all honest, most of us would admit we will not read that list.  It varies from Noxious Weeds (Male Wild Hop Plant) Order, 1965, to Musk Rats Act, 1933 (Application <Col N="164" /> to Mink) Order, 1965, and 95 other Orders and Regulations.  While we are preserving here a form of democracy we are doing nothing to give that democracy life, energy or real significance. Therefore, I think we will probably need to go very much further than even the helpfulness which the Minister has promised us here because if, when we get these regulations in our pigeon-holes or in our post, in many cases they will be phrased in such language that even a skilled lawyer will be unable to determine what they mean.  We would probably need explanatory memoranda to go with them.  We are becoming snowed under with a colossal volume of paper and documentation which most of us have not the time to read.</P>
      <P>While we have sections similar to section 5 in many Bills before this House, they are becoming, one day after another, of less value in helping democracy to work in this country of ours.  We shall certainly, in the very near future, have to set up some form of special Committee in this House, so as to ensure constant watchfulness on the part of Deputies, to examine each and every regulation as it is made and put on the Table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of those sections that one would need a day off to consider and understand.  In the first subsection, we are told we are repealing, to the extent specified in the third column of that Schedule, all the <Col N="165" /> Acts that are there set out.  However, if we go further down the page we shall find that what we thought we were doing we have not, in fact, done because where any of these Acts contains a provision relating to rateable valuation&mdash;either to the reduction of it or the non-increase of it&mdash;we will not repeal those particular sections.</P>
      <P>I have not had the time or, as was mentioned, the secretarial assistance available to me to determine whether or not the sections dealing with non-increase or reduction of rateable valuation are specifically set out as being not repealed in the First Schedule.  As far as I can see, it does not say so. What I want to know is this and perhaps the Minister might tell me: have we, in this Schedule, set out any Acts and said that the whole Act is repealed and then, by subsection (3), contradicted ourselves by saying we are not repealing the sections in relation to rateable valuation?</P>

      <P>I understand that, as the Deputy says, it would appear to contradict itself.  It is deliberate and not really a true contradiction.  It is a contradiction but we are leaving in the part we wish to leave in while repealing the Act generally.  In regard to rates remissions, if there were rates remissions for seven or ten years under the Acts we are repealing, though we are repealing the enactment under which such remission was legalised and provided for in the first instance, we are, by subsection (3), saying that notwithstanding having done this the benefit of that will continue in the period so promised in the original Act.

      <P>I speak respectfully when I say I thought it was bad draftsmanship. It is confusing draftsmanship. It is legitimate that a person wanting to see what Acts are repealed by that Act will go to the Schedule to <Col N="166" /> the Act which specifies the nature and extent of the repeal.  As far as I can see, there is no indication in the First Schedule itself that it is qualified by what is contained in section 6 with the exception of a marginal note in italics which says <i>Section 6</i> but it does not tell you that you must read the First Schedule in conjunction with subsection (3) of section 6.</P>
      <P>We ought to make these Acts easily understandable.  While we legislators may know something about this section&mdash;I say &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;certainly the layman or the lawyer who is not a member of this House and who has not the same duty and time to read every section of an Act will be confused. I should certainly like some specific note to be written into the margin to the First Schedule or, better still, that it specifically be written into the First Schedule that it should be read in conjunction with subsection (3) of section 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>To get the full impact or import of any enactment, it is usually necessary to read all of the Act which is something we do not want to do but unfortunately we generally have to do.  While it may be true that a reference, without elucidation, in the margin, is confusing, and so on, it is a practice that is there and not at all new in any way in many of our other Acts.  I do not know whether we can do anything to improve that or whether, in trying to improve it, we might, indeed, make it more confused. This is always a danger in trying to elucidate too much, as it were.  What seems to be a little confused at the moment can become quite confusing if you try to oversimplify.</P>
      <P>This section and the Schedule have to be read in conjunction with each other to get the total sense of the enactment in that regard.  I do not think you can get away from this.  Whether a cross-reference can be inserted that you should go back to this or that this should be read with the other, I do not know, but it might confuse still further.</P>

It is unreasonable to think that you can read this one and have the real sense because the one really creates and brings about the existence of the other.  Therefore, if you get down to one of them you must seek back to the other or if you read the section you must go to the Schedule to find out what is being repealed.

Why can we not say so? I understand, though it will add to the confusion, that it will be a true statement of the Acts repealed by the First Schedule and, in the First Schedule, we head the whole Memorandum with the word &ldquo;Repeals&rdquo; indicating that that is the extent of the repeals and we should not qualify it somewhere else.</P>

      <P>On that particular point, I, too, find myself confused. An Act listed in the First Schedule may be repealed but a subsection or clause of that Act may not be repealed for the purposes of this section of the Bill.  Is it not possible in such cases to incorporate in the Bill the provisions thus retained? Has the research carried out by the Department not been sufficient to make that possible? A lot of work has gone into this Bill in order to tie up dozens of old Acts. If it is a case that 97 per cent of the <Col N="168" /> provisions of any Act are repealed and three per cent, although not specified, are for the purposes of this section deemed to be still effective, would it not be possible to have those provisions incorporated in the Bill?  I am confused as to what is meant by this.</P>

      <P>The essence of the case here is that if the Bill is passed, the Acts specified in the First Schedule will continue to be repealed.  They will be gone if we pass the Bill but the effect which the repealed Acts had on certain tenants, for instance, remission of valuations, will stand.  We do not re-enact it.  We do not take out the sections of the repealed Acts and reenact them in this Bill.  We merely retain that which we wish to retain. We retain it by understanding rather than by writing it in.  While repealing the enactment under which it was created, we retain the good, if you like to put it that way.  There was remission of valuation under a certain Act.  We now repeal the Act but at the same time we retain the benefit of the remission for those who were entitled to obtain it under the Act that is now being repealed.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that an Act will be repealed but that this subsection will give power to retain parts of that Act that are beneficial but it also gives power to retain parts of that Act which are not beneficial. Does it specify that quite clearly?  I am not a trained man in these matters.  I am just wondering whether this subsection is put in because of the fact that the research has not been completed into the Acts that are being repealed and that because the home work has not been done thoroughly this subsection is put in for the purpose of correcting subsequently any mistakes that may have been made.  It is a very untidy way of doing matters.  A number of Acts are specified in the First Schedule.  There are ten Acts specified in respect of which the whole Act is being repealed. This section reads as if sections of each of those ten Acts may, in fact, not be repealed.  I do not know whether my interpretation of the subsection is correct or not.</P>

He is making legislation so difficult for the ordinary man to understand that he is forcing the ordinary man to go to a lawyer to get an interpretation of the law.

      <P>This seems to be a oneway traffic, like many other sections in legislation that we are inclined to pass.  The local authority may set off money which it owes to somebody who owes them money but that does not operate <i>vice versa</i>.  Cases have arisen where local authorities and others, such as tax collecters, have insisted on people paying money although the local authority or the tax collector, in fact, owed that person money that was due on another account.  We are here supposed to legislate not only for local authorities, for the State and for the public sectors of our society, but also for the protection of individuals. I believe that, if one side is entitled under statute to set off, then the other side should equally be entitled to do likewise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 13, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; occurs in many parts of this Bill.  I took the earliest opportunity to put down this amendment in order to remove what I believe is one of the most serious impediments, if not the greatest impediment, to housing progress. This amendment follows very <Col N="173" /> properly, I think, the amendment upon which we spent some hours earlier this evening in an effort to get real power for the members of local authorities and to take it away from the county manager.  What I am seeking to do here is to remove all the interference by the Department of Local Government that has taken place over the years.  I fail to see the necessity at all times for everything to be submitted to the Department.  There is no knowing how much this impedes progress in housing.  If we do not give the power we were seeking earlier to the local public representatives then the county manager has it.  Assume we do not succeed in this amendment when it is resubmitted, and I hope it will succeed, the power will be with the county manager.  Why not trust the county manager then? If he is not capable of doing his job, then he should never have been appointed.  If he has been appointed in error, then he should be retired and replaced.  We have no reason to believe, however, that we cannot trust the county manager and that we can trust the officials advising the Minister in the Department of Local Government.  At the moment there is a great scarcity of professional people for local authority purposes and for housing purposes generally. Here we have two sets of officials and two sets of professional people all doing the same job, one checking on the other.  In my view more harm than good is being done.</P>
    <P>If the Government have not got money for housing, then they should honestly say so.  This amendment is designed to take the dishonesty out of housing.  If we have only a limited amount of money, then we should state what we have.  Recently housing authorities were required to make a survey of housing needs in each area. The Minister acted wisely in requiring that survey to be made.  It is the intention, I understand, that similar surveys will be made in future at suitable intervals. These surveys give the local authority a measure of the problem in each particular area.  Local public representatives know the problem better than any officials in the Department could know it.  The only question that <Col N="174" /> arises is what will be the Minister's contribution?  If the need is indicated, and the Minister knows he has a certain amount of money and knows the requirements in the different areas, then, in the same way as he does with advances from the Road Fund, he can give each county a certain sum and tell the local authorities to go ahead and provide houses and not come back to him until they have done so.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister, with his past experience as a local representative and with his experience now as Minister for Local Government, stands for this wasteful, outmoded and frustrating system.  It is all wrong for the Department of Local Government to be used as a brake on expenditure.  That can only be the intention behind the retention of this divided responsibility for the same job.  This would not stand up in any other sphere of public activity, two sets of people doing the same job, one criticising the other, and all similarly qualified.  It serves no purpose except to impede the provision of houses.  I appeal to the Minister to get rid of this anomaly.  I appeal to him at the earliest opportunity I have in this Bill to simplify the procedure in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to a circular sent out by the Minister last May in which he called on every public representative to accept responsibility for wiping out arrears and for insisting that this backlog in housing shall never occur again.  In that circular he states he is reducing the submissions that will have to be made in future to the Department of Local Government.  It is quite fantastic then to find how much of the circular relates to the submissions that must still be made to the Department before a housing scheme can go through.  I have seen this going on not for months but for years.  It is still going on.  I have seen it in specific cases going on for ten or 12 years. That is why I am making such a strong appeal to the Minister to take this chance and give the responsibility to the public representatives to get the job done.  I believe it will be done to the extent to which the Minister is prepared to subsidise the operation and to the extent to which the ratepayers <Col N="175" /> are prepared to accept their part of the burden.  I think the job will be done and that those who are comfortably housed will accept responsibility for bearing the taxation needed to provide a minimum standard of housing for the rest of our people.</P>
    <P>This is one of the greatest impediments I have experienced as a local representative.  I have spent ten years trying to get houses built.  I would ask the Minister and the House to support this amendment and give us an opportunty to get on with the job.</P>

      <P>Deputy Clinton was becoming a bit involved.  The section gives the Minister power to allow local authorities to help, financially and otherwise, certain approved bodies in the provision of houses and also in respect of some other matters. In respect of the latter, we have to be somewhat careful, because there could be a fairly wide interpretation of that phrase.  I do not think in our present circumstances it is unreasonable for local authorities to go back to the Minister for his permission to give assistance to outside bodies in order to provide some amenity within their area.  Earlier this evening we were asking to have authority taken from the county manager.</P>

You can get advice from the manager and his staff, but what the amendment earlier tonight was seeking was to take from these people the power to make the binding decision and to allow the council to make the decision having received their advice.  If the Minister is sincere in the circular he issued <Col N="176" /> earlier this year&mdash;I doubt if it was done for any except political purposes, in order to put up a front&mdash;he has his opportunity to prove it now.</P>

I am giving him an opportunity of proving how serious he was when he tried to suggest that the responsibility for the backlog in housing lay with the local authorities and when he said we would not have that situation in future because he would allow each local authority to make the decision and set the pace. Deputy Clinton's amendment asks the Minister to let local authorities set the pace, without having the brake applied by the Custom House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether new or old, the purpose of this amendment, as we understand it, is to allow housing authorities provide loans, contributions to the funds of or guarantees to bodies which are providing housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Every local authority, being familiar with the needs and demands of its particular area, being acutely aware of its particular local responsibilities, is, I believe, the authority to make the decision in matters of this kind.  If the Minister insists on retaining the veto in relation to these matters&mdash;because that is what it is, no matter whether you call it &ldquo;consent&rdquo; or not&mdash;he is wasting his time, the public's time and their money in trying to pretend he is throwing the responsibility on local <Col N="177" /> authorities.  He is not doing any such thing.  He is keeping the power of decision making to himself.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned one aspect of this when he referred to research work.  It is possible the housing problem in Dublin would influence the corporation to carry out research into housing generally.  The same thing could happen in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  We might have nine or ten bodies carrying out research to achieve the same end. Surely the work carried out by Dublin Corporation should be sufficient for the rest of the country, thus avoiding duplication? There is a case where it is only right the matter should come back to the Department so that the Minister could, for instance, tell Cork Corporation that Dublin Corporation was doing exactly what they wanted to do and that there was no point in Cork Corporation spending money when they could get the result from the Dublin finding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal to be said in favour of the arguments put up by Deputy Clinton and Deputy Ryan, but I can see the other side of the picture.  The Department can make a good case for retaining supervision and uniformity as far as the different local authorities are concerned. They would be able to transfer advice from one council to another. But I am sure this amendment would never have appeared, were it not for the delays on the part of the Department when anything is submitted by a local authority.  Why should it take the Department months before they can give a council a decision on a relatively small matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Department dealt expeditiously with submissions by local authorities, there would be no amendment to this section.  Great frustration is caused by the Department holding up decisions and holding up approval in relatively small matters.  I cannot see why the Department should take months to give approval to small housing schemes, water schemes or sewerage schemes.  We are rather doubtful about <Col N="178" /> the integrity of the Department in some cases.  When a county council renews an application for decision, some time later a letter comes back expressing some doubt about some technical point, and I think that is deliberate.  While I agree the Department have a responsibility to get all the submissions covered by this section for their approval, I think there is an obligation on them to give a decision readily and within reasonable time. That is my personal view.</P>
    <P>It is our experience in local authorities that Departments are very slow. We know that in a number of bigger schemes where large sums of money are involved, the Department must be careful about approving the expenditure of big sums of public money, but we feel that in relatively small matters, there is no justification for getting their approval.  That is the only fear I have so far as this section is concerned. I do not disagree with the point of view of the Parliamentary Secretary that the Department should have a say in local authority matters covered by this section, but I hope that if the section is passed in its present form, there will be no undue delays in giving approval to recommendations made by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I am confused about what exactly Deputy Clinton wants in this amendment.  The section deals with assistance by housing authorities to certain bodies, assistance by loan, by periodic contribution to the funds of the body, and by guarantee of sums owed by the body.  Subsection (2) sets out the type of bodies.  They include bodies whose objects include the provision of dwellings for elderly persons, the provision of dwellings to secure one or more of the primary objects to which a housing authority are required to have regard, the conduct in relation to housing of research or the provision of training, and the advance of money for the provision, including reconstruction or purchase, of dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If local authorities decide to make loans from their resources, they should be the determining body.  For example, if Dublin Corporation desire to take advantage of the section to make a <Col N="179" /> loan to one of these bodies, they should be able to do so without having to have regard to the Minister, subject to the fact that the loan is being made from Dublin Corporation resources, but if this is a question of giving power to housing authorities to make loans which would have an effect on a programme for providing houses and dwellings for people in need, I would have to look at this again.  I am not quite clear on this matter.  The section is permissive and there is nothing in it which says money being utilised for this purpose will come from other bodies, such as the State.  If it is intended that the money should come from the State, then quite obviously there should be examination and approval on behalf of the people as a whole, through the Minister.  The section does not appear to call for any contribution from the State.  As I read it, it permits the local authorities to spend or lend money.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long it is since the local authority of which I am a member were able to raise money from any other source than the Local Loans Fund.  On one or two occasions we raised private loans, but the amount of money raised by that means was infinitesimal compared with our requirements. Suppose that next week a body applied to Dublin Corporation or Cork Corporation and said: &ldquo;We have plans to do so and so, and we want a loan of £½ million&rdquo;, quite clearly there would be a problem.  If the local authority were in a position to issue a loan of £½ million, what would their position be in regard to providing houses for people on possibly a very long waiting list?</P>
    <P>I should like Deputy Clinton to clear my mind on this matter because I am not too clear as to what the amendment proposes to do.  If it intends to empower local authorities to spend money which they raised, I would not be in favour of running to the Department and looking for sanction.  I do not think there is much merit in the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary about research, because very often if research is carried out into one matter from two or three different <Col N="180" /> angles, someone may come up with a better answer.  In the broad field of medical and scientific research, no one suggests that one research laboratory could find all the answers.  It requires a number of research laboratories&mdash; the more the merrier.  If Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation carried out research into one aspect of their housing operations, one or other might come up with a quicker or a better answer, and there would be an exchange of information.  In this narrow field, I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary's answer is sufficient, and I should like Deputy Clinton to make clear to me what exactly the amendment means because I am still confused at this stage.</P>

      <P>When I moved this amendment, I thought I made it quite clear that it could be just as appropriately moved on many other sections of the Bill in which the same statement occurs: &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; or, &ldquo;with the consent of the Department.&rdquo;  I want to remove this interference.  I want to place responsibility for housing on one authority, or in one spot, and if they do not meet that responsibility, we will know who is to blame.  We cannot continue with divided responsibility between the Department and the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is half as innocent as he pretends to be.  He spent a long time as a member of a local authority, as I did, and he knows the frustrations, the delays and the unnecessary expense and duplication that occurs because of this divided responsibility, the numerous problems that arise under this section if a local authority decides that it is a good thing to help various bodies to solve their own problem which is a housing problem.</P>

      <P>Yes, a block grant from the State.  The State's contribution should be given by way of block grants and it should be left to the discretion of the local authority how best to use that money.  As long as we have these long arguments as to who qualifies and who does not qualify for the various subsidies and the extent of the subsidies, we are quarrelling most of the time and working very little of the time, and that is why we have such a deplorable backlog in regard to housing needs.  If the interference by the Department is removed&mdash;and that is the intention in this amendment&mdash;we will get as much work done as we have money to do and we will get it done in the cheapest possible way.</P>

      <P>This is a completely new provision, the first of its kind in any of our housing codes and it gives freedom to the local authority, with the consent of the Minister, to contribute to outside bodies.  Up to the moment there has been no such provision. Local authorities and if one are the housing authorities themselves wants to talk about housing, they are the people who are responsible for providing houses for the people within their local authority area.  There is nothing in the law as it stands enabling local authorities, with the consent of the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Larkin hit the nail on the head when he referred to the fact that State aid may be involved in this.  If State aid is involved, it is only right that the Minister should have some say in it. No matter what Deputy Larkin says about this question of research, I still think it would not be a good thing, and there is no necessity, to have four, five or six bodies carrying out research with a view to getting the same result and having duplication of expenditure by Dublin Corporation and Limerick Corporation, as the case might be.  I think this provision is necessary and at <Col N="182" /> least some members of the Fine Gael Party felt that there was justification for requiring the consent of the Minister. This is a new provision and it is only reasonable at the initial stages that the Minister should have some control over it.  I cannot see that the local authority will be tied up too much by it.  As a matter of fact, the complaint we get from local authorities from time to time is that they are asked to contribute too much and more even, in some cases, than the State contributes to other schemes already in operation. The fact that this provision is new is something we should welcome and I do not think the fact that the Minister must give his consent before the local authorities can contribute will hinder them or stand in the way of progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to let the Parliamentary Secretary misrepresent me.  I do not think that any of the provisions of the section are undesirable in themselves.  What I am looking for is freedom for the local authority to make their own decisions.  This expression &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; always gives the impression that there is only one person to be consulted, that is, the Minister himself. We know from experience that this phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; covers all this set of submissions that local authorities are required to make before they can proceed with any work.  They have to be scrutinised by the Minister's advisers and they hold up progress in the provision of housing.  We are dealing with a housing Bill and I want that removed, once and for all.  This idea of using the Department as an artificial brake on expenditure is all wrong.  We should be honest enough to say we have no money if we have no money. If we have a certain amount of money, we should say: &ldquo;We have a certain amount of money which we can give this housing authority and let them work out their own salvation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of talk tonight about giving power and responsibility to public representatives. If you want a responsible local government, you must give local representatives much more power and responsibility. <Col N="183" /> This is the essence of this amendment.  I am seeking to give them such power and to eliminate the Department's interference.  I appeal to the Minister to give the public representatives this power and enable them to overcome this housing problem that exists, this enormous backlog. Whether it be by research or by any other method that, in the opininon of the local authority, leads in the right direction, by all means give them permission to carry on but do not have all this to and fro with the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Clinton is trying to complicate matters here.  He is speaking of housing generally rather than on this particular section which gives power to the local authority, with the consent of the Minister, to contribute to bodies which do not exist at the moment, as far as we know, and to which, if they do exist, the local authority has no power to contribute to assist them financially or otherwise in this whole question of housing.  Elderly people or otherwise are specified here.  Deputy Clinton talks about a bulk sum being given to local authorities to help them provide houses.  Is that what I understood him to say?  How then are we to decide how much each local authority gets?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment must be related to the intention of the section and the intention of the section is to permit a local authority to make a contribution out of their resources; in other words, to levy on the ratepayers an amount for a particular body.  That is what the section says. You are going to say to the local authorities in any part of the country: &ldquo;If you want to help some of the bodies which are specified, we are going to give you power by legislation to spend out of the money you recover from the rate £x for that particular purpose.&rdquo;  I do not know whether that is the purpose of the section but that is how it appears to read in regard to the contribution.  The way I understand a contribution from a local authority is a contribution from money raised by the local authority and the local authority can use it to channel funds from the Local Loans Fund for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will clear my mind on that.  If the purpose of this section is purely to extend to local authorities permission to spend money, as they do when they make a supplementary grant, that should be explained.  Any local authority which makes supplementary grants under the SDA do so on the basis that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as the section is concerned, as it is clear that it is a permissive section in general to give the local authority power to spend money in this regard, it appears that there is a very strong case for the amendment.  Once legislation is introduced permitting local authorities to make supplementary grants available, it will not be necessary for the local <Col N="186" /> authority to specify each particular case and get the sanction of the Minister for each supplementary grant.  If the housing authority are given authority to spend money for these purposes, is there any case for saying that they should require sanction thereafter from the Minister?

As a member of a local authority for the past 24 years, I have known of delays on the part of the Department which have caused further expense to the local authority in regard to house building and other matters.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment. I should like to remind Deputies that quite recently we passed legislation here embodying a similar section.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> That is a similar type of section and it was acclaimed quite recently by the House in dealing with that Act.  I do not know why Deputies opposite are insisting on getting these words deleted from the section because as I said earlier one of the complaints we had from local authorities from time to time is that they are asked to contribute to schemes of one kind or another to a greater extent than even the Central Fund.  In view of the fact that it is a new provision so far as housing is concerned it is no harm to have some control over the matter and I think the amendment should not be pressed.  We are satisfied that the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; will not in any way serve to hamstring local authorities or prevent them from contributing to any worthy proposal that may come before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great respect for Deputy P. Brennan, the Parliamentary Secretary, and usually when he makes a contribution, it is a sensible one.  I do not know if there is any significance in the fact that he is trying to get this particular section through but it is obvious that either he does not understand what it means or he is trying to put something across the House.  There is no other explanation. The Parliamentary Secretary is an intelligent man and, therefore, he must know that this is the type of section which got us into trouble in the previous Housing Bill because there was a very innocent looking section in that Bill which we are told was for the purpose of tightening up control; that there would be no change in procedure and so on.  The result was that nobody but a farm labourer could get a grant which was formerly given to everybody when the reconstruction job was half done.  The same arguments were made then, that it was for the purpose of helping and improving. Now we have a Planning Bill that will cause more trouble than anything else that has happened in the country for the past 40 years but this is one Bill that will not be allowed through in the same manner and there will be no compliments passed across the <Col N="188" /> House until we are sure what is contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Let the Minister tell me that if this section is passed as it stands and if somebody wants to apply to the local authority for a supplementary grant for reconstruction or the building of a house, does he have to apply to the Minister, or does the local authority have to apply to the Minister for sanction to pay it?  If they do not, why is this contained in the Bill?  It states:</P>
      <P>This section applies to the following bodies:</P>
      <P>(a)  a body whose objects include at least one of the following;</P>
      <P>(i)  the provision of dwellings for elderly persons,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the provision of dwellings which will help to secure one or more of the primary objectives to which a housing authority are required by subsection (3) of section 60 of this Act to have regard,</P>
      <P>(iii)  the advance of money for the provision (including reconstruction or purchase) of dwellings,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Reconstruction or purchase of dwellings&rdquo; is the reason why local authorities give supplementary grants. Perhaps the Minister will explain how any local authority would be entitled to give a supplementary grant for the reconstruction of a dwelling without getting the Minister's permission if this is allowed to pass as it stands.  If the Minister can persuade me that is not intended then perhaps I might change my mind but having listened to the explanations offered here and having read through the Bill I am satisfied that this is just another &ldquo;sly one&rdquo; which is being attempted by somebody and which is not going to work this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot blame me for that.  I still think you thought right then, but you are entitled to change your mind about what you then thought.  This particular section has nothing to do with supplementary grants nor have any of the sections leading up to it that we have already dealt with.  I think the first point at which we shall arrive in this Bill at matters which are being discussed on this amendment, and which are not relevant to the section, is in section 28.  The consent mentioned here is consent to something that was never done before.  The simplest thing to do would be to make provision financially and otherwise to do anything the local authority wanted to do in the interests of the community.  This is the intention. The section is drafted so widely and <Col N="190" /> is so much unrestricted in its overall provisions that the question of consent must, in my opinion, be included so that the Minister of the day may be kept informed&mdash;if for no other reason &mdash;of what is going on, what is being proposed and done by various councils throughout the country under the section.</P>
      <P>To correlate what may be done and prevent overlapping, as Deputy Brennan mentioned, would be part of the fruits of this consent and the Minister and his Department would be kept informed by necessity of what is proposed under this new measure of far-reaching effect and so widely drafted that it can reach far into the future and do things and help bodies that are not yet in existence to do them and do things that we may not have thought of doing and know nothing about.  In creating such power and putting it to the House I do not think it unreasonable that the Minister and Department of Local Government should seek to have the matter of consent written into the Bill just as we did in the more recent and somewhat parallel though much more restricted section 15 of the Planning Act.  I cannot see how this is going to restrict or reduce the power of the local authorities.  The very enactment of the section adds new powers and functions to them for their own benefit and advancement and the advancement of the people in their functional area.</P>
      <P>If this is so, how can any Deputy stand up and argue that by seeking consent in that fashion we are in effect reducing the powers of the local authorities?  How can Deputy Clinton wander all over the whole show and talk about a Departmental circular of last May as requiring the setting out of the documentation that has to accompany house building sanction? The circular he spoke about does no such thing.  The whole point of the circular was to reduce documentation to the minimum possible in order to expedite and make easier local authority housing programmes.  Listening to the argument tonight, I felt it was not really genuine.  I think there was quite a bit of playacting going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of protesting <Col N="191" /> tonight about interference with the functions of locally elected representatives. Firstly, they want to get rid of the managers; then they want to get rid of the Minister.  Of course, the one thing they want is to get the finances from the Department, from the Minister, from the Government. They cannot have the two things.</P>

      <P>Even if it were all rates money, why should there not be at the central level some sort of correlating force that would prevent overlapping in the spending of money for the same purpose by two organisations? Why is it that in regard to contributions to such bodies as the tourist regional groups and the old Tourist Association, though consent was not required, there was a limitation on the amount in respect of which a local authority might strike a rate?  I do not think anybody really cribs about the fact that in their contributions to municipal bodies there are restrictions. this provision.  Neither do local councils raise any hullabaloo about the fact that in their contributions to municipal bodies there are restrictions. There is not any question of kicking up about restrictions on the amount of money subscribable by the various local authorities towards the cost of running the Institute of Public Administration.</P>

      <P>What is wrong with all these things?  If they have not been objectionable in the past, how can the creation of this new function, to be operated at the local authorities' initiative, be objectionable now merely because the Minister wants it put into the section that his consent is required before these things can be done?  I cannot see how that argument can be sustained.  The only explanation is that quite an amount of confusion has <Col N="192" /> existed in the matter of supplementary grants for housing reconstruction and for the building of new houses.</P>
      <P>These matters do not arise on this section or in any section already dealt with: they will arise on later sections of the Bill.  This is a very reasonable provision which would provide the Department with overall knowledge so that the Minister would be aware of what was going on by virtue of his consent being sought.  This is a new departure to cater for the provision of sustenance to bodies that may not yet have even been thought of.  I submit this provision is one of the most reasonable ever sought in legislation of this kind.</P>

      <P>It is unreasonable to suggest that paragraph 3 of subsection (2) does not apply to money provided by a local authority for building houses.  The Minister did not mention that paragraph in the statement he has just made.  Perhaps it is not too late to expect clarification.  We know what happened in regard to the Planning Act.  When the Bill was going through the Dáil, the Minister made certain statements.  The Minister must be aware that a number of officials of local authorities read into the Act several things we did not dream could be included in it.  In respect of people seeking local authority grants, there is need in this paragraph of the amendment Deputy Clinton has suggested.</P>

      <P>From time to time the Minister gives us long lectures on the duties and responsibilities of local authorities.  From time to time he has exhorted local authorities to co-operate with the Department of Local Government in various things.  Yet here, when a relatively simple amendment is suggested to permit local authorities to spend money for worthy purposes and to make decisions as to whether <Col N="193" /> money should be spent in this way, the Minister says, in effect, that no local authority in the country has any responsibility whatsoever.  In effect, what he is saying to local authorities is: &ldquo;Because you are not responsible bodies, I shall see to it that before you adopt proposals to carry out certain objectives you must get Ministerial sanction.&rdquo;  This could create a situation in which the Minister could impede local authorities in their aims to assist very deserving bodies to do the work set out in the section.</P>
      <P>The section deals with the question of providing money for the provision of dwellings for elderly persons.  The Minister says, in effect, to the local authorities doing that very deserving work: &ldquo;We give you power to spend your money to assist any body providing dwellings for elderly persons. While you are being given that power, you cannot exercise it without my permission.&rdquo; The section deals with the advance of money for the provision of dwellings.  The Minister has indicated repeatedly on this that this does not refer to local authority dwellings or dwellings under the SDA but to dwellings provided by a body.  That may well be a co-operative body established for the purpose of providing dwellings for its members.</P>
      <P>We know the Minister is on record on a number of occasions as telling co-operative bodies they would have all the support in the world from him but possibly the local authorities were interfering with or holding them back from developing and providing dwellings for their members.  Yet, if the local authorities, once this section goes through, can give assistance to such co-operative bodies, the Minister says: &ldquo;No; you cannot do it unless you get sanction from me.&rdquo;  I submit again that the Minister in this regard is demonstrating, not in words, but by his decision, very little faith in the elected representatives on local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that he look at it again, in view of the fact that this appears to be a question of expending money, not the property of the State but for which the local authority is responsible. The Minister should show <Col N="194" /> that he has some regard for democracy, some regard for the system of democracy which appears to operate in the State, and permit the elected representatives to act in the name of the people they represent without having to go to him and say: &ldquo;This is a scheme: we are proposing to do this and we will spend money on this,&rdquo; to which the Minister says no.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Who said it will be only the council's money that will be in question?  Who can foresee that this is so?  I say there is nobody in the House who can stand up and say categorically that this is so, even if we were to take it on the face of it that it is council money and in no way State money.  I do not agree that may be so; there is no evidence that it may be so in this case. I am introducing a section which gives local authorities wide powers for the first time and I am criticised because my consent is to be sought before this power is exercised.  It is being said that this is proof positive that I do not trust the local authorities.  That is a poor argument.  Powers are being given which never existed before and because the Minister's consent is sought in regard to the exercise of these powers, it is said the Minister does not trust the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin knows I do not believe that.  In fact I do not think he believes what he says.  He thinks he knows what my mind is, and he knows better.  The evidence is surely stronger on my side for having section 12 included. A very strong case can be made that the Minister has more trust and confidence than had the Minister for Local Government who dealt with the Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  Some of the members who are talking loudly here about the lack of powers then supported the Government and the Minister who brought in that amendment which was allegedly to cure all ills and all infringements that had arisen, according to these people, under the original Act of 1940.  All those things were to be cured and all powers were to be restored to local authorities.  Elected members were to be emancipated.</P>

I am not reflecting on the people who brought in the 1955 Act, believing it would remedy some of the defects that had emerged and could only have emerged in the operation of the Act since it was enacted 14 or 15 years ago. The fact is that the very people who supported that move are now loudest in criticism of the lack of powers in local authority members.  Then, having got to that stage those same people now wish to use their past experience to create a belief that I, who had nothing to do with putting through the 1955 Act, whatever I did to stop it going through, am responsible for that lack of powers today.  Try to add it up. It befuddles and confuses me and does not really add up to a great deal of common sense.</P>

I would say further that some <Col N="196" /> of the local authority members were not invited.  It was a very good thing to have those meetings at that time but I want it to go on record that I did not decline to attend any of those meetings.  I was not invited.

      <P>The Minister has referred to the 1955 Act and he has repeated again and again that the members of this House were codded by the then Minister.  In fact I believe the Minister was quite honest about it and was using the information he had received from his advisers.  He thought then and he persuaded a number of us&mdash;he did not persuade the present Minister&mdash;that this amendment would do certain things.  A similar situation has arisen now.  We are told it will do something entirely different.  We are taking the stand which we took in 1955; we will not be blinded by the light shining across there.  Somebody has got the idea that they will slip a fast one but we will not allow it to happen if we can prevent it.

      <P>(b)  by a periodic contribution to the funds of the body,</P>
      <P>(c)  by a guarantee of sums owed by the body in respect of borrowings.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section applies to the following bodies:</P>
      <P>(a)  a body whose objects include at least one of the following:</P>
      <P>(i)  the provision of dwellings for elderly persons,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the provision of dwellings which will help to secure one or more of the primary objectives to which a housing authority are required by subsection (3) of section 60 of this Act to have regard,</P>

    <P>(b)  any other body approved by the Minister for the purposes of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just make this point?  The point is this that the local authority, according to the main section, may advance money to a body, one of whose purposes is &ldquo;the advance of money for the provision (including reconstruction or purchase) of dwellings.&rdquo; It is the body to which this subsection (iii) applies and not to the local authority.  The local authority may contribute to the body and the body is the body defined there, this being one of the objects at paragraph (iii) <Col N="199" /> of subsection (2) (a), that is, &ldquo;the advance of money for the provision (including reconstruction or purchase) of dwellings&rdquo;.  That refers to the body and not to the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 60 reads:</P>
      <P>(3)  In making or amending a scheme under this section the housing authority shall have regard to the following primary objectives:</P>
      <P>(a)  the repair, closure or demolition of houses which are unfit in any respect for human habitation;</P>
      <P>(b)  the elimination of overcrowding;</P>
      <P>(c)  the provision of adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons (including elderly or disabled persons) who, in the opinion of the housing authority are in need and are unable to provide such accommodation from their own resources;</P>
      <P>(d)  the segregation of persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not suggest that that section, which is referred to specifically in section 12, does not mean that the local authority are advancing money for one of those purposes to cover people in this category? The local authority advance money by way of loan or grant with the consent of the Minister if this section passes.  At the present time they do it without the consent of the Minister and that is where the whole trouble lies.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons why the Minister objects to this is that he sees that this may not alone be the local authority's money but money advanced by the local authorities and the State jointly.  If that situation arises, the Minister has the power already either to grant or refuse the money and he does not need any more permissions, so that rules out the objection put forward by the Minister. The Minister then goes further in a very innocent fashion.  He is an expert at sugar-coating a dangerous pill and this is a dangerous pill because anything which requires the consent of the Department and the Minister involves a sheaf of submissions, endless details, two sets of people preparing for it with one set depending on the other and, consequently, nothing done.  For that reason, I cannot see why the Minister cannot decide to give the local authority powers in this matter without his consent.  If he is afraid of the amount of State money that might perhaps be put into the various projects, he has the power to refuse.  It is reasonable to expect the Minister to delete this phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Minister agrees to this amendment, just one point strikes me, that is, that we will have a shower of amendments to delete this phrase in regard to every aspect of local authority spending.  As it is, say a local authority decides to contribute in some way to a body who will provide, say, 20 houses for elderly people.  That body seeks financial assistance from the local authority and the local authority agree to give it to them. <Col N="201" /> Even though they get the consent of the Minister to get a loan from the Local Loans Fund, they have to get his consent.  This is a new provision. You have to get the consent of the Minister now for most things.  As the Minister pointed out earlier here, they gave the local authorities greater powers in regard to the acquisition of land, and so on, so as not to have to come to the Department in regard to matters of this kind and that, in fact, we hope to speed up the building programme. If the Minister has to give way on this particular section I think we can take it that, as the consent of the Minister comes up quite often in this Bill&mdash;I think it does&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not think he could be accused of depriving the local authority of authority when, in actual fact, he is making a tussle to extend their schemes even still further by providing for assistance for certain categories, particularly in regard to housing. Instead of tying-up local authorities, he is extending their powers.  I do not think the deletion of the words or the inclusion of the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; will in any way affect the local authority in the operation of the section.</P>

      <P>I should like to add further to that and quote to the House the relevant provisions in some of the Acts which we have been talking about here.  Take, for instance, the Local Government Act, 1955.  We have a consent section there where power is given to local authorities to contribute to certain organisations.  Section 55(2) of the Local Government Act, 1955, says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A local authority to whom this section applies, may, with the consent of the Minister and subject to such terms and conditions as they think fit, contribute to the funds of a society, club, committee or other body providing <Col N="202" /> or proposing to provide swimming facilities.</P>
    <P>It is there in that particular section. I do not recall that I even objected to it then.  There are certain things that I objected to in 1955 but that was not one of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question for the Minister next week when he will regret that power being there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of that particular subsection of section 55 is almost identical with the wording of section 12 because whereas it says &ldquo;a local authority to whom this section applies, may, with the consent of the Minister........&rdquo; in section 12 it says &ldquo;a housing authority may, with the consent of the Minister.........&rdquo;  It starts off slightly differently but it goes on &ldquo;and on such terms and conditions as they think fit, assist a body.........&rdquo; Here we have, in the other one, &ldquo;contribute to the funds of.&rdquo;  It is tantamount to the same thing, almost identical, except that we are talking about a housing authority on the one hand as against a local authority on the other hand.  To all of us in this House, with the associations that we have, they are tantamount to the same thing in that very often the membership is a dual one and what is good enough for one is surely good enough for the other.</P>
      <P>Then, further in the same Act, and very shortly after, we have the other section &ldquo;Contribution to body providing museum.&rdquo;  One would think that that is rather the sort of function and activity that would not give rise to any sort of revolutionary action on the part of local authorities, particularly in regard to the vast majority of local authorities within whose territory there is not a museum at the moment nor is there likely to be a museum in the future.  Yet, in the 1955 Local Government Act, we find, under section 57 (1) the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The council of a county or corporation of a county borough may, with the consent of the Minister, contribute to the funds of a society, committee or other body providing or proposing to provide a <Col N="203" /> museum for the reception of objects of local antiquarian interest and may assist such society, committee or other body by providing a building for their use, supplying them with furniture, office equipment and stationery or by paying the whole or part of the remuneration of any person employed in relation to the museum.</P>
    <P>Surely, again there, it is obvious that the wording, the intent and all the rest is, in its broad purpose, similar to what is the content of section 12 and yet it is for such a harmless occupation as a contribution by one means or another, either in cash or in kind, to the upkeep, operation and housing of a museum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens.  Objection is being taken to the consent of the Minister in this particular section, which is so wide and can be so far-reaching that none of us can, at this stage, really determine its full scope as to what it may apply to in the future, and the not too distant future. If that is the scope of section 12 and if the limitation was a museum on the one hand in section 57 of the Act of 1955 and a swimming pool in section 55 of the same Local Government Act of 1955, surely, if those were there and they have not been objected to since and no amendment has been brought forward, if this consent is so objectionable now how can we then reconcile the fact that these were ever put on the Statute Book by the very people generally, though not specifically, who actually, as a Government, would have been instrumental in bringing them before the House that ultimately enacted them as law?  It seems extraordinary that this change should take place and that harmless occupations such as swimming and museums should be hedged around by two separate sections.  Here, now, we have a new section, less lengthy in wording than either of the other two, which covers such a wide field that none of us can see its utmost limits in the <Col N="204" /> future and yet we are strenuously objecting on all sorts of grounds of principle and otherwise.  It does not seem sensible to me how any people can accept the one, never object to it since, never attempt to have it repealed and yet now, with a broad issue such as this, they do not want it and put forward all sorts of reasons why we should not have it.</P>
      <P>Would some Deputies opposite tell me what the explanation of this extraordinary situation is?  I would be impressed if I could get an explanation from any of the people opposite as to how this comes about because I do not know and I cannot see it myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might possibly understand if he looks at the examples he has just given.  One of them is a museum and one is a swimming pool.  We are now talking about houses.  While there might be some argument in what the Minister says&mdash;I am not saying there is because maybe we would all have gained by experience over the years and we might not now, if the Bill were going through, adopt the same attitude to it as we did in 1955&mdash;at the same time, the fact that restriction are placed, and were agreed to, on the grants made by the local authority to the provision of a swimming pool or the erection of a museum is no argument in favour of refusing facilities to the local authorities to give grants to people who want to provide houses.</P>
      <P>If a group of people decide to build houses for a section of people who would normally qualify for local authority housing, at the present time they would get the normal grant from the Department of Local Government, despite the fact that this Bill has not been passed, and would get a supplementary grant from the local authority, without the permission of or reference to the Minister for Local Government.  As soon as the State grant is paid notification is given to the local authority who, if everything else is all right, automatically pay the supplementary grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now suggested that it is a good <Col N="205" /> thing that those people should be put in the position that they must apply to the local authority and the local authority must apply to the Minister for permission to pay the supplementary grants at present being paid without any delay.  Everybody involved in a local authority, particularly in regard to housing, is aware that if the local authority applied to the Department of Local Government for money, even before the credit squeeze, by the time the Department got around to it they had wasted several months.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could have the provision stated in such a way as to include people in the category to which I have referred it is quite possible that the opposition, particularly from the Labour Party, would not be so strong but as it stands the section seems to specify that the people to whom I have referred would be put in the position that they must apply for permission of the Minister for Local Government to have money paid to them whereas at present, without this Bill, which is to do so much for everybody, if there is sufficient money available to implement it, that would not be necessary.  That is our objection.</P>

      <P>This question of supplementary grants arose.  The supplementary grant applies in the case of an individual who is going to occupy the house and there is a means test.  Is not that so?  The supplementary grant is paid to the individual who will occupy the house.  It is not given in respect of the house; it is given to the individual.  The supplementary grant may eventually get into the hands of the builder, I agree, but it depends entirely on the person who is to occupy the house.</P>

      <P>I know.  The point that Deputy Tully made helps to clear the matter.  I hope he sees it as I see it.  If a group of people decide to build houses for certain persons they are relieving the housing situation.  They can be considered for supplementary grants only when the local authority knows who is to occupy the house.  Is not that so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The person occupying the house can be assessed as to means.  What we are doing here is making provision for a group to go to the local authority and say, &ldquo;This is a special case and we think you should contribute another £300.&rdquo;  If the local authority agree, they can go to the Minister and say, &ldquo;This is a good project.  We have already paid supplementary grants but we are prepared to pay the equivalent of another supplementary grant if the Minister will consent.&rdquo;  Is there anything wrong in having the provision there that they must go to the Minister to do that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Say the Brennan Building Company decide that they will build houses for ten people in that category.  They apply to the Department of Local Government for permission and a grant is paid because each of the persons concerned is eligible for such a grant.  They also apply to the county council who, knowing the means of the persons concerned, agree that they qualify. Therefore a grant and a supplementary grant are paid.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary now tell the House that this subsection will provide that those people, will be able to get that grant <Col N="207" /> from the Department of Local Government as a group and a grant from the local authority on condition that the Department agree to the grant?  That is what the section says.  At the present, as individuals, they can get the grant and supplementary grant without any difficulty.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify the position by stating in this section that this does not apply to the normal grants and supplementary grants and loans given for building houses, that this is something extra? As it stands, while it may be in the Minister's mind that there may be an extra grant given by the local authority, I am quite sure he realises now that it also catches a certain category in respect of existing loans and grants. They are not excluded and therefore it must catch them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is additional. Take a body such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  If they wanted to build houses for old people, as they are doing and as I hope others will do to a greater extent, they now can get in respect of those houses a special grant from my Department complemented by a grant up to the same amount from the local authority.  Over and above that, under section 12, if the local authority wish, in accordance with any conditions that they might wish to apply, and with my consent, they can now make a loan or a grant or an annual contribution to the <Col N="208" /> branch of the society that has provided houses for any given number of people, the elderly or others, in their functional area.  This is getting down to the bread and butter of this section.  In a practical sense under the section this can be done.  At the moment it cannot be done.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it could well be that for the same body and the same sort of operation the local authority could provide the entire architectural or engineering services requisite to the obtaining of the site, the preparation of drawings, site works, plans and supervision of the building and so on. They could get this as an addition, over and above the contribution of the local authority, with the consent of the Minister and in addition to the fact that each of the dwellings so provided in each area in a similar scheme would still be entitled, without regard to section 12, and independent of it, to the grants still available and existing at the moment.  This is a practical example as to where this additional facility can come in.</P>
      <P>Another example in which members of the House would be interested and which may be quite a development in the future is the idea of cooperative housing which, unfortunately, is not much thought of in this country although great work is being done by it in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking of cooperation between the Minister for Local Government and local authorities. That does not exist.  It is in spite of the lack of that that we build houses at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to cooperative housing in the true sense, a group might get going on this particular type of business. The beginning would be the difficult period.  They might not necessarily have funds available or, if they had, they would want those funds for the acquisition of sites on which to build houses.  The local authority could help by providing a small office and clerical staff to start them off.  That could make all the difference between the <Col N="209" /> sucess or failure of this co-operative housing effort.</P>
    <P>Now, with the consent of the Minister, this help can be given under section 12.  There are gaps which it is desirable to fill, but we cannot fill them at the moment.  This is a facility the general body of local elected representatives would be delighted to have and to use intelligently.  But I still must know what is going on.  Any Minister would wish to have such knowledge because this is a new provision. We must know what is happening. If certain grants or loans have been made we must know how well the system has worked.  Has a good return been given and, if the system is a success in one area, should we allow another local authority to adopt the same scheme?  These are the things we must have information about.  We are, I think, entitled to know.  It is to the advantage of the people and the local authority that we should know. This consent is absolutely essential, therefore, if we are to know.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Agricultural Credit Corporation Loans.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> At Question Time today I asked the Minister for Finance to take immediate steps to put the Agricultural Credit Corporation in funds to enable them to give and discharge the loans offered by them to farmers during the past 12 months, where the borrowers have entered into commitments on the strength of the said offers and where the borrowers are prepared and anxious to take up the loans.  I expected the Minister to give me an assurance that he would accede to my reasonable request, but he did not see fit to do so.  I, therefore, raise the matter now on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some years past the Agricultural Credit Corporation have been lending money freely for various purposes, including the purchase of land.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation were, in fact, encouraged to lend money and farmers were encouraged to borrow money for various purposes. <Col N="210" /> In the letter granting the loan there was a stipulation that the loan should be taken up within three months.  The Minister, in his experience as a lawyer, knows as well as I do that such a stipulation in a contract, specifying any special time for doing something, is never literally interpreted by the courts unless and until it is made the essence of the contract by a special notice in writing.</P>
    <P>In fact&mdash;and I believe the Agricultural Credit Corporation will so inform the Minister &mdash; this three months' stipulation was never insisted upon and never acted upon.  Rarely, if ever, was the loan taken up within the three months.  Lest it might be said I exaggerate, I say, without fear of contradiction, that quite frequently the loan was not taken up within the three months, but it was nevertheless granted.  Frequently, indeed, it was impossible for borrowers to take up the loan within three months because the title of their security, or some of their security, was not in order and it required a court application to put the title in order.  Very often the court application could not be made inside the three months.  The Probate Office, the Land Commission, the Land Registry, and other Government Departments were involved and that made it impossible for the borrower to put his title speedily in order and take up the loan within the three months.</P>
    <P>The important thing, however, from the point of view of my argument, is the fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation did not insist on the loan being taken up within three months and it was quite reasonable then for borrowers and borrowers' advisers to proceed on the basis that this stipulation was not a hard and fast rule and would not be arbitrarily enforced. However, like a bolt from the blue, in July last the Agricultural Credit Corporation, without notice of any kind, started insisting on the letter of this three months' stipulation, enforcing it strictly and literally.  The result has been many cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>For instance, farmers bought small adjacent farms&mdash;aye, and big farms too&mdash;of land beside them and entered <Col N="211" /> into binding contracts to purchase these farms on the strength of the offer of a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  They went further.  They paid deposits on these farms.  Some of them sold their own smaller farms, entering into binding contracts, in the hope of buying larger farms with the assistance of the loan which had been sanctioned.  Other farmers paid deposits out of their own pockets or persuaded friends to advance them money on a temporary basis until such time as the Agricultural Credit Corporation loan would come through.  These serious financial commitments were entered into on the strength of a letter from the Agricultural Credit Corporation that they were prepared to make these loans.</P>
    <P>I can give examples of loans which were sanctioned and cancelled within a short time: a loan for £1,900 sanctioned on 24th May, 1965, and cancelled on 31st August 1965.  In that case an application to the court was necessary and that application could not be made until November.  Another loan for £2,500 was sanctioned on 31st May and cancelled on 3rd September. A loan for £1,200 was sanctioned on 25th February and cancelled on 5th August last.  In that case probate was necessary and a sub-division involving two Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I maintain the Agricultural Credit Corporation have broken faith with their borrowers.  They have done so through no fault of their own.  On the direction of the Government, and as a matter of Government policy, they encouraged people to borrow money; they subsequently cancelled these loans, again on the direction of the Government and as a matter of Government policy.</P>
    <P>I say that the Government should now put the Agricultural Credit Corporation in funds to enable that body to discharge loans to farmers in cases where farmers have entered into serious commitments on the strength of these loans.  They did so in the belief&mdash;a belief encouraged by their advisers&mdash;that this three months was a mere formality.  It was stated the Agricultural Credit Corporation would <Col N="212" /> lend money to buy land.  They would lend money only for productive purposes. As a Deputy asked here today, was there anything more calculated to increase productivity and thereby add to the wealth of the nation than a progressive farmer buying a derelict farm next door, a farm which had lain idle for years, and putting that land into good heart to produce wealth for the nation?  In each of the cases I have mentioned that is what would have happened had the loan been forthcoming. How the Government could pretend such loans were not for productive purposes I do not know.</P>
    <P>I undertook to allow Deputy Harte to speak on this matter and I propose to give him time.  I am not playing politics here.  I am asking the Government to enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation to keep faith with the borrowers.  It would be a sad day for this country if the people could not do business with a State-sponsored, State-financed organisation on this basis of being able to rely on the assurances given them by that body.</P>
    <P>It is very doubtful whether the cancelling of loans without due notice would stand up to a test case in court. However, I do not see why any farmer should be put to the expense of bringing a case against the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I say the Corporation are not entitled, as a matter of law, to adhere strictly to this three months' notice without first making it of the essence of the contract by serving a special notice.  They have not done that in this case.  Without any warning at all, they just cancelled the loans.  It is significant that they thought fit in each case to send out a notice cancelling the loan.  They did not take the chance of relying simply on the three months' notice and saying it had lapsed.  If they thought they were on strong ground and had the force of law behind them to avail of that three months' notice, they should hardly have sent out notices cancelling the loans.  They did not send out a letter saying the loan had lapsed, but sent out a letter saying the loan had been cancelled.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to relieve cases of great hardship throughout the <Col N="213" /> length and breadth of the country which have been brought about by a drastic change in Government policy without any previous notice to the people concerned, who had involved themselves in heavy financial commitments on the strength of promises from a State-sponsored organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Fitzpatrick in this.  Like every other Deputy, I have had constituents coming to me telling their bitter stories about applying to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan to buy fertiliser, livestock, farm implements and machinery, farm buildings and indeed farm land lying convenient to their holdings.  They were told by the Corporation that their applications were granted and they then committed themselves, their friends or their families only to be told at a later date that the Corporation were dishonouring their promise to advance the money.</P>
      <P>This is the first opportunity Deputies on this side of the House have had of exposing this matter publicly.  I had occasion to raise the same matter at a county council meeting in Donegal.  It appears that whenever a person in public life tells the people exactly what is happening members of the Fianna Fáil Party at local government level get up to defend State bodies such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Without naming people, one particular Deputy defied me to bring forward one case of any constituent of mine being refused money.  This is like pulling a red herring across one's path. Every Deputy and every member of a local authority knows that all these things are sacrosanct and confidential, and it would be bad taste on the part of public representatives to bring them forward at a public meeting to prove a point.  Surely it is proof enough that a public representative seeks to expose these matters since he does so for a genuine reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same meeting a Fianna Fáil Senator said in defence of the Agricultural Credit Corporation that he had personal knowledge of a veterinary surgeon who applied for money to buy a Mercedes car and got it.  I would like to know who this gentleman was, what <Col N="214" /> cumann he belonged to and what he has done for the Fianna Fáil Party. It is a despicable thing that a member of such a profession, a profession in which he can earn his living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I may have misunderstood the Minister.  I thought he said it was the practice of the Agricultural Credit Corporation to do so.  Surely a responsible body such as this Corporation should see, even without a credit squeeze, it is bad practice to advance money to buy Mercedes cars and refuse farmers when they apply for as little as £100 for productive purposes?  This is the point that requiries to be explained to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in the Spring when the Government said they were giving the green light to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to advance £4 million to farmers.  I do not doubt that the Corporation accepted that in good faith and went ahead.  I can imagine the situation in the Corporation when people applied for loans.  Their security was examined and passed and <Col N="215" /> they were told the money was there, to go ahead and spend it.  The Corporation were satisfied from the history of the applicants that they could use the money for productive purposes, thus adding in their small way to the economy of the nation.  This was the pattern all along, until one fine morning the Minister for Finance was told by the banks that they had no money.  The Minister therefore could not give money to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Corporation, in turn, could not honour their promises to small farmers.</P>
    <P>While I am in no position to say exactly what happened, I think that is the case.  The blame for this lies not with the Agricultural Credit Corporation but with the Government.  The Government by their definite policy have misled the nation, and these people who find themselves in such jeopardy, into believing there was plenty of credit available.  At the same time, by the implementation of other policies, such as the corporation profits tax, they forced people to withdraw money from the banks with the result that the banks have no money to advance to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put the position of <Col N="216" /> the capital and public capital programme into proper perspective so that I can deal with this situation properly. The public capital programme, that is, the capital needed for expenditure on such things as housing, hospitals, schools, industrial grants, electricity, turf development, shipping, telephones, and so on, as well as for agriculture, rose from a total figure of £44 million in 1959/60 to £98 million in 1964/65, that is last year.</P>
      <P>It was to be expected that having regard to the economic activity projected in the Programmes for Economic Expansion, and to a large extent generated by those programmes, there would be a vast increase in the amount of capital expended on those programmes. It was envisaged in the Second programme that this figure would level off, taking one year with another, at £95 million.  In fact, as I pointed out, £98 million was expended last year, and the revised estimate for capital programme for the current year will be of the order of £100 million.  The break-down of that figure will be published in detail in the White Paper which was promised and which I expect will be published next week.</P>
      <P>That figure of £100 million, as Deputies can see, is in excess of the £98 million expended last, in excess of the £95 million which it was envisaged would be the order of capital expansion in the years immediately ahead for the remainder of the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> and considerably in excess of the figure for capital expenditure in the past six or seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My function as Minister for Finance is to ensure that sufficient capital will be available to service a programme of this order.  We had to rely, by and large, on the savings of the people, the savings of the people as made available in the national loans through the banks, and through superannuation schemes and otherwise, as well as what is called the autonomous inflow of capital, that is, capital invested by foreigners in this country in certain schemes such as factory buildings and otherwise, on their own volition.  The <Col N="217" /> latter was growing in the past but due to the credit restrictions throughout the world, in the current year there was a falling off on this figure which stood at about £16 million three years ago, £22 million two years ago, and which rose to about £35 million last year.  The amount of autonomous capital inflow offset the balance of payments difficulties which had arisen then.</P>
    <P>Having regard to this difficulty, to this world shortage of credit, and the limitation imposed on the inflow of capital from countries like Great Britain and the United States, by the Governments of those countries, it was found necessary in this country this year, in order to supplement the capital available from home sources and others, to seek a loan abroad, and the best advice available to us was that the amount we could confidently expect to get was of the order of £7 million.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate there is a considerable drawing, considerable demand, on this total of £100 million. Capital spending Departments and agencies&mdash;of which the Agricultural Credit Corporation is one&mdash;all make demands on the amount of capital that is available and these demands, as in the case of current expenditure by Departments, are often in excess of what can be afforded and, indeed, in some cases, what is likely to be spent.  So, as in the case of current expenditure by Departments, the capital requirements, as expressed in the original estimates by Departments, have to be pruned.  This pruning was done this year, as in other years, but it was found that the sums required were still considerably in excess of the £100 million.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that when capital demands are made and come up for payment, we are in a position to make the payments on foot of the debts properly due, for example, by way of contract buildings.  In order then to ensure that sufficient capital would be available for all the various purposes&mdash;for housing, schools, electricity, transport and for all the items of demand on the availability of capital&mdash;we had to go through the capital requirements again and at this stage the figure of Capital Budget as <Col N="218" /> published for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, stood at £4¾ million. That figure was looked at again on the basis of the figure supplied by the Agricultural Credit Corporation of commitments made and loans actually advanced in the first part of the year and it was estimated that a sum of the order of £4 million which is less than the figure which appeared in the Capital Budget would suffice.  It must be said that the figure of £4 million was based on an examination&mdash;not a close examination because time did not permit at that stage of such a close examination&mdash;by the Agricultural Credit Corporation of the commitments that had been entered into.  However, following closer examination by the Agricultural Credit Corporation of their requirements for purely productive purposes&mdash;and purely productive purposes had of necessity to exclude loans for land purchase and fundings of bank debts and for hire purchase: and there was a considerable degree of hire purchase of motor cars, not confined to veterinary surgeons alone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having regard to this new figure submitted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and after a joint examination of the figures by the Minister for Agriculture, representatives of the Agricultural Corporation and myself I decided to put the Agricultural Credit Corporation in funds to the extent of their estimated commitments for productive purposes to the <Col N="219" /> figure of £5¼ million for the current year.  I want to say that to this sum of £5¼ million must be added the sum of almost £14 million which was provided for the capital requirements of the Department of Agriculture generally bringing the figure available out of the Capital Budget for agricultural purposes to almost £20 million or 20 per cent of the total Capital Budget of £100 million.  To this must be added the fact that the banks have been considerably increasing their loans for agricultural purposes bringing the figure which stood at £28 million in July, 1959 to £56 million in July, 1965.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to the Deputy's question of the 28th April, 1965, statistics as prepared in my Department are on the basis of the occupation of the claimant not of the business of the employer.  Accordingly the information in the form required by the Deputy cannot be supplied. Road workers employed by local authorities are classified in a statistical group described as &ldquo;general and undefined labourers&rdquo; which includes many other types of workers and therefore the sickness experience of the group as a whole would not be a reliable indication of the sickness experience of road workers.  As regards building trade workers certain information relating to some of the main occupational groups in the building trade is available which suggests that the average duration of short term disability benefit claims for such male workers is approximately 8 weeks.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information sought in Question <Col N="81" /> No. 245 is not available in the form requested since the relevant records other than records relating to each individual worker in connection with his annual leave entitlement, are maintained on the basis of hours paid rather than on a daily basis.  In any event, in relation to both of these questions, I am reluctant to set the precedent of furnishing in respect of every forest centre in the country detailed data of a character which is compiled solely for administrative purposes.  The extraction of such information for reply to Parliamentary Questions would involve additional costs and I am not satisfied that any useful purpose would be served.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> In the twelve months ended 30 June, 1965, the percentage of total hours paid which was recorded as time during which weather conditions precluded work was 8½ per cent.</P>
