    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Local Appointments Commission will make provision to ensure that advertisements for posts in the local authority service are so framed as to allow time for Irish people overseas to learn of such posts and to apply for them in good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the Local Appointments Commission anticipate that persons resident abroad may be interested in a local authority post being advertised an appropriately long period, sometimes five or six weeks, is allowed for the receipt of applications. In addition, certain posts are advertised in appropriate technical or professional journals or other publications circulating outside this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that all posts should be open to Irish emigrants who wish to return and that the present situation, in which in some cases advertisements require applying within a fortnight, makes it impossible for Irish people overseas to apply?  Is he aware of a recent incident in which somebody who applied immediately from Canada was ruled out on the grounds that his reply came too late?  In addition, is the Taoiseach aware that in some cases it is necessary to write for an application form and it can take three to four weeks for the correspondence <Col N="2458" /> to go four ways across the Atlantic? In these circumstances it is necessary to review the whole procedure to allow ample time for applications from abroad for all posts in the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the specific incident to which the Deputy refers but I agree that there is a difficulty involved where potential applicants would not have an opportunity of replying within the 14 days limitation period.  I am informed that in certain circumstances where hardship might be involved, or a person would be at a disadvantage by reason of distance, being in a foreign country for example, the Local Appointments Commission take a lenient view in certain cases.  The Deputy will also recognise that there is always pressure on the LAC to fill posts expeditiously and it would be against the interests of that principle if too long a delay was involved between the advertising and the filling of the posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that a week or two is not very vital, particularly if it means getting the best applicant?  If somebody only had a fortnight he would not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is true and if there is a need to review the procedure that ought to be done and I will make inquiries about it.</P>

The controls under the Dangerous Drugs Act and the regulations made thereunder are generally adequate to prevent the unauthorised use of the drugs.</P>

The number of maternal deaths in 1970 was three, provisional, for the same area.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the agreement to which the Deputy refers is that the restrictions prescribed in the Safeguarding of Employment (Northern Ireland) Act, 1947, on the employment in the North of Ireland of workers from outside the area will be abolished over a transitional period of five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the fact that we have sought a similar five year transition period for this purpose must have weakened his hand in seeking, as I presume he did, to have the Safeguarding of Employment (Northern Ireland) Act, 1947, terminated as from the beginning of the transition period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will have to agree that membership of the EEC does bring about termination of this Act which, as we all know, is suspect and disagreeable in its origins. The fact remains that the protection of employment which we sought for our own workers was necessary and we should not discount the need for this transitional period.  Therefore, I sought that five years because of the anxiety of our own workers.  I do not object to a transitional period elsewhere, but what is objectionable in that Act is, of course, its origins and its political nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a total misapprehension about the functions of the EEC.  A function of the EEC is not to determine political differences between member States.  This House discussed this matter and I think I made it widely aware that the Act in its origins is suspect&mdash;that is a mild word for it.  It is a nasty piece of work.  What we sought was the protection of our own workers and what the British sought was the protection of employment in the North of Ireland. What membership of the EEC does is to do away with that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

As I have said, I and this House made it clear to everybody concerned that this Act had more in it than protection of employment, and at this time to see the finish of it is very welcome.  At the same time, I think it would be quite unwise to give the impression that we are dictating to the Community how they will behave with all other nations.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear to members of the Community that this Act, in its origins, is what I regard as a nasty piece of work.  If the Community after that decide to allow the Act to go on, I do not regard it as <Col N="2468" /> being a cause for us to take up a position in which we would feel that the Community are unfriendly.  It is satisfactory that the Act will come to termination after a five-year transitional period and, even though I would desire&mdash;and I think it is generally known that I would desire&mdash;to see the Act, because of its origins, disappear, I do not object to the protection of employment here or in the North of Ireland because it is necessary to protect workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we now to understand that the Minister does not consider himself entitled to make any representations to the Community on matters that are the content of negotiations between the UK and the Community?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have this right, and I can tell the House that the Community were aware that there were nasty aspects in that Act, but since we are seeking membership and while neither I nor anybody else here likes this Act, we should not put ourselves in the foolish position of telling the Community they are unfriendly if they do not do away with it at once.  They are doing away with it in five years.  They are giving our workers five years protection, and the Members of this House should grow up.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose <Col N="2479" /> taking Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme of grants for higher education was introduced in 1968.  The maximum amount of money paid to a holder of a full higher education grant is £300 per annum in the case of a student whose normal family residence is not adjacent to a University College or other approved institution of higher education and £175 per annum in the case of a student whose normal family residence is adjacent to a University College or other approved institution of higher education.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the scheme, university fees have increased by up to 25 per cent but the increase was limited to £10 in certain faculties.</P>
      <P>Special financial provision was made to enable university fees of holders of higher education grants in the academic year 1970-71 to be kept at the level obtaining in 1969-70.

      <P>The rates of subsidy paid to milk producers under the creamery milk price allowance and the milk quality bonus schemes were <Col N="2483" /> increased with effect from 1st May.  In the case of suppliers of between 7,000 and 10,000 gallons annually the rate of milk price allowance payable is due to be further increased from 1st September. These increases are additional to those brought into operation with effect from 1st September last.</P>
      <P>The measure of support for the creamery milk price is, of course, limited by the resources available to the Exchequer for distribution generally and the legitimate demands on these resources by other sectors of the community as well as the milk producers. The position in regard to Exchequer support for milk is kept under constant review but it is not feasible at this stage to indicate when the current level of such support might be increased.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply, would he not agree that the price of Irish dairy produce on the British market has risen in the last 12 months by more than 50 per cent and in view of this the actual burden to the Exchequer of dairy exports is very much less than it was even in the recent past?  Would he not further agree that if the prospect, which he wishes, of our entering the EEC comes to pass, it would be very desirable to stimulate milk production in order to be ready for that?  Would he not therefore agree that a very strong case exists now for the sort of price incentive which would result in a rapid rise in milk production? Would he not agree there is an overwhelming case for giving significant increases in milk prices at this time?</P>

This is not the case.  The Deputy will be aware that the Bord Bainne levy has been reduced on a couple of occasions since this situation arose.  This has brought about a considerable increase in the returns to milk producers.  I accept the Deputy's general thesis that milk production should be stimulated as much as possible <Col N="2484" /> within the limitations I have mentioned. It is still the most profitable line of farming there is, and the records of the Department of Agriculture over the years show very effectively that they have supported the production of milk.</P>

        <i>(b)</i> Prices paid for milk by creameries out of their own resources depend on such factors as the individual creamery's operational and marketing efficiency, extent of diversification of its production, volume of store trade, etc. and, accordingly, vary from one creamery to another.  The allowances paid by the Exchequer form a very substantial part of the total milk price received by creamery suppliers.  In the case of the milk price allowance the amount payable varies according to a producer's annual deliveries as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations, 1971: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations, 1971&mdash;a copy of which Regulations in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann on 14th July, 1971.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister for Health is anxious to get in to conclude this debate.  I do not blame him.  The Minister is a person for whom most of us have a very high regard as an individual but his handling of this whole matter&mdash;we must blame him for it even though his Department prepared it&mdash; makes us believe that as a politician he is not as astute or as honest with the House as we would wish.  This sort of thing which he introduced last week and which he has made numerous efforts to conclude has left those of us on this side of the House who pay any attention to matters of this kind with the idea that there must be something to hide.  We saw enough in it to know what he is trying to hide but there must be something more.</P>
      <P>I was very disappointed with the Minister's statement here the other day when he said, as a throwaway at the end of his speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped also to include in these regulations a provision fixing income standards for full eligibility, that is for that category who are entitled to medical cards.  After very detailed and careful studies of the matter, I have come to the conclusion that, as circumstances other than the purely financial vary so much as between country and town and between one family and another, I should not at this stage make regulations on such standards but rather leave it to the chief executive officer of the eight health boards to try to achieve the greatest practicable uniformity in their decision on <Col N="2503" /> eligibility.  I am arranging for my Department to bring the chief executive officers together with a view to working out a formula for achieving maximum unity of approach.  The reduction from 27 to eight in the number of bodies responsible for the operation of the health services should facilitate a reasonable degree of consensus in the matter.</P>
    <P>A whole series of rather large words which simply mean that the Minister does not intend to do anything about the scandal of medical cards.</P>
    <P>Since we started talking about the new Health Act the Minister, on every possible occasion, assured us that with effect from a certain date he proposed to introduce a list of incomes under which insured workers would be entitled to medical cards and I assume other people would have their incomes assessed in a certain way which would show whether or not they were entitled to medical cards.  Even as recently as two weeks ago, in answer to a question in this House, he told me that he proposed to introduce this regulation before the 1st October.  When I impressed on him that this could reasonably be introduced or at least the conditions could be reasonably introduced now he said that there was a certain amount of work to be done on it and it would not be possible to do it before 1st October.  At the end of his speech in a brief throwaway he says he does not propose to do it at all.  In fact, he proposes to allow the matter to be dealt with by the eight CEOs.  Does the Minister understand exactly what he has said?  He has said that now he is giving to a group of people, some of whom had absolutely no information about or experience in health matters until their appointment as CEOs, the right to determine who should or should not be entitled to free medical treatment.</P>
    <P>During discussion on the Bill dealing with health which was concluded before this issue was discussed, I said that instead of charging 15p for people to pay for hospital treatment he should use that amount on every insured worker and entitle him to have free medical treatment at all levels without <Col N="2504" /> having to go cap in hand to any person. If the Minister did this he would be doing a good job but he did not adopt my suggestion.  Instead, he introduced a selective tax in an effort to raise further income from those who are, according to the Minister, outside the medical card category.  The Minister then says that he is not going to say who is entitled to a medical card, after talking about it for at least two and a half years.</P>
    <P>Deputies who live in country districts &mdash;and the situation must be as bad, if not worse, in the cities and towns&mdash; know that there are people unable to pay for medicines and for doctors. Doctors who pay house calls, particularly in country districts, charge fairly hefty fees.  When people are unable to pay for medicines they do not bother to send for the doctor because they know that the cost of the medicines and the doctor's visit will mean that a member of the family must go without a meal.  We had hoped that the Minister would take some measures to ensure that all those entitled to free medical attention would obtain it.  The Minister has said that he cannot do it but that he is giving somebody else the job&mdash;somebody who must, of necessity, know less about the matter than the Minister or his officials.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his statement the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The chief executive officers will have available to them in their discussions the considerable volume of statistical material which was assembled in connection with the Departmental examination of this subject.</P>
    <P>Note may be taken of the number of large words the Minister has used.  The Minister further states:</P>
    <P>I would hope that the outcome would be the removal of the inconsistencies which have in the past existed in relation to the issue of medical cards, without substantially altering the total number covered. This should mean more equitable treatment for both the persons seeking the service and for the taxpayers and ratepayers who must meet the cost of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2505" /> The only people who could have all the information available are the Minister and his officials.  According to the Minister, a &ldquo;considerable volume of statistical material&rdquo; has been assembled.  In some peculiar way the Minister proposes to pass that information to eight other people and to ask them to set a number of standards that may vary from town to country and from area to area.  As a result of this, the situation will be much worse than it was originally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have told the Deputy that the chief executive officers will consult with the superintendent assistance officers and the staff officers who were concerned with this before the establishment of the health boards.  Obviously they would have to.  This may help the Deputy in his argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, but for the fact that during Question Time today I asked the Minister if I heard him correctly when he mentioned that in the south eastern area three senior officials on the Cork board had been transferred to the new health board and the Minister said that was correct.  The Minister may not be aware that throughout the country a special effort appears to have been made to ensure that the staff officers, to whom he has referred, do not get appointments on the new boards.  In fact, they were not considered as eligible to apply until I asked the Minister in the House if he would do something about the matter. As a result of his representations, the staff officers were informed that if they wished to apply they would be considered but this was not done until after an interview was held.  In a number of cases the staff officers did not apply and I do not blame them.  It is obvious they were being told they could apply if they wished but they had very little chance of getting the appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Minister now say that these people will be in a position to advise the CEOs when, in fact, most of them have terminated&mdash;or are about to terminate&mdash;their employment under health and are going back to local authorities as staff officers on roads, on <Col N="2506" /> housing or in some other section?  I know a number of such officers who have spent most of their public life dealing with health matters but a deliberate effort has been made to ensure they do not continue with this work.</P>
    <P>In view of this, does the Minister wonder that some of us are suspicious about what will happen?  Those of us in public life from time to time have received representations from people who considered they were entitled to medical cards.  As holders of the cards they were entitled, under the Health Act, to certain services and if they did not get those services we could discuss the case with the staff officers.  In no case could we intimidate the staff officer concerned, even if we wished to do so, because the officer was doing his job efficiently.  The Minister can understand the situation that exists now.  Prior to this we could talk to the staff officers employed in the local authority, of which we might have been members or have been associated with the authority.  Now we must talk with somebody who does not know, or care, who we are.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the new arrangement will be an improvement. I can see nothing but chaos arising as a result of this gesture.  Instead of the regulations being laid down by the Department so that nobody could accuse any person of giving medical cards to those not in need, or debarring those who were entitled, we now have a situation whereby the CEO will be entitled to decide who should have a medical card.  This is the source of all the trouble.</P>
    <P>It is not merely a matter of a regulation being introduced every year or every two years.  We are discussing a new Health Act.  It is framed in such a way that it will come into operation in stages during the next 15 or 20 years.  We are discussing a measure that will bind not only those people we know but will affect their children and grandchildren.  This is because some people have not taken the trouble to find out the best method; instead, they took the easy way out.  In this case I accuse the Minister of allowing someone to sell him a story, which he accepted apparently without question, <Col N="2507" /> that the proper method to deal with the problem was to hand it over to someone else instead of doing the job himself.  I am deeply disappointed the Minister has not carried out what he has said he would do.  I understood when the Minister gave his word to do something he would keep his word.  I cannot understand why he has changed his mind in this matter or who has twisted his arm for the purpose of ensuring that the matter would be dealt with in the way now suggested.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer, namely, how means are to be calculated.  Maybe I do not understand it fully.  Like every other piece of legislation this particular piece of legislation is worded in such a way that it is extremely difficult for some of us to understand what exactly is meant.  The suggestion here is that, instead of calculating yearly means by the method used to calculate them up to now, a new system of determining income is to be introduced. Section (2) (b) provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Income&rdquo; for the purposes of subsection (1) (b) shall mean the income of the preceding year ended on the 5th April and shall include all income which the person may have received for that year from all sources.</P>
    <P>During the Seanad debate a Labour Senator asked the Minister if, in fact, income tax was being included or excluded.  I am sorry; I should have said overtime.  He asked if overtime was being included or excluded and the Minister very explicitly stated that overtime was being excluded.  Would the Minister care, when he is replying, to explain what he means by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Income&rdquo; for the purposes of subsection (1) (b) shall mean the income of the preceding year ended on the 5th April and shall include all income which the person may have received for that year from all sources.</P>
    <P>I caught the Minister's comment&mdash;self-employed persons.  There are, of course, self-employed persons who do other work and, as the Minister knows, <Col N="2508" /> the income tax authorities will collect whatever should be collected as a result of any work done, including overtime earnings.  It is very difficult to define the term &ldquo;self-employed&rdquo; and the Minister and his officials must be aware of this because, instead of saying self-employed persons who qualify under a certain heading, they have put in this section out of the income tax code.  Am I to take it that what the Minister is saying is that self-employed persons who may be claiming medical attention under this particular section will need to produce a certificate of tax free allowance before they can claim?  Is that so or is it not?  Is the Minister saying that the only certificate which will be accepted will be the one accepted by the income tax authorities, not the visit from the home assistance officer or the superintending assistance officer, or anyone else?  It is provided here in subsection (c) of section 2:</P>
    <P>In determining the amount of income for the purposes of subsection (1) (b)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  regard shall be had to the amount of any income which would be chargeable to income tax under Schedule D or Schedule E as it would be determined for the purposes of an appropriate income tax assessment based on the income of the year.</P>
    <P>(ii)  the amount of any income from which Irish income tax would be deducted at source shall be based on the gross amount of the income receivable during the year.</P>
    <P>(iii)  the income from an employment shall be taken as the excess of the total emoluments for the year over expenses properly deductible for the purposes of Schedule E.</P>
    <P>The Minister was being a bit naïve when he said that these are self-employed because the reference even in his own brief is to people who are, in fact, employed and who, as well as being self-employed, may do a different job from time to time.  It will be &ldquo;God help the poor&rdquo; if the Health <Col N="2509" /> Act, the operation of which we have been watching for the past 12 months, the Health Act which will, we expect, be in operation for the next 15 or 20 years, it will be &ldquo;God help the poor&rdquo; if that Act is continued in the way apparently visualised in this particular section.  I think the Minister has deliberately or otherwise&mdash;I would hope it was otherwise&mdash;created a situation which, instead of improving the position from the point of view of those seeking medical services, will in fact make it a thousand times worse.  We know that the medical profession is in the main constituted of very humane persons, very dedicated persons who go out of their way to ensure that health services are given to those who need them.  We also know, however, that there are people in the medical profession who believe that the primary object is to make money.  All of us from time to time&mdash;I am sure no one more than the Minister&mdash;have had complaints from persons who tell us that the first thing the doctor did on coming into the house was to ask who owned the car outside the door, the car the breadwinner was using to get to work, or commented on the fact that there was a television set in the house and, because there was, the people living in the house were not entitled to a medical card.  By a strange coincidence, in cases like that a medical card is very often withdrawn until a row is kicked up and the card is returned.  We were hoping that the Minister in his introduction of a list of incomes for a medical card would do away with that kind of thing.  In fact it now appears as if the situation will be worse than it was before.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred the other day to a free choice of doctor coming into operation on 1st April, as well as certain other things.  I do not know whether or not it is simply a question of the Department trying to fit things in in a certain way so that there will not be too much trouble for them or whether they are really interested in having a decent health service.  It is my opinion that the former is the case. Like other speakers here, I am a member of a new health board.  So far that health board is no better or no worse <Col N="2510" /> than any of the others.  So far it appears as if it will not do very much for the health of those who really need help.  I have had experience of individuals who felt they were entitled to certain types of treatment.  I had one particular experience in which the husband was earning the princely sum of £21 per week, including overtime. There were three children, one of whom was an invalid.  The mother had a nervous breakdown.  There was a history of unemployment in the family before that.  The mother found it absolutely impossible to get a medical card.  So did her husband.  They found it impossible to get surgical boots for the invalid child.  They found it impossible to get drugs.  Everything seemed to go wrong.  I kept assuring them when this new list was introduced they were the people who would of necessity come under the new scheme and there would be no doubt as to their entitlement or, as the Minister likes to call it, their eligibility to this card. Now we find that the Minister has no intention whatever of trying to draw up a list.  He just dumps it back again &mdash;Paddy-go-easy; what was good enough for those before me is good enough for me&mdash;and he will deal with it in the same way.</P>
    <P>The right of Members of this House to seek information from health boards has been challenged by some of the people running the boards and the Minister has been very definite that information which is available should be given to Members of this House and that Members of this House are entitled to information.  Would the Minister state what he considers to be the right of a Member of this House, or of a county councillor who is not a member of a health board or, indeed, a member of a health board to comment, advise or make representations on the issue of medical cards?  This is an issue which will become very live after 1st October and most of us would like to know where exactly we stand on this.  There is no point in burying our heads in the sand and saying it is bound to turn out all right on the day. Many a thing has gone wrong because that attitude was adopted.  There is the suggestion that this is something which <Col N="2511" /> is only a matter of form and the Minister was very anxious to ensure speakers would not go outside the terms of reference of his regulations. If this particular regulation were not issued now in the dying days of this session&mdash;perhaps of this Dáil, as I believe it is&mdash;it would be debated for several weeks.  I believe a number of people who would have taken part in this discussion are not doing so because they feel there are other matters that must be debated before the Summer Recess.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister what are the opinions in his own party, not the opinions of those who will vote with him if a vote is challenged but the opinions of the backbenchers of his own party who do not appear to have been allowed to say a word about this Bill.  We can always gauge the support a particular Government measure has in the House by the number of backbenchers or front-benchers who come in on the Government side to support it.  Not many of them are rushing to speak in favour of the motion now before the House. The Minister has not got a word of support or encouragement from any of the Fianna Fáil Members in the House. Does he not think this strange?  Is it not true that they feel as we do, that this is not the way to do things, that the Minister is taking short cuts which he should not take and that they are not prepared to stand up and be counted.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this matter to which I should like to refer. Unfortunately, the section has been put into a sort of straitjacket so that the debate cannot be widened too much. We must keep within the rules of order. It is very difficult when commenting on something like this to keep within these limits in respect of something that has so many side effects which, in my opinion, could and should be debated. Unfortunately, we cannot do that; we must stick to what is on the Order Paper.  Therefore, I shall conclude by saying again to the Minister that a mistake has been made.  He should reconsider this question of issuing the instructions as to who is or <Col N="2512" /> is not eligible for a medical card in black and white so that everybody will know without having to ask anybody else whether he or she is entitled to a medical card.  Being a highly intelligent man with a sense of responsibility, as his record shows, the Minister should not try to bring in something such as he brought in here last week and think it would go through without comment or think it would solve the problems of medical cards.  I believe the problems will only begin when this news breaks to the country that the long-promised and often-promised list will not be published.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and not leave it to eight appointed people who are not approachable and who cannot be held answerable even in their own health committees because I am sure we shall be told that this is a matter which is reserved for the CEOs.  At least the Minister can be held to be answerable in this House.  The decision should be made to publish the list as promised and satisfy those who at present feel that they are not being treated fairly in regard to the issue of medical cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some of the Minister's proposals about which I as a Deputy representing a rural constituency, the one which the Minister himself also represents, cannot feel happy. In regard to the farming community we are told that a valuation of £60 is the maximum allowed, or an income of £1,600 for a non-agricultural worker. I find it difficult as a small farmer, to understand how the Minister, who represents mainly small farmers, can decide that a farmer with £60 valuation has an income equivalent to £1,600.  It is still harder to understand how a farmer with £60 valuation made up mainly of buildings can be held to have an income of £1,600 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, and I am sure the Minister knows, a number of holdings where the farmers may have a very small amount of land and a sizeable dwellinghouse and out-offices all of which are nonproductive of income.  How often have we seen the Land Commission advertise a residence on a 400 or 500 acre estate together with a farmyard of 20 <Col N="2513" /> or 30 acres of land for sale.  Suppose a farmer buys a place like that, his valuation would be much more than £60.  Will those large and in many cases obsolete and tumbledown houses with high valuations bring in to the occupier or owner an income of £1,600 a year?</P>
    <P>I think anybody living in such circumstances will demand from the Minister an answer to such a question. Personally, I know many people in Monaghan constituency who will expect the Minister to say how, on a small farm with a large valuation on houses, they are expected to earn £1,600 a year.  I expect the Minister in replying to explain, not only to me but to everybody in those circumstances, how they can earn £1,600 a year from derelict buildings.  I agree with Deputy Tully on the matter of giving the CEOs full control of the handling of medical cards.  I do not agree with this idea.  I believe the CEOs should have been consulted before the Minister put his proposals to the House.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, and a Member of the House, but not a member of a regional health board I want to know where I stand in relation to the regional authority.  I want to know if they are in any way answerable to me or if I have the authority or power to go into a regional health office and inquire about certain cases with which I am acquainted, as are other Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that we are not now discussing the Health Contributions Bill.  Nevertheless, I am answerable to my constituents, many of whom have demanded an answer from me. On their behalf I am demanding an answer from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that farm income is not keeping in line with incomes <Col N="2515" /> in industry.  Therefore, I would ask him if the £60 valuation will be reviewed annually and altered annually. Figures published by the Government in the past two or three weeks show that the farmer's income is lagging behind incomes in other employments. For that reason it is only reasonable that the Minister should tell us whether this maximum of £60 will be reviewed annually.  If it is not reviewed annually, the equation mentioned by the Minister, £1 valuation equals an income of £26, might be upset.  The Minister should tell us if this ceiling will be reviewed and altered annually.  I am afraid I disagree with his theory that £1 valuation is equivalent to £26 income.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of £1,700 annual income, who has a wife and three or more children, should get some allowance over a single person earning £1,600 and having no dependants. I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that in respect of a married man with three children the ceiling should be £2,000.  This would include an allowance of £100 for each dependant.  There is no comparison between the financial position of a single person with a salary of £1,600 and a married man with a family of three or more earning £1,500 to £1,700 and being responsible for the cost of medical treatment for that family.  I suggest that the case of the married man with an income of £1,700 and with three children should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the points I have mentioned before the regulations are put into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>An effective national health service should have a number of very clear-cut characteristics.  One feature which our national health service should have and which it does not have at the moment is an open administration. Within the health services there should be full publication of the general rules on eligibility, limited or general, and of administrative practices. In particular, there should be precise delimitation of the area of individual discretion left to the local inquiry officers and the CEO.  This should be <Col N="2516" /> statutory.  There should be some form of appeals system.  An appeals system is absent from the existing national health services in respect of the limited eligibility that we are now discussing.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the performance of the Minister in introducing these regulations was not one of his better performances. That opinion was confirmed on reading the Dáil debate of 21st July.  I would regard myself as being a partial admirer of the Minister's expertise.</P>
      <P>The Minister did say that the chief executive officers would have available to them in their discussions with the Department of the formulae for eligibility a considerable volume of statistical material assembled in connection with the departmental examination of the whole subject of eligibility, both limited and general.  It would be very valuable to Members of the House to have a reasonable amount of the statistical data prepared by the Department.</P>
      <P>I am sure it makes every elector entirely cynical when he reads, as we have been obliged to read over the past decade, of the tremendous, the quite amazing variation in regard to general eligibility for medical cards.  We have the situation, as has been eloquently pointed out by many Deputies, that for example in Dublin 12.3 per cent of the population are covered, in Roscommon 51 per cent are covered, in Donegal 41 per cent, Leitrim 40 per cent, Carlow 44.7 per cent, Kerry 43.7 per cent and Wexford 48 per cent.  These figures are well known to Deputies.  There is a disparity in the manner in which eligibility is arrived at and anomalies exist in many areas, county by county. This gives rise to the most outstanding area of cynicism and of straightforward allegations of corruption in relation to the health services in terms of the supply of medical cards to those who need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a trade unionist and as one acting on behalf of other trade unionists I have always resented attacks on officialdom because most of those attacks are entirely unwarranted. Those officials have to administer systems as they find them, bearing in mind the local variations, but nobody <Col N="2517" /> can accept the current widespread disparity of eligibility in the issue of medical cards.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, when introducing this motion last week, that there was a considerable volume of statistical material available.  I am quite certain the Minister has in his Department a tremendous amount of documentation available to prove the scandal that has developed in relation to the issue of medical cards throughout the country. This information should be issued to Members of the House.  It would save us the difficulty, now that we know that statistical information is available, of having to put down all those tedious Dáil questions, even if they are only for written reply.  The Minister should have been more forthcoming in giving us some indication of the formula for achieving maximum uniformity of approach.  He has said that the officers in his Department are bringing the CEOs together with a view to working out a formula for achieving maximum uniformity of approach.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to come before the House and say: &ldquo;This is going to happen, therefore give us the regulations, let us have the regulations adopted and we will then in good faith and good trust proceed to try to work out a formula.&rdquo;  As a public representative I have to suffer public humiliation every time I meet constituents who have applied for medical cards and who have had their applications either accepted or rejected for reasons which are unknown to me, and which cannot be conveyed to me.  I have often been blue in the face assisting and advising people in filling up this famous Dublin Health Authority application form.</P>
    <P>In the corner there is printed a statement that special circumstances, including unemployment, frequency or length of illness of the applicant or any of his dependants, should also be included.  It also has on the back &ldquo;For official use.  Inquiry officer's report&rdquo;. Then there is the peculiar mathematical formula, the details of which are unknown to us, numbered one to seven and then there are a few subtractions so that eventually by some computation <Col N="2518" /> there is a decision taken in the Dublin Health Authority.  The only objection I have is that the formula is unknown. If we could have the formula of the CEOs published or get some indication from the Minister about the maximum uniformity which he would like to see brought in, it would set our minds at rest.  When travelling around the country I meet relatives in south Cork and in Kerry and I can give them a completely different version regarding their eligibility for medical cards from that which I might give to some constituent in south county Dublin.</P>
    <P>We had laid before each House of the Oireachtas in January, 1966, the White Paper, &ldquo;The Health Services and their Further Development&rdquo;.  I presume this was prepared immediately following the general election of 1965 with a view to obtaining a general rationalising of the health services.  On page 34 of that White Paper the Government made a specific proposal when they said:</P>
    <P>These regulations, it is considered, should be subject to the approval of each House of the Oireachtas before coming into effect.  Persons within these limits would automatically be entitled to participate in the new General Medical Service, but it would be necessary to leave a discretion to the authorities operating the service to admit other cases experiencing undue hardship at any time because of special circumstances, in meeting privately the cost of medical care.  The income limits fixed by these regulations would be widely publicised, thereby overcoming one of the shortcomings of the present system.</P>
    <P>The words: &ldquo;The income limits fixed by these regulations would be widely publicised&rdquo; are printed in black type. Also on page 34 the Government stated:</P>
    <P>A persistent basis of criticism of the present service lies in the different standards of eligibility which are a consequence of local variations in interpreting the formula for the lower income group mentioned in paragraph 10, and in the fact that <Col N="2519" /> the standards for eligibility are not published.  Local health authorities must operate the law as they find it and variations such as these are probably inevitable in the operation of this somewhat vague criterion. It is, therefore, no reflection on these authorities that the Government accept these criticisms as valid.</P>
    <P>We were told in 1966 something which we knew from 1952 onwards.  The tragedy is that we are now in 1971 and that as yet the Government have not got to grips with this problem by giving the Dáil detailed information as to the precise formulae which we had hoped they would impress on chief executive officers at local level.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I approach these regulations with a great deal of trepidation and I feel that the Minister, rightly or wrongly, is not anxious to upset the political apple cart by assuring, as he should do, all those Fianna Fáil Deputies, particularly those from the western counties who are so meekly silent in relation to medical cards and limited eligibility, that it is quite a different matter having half the population covered by medical cards on the basis, as Deputy Oliver Flanagan said here on 21st July, that no one knows better than Fianna Fáil Deputies that a most effective trump card at election time is the medical card. Deputy Flanagan spoke of the whisper at the door that unless Fianna Fáil are returned to office the medical cards will be taken from them.  He said that the medical card has been responsible for getting hundreds of votes for Fianna Fáil, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>There is the other point that there should be some statutory offence laid down under the regulations or in general legislation in respect of employers who refuse to certify income for applicants for medical cards.  It is not good enough that a health authority should have to reply to an applicant that until such time as his employer certifies the application it could not be proceeded with.  I realise the majority of employers certify gross earnings.  The vast majority are quite helpful, but there <Col N="2520" /> are some who, either for income tax purposes or because they do not want to disclose what they are paying to such persons, are extremely reluctant to facilitate health boards.  Such refusal should provoke instant reaction from the Minister.  There should also be a method of assessing general income of families in this respect.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the suggestions of the House, he will be making the system fairer and more efficient. We will be changing the nature of the system and we will get away from the present system of medical cards and will be taking the assessment of eligibility out of the hands of the politicians. It is absolutely necessary we should do this.  The medical card and eligibility for it should be taken right out of the hands of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is so because it is a subjective area of representation. I am always shocked in this House when Fianna Fáil Deputies stand up and say: &ldquo;We in the Fianna Fáil Party have a special responsibility for looking after the poor.&rdquo;  Then one's blood begins to go cold when one begins to see political patronage, a kind of Tammany Hallism being substituted for national politics.  One finds a constituent saying: &ldquo;Thank you very much for getting me a medical card; if it were not for you I would not have got it.&rdquo;  When that happens to me I say that political and social education in Ireland is at a very low level.  These are the social rights of the electorate who should not have to go to any politician in order to be able to enjoy those rights and to obtain the benefits of them.</P>
    <P>It is with that in mind that I ask the Minister to speak from the rooftops so that people will not have any illusions as to their rights.  I know the difficulties involved in assessing incomes of self-employed, of farmers and of certain urban workers.  A better effort should be made on this.  The Minister has been rather agitated throughout the debate.  I do not think he expected the vehement reaction of the Opposition.  Such reaction was deserved as far as the system is concerned and because the Government have been spending far more time <Col N="2521" /> tearing themselves apart than tearing apart the health system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister I will not detain the House too long but I must add my voice of protest against his failure to honour the clear undertaking he gave to the House in relation to the fixing of criteria for the granting of medical cards.  We had hoped the Minister would have introduced some equitable system whereby the assessment of eligibility for medical cards would be standardised.  Instead, the Minister has now decided to allow decisions in regard to the determination of eligibility to lie with the CEOs in the various health regions.</P>
      <P>It is my conviction that the fact that in 1971 Dáil Éireann is discussing a health system which has come to be known as the medical card system is a terrible indictment of the social thinking of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It became apparent long ago to every representative in this country that the medical card system is a diabolical method, that it is a degrading system, a relic of the old poor law mentality which an enlightened Government could have and should have abolished long ago.  We still have this horrible system as an integrated part of our medical services and I hope the day is not far away when an enlightened Government will take steps to abolish the system in favour of a more equitable rational system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise this debate does not permit a discussion of the full health services but I should like to say that the Minister has made a serious mistake in not attempting to accept his obligations in this matter.  In view of the regionalisation of the health services, the Minister should have laid down some well-defined criteria for judging eligibility for medical cards.  With the creation of this much larger administrative system, I cannot see how the chief executive officer in the new health region could be expected to have the personal knowledge of not merely the financial circumstances but the domestic, human and maybe psychological circumstances which very often enter into the determination of the eligibility of an applicant for a medical card.  In <Col N="2522" /> the system which has operated hitherto there was the closest relations between the public representatives and the health authorities.  I can say from my ten years experience of dealing with the Limerick Health Authority that the officials were people who had a thorough knowledge of local problems, who understood the domestic and other circumstances of applicants.  The officials were prepared to discuss the matter with public representatives and invariably interpreted the health regulations according to the spirit rather than the strict letter of the Act.</P>
    <P>The laying down of well-defined criteria is now absolutely essential. Seeing that the Minister is a man who, when he has given an undertaking in this House, has invariably honoured that undertaking, I do not know what has happened in this case.  Perhaps it is a further indication of the topsy turvy Government we have had in this country particularly over the last year and a half, who make a decision today and reverse it tomorrow.  Even at this late stage I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  While we still have this medical card system, which I condemn, it is vitally important that the Minister would enable the new regional health boards to ensure that the question of eligibility for medical cards would be looked at equitably and realistically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies have mentioned the lack of uniformity in the granting of medical cards.  This has been brought before the Minister on several occasions in the past year or two, and it is regrettable that we are still as far as we were two or three years ago from getting a national scheme under which all of us here could understand the principles on which the eligibility of applicants for medical cards is decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had with me last night in my own constituency clinic a lady who had a liver complaint, whose husband was a cancer patient and who has one daughter working.  They were involved in very heavy expenditure and, while they did get some help towards the supply of tablets which were needed by herself and her husband, because the daughter was working the medical <Col N="2523" /> card had been withdrawn.  She explained that it would be necessary to send for the doctor at various times during the week and even though her husband was in a serious condition she was very reluctant to call the doctor because of the expense involved. I am sure other Deputies could cite cases from their own experience in which similar hardship is involved whereby people must make a choice between saving the expense involved and meeting the gravity of the illness of the relative and must very often decide that they cannot call in medical advice because of the cost involved.  It is regrettable that such a situation should prevail in our State in the year 1971.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell referred to the disparity in the number of people entitled to medical cards in one area as compared with another.  Quoting from columns 2209, volume 225, of the Official Report of 21st July, 1971, he referred to information he got in reply to a question in relation to variations in the numbers of medical cards given. The reply gave him the information that in the Eastern Health Board 14.7 per cent of the population are in receipt of medical cards; in Wicklow it is 34.2 per cent; in Dublin, 12.3 per cent; Kildare, 26.2 per cent; and he remarked that in the Minister's own county of Monaghan it is 41.9 per cent; in Meath, 35.3 per cent and so on.  There seems to be no acceptable national standard to decide eligibility. The result is that many people consider it necessary to go to this Deputy or that Deputy in order to get what they are entitled to.  I am sure I speak for most Deputies in saying I look forward to the day when people will get their rights under the health system as citizens without the necessity of invoking the aid of any political ideology. The Minister promised he would do something before now but we still await standardisation in respect of eligibility.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned that the £1,600 ceiling does not, in modern industrial conditions, adequately cover people who would need medical assistance. I accept that we have to temper <Col N="2524" /> to some extent the defective system we have by this compromise where if necessary we at least give some assistance towards the cost of drugs where the financial position of the person needing help, according to the interpretation of the local health authority, seems to be over the ceiling.  The ceiling of £1,600 is inadequate.  It does not guarantee that we would bring within the safety net of the health services all those people who need help.  An industrial worker might depend on his employer to provide a stretch of overtime.  This overtime might not recur each year, but such a worker might earn over £1,600 in overtime conditions.</P>
    <P>The nature of an illness should be taken into account.  The cost of such illness should be examined.  I cannot understand why the lady I mentioned has given all this information to the health authority.  If I write to the health authority I would presumably be repeating the information which she has given and has already furnished to them.  I am pretty confident that she should be assisted by the health authority to a greater extent than she is now assisted.  I cannot understand why assistance should not be given to her.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies may have experience of the fact that a letter with a title at the end of it apparently changes a case from one which does not require assistance to one which makes the person involved eligible.  We would go a long way towards the elimination of the mystery in regard to eligibility if we laid down definite standards which all involved may understand&mdash;representatives as well as those requiring assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister's present proposals are an alteration of the regulations.  It seems a pity that we cannot do more at this stage with regard to our health system.  The Minister appears reasonably happy that the bodies which he has set up to administer the regulations will be more satisfactory than the old local authority system.  The Minister may be right, but I have heard people say that they feared the lack of connection between these larger authorities and the ordinary people, and that the <Col N="2525" /> number of vocational interests from the medical profession which are involved may result in more tenuous contact than the old system had.  The members of the old local authorities had close connections with the community they served.  It is open to doubt whether the same can be said of the new larger authority.  The old authority kept in close touch with the area served.  When we depart from the elective system, as we apparently have departed, when we consider the majority make-up of these new authorities, one certainty is that we will run into a great deal of community opposition of one kind or another even where there is an improvement in the service of the area concerned.  A hospital might have greater rationalisation and the patients might get better service in a central hospital complex but the ignoring of the elective principle in the make-up of the new authority may result in great opposition even though the Minister's motives may be the best.  I am not suggesting that there was a better authority under the old system but I am expressing a word of caution in relation to this matter and saying that unless the elective principle in such bodies is acknowledged then whatever improvements may result from the larger-sized authority must be weighed against the resulting lack of contact in the areas served.  It is a pity when the Minister has shown such energy in reorganising the areas to be administered that he has shown such lethargy in attacking the main faults of the service, which speakers closely connected with the problems have drawn attention to down through the years.  Deputy Dr. Byrne and others have called attention repeatedly to the unfair features of the old system.  So long as we have people who must make the harsh choice between the need they or their relations have for medical treatment and the cost involved the problems remain, and we cannot say that we have a health service that we can be proud of.</P>
    <P>Many of us are acquainted with the conditions in Britain and the north. We know that whatever the faults of the socialism which is so often attacked from the benches opposite the services inaugurated by &ldquo;Nye&rdquo; Bevan have made fantastic changes in the lives of <Col N="2526" /> our fellow-Irishmen in Northern Ireland and in Britain.  It is a great pity that a country which boasts so much of its former Christianity seems incapable of bringing any of this theoretical belief in Christianity into practical effect.  It is a great tragedy that Deputies must listen to cases, such as I have listened to recently, of people having to come to a Deputy to claim what should be their ordinary rights.</P>
    <P>I cannot congratulate the Minister on this regulatory change here nor can he in conscience blame the House for discussing what he might regard as irrelevant tangents.  So long as the main features in the health services continue as they do and so long as the Minister evades his central duty as Minister of Health all Deputies must take every opportunity of bringing home to him and his advisers their total dissatisfaction with the health service as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to make some general observations on the impact of the medical service relating to full eligibility and limited eligibility in past times.  The whole community of this country is from 50 per cent to 60 per cent better off in real terms than they were ten years ago.  Nobody can dispute that.  There are pockets of poverty which have to be eliminated. No one suggests that the social problems have been solved, but it is interesting to note that in spite of the great improvements the numbers in the limited eligibility and full eligibility groups have not markedly changed.  In other words, within the community which has become more prosperous there are 30 per cent in the full eligibility group and 60 per cent in the limited eligibility group.  In so far as objections have been made in this House to the concept of limited eligibility&mdash;they were made to some extent by Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;all I can say is that we have a long way to go in improving the health services.  We have also to keep up with the advancing techniques which can be seen here and in other countries.  The World Health Organisation figures for the general health conditions in this country show that a great deal of what Deputy Dr. <Col N="2527" /> Browne said is grossly exaggerated. The health statistics provided by WHO leave us among the top ten or 15 nations.  That does not mean we should be complacent because in every country as in ours there are defects, deficiencies and inadequacies in the health service.  They vary from one country to another.  We have a great deal of work to do to improve the services. Nevertheless, I thought I had better make that observation at the outset.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I ought to say I have no evidence in my Department that there are large numbers of persons suffering from illness because, being in the limited eligibility group, they cannot afford to go to the doctor.  This is partly due to the fact that the hardship clause in regard to medical card provision operates in the marginal area between those on full eligibility and those on limited eligibility.  Were it not for that I would not be able to make that statement.  The application of the hardship rule does make a very considerable difference in this marginal area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make clear to the House that there is no suggestion that the creation of regional health boards should have the effect of centralising those health services which are naturally decentralised services.  Deputies and other persons will be able to appeal to the officers who are delegated to look after medical cards in local areas.  They will not have to go to the chief executive officer who will have to rely on the opinions of officers delegated by him, staff officers or superintendent assistants officers.  The idea that in enlarging the health administration area I was going to appoint some kind of maharajah at the head of each health board who would be utterly out of touch with people in local areas is completely false.  I have made absolutely clear in all my descriptions of the health board that on the one hand there is an inevitable concentration of hospital facilities and a reorganisation of hospital facilities and on the other there is the growth of decentralised services such as the <Col N="2528" /> public health service, and the operation of the medical card group in which the structure of the administration of the health board will be such that nobody will be able to say in the future that people's individual rights and problems will be ignored because of the enlargement of the health board. That is one promise I can make without any fear partly because those members of the health board who read the McKinsey Report could find no evidence in it that this firm of consultants was trying to centralise everything. In fact, in the detailed reports it was made perfectly clear that there would be a properly graded structure of officers within the health board providing better opportunities for promotion and providing at the top people whose qualification would be better than they had been up to now and that there would at the same time be very adequate local administration.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism about the income limit of £1,600.  The hardship arrangement has been operating in the case of persons with large families whose income is just above £1,600 and it will continue to operate in relation to people in the marginal group between limited eligibility group and the upper income group.  The figure of £1,600 was based on a decision made by the Government looking at the changes in the cost of living over various periods.  In 1953 the limited eligibility maximum was £800; in 1966 it needed only to be raised to £1,000 but was, in fact, raised to £1,200.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>To keep the standard of living the same.  In 1952 the figure of £600 was the upper limit, whereas in 1971 the figure should have been £1,400 but has, in fact, been made £1,600.  On can argue at what point one should take a decision to make an allowance for the cost of living increase but I do not think there is anything inequitable in striking a figure of £1,600 at the present time.  In the case of farmers where the upper limit is a £60 valuation, I want to make it <Col N="2529" /> clear to the House that if the very few farmers in the country who have very highly rated buildings feel they are being deprived of limited eligibility, because with the valuation of their buildings being included with the land valuation they are comparatively small farmers, and if they can prove that their income is less than £1,600, they can remain in the limited eligibility group and this is absolutely definite.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I was thinking back on the questions I have been asked in the Dáil debates in which I have taken part and very little mention has been made up to now of farmers with highly rated buildings.  As far as I am concerned this question has not arisen until the present debate.  I want to make it clear that if farmers in that special position can prove their incomes are not in excess of £1,600 by indicating their general means the fact that their buildings are highly valued can be taken into account in relation to their applicability in relation to the limited eligibility group.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully asked if overtime is excluded in relation to the limited eligibility group.  The regulations in relation to income based on the income tax code apply to self-employed persons, insured persons are assessed by Social Welfare and we will accept whatever have been their rules in that regard.  I have not had any complaints and I do not think my predecessor received complaints in relation to the former upper limits that Social Welfare were not making allowance for perpetual and continual overtime or that their decisions as to where to limit the Social Welfare class were inequitable. In any event, we propose to accept their rules in future, whatever they are at present in regard to overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully also mentioned that the applicant must produce a certificate of tax free allowances.  The evidence of eligibility in the future for self-employed persons will be either (a) the possession of a medical card or (b) having paid the contributions required under the Health Contributions Bill.  This will be a receipt from the <Col N="2530" /> Revenue Commissioners of the amount of contributions required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also referred to self-employed persons who work casually for employers.  In such a case the employer would presumably have to stamp a social welfare card for the week in which the man was employed.  This stamp would entitle the person to limited eligibility irrespective of the amount of his income from self-employment. These people would be in rather an unusual and, perhaps, more privileged position than others but I imagine there would not be very many of them.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a little more about this whole question of the limited eligibility group.  Not many Deputies said that people in this group could be classified as poor people although a number of Deputies did seem to speak in this way.  The fact is that in relation to taxing anyone else in the community in order to provide more services for the limited eligibility group, we cannot tax the 30 per cent who have full eligibility and neither could we ask the 10 per cent of those who pay for most of their health services, with certain exceptions, to pay increased taxation.  I have indicated to the House already that the rates of taxation for the upper 10 per cent compared very much with those than can be found abroad.  I have not had any proof that the 60 per cent group are persons who are mistreated because of limited eligibility, allowing for the special services made available to them at present and which will be made available in the future.</P>
    <P>May I remind the House that, first, there is the actual hardship clause for persons in this category and, secondly, that the Vote from my Department towards drugs for the limited eligibility group is of the order this year of between £250,000 and £280,000.  This is matched proportionately with a rate contribution.  Outpatient fees were abolished as and from the 1st April and I shall be introducing regulations for free drugs for adults of all income groups and free drugs and hospital treatment for young persons of all income groups in respect of special <Col N="2531" /> disabilities, a list of which will be published with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Later, we hope, as time goes on, to devise a system which is provided for in the Health Act whereby we might, if we can find the financial resources, arrange to pay for drugs costing more than a certain figure for those in the middle income group.  That is something about which I can make no absolute promise but it is on the list of improvements in the service that I should like to undertake.  However, as the House is aware, there have been very considerable improvements in the health services during the past two years.  For example, there has been the child health scheme which, I am glad to say, is proving successful.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of varying percentages of people in different areas who receive medical cards.  Of course, the reasons for this are numerous.  For instance, some countries may have more low income group people as a percentage of the total number of people in the county than others.  Unquestionably, standards differ to some extent as between one county and another.  It is true, equally, that in certain counties a certain number of people may not get medical cards until such time as they require them and occasionally one will find persons paying a private doctor and who do not obtain a medical card unless they require hospital treatment.  Pay increases, too, change the numbers on the roll of the medical card list and there may be some different applications in different counties in regard to the hardship clause.  All these factors affect the percentage of persons receiving medical cards.  During the debate I heard observations in relation to the position in Dublin where, compared with other areas, a rather small number of persons receive medical cards.  This may be due to a difference in standard but I would refer those Deputies who spoke on this matter to a comment by Deputy Garret FitzGerald in today's issue of the <i>Irish Times</i> in which he says:</P>
    <P>There are almost as many low-income families in the small towns <Col N="2532" /> and villages of Ireland as in Dublin &mdash;although these smaller centres have barely one-third of Dublin's population.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald, who is a clever statistical analyst, apparently sees a reason for the comparatively low percentage of persons in Dublin who receive medical cards.</P>

      <P>I shall deal now with the observations made about the alleged corruption and Tammany Hall activity by the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to assisting or helping people to procure medical cards.  This is ridiculous talk.  I have been in politics long enough to know that if TDs of any party can bring evidence to bear when speaking to officials of county councils that a person should receive a medical card, the officers of those county councils are sufficiently honest to pay attention to parties of all political complexions.  Does anybody here deny that?  Was Deputy Oliver Flanagan speaking the truth when he suggested that Fianna Fáil could win elections because of the issuing of medical cards?  Certainly medical cards have not been mentioned to me in the context of a live issue in any constituency that I have represented since 1938.  There may be some individual cases in some areas where this matter is being raised by someone and where this suggestion can be made but I have no knowledge of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan and others have been insulting the intelligence and decency of people in suggesting that Fianna Fáil have retained office by reason of the enormous influence they can assert on local authorities in relation to the procurement of medical cards.  Is not everybody aware that the vast majority of medical cards are awarded by the officers of local authorities without any intervention whatever or, if there is intervention, it is totally unnecessary and that most of the cases in which TDs, in my view, <Col N="2533" /> intervene rightly&mdash;these include TDs from all political parties&mdash;and in which county councillors and the clergy intervene are in respect of hardship cases that never could be put down in the form of written standards either by the CEOs or by me as Minister? Is not everybody aware that no matter what system of public standards we have there will always be a considerable number of hardship cases in which officers operating on a health board may not know all the circumstances of a particular family?  Do I have to tell Members of the Dáil that one of the reasons why TDs, county councillors and others are able to obtain help for constituents is because the constituents themselves do not know how to put their case in the best way?  Deputies, in particular, are skilled in how best to present a case. They extract all the information and present it in as forceful a manner as possible.  I see no harm in that.  I regard it as one of the privileges of democracy. I do not see how we could change that system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it operates here and in other countries where there is an element of hardship and there is hardly a case where rules could be prescribed so rigidly that there would not be hardship cases.  As Deputies know, there can even be hardship cases in relation to matters such as land project grants or farm building grants where an inspector may have wrongfully judged or undervalued the work performed.  Are we not all aware that this goes on and is it not inevitable in a democracy?  One could not prescribe a national system of standards in which there would not be a hardship element.</P>

      <P>I do not believe this talk of corruption and if Deputies boast too loudly about the medical cards that they can obtain and if they do it too professionally in the sense that they claim credit for getting medical <Col N="2534" /> cards that would have been got anyway, that is merely a weakness of human nature and I can do nothing about it.  I would hope that in the year 1971 when the people are far more highly educated than they used be, few Deputies would imagine that in the long run they could gain votes by that method.</P>
      <P>Maybe I have too much faith in the common sense of the Irish people but I believe that the majority of people are aware of the position, particularly in cases where people are fully entitled to a grant or a service, and I would hope that Deputies would not exploit the position.  I do not believe that many of them do.  In relation to hardship cases there will, quite inevitably, continue to be intervention.</P>
      <P>In relation to the medical card service there is one fact which has not been fully appreciated by the House and which, I think, I ought to mention. That is that the number of those receiving medical cards has gone down by about 6 per cent in the last four years.  I think this is due partly to the growth in prosperity, but it is not being accompanied by any tremendous questioning in this House.  Nobody seems to have noticed this.  I merely mention it in passing to show that there can be a 6 per cent reduction in the number of medical cards in the country.  It still remains at roughly 30 per cent of the whole population.  I mention this in passing to illustrate that these changes can take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the chief executive officers to come together and to establish a consistent standard for medical cards, excluding the inevitable hardship element.  I will ask the CEOs to publish those standards, if that is any help to the House.  That answers some of the criticism made that up to now nobody seemed to know what the standards were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, it is true, a great deal of information collected in my Department, but I felt very strongly that it would be extremely difficult for me to comprehend the whole of the variations that take place in the different <Col N="2535" /> areas.  The CEOs will take advice from all the persons in the counties who were formerly members of the county health authorities, and who are steeped in local information, in order to arrive at a consistent standard for medical cards.  Quite obviously the CEOs themselves, those of them who are inexperienced in this work, could not do it; but they will not only have the information from my Department, but they will be able to get information from the local offices and I hope that they will do a good job.  I will be responsible for their job.  If they do a bad job it will be I who will have to face the Dáil and the public.  I can only hope that their job will be successfully concluded and I am quite certain that the standards should be published.</P>
    <P>May I make it perfectly clear that there are bound to be some changes as between one county and another when the standards are published because there are variations in different areas.  I have made it clear to the CEOs that I do not expect to have an increased number of persons receive medical cards because I do not think that is necessary.  I have also made it clear to them that they should observe that clause in the Health Act which declares that when the head of a household and his wife are being examined for a medical card the incomes of those who are earning and who live with the head of the house and the spouse should not be taken into account in deciding whether the head of the house and the spouse should have a medical card.  That will have the effect, in some areas, of increasing the number of medical cards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the spouse's income will be assessed but not the earning members of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those will be two specific indications to chief executive officers, (1) that <Col N="2536" /> the total number should not increase and (2) the one I have just given about the income of the husband and the spouse in relation to their application for a medical card.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney suggested that there will be a reduction in the number of persons receiving medical cards because of the enormous cost of the choice of doctor arrangement.  That is untrue. The £600,000 odd will have to be found in any event and I have given absolutely no direction to anyone that the numbers of medical cards should be dramatically reduced in order that somehow or other £600,000 would be found from the medical card.  Departmental and local authority expenditure will provide for the choice of doctor principle.  The £600,000 will have to be found by those who pay taxes and rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned the question of a car that was essential to the business of someone.  I think some allowance is made for this by those who are in charge of these services already.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan suggested that under section 4 of the Local Government Act elected members could change a manager's decision on eligibility.  This is absolutely untrue.  Under section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, a local authority can direct a manager in the performance of many of his functions but the act specifically excludes, in section 4, any right to give directions on applicability of health services in individual cases.</P>
    <P>I should mention that 90 per cent of the farmers of this country are under £60 valuation.  I think when that is appreciated by the House they will realise that a very large number of farmers are covered either by medical cards or by limited eligibility services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney asked whether the CEO will have authority to go to the inspector of taxes for confirmation of a claim that a person has limited eligibility.  This, he suggested, would conflict with the confidentiality of the income tax code.  The CEO will not do this.  In practice, the Revenue Commissioners would have assessed income for the purpose of collecting contributions <Col N="2537" /> under the Bill and the applicant would have evidence of paying the contribution.  This would satisfy the health board as to eligibility and the board would not have to make further detailed inquiry.  Deputy Cooney also suggested that the fact that the income in the preceding tax year was taken into account would cause hardship if the current year's income was less.  The Revenue Commissioners do have to relate their calculations to the preceding tax year's income but in any case where income subsequently fell this could be dealt with by the hardship provisions, section 46 (8) of the Health Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fox made a point about farmers who have low land valuation and high valuations of buildings.  He referred specifically to County Monaghan, which I represent.  Only 596 farmers in County Monaghan are over £50 valuation and we might say that 400 of these are over £60.  There are something like 6,500 farmers in Monaghan.  This is about 6 per cent of all Monaghan farmers.  It is only in the case of a fraction of the 400 that there is a possibility of the unusual case referred to by Deputies, namely, a very high building valuation.  I think I have already dealt with that and pointed out that it is up to farmers to prove that they earn less than £1,600 if they feel that the valuation is not to their advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond and others referred to an appeals system in relation to <Col N="2538" /> decisions on medical cards.  In fact, this is provided for in section 47 of the Health Act, 1970, and regulations will be made under that providing for appeal, probably to the CEO.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond complained that employers might refuse to provide evidence of earnings for decisions on medical cards.  There is no provision in the law compelling them to do so.  This matter has been raised only in this debate and if there were evidence of widespread refusal by employers to provide this evidence, which could not be overcome otherwise&mdash;for example, by legitimate union action&mdash;it would be necessary to consider this point in future legislation.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered every question put to me during the course of this debate.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last week I had only had time to deal with two aspects of the debate up to that point: one was the reference persistently made by members of the Government party to the boycott of the South African rugby match by the anti-Apartheid Association and the attempts those on the Government benches made to draw an analogy between that boycott and the persuasive efforts made by members of the anti-Apartheid Association to get the Press to apply a similar boycott to the match.  I dealt with the attempt of those on the Government benches to draw an analogy between this totally voluntary request by the anti-Apartheid Association and the design expressed in this Bill providing for the prosecuting of the Press for reporting, commenting upon, airing or giving the freedom of the Press to those who encourage or advocate the commission of an offence under sections 2 and 3 of this Bill, whatever &ldquo;encourage or advocate&rdquo; means.  I trust that I adequately established the distinction between the persuasive attempts made by those to whom the South African regime is loathsome and the unacceptable and the fascistic style of Press muzzling envisaged in this Bill.  I think I made that distinction satisfactorily to any reasonably minded person.  I am sure I did not make it adequately to the Minister, as the Minister, if I may say so&mdash;and I do not often indulge in personalities in this House&mdash;in a characteristically petulant letter to the national Press over the weekend demonstrated that he remains obdurate in his refusal to concede&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Every word of it was, to all intents and purposes, untrue.  The point the Minister missed in that letter was this: he implied that the amendments put before this House by Deputy Cooney and Deputy Fitzpatrick and the comparable amendment put forward as amendment No. 10 by Deputy Pattison and Deputy Desmond, seek to make a distinction between journalistic freedom of expression either in the Press or on television and the freedom of expression of the man in the street at the street corner.  Certainly, some distinction is made in these amendments but they are simply an attempt to rescue journalistic freedom from the blanket application of section 4 against comments or advocacy of this kind.  Certainly&mdash;I know I speak for myself&mdash;if the amendment could go further and involve the total deletion of the section in question I am sure everybody in these benches would be extremely happy and Deputies Fitzpatrick and Cooney would be equally happy if the section <i>in toto</i> were withdrawn.  The amendment put forward simply seeks to ameliorate an almost unamendably dictatorial section and it should be viewed in that constructive way and, as I shall have occasion to mention later, as the official newspaper of the Minister's own party views it.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to make is that the Minister is seeking here to limit not merely action, the action of squatting, for example.  This I could understand though not necessarily in every instance approve.  What the Minister is seeking to inhibit here is the expression of opinions.  This, I respectfully suggest, is a qualitatively different thing to attempt to do, an attempt to limit journalistic expression on radio or television, the expression of opinion.</P>

It seems to me&mdash;and this point arose in an exchange between the Minister and Deputy Dr. Byrne&mdash;that if I in this House say, as I intend to say in about ten minutes, that in certain circumstances people should be encouraged to squat, and I am free to do so, and then go outside the gates into Kildare Street and say it again I become instantly liable to prosecution under this Act.  I do not even have to name a specific person who should squat, as it is crudely called; all I need do is say that, in the circumstances&mdash;the Minister is a lawyer and I am not&mdash;on the public street or on television or in the Press, if it is not exempt, that I advocate under certain circumstances the commission of what the Minister calls an offence to become instantly liable to prosecution.

      <P>In what circumstances? This Bill will be a lawyers' delight; I can see that.  The Minister does not seem to be friendly to very many people but he certainly does appear to be friendly towards the Bar. I revert to my point that what the Minister is trying to do is not simply inhibit action but actively to prevent expressions of opinion or advice or, as he calls it, encouragement.  The expression of free opinions is one of the oldest buttresses of democracy everywhere.  People express opinions which are at odds with the law; they express opinions and encourage actions which are at odds with our own tastes or verbal or mental preferences.  One of the oldest traditions of democracy is that at least they are permitted to be heard.</P>
      <P>Much reference has been made here to the fact that one of the most historic advocates of forcible entry and occupation in this country was the late Patrick Pearse.  Trinity College, of which I am a Fellow, in one of the less attractive episodes in its history on one occasion forbade the entry of Patrick Pearse to address a meeting of the Gaelic Society in Trinity College. The then Provost, Dr. Mahaffy, referred to what he called &ldquo;the man called Pearse&rdquo; and said in effect that no platform would be offered to this man so long as he was Provost of Trinity College.  Pearse consequently was not heard within the walls.  Most of us today in Trinity generally accept that this was a shameful occurrence in our history.  Yet, this is precisely what the Minister is seeking to do, to prevent, not an action, but the simple verbal advocacy of a certain point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, I had occasion to mention the great English philosopher, John Stuart Mill.  The Minister unfortunately, and I can understand that he must be undergoing considerable physical stress in connection with this <Col N="2544" /> Bill, was not present to hear my philosophical contributions and so I am happy that now before one of the Parliamentary Secretaries takes his place, I shall have the pleasure of reiterating some of the arguments I made then on the Second Reading which are specifically relevant to this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think that any member of the O'Malley family has in recent years suffered from any considerable disadvantage.  I would remind the Minister that the Irish, if these benches are guilty of obstruction&mdash;which I deny&mdash;have the honourable record of having invented the art form and that it is safe to praise it at 90 years removed but, apparently, unpalatable to have to endure it in a green Tory State.  I would remind the Minister of the words of Parnell to Butt when Butt complained that Parnell's actions were incurring the odium of the English.  Parnell replied: &ldquo;The day the English start liking what I say I shall consult my conscience.&rdquo; The day the Minister starts being impressed by what I say I shall seriously have to consult not merely my conscience but my confessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John Stuart Mill in &ldquo;On Liberty&rdquo; laid down a number of tests for the <Col N="2545" /> preservation of liberty in a community. These tests revolved largely around the concept of freedom of expression, the greatest single buttress of democracy. They are summed up in a number of great epigrams of Mills such as: &ldquo;All mankind has not the right to silence one dissenter.&rdquo;  If there was only one person in a State who held a contrary view to all the others in the State, that man had a right of freedom of expression of his opinion, not perhaps to action or to revolution or to violence but at least to the expression of his opinion.  Looking with the eye of the practised scholar at categories of human intellectual activity for which the Minister has such predictable contempt. More, realising how much society had changed its opinions about matters of ethics, law, morality and sociology in the 2,000 years since the birth of Christ, argued that every opinion, even the orthodox one, should be subjected to constant challenge because, he said, even if it was a right opinion, it was unlikely that it contained all truth and its collision with another opinion might, perhaps, lead it nearer truth and that even if in turn it was to be seen that it possessed all rectitude and all truth, unless it was opposed by the continuous battering and opposition of contrary opinions then that orthodox opinion would harden into an ossified sacred cow which was accepted in ritual rather than intellectually.  On the basis of this he distinguished between self and other regarding actions in the world of morality and law and, while setting his face against those actions which were physically hurtful to other people, insisted upon the retention of the right to express a point of view no matter how unpopular.</P>
    <P>This is a tradition as old as Savonarola, as old as Socrates, as old as Sir Thomas More.  It is a tradition which was maintained as recently as 1914-16 by the then Chief Secretary in this country Augustine Birrell who, in fact, treated the manoeuvrings, the marches and the speeches of the volunteers with a greater degree of tolerance and acceptance than the Minister is prepared to treat the expression of opinion hostile to this Bill 60 years later.</P>
    <P>The Minister objects to the continuous use from these benches of the <Col N="2546" /> word &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; to describe his Bill but listening to some of his own most ardent supporters I could not help feeling how valid this expression was. Deputy Carter, for example, spoke of statements which could be harmful to to the State.  &ldquo;Harmful to the State&rdquo;&mdash; what a horrible phrase, evocative of the Germany of the 30s and of the Eastern European countries of the 50s and to some extent the present day.  &ldquo;Harmful to the State&rdquo;.  What is wrong with expressing opinions harmful to the State?  What guarantee have we our laws, ethics and institutions are impermeable and here for all time?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows much more about law than I do.  I wonder if he knows as much about the history of the freedom of the Press both in remote times and in more immediately proximate times in this House.  Replying to Deputy Byrne he made a facile, if correct, distinction between the privileged reporting of debates in this House and the reporting of statements made outside it.  I wonder if he knows with what great difficulty a man called Hansard secured this same freedom, privilege, of reporting the proceedings of the House of Commons in England on which, let us face it, we largely model ourselves, how in a series of libel actions relating to Sir John Wilkes, he established the principle of what was said and leased in Parliament was sacrosanct.  That principle was broadened in both countries, both England and Ireland.  In fact&mdash;and this is not totally irrelevant&mdash;up to relatively recent times, up to about 50 years ago, the Minister may know, the laws of libel were greatly more relaxed than they are today, so that newspaper comment, for example, at the time of the Parnell and Dilke divorce cases was a great deal freer than it is today and political invective in the hands of someone like Tim Healy in the columns of <i>The Nation</i> was permitted much greater play.  In the two centuries in which the freedom of the Press was traditionally won Ireland played an honourable role in asserting this principle. There were many famous newspapers in this country which have challenged orthodoxy, authority, and most times have got away with it and when they have not got away with it <Col N="2547" /> have been involved in some cataclysmic upsurge which has affected our nation's history.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the editor of <i>The Nation</i>, I wonder what Davis, what Gavan Duffy, would think of this particular piece of prescription.  I wonder what Lady Wilde, who wrote under the name of Speranza, the article that precipitated the 1848 Revolution&mdash;<i>Alea jacta Est</i>&mdash; and was not prosecuted at that time for it by the British Government, more tolerant of dissent than our contemporary Irish Government are, would think of this present legislation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Press.</P>
    <P>I wonder what would be the view of the editors of <i>The Irishman</i> of <i>The Irish Felon</i>, of <i>An Phoblacht</i>, of <i>The Workers Republic, The Irish Worker</i>&mdash;a whole catalogue of papers which sold in the streets of Dublin for 1d and gave some hope, confidence, to people who were being told, as this Government are telling certain sections of the community today, that they were outsiders, beyond the Pale, because their views were not acceptable to the then Ministers.  The people who in 1913 passed from hand to hand the writings of Larkin and Connolly in <i>The Workers Republic</i> to buttress them up against the hunger and starvation, deprivation imposed on them by an alien capitalist regime&mdash;I wonder what they must be thinking now, wherever they are, of a regime which, thanks to their blood and their sweat and their sorrow, exists with the legal force to introduce legislation to prevent a journalist, a commentator or, indeed, a politician outside this House from expressing his point of view if that point of view differs from that of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne a second ago said that we do not trust <Col N="2549" /> the motives of the Minister in this. This is perfectly correct.  By a happy coincidence he brings me on to the next point I want to make and I trust I am in order in making it.  What we have here is a gap in credibility between Opposition and Government. The Minister insists that nothing is intended in this section 4 beyond the operation of what is, effectively speaking, the present law.  The Opposition in turn insists that an attempt is being made here to muzzle the Press and television.  At this point I bring to the evidence against the Government on this Bill and on this section in particular a special knowledge and a special experience, which qualifies me perhaps to speak about the maintenance of journalistic standards of freedom in the face of acceptable or unacceptable legal restrictions with an experience not shared by anyone else except Deputy Keating and of course Deputy Major de Valera, who presumably is the author of this morning's editorial to which the Minister takes such exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For three of the most enjoyable years of my life I was permitted by accident to play a central part in the formulation of the current affairs policy in broadcasting in this country. This experience has left me with an insight into the attitude of the Government towards the communications media which entitles me, I think, to comment on the credibility gap between the two sides of the House here today.  In 1966 I was hired to take the chair in what was perhaps the first infant, thrusting experiment, unrestrained in unbridled discussion of political affairs, a programme called &ldquo;Division&rdquo;.  In the three succeeding years I worked with a man, younger than I, who can I think be fairly called without rival the architect of whatever freedom of expression exists in political journalism in this country, Muiris MacCongail, a young man who has now, after five years, resigned from the editorship of &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, a resignation, which on the one hand permits me to speak a little more freely than I would otherwise do, a resignation which, cumulatively with these other actions of the Government, makes me <Col N="2550" /> wonder if perhaps the freedom achieved in those short years is about to be lost.</P>
    <P>I fear in this Bill, in regard to journalistic freedom, not the direct legal provisions made here so much as the innuendo, the threat of the big stick which will hang over every television producer and newspaper editor if this section goes through.  What do I mean by that?  I mean that the Irish way of doing things, if I may put it that way, is not to bring the full force of the law down with sledge hammer effect on such an editor or such a producer but rather by the subtle use of innuendo, the implied threat, the guarded remark across the luncheon table or on the telephone, to induce in such a producer or such an editor such a degree of nervousness that any kind of freewheeling aggressive journalism becomes impossible in his junior staff, becomes censored at source.  It is the censorship at source I fear and it is Bills like this, which hold the big stick over editors and producers, which would bring about that censorship at source.</P>
    <P>I can remember well, when I was a relatively young, very nervous man in the presence of Fianna Fáil Ministers, that political broadcasting was nearly destroyed in Radio Telefís Éireann owing to the obduracy of not this Government but a previous model.  I remember one instance&mdash;it is relative to this section&mdash;when because in &ldquo;Division&rdquo; it was felt a discussion on agriculture necessitated the presence of the then president of the National Farmers' Association, Mr. Rickard Deasy, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Charles Haughey, refused to appear on the programme. The inference was made, never in writing but always on the telephone, by innuendo that in the absence of adequate Fianna Fáil representation on a specific programme that programme should not be permitted to be transmitted.</P>
    <P>This use of the big stick was resisted. It was resisted because the then Controller of Programmes, a Swede, Gunnar Rugheimer, was prepared to stand up to the Government and because this young man MacCongail <Col N="2551" /> was prepared to do the same.  For four months that programme continued to transmit its weekly editions without the presence of any member of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Government. This is something I admired deeply in the members of that programme at that time.  Ultimately that particular conflict was settled in precisely the characteristic, unwritten way that I am talking about in connection with the threats implicit in this Bill.  Some day I shall write the full history of this episode.  It was settled after four months during an all night meal in the Quo Vadis restaurant with myself, Mr. MacCongail, Deputy Haughey and two of his political colleagues.  Fianna Fáil consented once again to revert to participation in this relatively unimportant political programme.</P>
    <P>That is just one experience and oddly enough, as some Deputies in the House know, since I am psychologically averse to talking for talking's sake, I will not detain the House with many similar experiences which occurred during the next three years, experiences which show that any attempt at individual expression of opinion, fair critical comment by &ldquo;Division&rdquo; or &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; invariably ran into the hostility of the Government and the Government Whips.  I will not deal at length with the programmes which were either taken off, bowdlerised or fought through thanks only to the courage and resilience of one of the people taking part in them.</P>
    <P>I will not deal at length with the notorious Whips agreement which the Government thrust down the throats of Radio Telefís Éireann in 1966 by which the participation of an individual TD would not be allowed except with the prior sanction of the Whip. If you think about it, it is an odd situation; it is a restriction which would have made it impossible for George Browne to go on British radio and attack Harold Wilson over the Common Market, a position which would have made it impossible for Roy Jenkins to go on and do the same. The British, happily, have no such fears and on the whole, with some regrettable exceptions, permit their <Col N="2552" /> politicians and their commentators much greater licence than we are used to here.  In our case, with broadcasting still as it is today in its infancy, and indeed with sophisticated political comment in the newspapers relatively speaking, in its infancy, since it has only gone on for a decade, we stand in permanent danger of the ground that was won over the last five to ten years being taken back on us, the danger of going back to the situation where the function of the political journalist was either to praise and laud the Fianna Fáil Party or else to report political events with the detachment and dead pan lack of comment with which they would report a flower show.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into my whole career there, although some day I shall.  It is a career with unremitting hostility from the Government to the whole principle of journalistic freedom, a period of unremitting incapacity of the Government to understand what is constituted in the phrase &ldquo;journalistic integrity&rdquo;.  It is a concept to which I shall refer in a few moments.  Let me just say for the moment that in those years, when a TD was relatively unmuzzled thanks to the courage of that young man, MacCongail, no bias followed from that freedom.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, the journalists associated with those programmes showed that almost invariably they could be relied on totally to maintain balance between different points of view.  Even I myself, a life-long socialist, can say with my hand on my heart that I never loaded a programme or an interview against one person as against another.  Indeed, before I ever joined the party of which I am now a member, the Leader of the party, Deputy Corish, during a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs some three years ago said that the roughest interview he had ever had or had even seen was one done by me.  I wonder if those on Government benches are capable of understanding that journalists can be trusted to that extent, and I call myself a journalist with some pride because during those three years I was to all intents and purposes a journalist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2553" /> What are the alternatives to this form of independent comment?  The alternative is to be found all over Western Europe.  They are not very happy.  They tend to come from countries we would not seek to emulate.  There is ORTF in France where the grip of the Gaullist and Pompidou Governments is so total that the jobs and livelihoods of the newscasters and commentators and interviewers are permanently in jeopardy unless they toe the official party line. Another solution, one which I think would appeal very much to the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;I am sure Deputy Collins, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has studied this&mdash;is the solution of the Italian television service.  If a strike takes place and there is a police baton charge and some heads are broken the television commentators are entitled to inform the public that the strike took place, that there was a baton charge on such a day and at such a time and that a certain number of people on both sides were injured.</P>

      <P>Since Deputy Browne was so good as to provide me with an audience which was already dwindling I do not wish to deprive them of losing the chain of reason which I was so carefully working out here, particularly seeing the Minister for Transport and Power here who has some experience of some of the incidents which I was adverting to in relation to the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme.  I felt I should place him in focus, as it were.  As I was saying about the Italian television service, the position is that one may simply report a fact.  One may report that a strike took place, or a death took place and that certain events followed from this but one may not make any attempt at interpretation of the factors leading up to the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the wish of this Government that a similar situation should apply here?  I think it is the wish of this Government that this should be the case, because they have shown this in many ways.  They have shown it in the constant perorations about journalistic licence made by Deputy Childers, the advocacy by Deputy Childers of the idea that newspaper reporters and television programmes should continually report good news.  It is a rather amusing thought.  They should rise in the morning and say the sun shone and that everything was fine in the Irish Republic.  I do not think the ambitions of Deputy Childers in this direction are fallen far short of by the present news division of RTE.  Every time I switch on the news I find that the Six Counties are &ldquo;in a state of chassis&rdquo; and that the Twenty-six Counties are in a state of beneficent tranquillity.  Every newscast begins with shots of beatings and riotings in Derry and Belfast, often not with the inclusion of mention that these were shot 24 hours earlier and bear no relation <Col N="2555" /> to what is being said on the news broadcast.</P>

The gentlemen on the Government benches should bear in mind that they may not always be on Government benches. Sitting on these benches, they might feel a little more sympathy with what I am saying than they are doing at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a promise, not a threat.  If it were coming from over there it would be a threat, not a promise.  I wonder if the cameras will be out in similar force and I wonder whether, if violence or anything of that sort happens at that march&mdash; please God it will not&mdash;it will find the top headlines in the news or if the docility to which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs seems to have already reduced, even without this Bill, some journalists will mean inevitably that the news will start with the information that it rained in Belfast today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is further evidence of the Government's attitude which frightens us in regard to this Bill.  I can mention the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; Tribunal.  I admit that in relation to that programme, speaking from experience as a journalist, devices were used which should not <Col N="2556" /> have been used.  It is perhaps inadmissible to use concealed cameras or concealed microphones.  It is arguably inadmissible, and I will give an argument here, to use simulated shots to reproduce actions which notoriously take place which could not possibly be photographed.  For that, the programme was perhaps correctly reprimanded. But surely&mdash;and this bears heavily on the accusations levelled at these benches that we sought that inquiry&mdash;the point at issue here were not the peccadilloes of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; team but the major social evil which existed in moneylending.  If journalistic licence as was used here to expose an evil had not been there I wonder how much opportunity Emil Zola would have got to rehabilitate Dreyfus under the kind of regime this Bill seeks to introduce? Had he been told he was over-emotional, that he was going too far, Dreyfus would have remained for the rest of his life on Devil's Island.  Surely an ounce of journalistic licence is less important in the scale of justice than a massive social injustice which causes people to live in misery.</P>
    <P>All these instances, these experiences of mine, cause me to doubt that this is a Government to which this power could possibly be committed.  I will inevitably be contradicted but I am absolutely certain that the view I express is shared by practically every journalist in this country.</P>
    <P>How, finally, can we evaluate the traditional attitude of the Government towards the Press and television?  The simplest way to solve this, to define this is to quote from the remarks of the former Taoiseach, the late Deputy Lemass, God be good to him; he was a man for whom I had the utmost admiration in many respects but whose views on television freedom I could not share.  In reply to a question in this House on 12th October, 1966 at column 1045, volume 224, of the Official Report the then Taoiseach said on behalf of the Government:</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Éireann was set up by the legislation as an instrument of public policy and as such is responsible to the Government.  The <Col N="2557" /> Government have over-all responsibility for its conduct and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
    <P>To this extent the Government reject the view that Radio Telefís Éireann should be, either generally or in regard to its current affairs and news programmes, completely independent of Government supervision. As a public institution supported by public funds and operating under statute, it has the duty, while maintaining impartiality between political Parties, to present programmes which inform the public regarding current affairs, to sustain public respect for the institutions of Government and, where appropriate, to assist public understanding of the policies enshrined in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  The Government will take such action by way of making representations or otherwise as may be necessary to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann does not deviate from the due performance of this duty.</P>
    <P>That reply was given on 12th October, 1966, in the very context of the same row with Deputy Haughey over the programme in which I was involved, <i>Division</i> about which I spoke a few moments ago.  The thinking which is represented in that statement can only be described as fascistic in the extreme. That sort of thinking and the kind of thinking enshrined in this Bill would send shivers down the spine of any newspaper editor or any television producer.</P>
    <P>Again I emphasise that what is involved in legislation of this kind is not the overt Government interference in public affairs programmes or newspaper journalism.  In my career in television I cannot recall where the prescribed formula for Government intervention in a case where a television presentation was considered to be less than detached, to be biased, was ever used.  It was never necessary for it to be used.  The other way, the way of innuendo, the sapping of the morale of the senior men, the producers and <Col N="2558" /> the editors, was sufficient.  The other way was sufficient: the reminding of young, idealistic television producers, people like Owen Harris, Seán Egan, Lelia Doolin, Jack Dowling, and now perhaps, for all I know, my old colleague, MacCongail that they were on short contracts, that they were in insecure positions, that they had building society mortgages on their houses, that they had wives and that they had children.  This is enough in any country to produce a degree of self-censorship which will ensure that the Government, having got their way by having the big stick in reserve, need never actually incur the odium of producing it in public.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because of debates like this which cause the Government's motives to be seen clearly by the public, that I delight in being and am proud to be part of the opposition which is being mounted from these benches to this shattering Bill.</P>
    <P>Again I turn to phrases used by Deputy Carter the other day when he spoke of things like &ldquo;fair or unfair comment&rdquo;.  Who is to determine what is fair or unfair comment?  The Government? If the Government were to determine this, fair comment would be solely that which was laudatory. Once every six months some emasculated representative of the Opposition would be brought on to jerk his head like a puppet and give sanction to what had been said before.  There is quite enough evidence that this is the line of Government thinking for me to be able to say that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter spoke of a situation in which the public were sufficiently informed.  &ldquo;Sufficiently informed&rdquo;, &ldquo;fair and unfair comment&rdquo;&mdash;these are phrases evocative only of Goebbels. Who is Deputy Carter to determine whether the public is sufficiently informed or not?  To me this section in particular is part of a creeping campaign against the freedom of the Press and television to which I have referred, a creeping campaign which is also expressed in the Commission of Inquiry, or whatever it is called, recently appointed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, into RTE, a Commission of Inquiry which will lead no <Col N="2559" /> doubt, to a restructuring of the 1961 Broadcasting Act to make it even worse and more repressive than it is at the moment.  It would suit the Minister better to be seeking to liberate television still further, to accept that nine or ten years experience, whatever it is, have acclimatised our people and our journalists to the utilisation of this medium to a point where they can be trusted to the extent that the BBC are trusted in England.  If for one moment I thought that this was the thinking of this Government I would support the commission appointed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and I would have far less trepidation about this section.</P>
    <P>However, everything I have said here, every experience I have had, every straw in the wind I have encountered, lead me to believe that all these measures, most specifically this section but not solely this section, are part of a creeping campaign against the whole idea of journalistic and television freedom.  Of course it will not work because even if television were reduced to the most emasculated of current affairs programmes and an endless stream of imported American comedies, that alone would have the effect of reminding people in this impoverished, emigration-torn Ireland of the high standard of living which exists in other countries; it would remind them of the freedom of expression of ideas which exists in countries like England and America; it would remind them of what they are being deprived of.  Television is the Pandora's box of our particular age.  The Government, having seen the lid opened between the years 1966 and 1969 much against their will, are now endeavouring to mount the impossible task of sitting on that lid and forcing it shut again.</P>
    <P>They will not succeed in doing this but in the process of attempting to do it they will break the careers and the hearts of the finest of our Irish journalists between the ages of 30 to 40 years.  Shame upon it for attempting to do so.  I have great confidence in the Irish press and television&mdash;if I said that outside the House the Minister might dispute it, and I would probably be subject to prosecution after this <Col N="2560" /> misbegotten Bill goes through the House&mdash;and the journalists and commentators in the four national dailies and also in the provincial Press.  I hope they will have the courage to infringe the conditions to which we are opposed here within one week of this Bill becoming law.  If they do this they will demonstrate to our so-called Irish Republican regime, as Irish Republicans demonstrated 50, 60, 100 years ago, that the jails even of a regime like this are not large enough to hold the dissentient if that dissentient is sufficiently numerous, sufficiently sincere and sufficiently honourable.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to a case of a woman in my constituency who has had an ileoechtomy.  This is a very unpleasant, painful operation requiring removal of the entire lower bowel and the living of a life of tremendous handicap thereafter.  This woman's husband is an alcoholic under treatment and she has two children.  She has tried to be rehoused but she cannot be rehoused because she has only two children. The corporation do not regard the family's medical evidence as adequate to justify rehousing.  If that woman said to me that she was going to squat somewhere, I could not find it in my conscience to tell her that that was a wrong, immoral, unethical, unlawful and unjust thing to do.  Would she be a criminal for having done so? Yes, and I presumably would be a criminal for having encouraged her to do it.  Would it not be better if the Government, as the <i>Irish Press</i> pointed out, devoted time to solving problems like that of housing rather than devoting time to muzzle the exponents of one form of solution to this problem?</P>
    <P>Earlier, the Minister for Justice, with a characteristic sneer, implied that opposition to this Bill was confined to these benches and to 200 or 400 of the usual Reds, Odd bods, Weirdies, <i>et cetera</i>.  Do the people on the benches opposite never read the newspapers?  From all corners of the country&mdash;the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>, the <i>Monaghan Argus</i>, the <i>Kerryman</i>&mdash;editorials have come out attacking this Bill.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> has denounced it.  The <i>Irish Times</i>, after what I must regard as a degree of equivocation about this Bill and a <Col N="2561" /> slight degree of satire towards the attempts of the Opposition to frustrate it, on 22nd July, came out with a denunciation of this Bill and of this section in particular.  Lo and behold, today the <i>Irish Press</i> managed by Deputy de Valera, bearer of the most honoured name in the entire traditional Fianna Fáil camp, perhaps the author of the editorial to which I intend to refer perhaps not, but in one way or another underwriting it, wrote as follows:</P>
    <P>Without going into legal niceties, it should have been possible before now to devise some formula of words whereby fair comment and reportage, be it pictorial or otherwise, on a matter of public interest would not be inhibited.  Some amendments of this nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the amendments at which the Minister for Justice jeers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>have been proposed and at the beginning of this, apparently final, passage of the Bill through the Dáil, these or some variant of them should be put into effect.</P>
    <P>We have some enormous problems confronting us, the deteriorating situation in the North is but one. Having the Dáil's time taken up with one easily alterable section of a Bill, whose retention is being fought for and against with the ferocity of a rearguard action in the field, will not help us to deal with these problems. Let us now have that suitable alteration and let us get on with the nation's business.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Justice not realise how isolated he is?  Has he given up reading his own party newspaper?</P>
    <P>I have very little more to say.  The point has been made in the past that perhaps the Deputies on these benches are insincere in defending journalistic freedom and that if they were placed in the same position as the Government they would behave in the same way as the present Government are behaving. It is a fair accusation.  All politicians are hypernaturally susceptible and sensitive people, and to them a good television programme or a good editorial is one which concurs with <Col N="2562" /> their own views.  I can assure those journalists who question the sincerity of people on these benches that I, as an ex-journalist, am sincere in saying that in no circumstances would I subscribe to the kind of inhibition on freedom of expression contained in this section.  In England, the testiness of the Labour Party in Opposition about the BBC is ridiculous, childish and unworthy of them.  The setting up of a Press and TV council is also childish and unworthy of them.  Under no circumstances would I associate myself with the same thing here.</P>
    <P>It is tactical for Fianna Fáil to blame the Press for the image of the Government and the image of Parliament. This does less than justice both to the integrity of the journalists and the intelligence of the Irish people.  If the image of this Parliament is low it is not from journalistic distortion of the facts.  The conduct of Parliament and of this Government in particular has been low during the past two years. Deputy Carter opposite and the Minister also spoke of the Irish &ldquo;captive audience&rdquo; who can be seduced by the 200 odd weirdies, <i>et cetera</i> who have infiltrated television and who are all dedicated to the Labour Party&mdash;of course, there are none of them in Fianna Fáil.  The Irish never showed any predilection for captivity in the past.  Every television set has a knob which can turn it off and the Irish are quite capable of using those knobs.</P>
    <P>Spokesmen for the Government have sought to make a distinction between the transmission of fact and the transmission of informed and presumably prejudiced comment.  Already in the context of Italian television I have made the point that this is meaningless. The late C.P. Scott, editor of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> for many years, said &ldquo;Comment is free and facts are sacred&rdquo;.  When the question was put to Muiris McCongail at the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; Tribunal whether or not be agreed with this statement, he answered that he had never been able to understand it.  I should like to say the same thing.  What is a fact and what is a comment?  How can any energetic, idealistic, journalist, either on television or in a newspaper, explore the motivation <Col N="2563" /> of a fact without a degree of comment? How can he simply say that an event occurred, that Michael Collins was shot, that war broke out, that Hitler died, without in some way setting this in the context of comment? A television station reduced to the reportage of fact would set the clock back five years to the days when &ldquo;Open House&rdquo;, I think it was called, was the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of political television in this country, a benevolent placid opportunity for TDs to express in carefully rationed segments of time, related to the strength of their party, their prepared opinion under the benevolent auspices of a neuter chairman. If that is what the Government seek, and I think it is, then indeed the lights are going out for journalistic freedom in this country.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to speak at any great length on this amendment. I intend to make one or two comments so that it may be possible for me to confirm the view I have that the pseudo-opposition to this Bill which we are getting here is not anything more than an attempt at filibustering and playing to the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a citizen and as a public representative there have been times over the years when I have had certain misgiving about what I saw reported in our daily newspapers and what I heard reported on radio and television.  Giving to journalists the integrity about which we have heard so much here I decided they were doing what they were entitled to do and what they felt was for the betterment of the people and in the best interests of journalism. I never questioned them on it and for that reason I should be accepted as one who has this respect for journalists about which other people speak, <Col N="2564" /> although their history may not be as good as mine.</P>
    <P>Because I speak after Deputy Thornley I wish to refer to the occasion when Deputy Thornley and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien set themselves up to indicate to the Press how, when and on what they should report.  I am not concerned with what agitated the minds or the consciences of the Deputies in question because the case they made today I can make tomorrow. It is rather extraordinary and quite paradoxical that the two Deputies, who are on record as having suggested that they would deny the right to any paper or a particular paper to report on that which journalistic integrity would have them report, now come before this House baring their hearts in the interests of and on behalf of what they claim is journalistic integrity.</P>
    <P>Admittedly they will make the case that, having regard to the special circumstances as they saw them, they saw fit to register this objection and to indicate what would happen if they were in office.  Deputy Thornley and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien are two rather influential members of the Labour Party and if Deputy Thornley says he would do in the Government what he is doing now then we must take a lead from what he did last year.  Would he in Government indicate to the Press what they should report on?  These are matters which indicate the insincerity of the case being made by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>As politicians we must be forever conscious of the Press.  We all like reportage and we all like favourable comment and as an indication of the faith, trust and confidence I have in our journalists I am prepared to take slight issue with them knowing they will not harm me because I exercise the freedom I have to comment on things honestly and truthfully in the same way as they themselves comment on them.  No one accepts that every journalist is the absolute in integrity. Everyone realises that a journalist might in the same way as a politician, a professional man or a labouring man offend occasionally.  This glorification of journalists is but an effort on the <Col N="2565" /> part of the people concerned to play to them in the hope that they will curry favour with them and get what all politicians hope for&mdash;better reportage.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition are as anxious as they lead us to believe in wanting to take over Government tomorrow why should they not be encouraging the downfall of this Government?  Why should they not encourage the Government to have on their conscience the fact that they introduced legislation which was unwelcomed by the people and which meant when the next election occurred that they would be in government?  I am convinced that the Members of the Labour Party and others who have spoken know quite well that this Bill is necessary and that the section we are discussing, which makes it an offence for any erring journalist to encourage, or incite other people to commit an offence is necessary also.  That is what we are discussing. We have had many references to various countries but there has been a careful avoidance of mentioning those socialist countries where the Press has no freedom.  England has been quoted where it suits to do so. This is the first time that I have heard a socialist at heart regard England as being the ideal socialist country. Apparently it suits to do so on this occasion and, no doubt, there will be other occasions when it will be suitable to cite some other country.</P>
    <P>In relation to squatting there is the difficulty of doing what might be popular as against what might be responsible.  I am as familiar as anybody else with the housing problem in Dublin and I have the same sympathy for any family who has not the accommodation they require.  In this context I am happy to take issue with Deputy Thornley in his reference to a lady in the constituency that both he and I represent who has two children but who cannot get a house.  Deputy Thornley spoke of a house being vacant beside this woman and, in conscience, he says he could not dissuade her from going into that vacant house.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is well aware that in Dublin there is a certain priority in the matter of housing.  He knows, too, that there is a certain regard to medical <Col N="2566" /> opinion.  A medical certificate indicating that a family are entitled to priority is taken into consideration in respect of that particular family so that they might be accommodated sooner than what we might call a healthy family.  Notwithstanding the fact that in Dublin there are many thousands awaiting to be accommodated, Deputy Thornley would indicate that he is prepared to take a person who may be at the end of the priority list and help him or her to get a house to which, in accordance with priority, somebody else is more entitled.  I am at a loss to understand how the Deputy could make such a suggestion because in so doing he is disregarding, among other things, the recommendations of the medical officer in Dublin city.  Again, this is the popular thing to say.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke also about television programmes and in particular about what he would consider to be the injustices that have occurred.  I must bear in mind that at some future date I might appear on a television programme and that, consequently, I should be boosting up the gentlemen responsible for these programmes. While I have respect for them and appreciate the work they are doing, I must say that, having taken part in one or two programmes, I was not unmindful of the attitude of one or two people on those programmes.  Because myself or some other contributor was not prepared to speak in a tone that fitted in with the programme as they saw it, we were not entitled to the freedom that they would now claim for themselves or would consider that we are taking from them.  Human nature does not end when one moves into the field of journalism and neither does it end when one goes inside Montrose. There are people there who think like us but in so far as this Bill provides for the possibility of there being, at some time, a journalist who might not appreciate his responsibilities, as other journalists of integrity appreciate them, and in so far as there might be a journalist who might be a party to inciting persons to commit an offence, there is nothing wrong with this Bill and the amendment is not necessary.</P>
    <P>We have heard examples of what <Col N="2567" /> happens in other countries.  I would not wish to be accused of being insular but I have more interest in what is the concern and philosophy of our people than in what is the concern and philosophy of people of other countries.</P>
    <P>Although I may have been somewhat critical of Deputy Thornley's approach, I think that if he were here he would agree with me when I say that in parts of our constituency during the past two years we have been attending meetings at which people have been crying out for the Government to take some action in the matter of vandalism&mdash;vandalism of the type that results in young men, and sometimes young women, who have nothing else to do moving into corporation playing areas and evicting the young children who are playing there so that they themselves might take over.</P>

      <P>With respect, I think the point I am making and which I intend pursuing is as relevant as some of the utterances we have had so far, if not more so.  I try to regard legislation as it affects the people.  I was hoping to pursue the point in relation to my own constituency so as to indicate that during the past couple of years Deputies Thornley, Byrne, Gogan and myself have attended meetings at which the concern of the people was the taking over of corporation property by vandals&mdash;in our area, they are called skinheads&mdash;who have no respect for property.  In so far as this legislation would help to curtail the activities of these young people I welcome it.  I have no doubt that nobody in this House, and no journalist, whether he represents Press or radio, would encourage these young people or any other people to annoy their neighbours.</P>

    <P>Since other Deputies have been allowed wander far afield before coming directly to the terms of the amendment, I would make the point that we are being told now that there are more urgent problems than this.  To me <Col N="2568" /> there is no more urgent problem in Ireland at the moment than the situation in which we have a certain body of people, thank Heaven not a great number, whose philosophy is that if they have not got something which I have and if at any given moment it does not seem to be required by me they have a right to use it.  Whether it is my house, my car or, indeed, my money they do not care.  It is rather frightening to me to think that we have people who have been elected here and represent people, as I do, who would suggest that the day has not come when we should put a stop to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not very often do I trespass on the very valuable time of this House but I am prompted to contribute to the debate on this Fine Gael amendment because I regard the passing of this amendment to this most objectionable section in this most undesirable and unwanted Bill as of great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by speakers on all sides to the importance of preserving, not alone free speech, but the freedom of journalists to report as they think fit.  My reason for viewing with grave concern and alarm this section and the reason I feel so agitated about it is that I recall with great pride the lengthy speeches made in this House to my knowledge over the past 20 years or 29 years on the subject of the preservation of democracy, the right of free speech, the right of free reporting, the right of a free Parliament to legislate.  I recall those speeches when I hear of the views expressed last week and this week that certain Deputies are anxious to deliberately waste the time of this House on this amendment.  That is not so because there are Deputies who have been impressed by the high standards set in this Parliament by the late William T. Cosgrave, the father of the present Leader of the Opposition, similar speeches by the late Deputy Richard Corish, father of the Leader of the Labour Party, and the inspiring addresses of the late Deputy James Fitzgerald Kenney, coupled with the sentiments of men like the former <Col N="2569" /> Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Seán MacEoin, the late Deputy William Norton, the late Deputy James Larkin, who was an outstanding advocate of the right of free speech, free assembly and, above all, freedom of the Press to report without hindrance.  I remember speeches in this House by an Independent Deputy, the late Deputy Richard S. Anthony, just as I remember the contributions very eloquently made by the late father of the Deputy who has just spoken, Deputy Tunney, whom we all held in the greatest affection in this House many years ago.  All these speeches were based on the right of a Parliament to make good laws to be obeyed by all our citizens.</P>
    <P>If there is an effort being made in this section to interfere with the right of journalists, whether on newspapers, radio or television, to report facts as they find them, I venture to say that if such a Bill or such a section were presented to Parliament in the time of the late W.T. Cosgrave, the late Richard Corish, the late James Larkin and others, to whom I have referred, there would have been uproar in this House but as time goes on and, perhaps, with the new type of Deputies we do not seem to set the same value on or attach the same importance to the right of free assembly, the right of free speech or the right of Parliament to pass fair laws, reasonable laws which citizens are expected to obey.</P>
    <P>A Bill of this kind is tantamount to aggravating and disturbing the peace of mind of law-abiding citizens.  Many of us have asked ourselves, but have not got a reply, what is the necessity for this Bill and for this section.  We are now considering the necessity for amending the section.  Is there large scale squatting in this city or in this country at the moment?  I cannot see nor have I heard any evidence of such. There is certainly no general demand in rural Ireland for a Bill or a section of this kind to be enshrined in the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>We hear the Minister for Justice and his party colleagues saying that Parliament cannot adjourn for the summer recess until this Bill has passed all stages.  I have wondered in the past <Col N="2570" /> few days whether there is a reason for all this.  Did they think that by slipping in this Bill at the end of a long, weary and tiresome session of Parliament that Deputies would be so weary and tired, their energies so overtaxed, that they would get it through without a clear expression of opinion and without sufficient thought?  If the Minister for Justice thought that he should think again.  In the past week it has been said that the reason Deputies were so vocal on this amendment was anxiety to curry favour with journalists in order to gain generous publicity for their political activities. That is not so.</P>
    <P>Deputies are elected to Parliament mainly to legislate, to contribute to debates and to object strenuously regarding any legislation that interferes with the rights of citizens.  That is why Deputies wisely have taken time to focus public attention on what appear to be the hidden motives behind this section.  We could not discuss a more important matter than the amendment now before the House.  It is my view, and I am sure it is shared by many other Deputies, that there is no evidence of a general demand for this Bill and there is no need for all the alarm, the excitement and the rush on the part of the Taoiseach and his Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker inferred that Deputies were vocal on this issue in order to get into favour with journalists and reporters of the newspapers and television.  Deputies have a duty to speak on an important topic such as this and we are exercising that duty. We cannot expect respect from those outside this House unless we show them we are serious in our work and serious in exercising our responsibilities in giving the people good legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have been vocal in their objections to this section realise it is not in the public interest.  It is an evil section and is more far-reaching in its consequences than any other section of the Bill.  It is part of a major and well thought-out plan to remove completely any essence of democracy. The experience in other countries has shown that freedom is not lost at once. It is lost step by step.  If we consider <Col N="2571" /> the setting up of regional boards to replace the smaller authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The previous speaker mentioned that there might be one journalist who did not use proper discretion in the discharge of his duties. It there will be only one offending journalist, why is it necessary to have such a section?  My experience has been that journalists are, perhaps, more conscientious in the discharge of their duties than even Members of this House.  They have a grave responsibility to report facts, whether in the newspaper columns or on radio or television. Above all, they must report the truth.  Journalists are men and women of integrity, intelligence, common sense and devotion to duty and, above all, devotion to publication of the truth.</P>
      <P>Is this section being included in order to prevent the truth being revealed and read by the citizens?  Is this section not a vote of no confidence by the Government in the integrity of the journalists? The section has been described as a &ldquo;gobstopper&rdquo; to prevent people of integrity from discharging their duty, namely, to tell the truth to the people.  This duty imposes a grave responsibility before man, and more grave responsibility before God.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section an effort is made to prevent the discharge of their duties by this responsible and highly professional group of people.  How do the Government expect to earn the respect of the general public if the laws we pass here do not meet with the approval, the support and the respect of the people?  Is it not most desirable that we should pass here laws which all citizens can obey, cherish and respect? <Col N="2572" /> How can citizens be expected to respect, obey and cherish what we are all agreed is bad law?  Does not the bad law lead to anarchy?  This section is bad and, if the amendment to the section is not accepted, then this section could lead to anarchy.  The constitutional rights of journalists and others to report facts will be restricted if this section becomes law.</P>
    <P>I find in the country a good deal of apathy on the part of people in relation to their constitutional rights.  If this section is not amended it will lead to a disastrous situation because, as it stands, it is designed to muzzle the Press, radio and television.  There are those of us who believe in democracy. There are those of us who believe in freedom of expression.  There are those of us who believe that one should speak and say what he likes, how he likes and when he likes so long as he keeps within the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any law designed to restrict freedom of speech is suspect.  One cannot but be critical of any law designed to prevent free comment. This section, as it stands, will prevent free comment by those whose job it is to report facts and to give the truth.  Will those engaged in the newspaper industry take this measure lying down?  Are the Government reinforced in their hope of getting this section because people are not interested and because journalists, as a voting power, are not a very strong pressure group? Here is a piece of legislation which could seriously affect the lives of those engaged in the newspaper industry; not alone that, but here is a piece of legislation which could affect the lives of their readers.  I believe there is not sufficient emphasis outside this Parliament on the design behind this section.  If editors, journalists and all others engaged in the news media allow this section to go through, with the support of the public, a public sunk in apathy, then the loss will be theirs and the loss will be engendered through their neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have expected the moment this section appeared in print <Col N="2573" /> that every newspaper in the country and the news media on radio and television would have come together to make known the perils.  Admittedly, the National Union of Journalists made their protest.  The protest took the form of a letter expressing their views, their indignation, their horror and their disgust.  What about the tens of thousands outside who should be interested in this section?  Why do the journalists and all those concerned in the news media not focus attention on this section?  Why do they not hold a &ldquo;No News Day&rdquo;, a black day, with a complete closedown on news in the public Press and on radio and television? That would focus public attention and alert the people to the seriousness of this section.  This section is a cancer which will eat into the living cells of democracy.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most objectionable sections this House has debated for many a long day.  I have yet to hear the Minister go into real detail on this section.  He has a duty to tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Assuming that he were to say in his report that in his opinion these people had every ground for taking the action they were taking, whatever that action might be, he will be accused of encouraging or advocating. He can encourage by being present.</P>
      <P>I remember receiving a summons in 1942 before I was elected to this House because it was held that I encouraged and advocated the non-payment of a just rate imposed under legislation in this House, the Barrow drainage rate. Before the summons was heard I was elected a Member of the House.  Summonses were issued against other people for encouraging and advocating. Less than three years afterwards this House passed legislation wiping out this special rate because it was considered to be unjust.  A section of this kind can be used as a means of preventing others as well as journalists. Take the Deputy who supplies his script to the journalist for publication. Take the Deputy who would be present at a meeting, who might be on the platform, and who is reported as having been present.  If this section is passed, similar sections will appear in other Bills which will deprive elected representatives of their rights as this section is designed to deprive the journalist of his right to report the facts either on radio or television.  This is the thin end of the wedge.  If this section gets through without Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment it can be used by Fianna Fáil as a precedent for other legislation designed for the convenience of Fianna Fáil and the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section should be fought tooth and nail, inside and outside this House, because there is a deep rooted, evilly disposed motive behind it.  It is a &ldquo;gob stopper&rdquo; to prevent journalists from reporting the facts.  It is a step, as Fianna Fáil believe in the right direction, to undermine the existence and <Col N="2577" /> continuance of democracy as we know it in this country.  We have a duty to prevent that.  Fianna Fáil may laugh. Fianna Fáil Deputies may sneer and jeer.  Facts are facts.  Here we see professional people in the discharge of their duties about to be branded as being associated with irregular activities and to be described as breakers of the law by encouraging and advocating people to break the law.  These journalists are impartial, having no interest other than to report the facts, not concerned with the merits of the case, not concerned with whether it is right or wrong.  They are there in their professional capacity to report facts.  If they report the facts in regard to proceedings, no matter how strong may be the grievance of those associated with the problem being discussed, these journalists can, under this section, be branded as law breakers and criminals.</P>
    <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary who is sitting in for the Minister not ashamed of this section?  There must be some Deputies left in Fianna Fáil who have some love left in them for the rights of the citizens and for the preservation of democracy.  You cannot have a free Parliament if you have not a free press.  Parliament will become a farce if journalists are not free to report what goes on, whether it is to the credit of Parliament or to the dishonour and disgrace of Parliament. We have a right as elected representatives to speak our minds here.  The day that right goes from us in Parliament is a long, gloomy, sad day for the country.  The day the journalist is blindfolded and gagged is the day when freedom and the right of free speech in Parliament are rocked to their foundations.</P>
    <P>At all costs, we must preserve in a free country freedom of the Press and those associated with the radio, the television and the Press must not have hanging over them the threat of legal proceedings, of being branded as criminals or as law breakers, or of being presented with summonses and court decrees when they discharge their duties honourably and truthfully. If I know the journalists of this country, there is never any need and there never has been any need to question <Col N="2578" /> either their ability or their integrity. Here we have a section in a Bill, with far-reaching concealed effects that we have not seen yet, deliberately designed by Fianna Fáil as a step towards setting up &mdash; Fianna Fáil Deputies may laugh but it is happening under our very eyes&mdash;a small, high powered, big-influence, wealthy dictatorship of big men with empty heads, who talk very loud.  We must break that up in this Parliament.  This section is to reinforce these big men.  For those who have been here long enough, past history is sufficient.  This section is designed to prevent the journalists and newspapers of this country from publishing the truth and from using their own discretion in giving the public the facts.  Parliament weakens and every Deputy's status is reduced the day this House passes a section which will interfere with the rights, liberties and freedom of the Press.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the United States of America.  The hallmark of a State that is in any way democratic is freedom of the Press.  In the United States of America that freedom is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution.  I have always regarded the United States as the defender of freedom.  Thank God that that great Power is there to maintain freedom and to help nations whose freedom is being diminished.</P>
    <P>Some 100 years ago the British Government, in their respect for freedom and to show the importance they attached to freedom of the Press, removed all taxes on newspapers.  They considered that a tax on newspapers, on the publication of information, would hinder freedom and democracy and the right of the public to be well and truly informed.  We have even seen in the past few weeks the manner in which the freedom of the Press was highlighted in the city of New York when every newspaper and every journalist in the United States felt that if that freedom was to be infringed in any way a great wrong would be imposed on the American people.  They won the day.  The freedom of the Press, the radio and television is something to be cherished.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have spoken about <Col N="2579" /> the freedom of television.  We have not in this country what we can describe as freedom of television or radio because of Government control.  I was amazed to read an article last week, with reference to this Bill, in which it was conveyed to the public that neither politicans nor newspapers were aiming at or should aim at a high ideal of perfection.  When I saw that a responsible newspaper, with reference to this amendment, was questioning the right of newspapers or politicans to aim at a high ideal of perfection it made me think.</P>
    <P>May I ask what is wrong with Members of this House aiming at a high ideal of perfection?  Have not the newspapers, as well as the Members of this House, a bounden duty both before God and man, to aim at a high ideal of perfection?  If we see that a newspaper is critical of Parliament, or if one newspaper is critical of another's ideal of perfection we are slowly losing our grip and steadily slipping down the slope of imperfection and Parliament are standing idly by because their aim in the past has not been at the highest standards of perfection. Their aim has been to the contrary and a section of this kind, if passed by a free democratic Parliament, will add considerably to those imperfect standards.</P>
    <P>We all have a duty.  Every individual will be judged eventually on his own record, both here and hereafter, and he has a duty to set high standards and to endeavour to attain, if at all possible, to the highest possible standards. I want to tell newspapers who feel that politicians have no interest in perfection that they ought to examine their own conscience in regard to playing up to the whims and to the cheques of their advertisers.  We who are politicians, dealing with an amendment such as this, have a duty in regard to perfection and because we are dedicated, in so far as we possibly can be, to perfection we want to see that this unwarranted, unnecessary and disgusting section is suitably amended.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why newspapers and those connected with the presentation <Col N="2580" /> of news have not taken a more determined and serious view of this matter.  We find that printers who may execute orders for literature, posters, handbills or anything else of that nature, or who become involved in any work of that nature, will be guilty under this section which is an intrusion on the rights of even the ordinary citizen who might be involved in giving out handbills.  No Government should be given the authority which this section seeks.  We all have certain rights and we have a duty to hold on to those rights and to safeguard those rights.</P>
    <P>What I greatly fear is the section which we are now trying to amend.  If it is passed it can be used as a precedent for having similar sections in other pieces of legislation.  It has been suggested that Deputies who have become so determined to speak at such length against this section have motives other than their concern for a free Press.  We are all very conscious of the high standard of integrity of the ladies and gentlemen of the Press and of the managements of national and provincial newspapers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the position becomes serious when a section of this kind is brought in by a Government who would not hesitate to use it to suit themselves.  In this country, especially in relation to radio and television, nobody can say there is entire freedom. Many of us have been trying to get a free radio and television but our best efforts have not been successful because they have been hampered by the Government.  Although we have not a free radio and television, we have a free Press and the great danger I can see is further Government influence. We know that appointments to radio and television are Government appointments and we know that broadcasts are of the type that suit the Government. No one listening to newscasts could fail to realise the pro-Government bias.</P>
    <P>Consequently, a free Press is of vital importance.  To date, there has not been Government intervention but all of us know that if Fianna Fáil had their way every newspaper would be pumping out Fianna Fáil propaganda week after week.  We had an example <Col N="2581" /> of attempted Government interference with <i>The Farmers' Journal</i>.  It was fully debated in the House and there is no need to comment further on it.  It was direct interference with a free and independent Press.  The only way the Government can influence newspapers is to withdraw or to curtail Government advertisements.  Many provincial and some national newspapers have been influenced by the amount of Government interference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to explain to the Parliamentary Secretary that we have a free Press but that we have not a free radio and television, despite our best efforts to have it free.  One way the Government can get at the Press is to interfere with Government advertising. That is the way they can interfere, particularly with a newspaper that cannot stand on its feet, that must depend on Government advertising for its existence. I should like to see every newspaper in the country standing on its feet without dependence on Government advertising.  If newspapers find this type of interference they should immediately consult their local TDs so that the matter might be highlighted in this Parliament.  If there is not freedom of the Press to convey to the public what takes place in Parliament, then Parliament itself becomes a farce. I would go even further and say that even more important than Parliament is a free Press.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Nationalist and Leinster Times</i> of Carlow, an editorial last week referred to a speech by the Taoiseach last autumn to a group of western journalists.  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a fair and balanced presentation of news and views and from free expression of opinions, a <Col N="2582" /> healthy democracy draws its life and strength.</P>
    <P>It is not without good reason that the Press has become known as the Fourth Estate, for it shares in government and is an essential element in the democratic process.  If the Taoiseach expressed those views to the western journalists last autumn why is there now a necessity, less than 12 months after that speech, to curtail the activities of the journalists by this section, to have them, so to speak, branded as criminals for encouraging and advocating the breaking of the law?  Was this speech not a piece of hypocrisy? Did Deputy Tunney not describe it exactly a few moments ago when he referred to speeches being made by politicians to obtain the goodwill and favour of journalists?  What other purpose had that speech?  If there was any sincerity in the speech, if the Taoiseach meant what he said to the western journalists, would he have allowed the Minister for Justice to come into Parliament with this section which is an instalment, and a major instalment, towards the ending of democracy as we know it?</P>
    <P>It is only right that the Taoiseach should let us know what has changed his mind in relation to Irish journalists since last autumn, because he is not paying the same tribute to the western journalists in this section of the Bill presented here by the Minister with his knowledge and consent.  Although anything can happen in Government circles today, it is most unlikely that the Minister for Justice brought in this Bill without the Taoiseach's knowledge.</P>
    <P>I wonder what did the Taoiseach mean by saying that the Press shared in government.  This is an occasion on which he should be invited to tell Parliament what he meant.  Did he mean that the Press was to be used by the Government to advocate whatever the Government wanted, be it right or wrong?  If the Press is to be free the Government must act reasonably and in accordance with the precepts of Christian charity.  Do the Government want the Press to cover up the failures, to putty the cracks, to bolster up the dishonesty, to participate in an act of hypocrisy?  Is that <Col N="2583" /> what the Taoiseach meant when he spoke to the western journalists about the Press sharing in Government?</P>
    <P>The Press is free and we want to keep it free.  If freedom has been taken away from radio and television we now have an opportunity of demanding that the Press be left free to judge for itself what is right without any interference or dictation, without threats, without having the rights of journalists and of management being overthrown through the frequent visits of the summons server.</P>
    <P>How can there be a free Press unless the heavy hand of the law is lifted and the Press allowed to continue to enjoy the privileges which the Press in this country and in our neighbouring country of Britain have enjoyed for over 100 years?  By this Forcible Entry Bill Parliament is selling out.  We have no right or authority to barter the rights and privileges of citizens.  We have no right to prevent the free exercise by a man of his profession. This is the first time I have seen a section of this kind in a Bill which makes it a criminal offence for a man to discharge the duties of his profession.  One can encourage and one can advocate.  If this section is passed it will be the thin edge of the wedge.  Democracy has taken a beating over the past two years in this country.  A section of this kind in this Bill which no one wants is a threat. There is a threat of fine and imprisonment for newspapers and journalists. This is one of the most serious and determined blows against freedom which we have had since the State was founded.  If we were doing our jobs properly we Deputies should avail of every week-end to tell the public that, even though the Taoiseach praised the integrity of journalists and said that a free Press was the right of a democracy, there has been a change in the meantime.  There is an effort to kill the Press, to stifle the truth and to prevent the public from getting the facts.  The one way that can be done is to hold a threat of jail or of fines over the heads of eminent journalists of the highest integrity.  If there are <Col N="2584" /> Deputies in the House who think that is good law they are entitled to their opinion in accordance with their intelligence. This might be good law for Bulgaria or State behind the Iron Curtain or for Fidel Castro.  It might be good law in a country where there is no free parliament.  In the Republic where we pride ourselves on whatever freedom we have, we find at the end of the long summer session that Fianna Fáil are rushing through legislation to make criminals of journalists and pressmen who believe in the exercise of their own discretion in accordance with the ideals and high standards of their profession.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment will be accepted.  It appeals for the exclusion of radio and television from the terms of this section because if radio and television are not excluded the Press will be muzzled and journalists will be afraid to report.  The Minister for Justice will use the full authority of the State to make journalists do what he wants them to do because he is a small, little man who likes to pull big and heavy weights.  If the Minister gets a section like this passed, he will not hesitate to implement it.  Radio and television can now be described as part of our lives.  If those responsible for presenting true facts on radio and television are going to be stifled and gagged by a section of this kind, how can we expect impartiality in the future?  How can we expect truth and facts?  With this threat of forcible entry, it is only a matter of time before legislation is introduced to deal with farmers' organisations, tenants' associations and rent problems. The squatters are only being used as an excuse for the introduction of this section.  They are non-existent. They are being used to stifle the Press. It is the aim of Fianna Fáil to stifle the Press.  The Press brings the truth to our homes.  The truth does not suit Fianna Fáil and in order to stifle it we are going to be branded as associates, advocates and encouragers of the breaking of the law, when we assist the squatters.</P>
    <P>This Bill and this section of it are too serious to smile at or to joke about. The consequences are too serious to <Col N="2585" /> contemplate.  I hope that an effort will be made by the newspapers to bring home to readers throughout the country what Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Justice are trying to do. This Parliament stands for the free expression of opinion by radio and Press.  Fine Gael want that freedom maintained and encouraged while Fianna Fáil want to stifle it.  Why do they want to stifle it in relation to forcible entry?  Forcible entry is non-existent. The introduction of this section is a hoax.  Fianna Fáil want to use this section for other activities. They want to prevent the public from getting the truth and the facts in relation to other more vital items.  This section will be used when discussing other legislation so that they can say: &ldquo;There is a precedent for a section of that kind in the Forcible Entry Bill. We will now have a section in a Bill to deal with tenants' associations. We will now put it into a Bill that it will be an offence to advocate that foreigners should not buy land here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If a journalist were to condemn the purchase of land by foreigners and if a section such as this section were put into a land Bill, what would the situation be?  Deputies have a grave responsibility. If I saw a land Bill coming in with a section which would prevent me from advocating or encouraging that foreigners should not buy land as they are doing, and have done, I would take a serious view of it.  In relation to this amendment and this section I do not want the Government to be in a position to say that we already have it enshrined in the Forcible Entry Bill, that Parliament at the time did not take a serious view of it, because Parliament thought so lightly about it, because Parliament commenced to give away democratic rights, because Parliament did not value the freedom of the Press, because Parliament did not put a proper value on the integrity of Irish journalists and we let it through our hands.  I do not want to see that happen and that is why I cherish the speeches which have been made here during the last 29 years.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the Chair I believe I am the longest serving Member <Col N="2586" /> in this assembly at the moment.  I have heard great men, who are not here now, speak in defence of democracy, the freedom of the Press and radio and freedom of speech.  Is everything they have said from these benches to fade into insignificance as a result of a section which will immediately take away the right of the journalist to report the truth as he thinks fit and to give to his readers the truth as he finds it?  The late Deputy James Fitzgerald Kenney, Deputy Richard Mulcahy, Deputy Dillon, the late Deputy William Norton, Deputy Corish's father and Deputy Dick Anthony, all spoke from these benches as we have been speaking tonight to prevent any Government from taking from our people the rights they have.</P>
    <P>This Bill is taking from our people the right to read and hear the truth. How can there be anything more serious for Parliament to consider?  We must deplore the act of any Government that tries to do that.  We must decry the attempt of any Minister who comes into Parliament in the name of democracy and tells us that, by a section of a Bill uncalled for and unwanted, he is going to brand journalists and the management of newspapers as criminals.</P>
    <P>Is it not time we sat up and realised that something is being taken from us by Fianna Fáil?  They are depriving us of the right to truth through the medium of a free Press.  This section is highly explosive so far as democracy is concerned.  It is evilly conceived and put into this Bill with a bad intention.  It is weighed down with advantages for Fianna Fáil so far as the stifling and muzzling of a free Press are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have availed of every opportunity during the past 29 years of rising in defence of democracy.  I believe in freedom to speak both inside and outside this House.  I also believe in the right of a free Press to use their own discretion in reporting what I say. The day that Parliament loses its free Press is a day when Parliament becomes a farce and ineffective.  The most important thing in the life of any democracy is the freedom of the Press. <Col N="2587" /> This section interferes with this right and yet the Minister for Justice wonders why we are delaying the House talking about a trivial little amendment that does not make any difference.  He says that it is not important and may be ineffective.  If that is the case why does he not take the section out of the Bill?  Why does he not have confidence in journalists? Why does he not ask the Taoiseach what he meant when he said last autumn that the freedom of the press was the essence and the true life of a democracy.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of dialogue between the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach. They are walking in opposite directions.  In order that they may have an opportunity of coming together might I recommend to the Minister for Justice that he seek from the Taoiseach's Office a script which must still be in existence, if it has not been shamefully destroyed within the past ten days, of the Taoiseach's speech to the western journalists.  If a meeting could be called in the largest party room in the House and the Taoiseach was at the head of that meeting&mdash;provided, of course, that Deputy Blaney and Deputy Haughey were not available&mdash;he could instruct members of his party on what he really meant when he said to western journalists that a free Press was the essence and the true life of a democracy.</P>
    <P>This is the most vital and serious problem which the House has debated for a long time.  I trust that others who have a view to express thereon will express it.  My own view is that this is a firm and determined nail in the coffin of democracy.  It is a wrong section in a wrong Bill.  It is aimed at doing a grave wrong to our people, who are lovers of freedom, whether it be freedom of speech or freedom of the Press.  This is an effort on the part of Fianna Fáil to deny our people the right of freedom through the medium of the Press, radio and television.  Such denial will meet with the greatest opposition possible outside this House. I call on every editor and on every journalist who is worth his salt to stand up now and to shake off the shackles <Col N="2588" /> of slavery and shake off the shackles of waiting for the £ from Fianna Fáil for advertising and do this country the good turn of informing the public of the grave national scandal that is involved in interfering with the rights of the free press.  One way of drawing public attention to this suppression of the free Press is to have a black news day, that is, to have a day on which no news would be presented and then, the next day, tell the public that this had been done in order to draw their attention to the whim of the Minister for Justice, contrary to what the Taoiseach said, to regard them as criminals because they discharged their loyal duties of honesty and integrity in conveying the truth to the viewers and the readers of this country.  This is a disgraceful Bill and this section is particularly disgraceful.  I hope it will be amended in the manner in which the two Deputies have suggested but even if this amendment is accepted, the teeth are still not taken out of the section because these teeth are dangerous and can and will be used to the detriment of democracy and freedom of speech and viewing.  Should the Bill be passed by the votes of Members of this Dáil, I hope that after the next election, when the present administration is replaced, no time will be lost in having this objectionable section removed from the Statute Book in order that we might be sincere in reinforcing the confidence of newspaper management and of the Press generally.</P>
    <P>It is essential for the future of democracy that there be a free and healthy Press&mdash;a Press that would not be interfered with by the Garda, by the Minister for Justice or by the courts of law.  At this late stage I appeal to the Minister for Justice to take his dirty hands&mdash;speaking politically&mdash;off the freedom of the Press and thereby permit the free operation of journalists in their efforts to provide the people with the truth.  The Minister still has a little time left.  If he does not do as I have asked, this measure will be regretted. I look on the Bill with disgust and contempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why the Minister for Justice and, indeed, why the Government have not <Col N="2589" /> yet got the message, not necessarily from those of us in Opposition, that this Bill is thoroughly unwelcome and undesirable.  All the daily papers have commented on the Bill.  In particular they have commented on section 4, an amendment to which is now being debated. I would commend to the Minister and to the Government the last sentence of a leading article that is published in today's issue of the <i>Irish Press</i>.  To a large extent this reflects the sentiments not only of those of us who are in Opposition but of the people of the country generally.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Having the Dáil's time taken up with one easily alterable section of a Bill, whose retention is being fought for and against with the ferocity of a rear guard action in the field, will not help us to deal with these problems. Let us now have that suitable alternation, and let us get on with the Nation's business.</P>
      <P>They refer to section 4.  I take that as it is written and not as it might be interpreted by some members of Fianna Fáil as being a criticism of those of us in the Opposition who have spoken with such concern and at such length against the Bill and, in particular, against section 4.  I have been a Member of this House for a number of years&mdash;not for as long as Deputy Flanagan&mdash;but I recognise the repetition of the tactics of a Fianna Fáil Government particularly when they want to push through legislation such as this.  Their tactic is to try to stampede the Opposition into letting the Bill through without serious consideration. This Bill is being given serious consideration even though there are people who wail that the Dáil should be adjourned by now so that people might go on their holidays.  People should be allowed to go on their holidays and the staff should be relieved but the ball is at the feet of the Minister for Justice who, I might remark, has shown scant respect for this House during the Report Stage of this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw a similar tactic in December last when the Government tried to rush through what they must now consider to have been an undesirable piece <Col N="2590" /> of legislation&mdash;the Prices and Incomes Bill.  At that particular time they were so intent on trying to put the Bill through that, after we had voiced our objections to internment without trial and asked for a debate, we were told that we could swop a debate on internment without trial if we gave the Government the Prices and Incomes Bill before the Christmas adjournment in 1970.</P>
    <P>In 1961 we witnessed the same sort of tactic when the Government for some unknown reason assembled Dáil Éireann by telegram in order that during what was a holiday period they might push through the Electricity Supply Board (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  They blame the Opposition for having the Dáil sitting at this stage but I remember a time in 1948 when the tactics of Fianna Fáil speakers on certain measures at that time, not as serious in their content as this particular measure, succeeded in keeping the Dáil in session well into the month of August.  There were no wailings then about the staff and neither was there any criticism of the Labour Party or of their association with the trade union movement.  I do not know whether it is pride, vanity or pique on the part of the Government and in particular on the part of the Minister for Justice that we are still here because, as I said at the beginning, they must have got the message by now.</P>
    <P>If the Press, radio and television are at all representative of the views of the people of the country, it must mean that if we do not have a majority of people in the Opposition to defeat this Bill it would be defeated overwhelmingly if it were put before the people in a referendum.  There is no use Fianna Fáil consoling themselves that they have a majority of votes and that, consequently, the Bill will be passed.  It must be remembered that the Opposition, whether Independent, Fine Gael or Labour, have a majority of support so far as votes are concerned as was reflected in the figures for the last general election.  I do not wish to attribute motives to Fianna Fáil that are too sinister but they have been in office now for quite a long time.  Like the Unionists in the North, I suppose <Col N="2591" /> they are determined by hook or by crook to hang on to that power.  It appears to me that there is a very definite pattern when Fianna Fáil come to deal with people who annoy them, who get in their way or who irritate them.  The usual solution of the Fianna Fáil Party is, as in legislation like this, bluntly to demand heavy fines or, failing that, to put them in jail.  I have referred to the ESB (Temporary Provisions) Act providing that if workers did not conform to certain sections of that Act they could be put in jail.  It meant that if they decided to withdraw their labour or not to accept a wage offer, for example, which was agreed on by a third party, if they refused to work for those wages, they would be put in jail.  There were similar provisions in the Prices and Incomes Bill which the Government had the good sense to withdraw, or which the Government withdrew when they saw the success of the trade union movement with the employers in establishing a national wage agreement.  We saw then proposed trade union legislation&mdash;the same tactic&mdash;if you do not do the will of the Government, as expressed in the Bill, we will put you in jail.  We had this in the Criminal Justice Bill.  I suppose one must be thankful that there was this upset in May, 1970, when a Minister for Justice was either dismissed or resigned.  It was the last we heard of the Criminal Justice Bill. Despite all the defensive speeches at that time for that Bill and the speech made by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Ó Móráin at a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, there has not been one mention of it since.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Government to regard this piece of legislation, particularly this section in the same light, to pocket their pride and their vanity and say at least: &ldquo;We will defer consideration of this until the autumn session.&rdquo;  I do not think anybody from the Fianna Fáil benches has attempted to stress the urgency of having this Bill passed before we adjourn for the summer vacation.  We saw this attitude of Fianna Fáil trampling over their opponents or those who irritated them in protest marches by the farmers <Col N="2592" /> when, once again, and without legislation like this they put many of them in Mountjoy Jail.  I do not think I could be regarded as a trouble maker or one who has ever advocated violence or breaking the law but the Government must recognise that there is such deep feeling not alone among Members of this House but among people in the country generally that they could be building up, are building up, will be building up a lot of trouble for themselves if they insist on going through with this legislation. Deputy O.J. Flanagan gave certain advice to the news media&mdash;the newspapers, television and radio.  He told them what they should do.  What he failed to realise, of course&mdash;I am sure the Press, radio and television realise it&mdash;is that if they take that advice under this piece of legislation they could find themselves in jail.  I warn the Government and I warn the Minister for Justice that there will be a violent reaction because the people do not like to be persecuted.  They will not be repressed and they will not be kicked around.  This is what this legislation is all about.</P>
    <P>There were people who talked about the Minister's intentions.  A usual remark from the Opposition when one comes to consider legislation like this is: &ldquo;Well, the present Minister may not implement the terms of it in full but some other Minister in five, ten, 15 or 25 years might.&rdquo;  We have the reverse position now because, in my view, and I bear no malice against him, nor to any other Deputy in the House, one man who would employ that Bill to the very letter is the present Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley.  That is the big danger that I see as long as he remains Minister for Justice or for as long as the Government decide that they will push this Bill through Dáil Éireann by reason of the fact that they have a majority of the Members of Dáil Éireann behind them.  On the other hand, however, they have not a majority of the people behind them.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any other law which has the same provision as that contained in section 4 of this Bill.  I do not know of any section which <Col N="2593" /> attempts to muzzle Press comment and, mind you, it may be an interpretation of what the Press said, it may be somebody's interpretation as to what the writer of a leading article may think and it may come down to a case where the editor or journalist has a certain sentence with a question mark after it or an exclamation mark.  It could be interpreted as advocating a particular offence described in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no criticism to make of the Press.  Our Party certainly have no criticism to make of the Press even though it is only fair to say that on very many occasions and maybe in the majority of cases, when there is general comment, we have been, so to speak, on the wrong end.  I suppose we all have our favourite newspaper and I will not name mine now&mdash;it could be the <i>Irish Press</i> sometimes&mdash;but these are strong words from the <i>Irish Independent,</i> from their editorial on 17th June.  It is headed &ldquo;A Fascist Bill.&rdquo; There are strong words in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I think they mean it.  I think it could not be said that they are anti-Fianna Fáil.  I do not think it could be said that they have carried on a campaign against Fianna Fáil any more than any of the other newspapers in the country have carried on any sort of campaign against Fianna Fáil generally.  On particular issues, yes, perhaps.  This editorial of 17th June reads:</P>
    <P>The Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill 1970, which was again debated in the Dáil yesterday, betrays certain disturbing fascist tendencies in our present administration. Three repressive proposals stand out: (a) the giving of powers of arrest without warrant to the Gardaí, (b) the placing of the onus of proving himself innocent on an accused,</P>
    <P>It goes on like that.  While that is regarded as fair comment and may be fair comment from those who do not agree with it, if this particular Bill becomes an Act and is signed by the President the <i>Irish Independent</i> can be heavily fined or its editor and those associated with the newspaper can be put in jail if this is reproduced after <Col N="2594" /> the President has signed the Bill. Deputy Davern shakes his head but this could be regarded as advocating and suggesting to people that it was a bad law, an unfair law, that it should be resisted.  I have a similar quotation here from the <i>Cork Examiner</i>.  I do not think I should delay the House by reading it fully because I am sure in my absence this has been quoted fully. Each one of the daily newspapers&mdash;the <i>Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> has suggested that this is a bad Bill.  The <i>Irish Press</i>, in particular, takes exception to and strongly criticises the Minister for his attitude towards the amendment now proposed to section 4.</P>

      <P>The <i>Cork Examiner</i> dated 4th June, 1971, and the <i>Irish Independent</i> dated 17th June, 1971.  It has been said that we are wasting the time of the House.  So far as my party are concerned, there was no decision, tacit or otherwise, that there would be a filibuster.  There was no decision whatever that the House should be unduly delayed.  I can assure the House that those people who have made long contributions have carried out a tremendous amount of research because they feel so strongly about this Bill.  I concede to the occupant on the front seat of the Government benches that his contributions on certain other amendments were excellent. However, apart from the contributions by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister&mdash;both of which could be described as brief speeches &mdash;I cannot understand why there has not been a greater reaction in defence of this Bill, and in particular of this section, from Fianna Fáil members and especially from members of the Government.</P>

      <P>There has been no such reaction.  The Minister treats this House with scant respect.  I do not know where the Minister is.  According to a report recently it appears he was in some place in the Middle East or in Eastern Europe lecturing to people on peace and justice.  I hope be told them <Col N="2595" /> about this measure and assured them he would not introduce internment without trial or reintroduce the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
      <P>There are many more important things we should be discussing in this House and this has been suggested by the <i>Irish Press</i> in an editorial today. We are talking about people squatting but we are not talking about people being exploited; we are not talking about the 250,000 people who are living below subsistence level; we are not talking about the 70,000 unemployed; certainly, we are not talking about the people in Dublin and in the provinces who are in urgent need of houses.  The public should realise it is not the Opposition who determine what is to be discussed in Dáil Éireann. If we had our way we should sweep this Bill under the carpet.  We would much prefer to talk about the unemployed, to talk about the situation in the north, and above all, we should prefer to talk about the provision of money in order to provide the houses that are so badly needed.</P>
      <P>The argument relating to the letter members of the Labour Party, including myself, addressed to the Press requesting that they should not report the visit of the Springboks is a weak argument.  We did not threaten the Press: we merely suggested that this might be an effective form of protest against a team and a group who were pro-apartheid.  We did not say they should be fined, we did not say they should be put in jail.  As fellow trade unionists we asked them to use their discretion and said that in our view the visit should not be given any publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Government defer this Bill, or at least defer the inclusion of this section, and swallow their pride.  We have had legal arguments from people qualified in the legal profession&mdash;I am not one of those people. Other defenders of the Bill on the Government side seemed to suggest that the Bill was designed to prevent squatting and the taking over of homes.  I do not think I should go into great detail again on the attitude of the Labour Party in regard to squatting, particularly if it means that <Col N="2596" /> people jump the queue in regard to corporation houses.  We do not think that is right but we say when this is done there is the ordinary law.  In our view, and this view is shared by the majority of people, the law is sufficient in itself to correct any such transgression.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the legal problems arising from squatting could have been handled by a change of court procedure and, I believe, this has been done in Britain.  That country has a far greater problem in regard to squatting.  I do not know if it is a bonus for Fianna Fáil or for the city commissioner, but my information suggests that there is less squatting in the city of Dublin today than existed six or 12 months ago.  This may be due to the fact that the Government are making a contribution towards the provision of houses, but I do not know if this is the case.  Although the problem in Britain appears to be much worse, they amended the rules of court relating to the procedure.  I am informed the relevant Order is Order No. 113 of July, 1970, and it makes provision for obtaining possession more efficiently and more effectively &mdash;not the sledgehammer approach adopted in the Forcible Entry Bill. Senator Robinson pointed this out in the Seanad and she suggested that what we required in this instance was a new procedure.  That procedure has been provided by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Squatting in local authority houses is covered by the 1970 Act and the Minister for Local Government said this was sufficient.  Therefore, why the necessity for this Bill and what is the purpose of subsection (1)?  It is abundantly clear to us all that it is an attempt to muzzle the Press.  Section 4 (1) is unnecessary because incitement already is an offence and we have had an example in the last two or three days of incitement being so regarded.</P>
    <P>The Government are attempting to establish a more authoritarian State and this is one example.  There is a pattern in the legislation introduced by Fianna Fáil and the manner in which they acted against trade unionists and farmers&mdash;now they are acting against the people they call squatters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2597" /> This is indicative on their part of distrust of the law and the courts and this section demonstrates their distrust of the Press.</P>
    <P>It was not regarded as necessary in Britain to introduce new legislation and we operate more or less under the same law.  So far as housing is concerned, we should tackle the problems that cause people to squat rather than squatting itself.  It is fair to ask: would these people squat if they had houses? When people mention squatting, frequently the picture that is painted is one of undesirable people forcibly entering houses, of squatting and regarding the property as their own.  In many cases&mdash;I will not say in the majority&mdash;these squatters are not in the real sense people who have no absolute right to be in the houses.  In many cases they are relatives of the tenant who has died or relatives of people who have moved to another place but, in a moral sense, they do not regard that as squatting.  They believe that, because they are related to the former tenant&mdash;in some cases that tenant may be a parent&mdash;they have some sort of right to be there.  They do not do this with any criminal intent but if this particular piece of legislation passes through Dáil Éireann, they will be regarded as criminals.</P>
    <P>This Bill, described by the Fianna Fáil Party as being against squatting, will go even further than it does in regard to people who are homeless.  It could be used against other forms of social protest, protest I do not consider entirely undesirable.  I certainly do not consider those who participate in protests by way of squatting to be criminals and I do not regard that activity as illegal.  Would it be an offence, in a particular industry if trade unionists, who believed they were being treated unfairly by the boss, decided to sit in in the factory?  We have had many examples of that, some here and some in other countries throughout the world.  That is part of their protest.  It is one of the ways in which they believe they can bring home to those who are their employers the justice of their case and the injustice of the attitude of the employer.  This form of protest has been made and it has not been regarded as illegal.  Some may <Col N="2598" /> regard it as undesirable but, in my view, they have just as much right to sit in as they have to picket outside. They are part and parcel of the industry and their stake is just as good and just as important in that particular industry as is the stake of those who supply the money.</P>
    <P>We had the famous case in Stockholm where people protesting against a decision by the local authority to demolish trees protested by sitting in the trees.  There are various forms of protest.  We have had them in many of our seaside resorts, in some cases in undeveloped resorts.  Is it suggested that this Bill will be used against people who honestly believe that an amenity should not be destroyed, who honestly believe that a right-of-way, say, should not be taken from them even though somebody can go back so many years and quote some particular Act to show that it is not a right-of-way and can never have been because it has been in the possession of this family or that family for generations?  I honestly believe people are entitled to make a peaceful protest against incursions on amenities that have been enjoyed by them and by generations before them.</P>
    <P>I believe that, despite the law, people must have the right to protest against the demolition of buildings, for instance.  People protested successfully in recent times in one particular case. I believe they have the right to protest against the destruction of amenities which they believe should be preserved. I believe people's voices should be heard much more often.  It surprises me at times that people should appear to be so docile.  We are supposed to be a nation of rebels and revolutionaries. On the other hand, we are told we are a democracy.  Democracy, as far as the people are concerned, is exercised only once every three or four years when an election comes around and they vote for the candidates of their choice under the system we have of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>Let no one suggest I am instigating people to break the law but I will always defend the right of people to make peaceful protest.  They are entitled to do that.  What has been described as one of the most democratic <Col N="2599" /> States in the world, Switzerland, consults the people very often.  It is not just left to 74 people to make the decisions.  Here the only decision the people make is on election day when they decide whether or not Deputy O'Kennedy, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, Deputy Tunney or myself will be in this House and, if there is a majority on one side, they make all the decisions for the next three or four years.  I do not believe that is right.  I do not believe that is real democracy.  I do not say there should be mob law, that the people should take over, but regard should be had to their views.  Fianna Fáil cannot pretend or protest that they are the sole custodians of what the people want. One of their famous leaders once said that, when he wanted to know what the people wanted, he looked into his own heart.  With all due respect to him, I do not think he could understand the mood of the people in all situations by just looking into his own heart.</P>
    <P>Apart from squatting, section 4 prevents comment.  Section 4 attacks the freedom of the Press, provides for guilt by association and provides that a person is guilty until he is proved innocent.  I believe the existing law governing incitement is quite sufficient. Why then this new section?  If it is a crime to squat then it is a crime to incite.  I do not know what guilt by association can mean or how it will be interpreted.  Does it mean that if some journalist is reported as having encouraged or advocated something then everybody associated with him will be guilty of the same offence? Does it mean that the sub editor, the compositor and every person employed in that particular newspaper office will be guilty by association?  Does it mean, and it did mean this in trade union legislation proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party, that all the members of a trade union can be held responsible for some particular act merely because they were members of the trade union? Does it mean that if a football pitch is invaded everyone who goes on to the pitch will be regarded as guilty by association or guilty of forcible <Col N="2600" /> entry.  That is what is provided in this piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Tunney while he cannot do it now could, on some other part of the Bill, give us the benefit of his views on the submission made by the NUJ because they do not lightly produce letters like this.  They should be heard.  They have pointed out the dangers not only to their newspapers but to themselves.  Deputy Tunney is particularly interested in them.  They are very worried about their position in the event of their reporting certain incidents or contributing an article or a column to a newspaper on certain topics.  They do not take up the attitude they have adopted now lightly.  For that reason their views should be considered by the Minister for Justice.  We cannot get any view from the Minister, even by way of interjection, because he is lost for the past two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we shall not get to a stage that has been reached in other countries such as Portugal where all news is censored.  This Bill does not say that all news should be censored but it is a beginning.  How far Fianna Fáil will go in other legislation I do not know.  In Portugal, all news, all editorials are censored and, in fact, everything going into a newspaper there must get the censorship stamp. Surely we shall not begin to embark on that sort of course.  As I have said, <Col N="2602" /> the editorials produced in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on 4th June and in the <i>Independent</i> on 17th June could not&mdash;I defy anybody to say otherwise&mdash;be produced if this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>It may be a vain boast but I want to say this.  Politics have been changing rapidly in this country.  Nobody knows when there will be a general election. Many people think that because we are Members of this House we should know approximately when the election will be.  I do not know when it will be and as far as this party is concerned we do not care how soon. But if we have any say in the next Parliament&mdash;Deputy Davern can note this date for the record, 27th July, 1971, at three minutes past ten&mdash;if the Labour Party have any say in the matter, this Bill if passed by this House will be repealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief but I should like to refute much that has been said by many Opposition Deputies and which is completely designed to mislead the publc in regard to this Bill.  As the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Kennedy, stated there is no reference whatever to the Press or to radio or to television in section 4 which this amendment purports to deal with.  An argument has been put up there that members of the Press are above all suspicion, that they are totally immune from any law. Any member of the Press is an ordinary citizen and the Press has its black sheep as well as politics or any other walk of life.  It is just as likely that a small minority of the Press will be as guilty as some of the people who would attempt to disrupt law and order.  These are the people the Bill is intended to deal with, those who would try to usurp the rights of others or take over the property of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a great believer in the saying that a man's home is his castle.  If he has paid for that home, or if he is working hard for that home which probably will not be paid for until he is 65, then by heavens he has every right to defend that home by any means according to his own strength and resources.  We have Deputies, not on this side of the House, who guard their homes with alsatians.  Is that an <Col N="2603" /> anti-squatting measure?  In view of the fact that legislation is reportedly being brought in in Britain to deal with these savage hound dogs, I wonder are they licensed.  The interesting point is that those who presume to tell us that we are introducing fascist legislation here are themselves&mdash;one or two of them at least&mdash;taking private steps to deal with any squatters or intruders using their own means.</P>

      <P>The amendment here would seem to set people in the Press, radio and television above the ordinary citizen.  This is totally immoral in legislation as far as I am concerned. The fact that a man, because of this amendment might advocate the possession of some property by forcible means on the street corner and be <Col N="2604" /> prosecuted for so doing but would be allowed to go on television and radio where he would gain the ears and minds of millions of people and would not be prosecuted is totally immoral. This is peculiar in that the Fine Gael Party a fortnight ago were asking for law and order in this country.  They asked the Government to enforce law and order effectively.  Now they oppose this Bill which will deal with some of those who would attempt to usurp the rights of citizens.  It is interesting to note that the amendment says:</P>
      <P>... after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;verbally (otherwise than on radio or television)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If he writes it, it is all right: if he stands on a platform and says: &ldquo;I am going to advocate something and I want you to do this with your full hearts and souls&rdquo; and then hands out a leaflet and says: &ldquo;That is what I want you to do&rdquo;, he is not liable to prosecution.  But the innocent person who may stand up, not being as clever as some of the backroom boys in these organisations are, may jeopardise himself by being misled by those concerned. I have no legal connections but there are some legal Members in the House, particularly on the Opposition benches, and I ask them to look again at their amendment.  To me it seems totally inconsistent to be putting some sections of the community on a pedestal and granting them diplomatic licence, as it were, to do or say as they wish.  The Press is not always proper and correct in its editorials even though it may agree or disagree with us.  They are not bibles and have no right to assume they should be.  I see nothing in this Bill dealing with the freedom of the Press.  I agree with the whole concept of squatting in the Bill and I am sure 100 per cent of the party agree with it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is nothing whatsoever in this Bill about protest, that is the ordinary, recognised protest that we see every day, but it is to deal with those who would presume to use militancy or brute force.  I speak with particular reference to two organisations who seem to make a full-time occupation of urging others to do their dirty work or to implement their ideas for them but who themselves stay in the background.  Deputy Corish also mentioned a case where somebody was charged with inciting.  I think we all know who the person is.

      <P>There is a deliberate plan in this House by Opposition Deputies to mislead the people totally and to obstruct legislation, and indeed, to usurp the time of the House.  They are going on a joint protest tomorrow night.  I do not know if the Opposition in the House plan to do so but those in opposition outside the House plan to march to Aras an Uachtaráin tomorrow night and to ask An tUachtarán not to sign the Bill.  In other words, they recognise that the <Col N="2606" /> Bill will be passed in this House but they are obstructing it so that they can disrupt everything, including legislation which could have been piloted through the House by now.  This is a totally irresponsible attitude.  Inasmuch as people who have led campaigns outside the House have also led other campaigns, this would add to the long list of degrees they have for irresponsibility and lack of interest in the nation as a democracy.</P>
      <P>A question was raised&mdash;again in connection with Deputy Corish's reference to the Constitution and the type of democracy practised in this country&mdash;with regard to the voting system.

      <P>I should like to make the point in regard to the question of guilt by association, that those who would incite others or would urge others, who are the instigators of squatting and forcible entry, are the people that should be covered in the Bill because it is often the case that the individuals who actually occupy the houses are a very innocent type of people.  I do not know whether it is their mental capacity or other circumstances which may result in their being led on.  The persons who lead them are the persons who, in my opinion, are far more guilty.  This is obvious to many of the Fine Gael Deputies and, indeed, to some of the Labour Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of censorship has been raised in connection with this Bill. The Opposition know&mdash;each and every Deputy knows&mdash;that we are not any different from them as to where we come from, what we come from and whom we know and speak to.  We are not Hitlers any more than they are.  If this matter is raised, I must say that, as far as I am aware, the only Government ever in the history of this State to intern a journalist in Southern Ireland or to commit a journalist to <Col N="2608" /> jail was the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>

      <P>The point is that the members of the Opposition are accusing us of introducing facist legislation, of censorship of the Press.  There is not one word in that Bill about Press, radio or television.

They know it to be totally untrue that we aim in any way to interfere with the freedom of the Press.  Indeed, the accusation has been made that the Press who attend this House will not be allowed to report any statement that a Deputy makes that may be against any Government action in respect of legislation that they introduce.  This is a deliberate and totally irresponsible attempt by Opposition Deputies to bring down the House and the reputation and standard of the House.  Not least in their minds is the object of bringing down the Government.</P>

They want to be the knights in shinning armour, be the heroes, be against the fascist Government, as they claim.  Remember this much.  Since 1932 we have had only two interrupted periods of Government.  We have been accused before of being fascists and will probably be accused again.  The more muck thrown at this Government, the more muck thrown at these benches, the more we like it because I can assure the Deputies opposite the people have never paid attention to them, to their muck or any other kind of dirt they try to throw at us. Wild, irresponsible accusations will <Col N="2610" /> never be listened to.  It is a well known fact that the people on this side are of the people, by the people and for the people.

      <P>If Deputies on the opposite benches can agree with that then what they have been saying a few weeks ago is totally inconsistent with the views of the people who have elected them here.  Those who try to usurp the rights of others do not deserve mercy.  This Bill is specifically to deal with those people.  Each and every one of the Deputies opposite knows in his heart and soul it is to deal with subversives who would try to use innocent people to take over office buildings, disrupt economic development, disrupt ordinary progress in the country.  These people are the people the Deputies over there are trying to protect under this Bill.  Any newspaperman, anyone who advocates that these <Col N="2612" /> people are right, is equally as guilty as the person who enters the building. The vast majority of journalists are looked up to and they exercise a wide influence in this country.  I know what the idea of most of the Deputies behind this is.  It is so that they will get a good coverage in the papers each week for the rest of the year.</P>
