    <P>The Dáil, according to order, went into Committee on Finance to consider Supplementary Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31st March, 1972.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £40,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for contributions to the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, Intergovernment Legal Bodies and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; and for other expenses in connection therewith.</P>
      <P>By agreement we are taking with this Supplementary Estimate a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Defence to enable the Government to make £10,000 available to the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional sums under the Vote for International Co-operation are required for a special contribution of £40,000 towards international efforts for the relief of distress in India and Pakistan resulting from the situation in East Pakistan.  Of this amount £20,000 will be contributed to the United Nations High Commission for <Col N="1475" /> Refugees (UNHCR) and £20,000 to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</P>
    <P>Deputies are by now only too well aware of the desperate plight of the victims of the civil war in Pakistan. It is, indeed, a profound tragedy that this man-made disaster should follow so soon after the tidal disaster of almost unprecedented proportions, which the people of East Pakistan suffered last November.  It will be recalled that at that time the Irish Red Cross Society sent £5,000 worth of relief supplies to Pakistan and that at the end of March the Dáil voted 25,000 dollars for an emergency contribution to UNICEF for its relief and rehabilitation programme for women and children in the tidal disaster areas.</P>
    <P>The present tragic situation bringing strife, death and destruction has aroused world-wide concern for the plight of the enormous number of refugees who have poured from East Pakistan into India during the past three months and are now estimated at over 6,000,000 people.  They belong to every religious persuasion of the region&mdash;Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist and Christian.  They come from every social class and age group.  When it is recalled that this massive influx has occurred in an area where there is already a very great demographic problem, Deputies will have some idea of the immensity and complexity of the situation.</P>
    <P>On 19th May last, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, at the request of the Government of India, earnestly appealed on behalf of the United Nations family to Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations as well as private sources to help meet the urgent needs for humanitarian assistance in the present tragic situation.  The Secretary-General announced at the same time that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees would act as the focal point for the co-ordination of assistance for all the organisations from the UN system for refugees from East Pakistan in India.  From the beginning of the trouble in East Pakistan the Secretary-General was <Col N="1476" /> also in touch with the Government of Pakistan about the provision of humanitarian assistance.  That Government indicated their requirements to him on 22nd May.  There is an immediate and continuing need for vast supplies of food and clothing and the provision of shelter.  Many refugees are also in need of urgent medical attention. Thankfully the cholera epidemic which threatened the area and which has claimed thousands of lives appears to be under a measure of control at this stage.  With the onset of the monsoon rains the threat of pneumonia has become very real and is imposing a further strain on the already overburdened facilities.</P>
    <P>The Government have considered it desirable to respond as generously as possible to the appeal of the Secretary-General and accordingly they announced on 10th June that they had decided to pledge, subject to Dáil approval, £50,000 towards the international efforts for the relief of distress in India and in East Pakistan resulting from the situation in East Pakistan.</P>
    <P>Of that amount the Government propose to contribute £20,000 to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), £20,000 to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and £10,000 to the Irish Red Cross Society.  In addition the Minister for Agriculture is arranging to provide through the world food programme a further contribution of £50,000 in cash and kind for relief of distress in the area.  This brings the total of Government aid for the relief of the victims of the strife in East Pakistan to a total of £100,000.  The Government, of course, also contribute to the annual budgets of a number of international aid organisations, including those I have mentioned, and a portion of their regular budgets is also being used for the relief of the refugees.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention that substantial aid has been provided by the Churches in Ireland and by voluntary bodies and other private sources throughout the country.  It is only right that I should express appreciation of the generous response on the part of the Irish people to this tragic refugee problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> The response made by Government and non-governmental organisations has been notable.  By 1st July over 46 million dollars in cash and in kind had been pledged to the High Commissioner's fund.  The amount in cash and in kind, paid, delivered or pledged by Governments on a bi-lateral basis and by non-governmental agencies, was estimated as of 10th July at 114 million dollars bringing the total effort announced by the international community on behalf of the refugees from East Pakistan in India to a total of 160.5 million dollars.</P>
    <P>Red Cross aid for the suffering refugees is being channelled by the League of the Red Cross Societies to support a programme being carried out by the Indian Red Cross Society at the request of the Indian Government. In response to the appeal by the League the various National Societies had, up to the end of June, contributed over £1.4 million in cash and materials.  The Irish Red Cross Society have already contributed £8,000 to the League and have forwarded medicines valued at £2,250 to the Indian Red Cross Society.  The Government's contribution of £10,000 will enable the Irish Red Cross Society to offer further aid for the relief efforts.</P>
    <P>The first priority in the present tragic situation is to get aid to those who are suffering and to do so in ways that will not sharpen the political animosities that exist.  However, it is essential that a permanent solution be found to the problem and the means by which the refugees can return to their homes, without fear be relentlessly sought.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that consistent with the need for human solidarity and international co-operation in the face of so great a refugee problem, the people of this country would wish the Government to respond on their behalf to the appeal of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.  The passing of these Supplementary Estimates will be a practical indication of the sympathy and concern felt in this country for the plight of the refugees from East Pakistan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Dáil will, of course, give unanimous support to the proposal <Col N="1478" /> of the Government to donate £50,000 to the relief of refugees from East Pakistan.  As we do so, let us not for a moment be smug or complacent about the position.  We are making a contribution which on present known figures of refugees, who in India alone are now believed to number nearly 7,000,000, is less than 1p per head for each of those refugees.  The Indian Government from their own resources and sources of help available to them, are spending about 4s per day on each of those refugees, so that some idea of the insignificance of our contribution can quickly be seen.</P>
      <P>The problem in Asia particularly in the Indian and Pakistani regions is one of a very serious and disturbing nature. There we have a situation in which millions of people are already living on the precipice of death because of chronic disease, hunger, undernourishment and exposure to the elements.  It is tragic indeed in such a depressed area, in which the forces of nature make living harsh, that man through folly or greed should now have multiplied the difficulties of everybody there, because the difficulties arise, not merely for the unfortunate refugees, but for the host country and for the country from which the refugees came, because of the infliction of immense cruelty, barbarity and suffering in that region at present and we feel so utterly helpless about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us, therefore, readily give this token assistance&mdash;that is all I fear it is&mdash;and at the same time reflect upon the need to assist any international insituations in preventing similar man-made tragedies occurring in the future and providing some solution to the difficulties which have already arisen.  Although for the first time in the history of man all nations have subscribed to the universal declaration of human rights which recognises the right of every individual to freedom and a decent standard of living, we now have a known 55 million refugees in the world, people who are prevented either through deliberate, man-made action or through fear from living in the land of their birth, people who have to endure untold suffering, lives seemingly without hope because <Col N="1479" /> the political ambitions of others make life near to impossible for them.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Refugee Organisation do their best to provide relief but I believe such relief is no more than a palliative at any time and that is no more than what we are offering today.  This country has a special mission in the world as a country which has no reason to engender hostility anywhere because we have no ambition except to serve mankind, no ambition to dominate any other people, no history of dominating any other people or wanting to interfere in other people's differences.  In that situation we should take more initiative than we do to offer ourselves as mediators in any areas of tension that may develop. In this particular region people, both Pakistani and Indian, regard the people of Ireland as their friends.  It is some cause of pride to us that three Members of this House have been chosen by international organisations to examine the situation on the spot. The fact that they were invited to do so and were well received is an indication that no country feels any resentment towards us.</P>
    <P>For our own good we need to look out on the world to see that the problems outside frequently are greater than our own.  It may help us sometimes to see our own difficulties in proper perspective.  In comparison with the days in which we achieved our freedom, one of the difficulties nowadays is that when troubles arise they become matters of rivalry between the great international Powers.  At one time&mdash;we were lucky in making our break then&mdash;people striving for freedom and justice and the right to control their own affairs had only to fight against the occupying Power in their territory.  Nowadays any people struggling for freedom and creating any kind of international excitement attract to that area the rivalry, the jealousy and the vicious anxiety of the great international Powers.</P>
    <P>One of the terrible tragedies in Pakistan at the moment is that the Pakistani Government know they can get arms from a number of different nations.  Each nation that is supplying <Col N="1480" /> arms is afraid to stop the supply because, by doing so, they would leave the avenue of supply open to their rivals and thereby lose areas of influence. In a situation like this we should never seek to exert a political influence when we are offering aid of the type we are approving today.  To do otherwise would create fears in the mind of the host Government.  It must be a cause of some regret to us to read in today's papers reports that the Indian Government have asked for the withdrawal from India of all foreign workers who have been assisting the refugees in recent weeks.  I suspect that this arises because of the anxiety of the Indian Government that all the people helping in that work were not neutral and, perhaps, some have been endeavouring to exert political influence.</P>
    <P>The Irish people would be most anxious that any Irish workers in the refugee camps should be allowed to remain there.  Clearly it gives an added incentive to a country to give help if the people know that the help is being administered by their own nationals. I believe, and I hope I am justified in this belief, that any of our relief workers are not interested in exerting political influence and that their interest is the humanitarian one of relieving suffering.  It is necessary to divorce political considerations from humanitarian considerations when offering aid. We must, as the Minister has suggested, consider what steps can be taken to provide a long-term solution.</P>
    <P>There are already 55 million known refugees in the world.  These people have little prospect of returning to their countries.  I had the opportunity of visiting a region where there are 600,000 refugees&mdash;they were the Palestinian refugees in Jordan.  They live in camps in appalling conditions.  They were received with hospitality by the Jordanian Government but a tragedy developed there in which the stresses, the strains and the frustrations of the refugees exploded into hostility against their host Government.  As India today holds out a hand of friendship and renders assistance to refugees, she cannot be unmindful of the possibility that six or seven million refugees residing <Col N="1481" /> permanently on her territory must create new political, social and military tensions in the future unless some way is found to allow the refugees to return without fear to East Bengal. They must be allowed to return without suffering the loss of their holdings or any other disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if he or the Irish delegation at the United Nations have attempted to take any initiative in this field.  I do not imagine that from our little remote island on the western fringe of Europe we could know fully the problem or provide the solution.  However, as I said before, we should try to encourage other countries to assist Pakistan and India and the people of that region to work out a solution for themselves. That solution must come quickly.  The longer the refugees are left in their present plight, the more difficult it becomes to reinstate them and the political regime, which is the cause of their moving, will be more opposed to their return.  As has happened in the past, the refugees will be treated as people who have abandoned the country from which they fled and they will be considered not deserving of any rights.  Like all mankind, these people have fundamental rights which transcend any political jealousies, rivalries and passing tensions.  If the United Nations is to be respected and to fulfil the role which destiny has marked for it, it must provide an expeditious remedy.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this money is being voted under a type of international co-operation which includes the Council of Europe.  I was saddened to see an article recently that was critical of that organisation and of expenditure in relation to it.  The article expressed criticisms which I have heard uttered only by the colonels in Greece&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if this is relevant to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair will bear with me, I think its relevance will be seen.  The Council of Europe may seem to some people to be no more than a talking shop, but the great achievement of the council is that not only has it its Covenant of Human <Col N="1482" /> Rights but it has a way of enforcing it.  It has its Commission on Human Rights and its Court of Human Rights.  If a European government behaved in the way we have seen the Pakistani Govment behave in recent times, that Government would find themselves charged with the most serious offences before the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.  It is regrettable that the United Nations has not yet developed machinery of that kind so that the fundamental rights of individuals could be asserted, irrespective of the embarrassment that might be caused to political regimes.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, at the moment many governments and institutions are hesitant about making complaints regarding the behaviour of a sovereign government because they consider a sovereign government are entitled to behave in any manner they wish in their own domain.  We live in a world community and, if we accept the fundamental equality of all men, we cannot accept that any government have the right to engage in brutal and inhumane conduct towards their own citizens, no matter how justified they may feel in doing so in relation to political ambitions.</P>
      <P>We are glad to see that the £10,000 which is going to the Irish Red Cross is to be given directly by the Red Cross to the League of Red Cross Societies.  It is most regrettable that the Irish Red Cross and the Irish Government should have been placed in a situation in which they disgraced this country and seriously embarrassed the International Red Cross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to discuss today the manner in which this money is to be channelled towards the object which is set out in the Minister's proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These contributions are for the relief of distress in India and Pakistan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are also entitled to ensure that the money goes towards <Col N="1483" /> the relief of distress in Pakistan.  We are also obliged to ensure that never again is money misdirected and we are also obliged to ensure that when a Minister asks for money in this House he will give an assurance to the House that proper accounting procedure will be followed so that, when the House comes to consider the Estimate at the end of the year and review the preceding year, the Minister will be in a position to prove to the House that the money voted for a particular purpose was spent for that purpose and no other.</P>
      <P>We are also entitled on an occasion such as this, when we are giving £10,000 to the Irish Red Cross, to say to the Government that we must never again use the Irish Red Cross for any political purpose no matter how laudable that purpose may be, and no matter how anxious we may be to achieve a particular purpose.  The success of the International Red Cross has been that it is divorced from politics and that it does not on any occasion seek to exert political influence or bring about changes in political philosophy.</P>
      <P>The object of the International Red Cross is to relieve human suffering and, to be selective in the manner in which you provide that relief, or to cause political embarrassment to the Red Cross, is to do serious disservice not only to the Red Cross but to all mankind, and particularly to the people whom it is intended to relieve.  These are terribly important considerations for us to have in mind when we are giving our approval to these proposals. We assume from what the Minister has told us that the money will be channelled directly to the League of Red Cross Societies.  If that is so we have no reason to fear that there will be any further embarrassment, or that Ireland will again give any cause to the International Red Cross to make any complaint against us.  It should not have happened in the past and I hope that the Government and people of Ireland have learned a lesson and will ensure that it does not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House <Col N="1484" /> is aware, all three political parties have been represented in a group of observes in that area.  Deputy Loughnane and Deputy Esmonde are out there at present.  I believe that at the moment they are in the Calcutta area.  I think we all regret&mdash;and I certainly do&mdash; that they are not able to be here to add their voices to this discussion on the Estimate before us.  I have seen reports of statements made by them in the area.  I fully agree with them.  I think, therefore, that there is agreement between the Deputies who have visited the area and the basis for a very wide measure of agreement among all parties here, as there should be, about this very terrible problem.</P>
      <P>This is probably the greatest human disaster that has occurred both in scale and intensity since the end of the Second World War, and certainly since the partition of the Indian sub-continent. As the Minister has said, this is a man-made disaster.  Man-made disasters have something particularly terrible about them, not only in the evils of the passions involved which create such disasters, but also in their relative irreparability.  If farmers have been driven out of an area by a flood, or a cyclone, or a natural disaster, usually after some time they can count on being able to return.  Usually they can also count on international aid, uncomplicated by political opposition and calculation.</P>
      <P>None of these factors applies in the case of victims of man-made disasters. Refugees who have left in such circumstances may never be able to return to their homes.  They can never be integrated into the society to which they have come.  That remains very largely a fact about the refugees who crossed from Pakistan into India and possibly the other way also.  At the time of the partition of the sub-continent, millions of people remained in West Bengal in the Calcutta area who crossed 20 years ago, who are unabsorbed and unemployed and who have found no role in the society to which they have come and no hope of return to the society which they left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present dimensions of the problem are known in a sense and, in another sense, are incapable of being <Col N="1485" /> imagined because of their very scale. The number of refugees is somewhere between six million and seven million. The conditions as I saw them last week are not, perhaps, at first sight so immediately shocking as Press reports, based on the first wave of refugees before the organisation of their reception was undertaken, might have given one to suppose.  Most of the refugees are now in receipt of regular though inadequate rations.  Most of them have some shelter.  The shelter ranges from cowsheds&mdash;and these are the élite places for refugees because they provide completely adequate shelter&mdash;to tents for which there is competition because they are made of tarpaulin and provide shelter against the monsoon rains, to straw huts some of which are about the length of four of these benches and about that high accommodating families of five or six huddling in these shelters under the monsoon rains in conditions of very great misery.</P>
    <P>The danger of a cholera epidemic appears to be contained for the moment as a result of a very fine and well organised mass inoculation effort organised by the Indian Government and using procedures by which one person can inoculate 1,000 people an hour.  This seems incredible but it is being done.  In this effort, of course, both official international organisations and voluntary organisations such as &ldquo;War on Want&rdquo; and &ldquo;Save the Children&rdquo; have played and are playing a very useful part.</P>
    <P>There have been references to the role of Irish voluntary workers in this work and I should like now to join with the other speakers here in paying tribute to these.  Deputy Ryan made reference, rightly and understandably, to the report which has appeared to the effect that the Indian Government may ask relief workers to leave India.  I do not think we should take an alarmist view of this. I imagine the Minister will confirm me in that.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of having some discussion on this subject with Father Raymond Kennedy in Calcutta just before he went to join the Irish group in the Garo Hills on the northern frontier of East Pakistan.  He told me <Col N="1486" /> of what he regarded as the understandable reservations the Indian Government had about relief groups working in sensitive areas and also of the good relations his group has with the local authorities in the area in which they are working and at whose invitation they are there.  The chief co-ordinator of refugee relief in India, Colonel Liuthra, said that the Government had taken a policy decision that all relief work among the refugees be handled by Indians unless a specific request is made for help from abroad.  This is very significant.  It is also very natural and wholly understandable that, in this situation, which, as well as being a human disaster also involves security aspects which threaten yet further human disaster, no Indian Government could agree to absolutely unrestricted activity by foreign groups in the area, without any supervision, or without any request from the Government of India.  I imagine that is all the statement means.</P>
    <P>In any case, while we are right to provide the aid we are providing, it seems to be on rather a small scale compared with what we have provided for previous disasters and considering the scale of this one.  However, it may not be the final aid.  Whatever we may think about international aid forthcoming for this, we must not lose sight of the central fact that the Government of India and the Indian people have been bearing the overwhelming force of the tremendous strain of this event and have been and are doing, and doing very efficiently, most of the work, work which requires a tremendous amount of bureaucratic organisation even to supply such an enormous mass of people, twice the population of this republic, with regular rations and to look after their most pressing health needs.  I say most pressing because the refugees, although they are being kept alive from day to day, are only barely being kept alive.  They are living on what is essentially a malnutrition diet. If one goes into places in which they are living one notices, for example, that about half the children are playing. As we know, children will play in almost any conditions, particularly if the sun comes out and there is a little bit of open space around; about half <Col N="1487" /> the children are playing and about half are sitting or lying there staring into space.  We know what the implications of that are for their health and we find it hard to see just what the future can be for these children as well as for their parents.</P>
    <P>In relation to this man-made disaster we have to ask ourselves how long will this disaster last, because the actual presence of the refugees, the life of the refugees, is itself a continuing disaster.  They have nothing to do. These people were, in the main, small farmers.  They include all kinds of people, as the Minister knows but, in the main, they are small farmers who cultivated two or three acres of rice, three crops a year, in the great monsoon region of the eastern part of the sub-continent.  We hear a great deal, and it is right that we should, about Indian and Pakistan poverty; in the cities in particular it is very terrible, but people can lead a decent life if they have a few acres in the country, a surprisingly good life.  These had that life.  They have it no more and they are, in the main, lying there listlessly and helplessly in these camps.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking of a disaster which has happened and is now over.  The very life of these refugees is a continuing disaster and, of course, refugees are continuing to come in; they are coming in at the rate of about 2,000 a day.  The Indian Government fears that the dimensions of the problem may grow to the incredible figure of 10,000,000 if things go on as they are.  We here, in our small way, remote from this disaster, may be approached again and again.  The Minister may have to come here for further contributions to enable the disaster not to become worse, to enable it to continue at its present level.  That makes urgent the question raised in the last section of the Minister's speech where he says that it is essential that a permanent solution be found to the problem of the means by which the refugees can return to their homes without fear. That is certainly true and I think we can underline the words &ldquo;without fear&rdquo; because we have seen in our time, and even within the past five <Col N="1488" /> years, a situation where refugees were told they could safely return to the area from which they had come; they were even urged by their own Government to do so.  Their return was followed by a second massacre.  That happened at one phase of the events leading to the Nigerian civil war and nobody who remembers that could take the responsibility of urging the Pakistani refugees to go back to their homes on anything less than a virtual certainly that they would not be the victims of further excesses.</P>
    <P>What can be done then to enable the refugees to return to their homes? We appreciate and understand the Minister's diplomatic responsibility and his necessary diplomatic reticence on certain things, but I hope that, when he is closing this brief discussion&mdash;I would not call it a debate; there is nothing polemical about it&mdash; he will be able to give us some indication of the position he will take up on this as a political problem and the line of approach he may take with friendly countries, or in concert with friendly countries, and what he is likely to do about this at the United Nations.  The urgency and the nature of this problem are generally known and they carry within themselves, I think inevitably and logically, the answer to the only conditions on which the refugees can safely return home.</P>
    <P>The population of East Pakistan were asked to express their views in elections the fairness of which cannot be challenged because they were conducted under the authority of the present government of Pakistan. Among a population of 72 million people, there was a majority of 137 out of 139 for the Awami League which, if the parliamentary session had met afterwards, would have given the Awami League a majority, not only in East Pakistan, but in Pakistan as a whole, Of course, parliament never met.  Its convening was postponed.  Disturbances occurred in East Pakistan and the Pakistan army retaliated with terror, first, against the Awami League &mdash;the political organisation of the majority of the population, mainly Muslims&mdash;of East Pakistan and, secondly, against non-Muslims, mainly <Col N="1489" /> Hindus, using these as scapegoats for the repression of the political organisation of the people of East Pakistan.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in relation to that, I should like to commend, if I might humbly do so, the action of the Indian Government in doing their very best&mdash; and very successfully so far&mdash;to prevent any communal backlash inside India; to prevent resentment at the fate of the Hindus of East Pakistan splashing back against the Muslims of India, a population of 60 million. Should the Indian Government be unsuccessful in these matters there could be in the making another tragedy on an even large scale.</P>
    <P>When we accept these facts that are notorious it is clear that the only condition in which the refugees can return safely is the completion of the democratic work, that is to say, the installation in East Pakistan of a government responsible to the people of that area, and the end of military Punjabi rule which, as it works from a considerable distance and through an army that is outnumbered enormously by the people, has taken the path of terrorism as the only effective way, presumably, of maintaining its rule.  I have no wish to deal in stories of atrocities but anyone who visits these camps and talks to the refugees will hear many such stories.  Some of them may possibly be exaggerated and some refugees may have fled because of what they heard had happened in the next place but most of those to whom I talked&mdash; I talked to some directly in English; mainly these were schoolteachers, clerks and people of that type and to some such as ordinary Bengali farmers through an interpreter&mdash;had their own personal experience of destruction and of military violence in their own villages.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the details, a population of this size, more than six million people comprised mainly of small farmers, do not leave their villages and their homes without having adequate reason for so doing because, by leaving, they are giving up everything that was their life.  Not only are they giving up their means of subsistence but they are giving up also their habits, their culture and everything that pertained <Col N="1490" /> to them and made them social human beings.  Of course, this continuing disaster is also a kind of time bomb.  A section of the people of East Pakistan, believing that they are denied democratic outlet and are being crushed, have resorted to guerrilla activity particularly in the eastern part of the area.  The Indian community, on their side, believe that they cannot continue indefinitely to support this situation, a situation in which a town such as, for instance, Tripura, with a population of 30,000 being surrounded now by a refugee population of 100,000.  One can well understand how such an area might not consider that it was capable of supporting that number of people indefinitely.</P>
    <P>As anybody who has visited the area knows, there is talk of war.  This talk is discouraged by the Indian Government and by Mrs. Gandhi but there is a danger that this situation may get out of hand.  In short, there is a real threat to the peace.  Sometimes the phrase &ldquo;threat to the peace&rdquo; is invoked to raise any issue which it might be convenient to raise but which does not actually involve a serious threat. I notice that the Minister is smiling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

      <P>I was wondering why the Deputy was smiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is not for either of us a smiling matter. It is a profoundly serious matter and one that is a real threat to peace.  In these conditions it is impossible not to be alarmed at the sluggishness and I would even say, callousness, with which the international community generally has responded to so enormous a problem. There seems to be no sense of urgency in dealing with it.  Certain countries, the US among them, have continued sending arms shipments with certain qualifications to the effect that they may be about to cut off further supplies.  Arms in the hands of Pakistan soldiers are at the origin of this situation.  I do not care whether these arms were supplied by the US, by China or any other country but it was these arms in these hands that created this disaster and that can create further disaster.  There is ground for a very <Col N="1491" /> clear statement from as many countries as possible, including this country, repudiating and rejecting such arms deals and calling for the cessation of all military aid to Pakistan until such time as this situation has righted itself.</P>
      <P>There are many situations, and this is one of them, in which a small country, even one remote like ours and lacking in material or military power, can serve to ventilate effectively a problem which is troubling the conscience of human beings generally and which is troubling these ordinary human consciences very much more than it troubles the conscience&mdash;a very rudimentary organ&mdash;of any great Power.  Small countries can serve to mobilise opinion on this and to assert some pressure&mdash;I do not care how much pressure but some&mdash;on the great Powers in relation to their position in this situation.</P>
      <P>From that point of view and considering the scale of the disaster and considering the threat to world peace, I think the Security Council should have been called together.  If it proved impossible to call them together by reason of the resistance of any of the great Powers, a move should be made for a special or emergency session of the General Assembly if only for the purpose of marking the concern of mankind generally in relation to this situation. When we consider a figure that is more than the six million mark we cannot say: &ldquo;Let the Indians take care of it&rdquo; or &ldquo;It is no concern of ours because we are so far away.&rdquo; There are between six and seven million people involved in a continuing disaster and constituting now a threat to peace which will affect all of us if, which God forbid, India and China should be drawn into conflict in the area which is a possibility not ruled out of consideration in New Delhi. Then a chain of events might be set going which would, indeed, involve all of us in a personal way not just as a question of remote humanitarian concern but as something directly affecting us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister, if I may, to do two things&mdash;<Col N="1492" /> to give the Dáil and the country some indication of his thinking on these wider aspects and also to consult with like-minded countries &mdash; I believe Canada, for example, would be one&mdash; to see what kind of international initiative might be most effective here.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Frank Aiken, on certain occasions, took initiatives of this kind which, I believe, heightened his stature and that of this country internationally and, more important, were of actual use in the reduction of international tension. The Minister now has an opportunity for such an initiative.  I believe he would wish to take it if he saw it open to him.  I should like very much to hear what he would say about these wider aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a tragic matter and it is right that this Parliament should contribute, as is being done here.  The problem, as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien has pointed out, is of very large proportions and ultimately threatens to involve the whole world. I think the problem which faces the Indian Government here, and the necessity for understanding that problem before we rush to offer opinions or criticism is not sufficiently realised. Here is a case where refugees numbering millions have been suddenly translated across a border and are proving a very real problem for the host country organisationally apart from all the other implications.</P>
      <P>Apart from the organisational problem and the humanitarian problem, there are political and more than political problems in that the peace along that whole border area on both sides is threatened and, in fact, is being disrupted. There is then the threat of war for this country which in no way was responsible for the situation which developed, a war which could ultimately affect all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is of vast proportions and I have not got very much personal knowledge so there is very little I can contribute to a debate like this, but the point I want to make is that we should have an understanding of the size of the problem and a certain discipline in our approach to it.  I am <Col N="1493" /> thinking of the criticism that the Indian Government were placing restrictions on outsiders.  Again we must realise the size of this problem.  This is not a question of a couple of hundred refugees in a small area.  This is not a question of a magnitude with which we are familiar.  This is something that requires a vast organisation comparable to a war organisation and it is a problem that could only be faced by a power&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;power&rdquo; in a general sense&mdash;with the capacity to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There are one or two fortunate aspects of this disastrous situation.  India is a powerful and organised country. The state of India is large and better organised fortunately than it is usually understood to be in this part of the world.  The Indian Government are capable of handling the local situation within its own borders as has been proved.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, who has been there, said that the efficiency and the results obtained have been truly remarkable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This fact should be realised.  It is a great credit to the Indian Government and to the Indian people.  That fact should be appreciated and co-operated with.  There is a very large co-ordinational and organisational problem here and the only proper authority to co-ordinate and direct that within the territory of India is the Indian Government and the Indian State.</P>
      <P>Of course, I am not decrying the goodwill and the generous and admirable humanitarian efforts of volunteers from other places in the world but it is only reasonable that their efforts should be subordinated to the overall organisation of the Indian Government. For that reason, I think criticism of that Government in that way would be out of place in the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To develop this into a subject of controversy would be doing a great disservice to the whole cause in which we are interested and about which the whole world is so anxious.  Not only is there an organisational and co-ordinational problem but there is also <Col N="1494" /> a very big political problem.  I believe that unrestrained interference by outsiders in local political problems, by and large, tends to do more harm than good.  There is always this danger in a situation like this aggravated in this case by the political implications of the whole world scene here.  We have had the unfortunate experience of Nigeria and Biafra.  In this case, where the Indian Government are quite capable of dealing with this side of the problem, they should get all the assistance&mdash;material, volunteers, everything&mdash;but in an orderly way and under their orderly direction.  So much for what might be called the local aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>I have not been there and would not presume to discuss details but on the larger basis it is quite clear that all that can be done by the Indian Government is to alleviate this very great refugee problem.  They may even be faced with attempting some permanent settlement which is never an easy thing. Short of warlike action they are confined to their own territory in tackling the problem.  Historically the Indians have proved themselves to be amongst the most fundamentally peaceful people in the world and in recent times have demonstrated that attitude also.  Therefore, it falls to the remainder of the world to see what can be done to go to the roots of the problem and solve it.</P>
    <P>I understand part of this aid is going to the United Nations which appears to be the rational and proper centre through which other nations can operate.  I do not know enough about the problem in detail nor have I the experience to be able to offer gratuitous advice to the Minister as to what we should do but we must recognise that there is an over all threatening situation. As in nearly all crisis situations in recent years, there is inherent in this situation the possibility of local war with a threat of global expansion. Perhaps realisation of this threat is one of the best ways of forestalling or preventing further catastrophe.  In the councils of the nations that realisation can be developed.  It seems, therefore, that there is a real role for the United Nations in this matter.  It was comparatively simple for the UN to deal <Col N="1495" /> with problems in Africa or the Middle East but we now have a situation which we may fear is analogous to the situation in which the League of Nations found itself when Abyssinia was invaded and methods of warfare of horrible brutality were employed. The nations of the world in their organisation ultimately found themselves helpless and in acknowledging that fact completely destroyed any power or influence their organisation had when it came to the events that led immediately to the second world war.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is an alarmist statement. But here in some ways are the seeds of greater trouble and&mdash;possibly not yet apparent&mdash;interests on a much larger scale that may come into conflict. To develop such thoughts would not be helpful because they must be alarmist or have alarming overtones. My point is that we are right in doing what we are doing.  The Minister is to be commended on it and also commended because it is oriented towards the United Nations in the beginning at least and it is there one may hope that the voices and actions of the nations of the world can be effective in dealing with the Pakistan problem.</P>
    <P>We should realise, as Deputy O'Brien has said, that such situations may call for more help from all nations but that help must be disciplined and co-ordinated and in so far as the action is within the territory of the Indian Government which undoubtedly has given every evidence that its aims and objects are fundamentally and truly peaceful, that action should be coordinated under their supervision.  The situation should not be complicated by disconnected activities no matter how well meant.  I say this in an effort to avoid or forestall the type of debate that can develop in cases like this where peoples, nations, groups and interests which have fundamentally the same goal, through lack of understanding, cross each other's bows or impede each other in their drive towards a common objective.</P>
    <P>The reason I say the Indian Government is the proper authority to deal with this problem is that, first, they are the legitimate authority and, <Col N="1496" /> secondly, the problem is on such a scale that only the Indian Government and people can cope with it.  Further, fortunately for humanity, for the refugees and for the peace of the world this great Indian State has the capacity, the organisation and ability to cope with the situation and at least achieve the position in which, as Deputy O'Brien said, the problem is under control although not solved.  It will not be solved until the root causes are eradicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for its contributions and for agreeing to the small financial provision which we have pledged.  I agree with Deputy Cruise-O'Brien that the amount seems to be small in the light of the problem.  The amount we are voting must make us all feel we should do more.  However, if every country according to its means does what we are doing, I think there will be a satisfactory result from the point of view of contributions.  I pay as much attention to the fact that this is a token of our interest in the real problems created by the situation in East Pakistan as it is a direct help to those who need money to supply food and clothing for the refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a discussion here which makes it worthwhile considering some broad principles which should be considered by this House from time to time.  A small but important point is the role of the Dáil in getting information from these areas.  The Deputies who contributed will be aware of the machinery available to my Department &mdash;in this case through the ambassador in India&mdash;and my personal contacts with the ambassadors of the countries concerned.  The fact that we can get informed debate and discussion on problems so important, and at the same time so far away, makes one wonder if this House should not consider sending our own Parliamentary delegation for information if we are seeking a role for this country in international affairs.  At the same time, we must be grateful to the organisations which make it possible for Deputies to visit the areas.  I put out this suggestion merely as an idea.  This is not to take from the very valuable service <Col N="1497" /> made available to me by the civil servants involved in my Department, on the spot and at home.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would mention that the humanitarian aspect of these problems brings an easy response.  We all have a ready compassion for those who are suffering and this House has never been niggardly in its response to requests for help.  I share the view of Deputy Cruise-O'Brien that we may have to help again.  The problem will not be solved by having a debate on one occasion.  It will not be solved until people can return home and find roots.</P>
    <P>To move from the humanitarian aspect of the refugee problem and like problems, to the solution, one is immediately into the principles of involvement in conflict situations, whether international or sectional.  My experience has been that any solution, no matter how obviously it is the correct one, only works if it is accepted by all parties involved in the conflict.  Only to that extent is it a real solution from the point of view of the person concerned in government, whether in foreign affairs or in home affairs.  The wish to offer a solution making it at the same time clear that there is no wish to have a solution imposed by force, means that a person time his efforts to the situation in which a solution is desired and acceptable to the parties involved.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will agree that if you come along with a solution not acceptable to one side, if you insist on proposing it, or trying to find means to impose it by going to larger organisations such as the United Nations, you are not finding a solution.  You are taking sides and destroying the possible role which this country could have in conflict situations.  That is the principle which guides me in this type of international situation.  Deputies, aware of our history, and knowing that there is goodwill for us, think that to offer to mediate would be acceptable immediately.  If Deputies think it out they will realise our usefulness could be diminished considerably if the offer is ill-timed or if any attempt is made to force what would appear to us a reasonable solution but <Col N="1498" /> is one not acceptable to one side or the other in the conflict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that we could not enforce that.  That would be the moral strength of our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree with me that we cannot enforce in terms of military force, but bringing the force of public and international opinion is to use force also.  This does not exclude what Deputies asked me to do.  I shall follow up with our Ambassador to the UN the possibilities of initiatives being taken by us, as long as Deputies accept that my thinking is a reasonable approach to our taking initiatives.</P>
      <P>We have diplomatic relations with Pakistan and we have friendly ties with the people.  We hope Pakistan will find a solution soon to the situation existing in that country and thereby bring peace and stability to the sub-continent. We are following events.  Any initiative will be determined in the light of all the factors involved.  I made known our concern about the situation in Pakistan to the authorities there.  On 26th June the Ambassador of Pakistan to Ireland&mdash;he is resident in London &mdash;travelled to Dublin at my request. We discussed the matter at some length and I told him that the Government, Members of this House and the public generally were gravely disturbed by reports of events in East Pakistan and the massive out-flow of refugees to India.  All of us must be conscious of the dangers in the present situation and I hope both India and Pakistan display the greatest restraint.  I have grave doubts about attempting to involve ourselves directly in searching for a solution at this time.  Unless invited to mediate&mdash;and we have not been invited to mediate&mdash;I would not force myself on the people involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien referred to &ldquo;like-minded people&rdquo; but I think this is covered by my undertaking to follow up in the UN the possibilities of initiatives.  Our first step would be to seek out like-minded people and see if we can find a way to help the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> I should like to put on record, as other Deputies have done, a sincere tribute to the magnificent efforts which India has made in providing refuge and aid for these more than six million people.  As has been said, it would be a daunting task for any country, but it is a particularly heavy burden on India which is strugglng to overcome great obstacles in the way of its own development. India is entitled to look to the international community for all possible humanitarian help in meeting the needs of the refugees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the report in the newspaper this morning, I am awaiting clarification of the position and would prefer not to comment until I have received it.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's explanation is probably correct.  It seems quite reasonable to me that a country would want to control another influx of people in taking care of a problem like that.  It may be, in fact, that adequate personnel are already in India.  I do not think anybody would dispute the right of the Indian Government to decide who will deal with their problems at this time.  They have asked for financial help and I think we should willingly give it without in any way trying to say that the fact that they are dealing with a great tragedy diminishes their right over the movement of people in their own territory so far as helpers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the House again.  This has been a useful debate. From time to time Ireland's role is brought up.  Each time it is&mdash;and it is useful to consider it&mdash;it makes me wonder whether we are playing our role to the full.  If we do not always seem to take action it is because of what I said.  Untimely action can cause you to fall and make you seem to take sides in a dispute which is not your own and reduce, or sometimes remove, your possible usefulness, created by the goodwill which already exists and which is based on the behaviour of our country up to now in many situations.</P>

      <P>Last night, under slight difficulty, I was dealing with the construction of this amendment and the nature of what is involved in it. Today I want to talk about a slightly different matter.  Under the Interpretation Act, 1937, the singular includes the plural.  Therefore the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; here includes a group of persons. There is a difficulty in connection with this kind of situation.  Suppose a visitor to this country goes down to Brittas Bay and erects a camp on the sand dunes there.  He will find that an Act passed by the Fianna Fáil Party in the middle thirties has enabled a well-known Fianna Fáil family to enclose the sand dunes legally&mdash;I do not think they are enclosed any more than they ever were; there is just a low wall&mdash;and somebody representing the owner can order him off.</P>
      <P>There is an old custom in this country and strangely enough that custom which prevailed over most of the island for a long period did not prevail in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  It has now been adopted in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and the people who had control of places where there were beaches have been bought out, but in this part of the country the movement is reversed under this Act of the thirties. Sand dunes which are of no agricultural value are being grabbed by people who charge others a relatively large sum for going in on them when they go for a day's outing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making any case at all against the charge which is made at the Silver Strand by the owner of that fine field.  I understand that the charge is 3s now.  When I used take my family down there it was only 1s.  I always thought that a man who owned a good agricultural field giving access to <Col N="1502" /> a particularly desirable strand was entitled to make a charge if he allowed you to have a picnic in his field.  It is extremely objectionable that in 1971 this House should pass any Bill which would countenance the kind of thing that was done at Brittas Bay.</P>
    <P>Instead of passing this kind of Bill, what the House should be doing at the moment is expropriating these people with modest compensation appropriate to what the place cost them, which was next to nothing.  The various strands in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland which were cut off have all been purchased from the owners and, therefore, there is access to these strands without any payment.  There used to be a sizeable payment in the fifties.  I think it was 2s for a motorcar. I should like to say a word in praise of Wicklow County Council for what they have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is relevant to the amendment.  If the Minister wants me to spell it out for him I will do so in single syllable words. A man comes along and says to a person who has pitched a tent on the sand dunes at Brittas Bay: &ldquo;You have no right to be here.  This is owned by so-and-so.  You get off.&rdquo;  The person who has pitched the tent for the day, or the night, or the week, or whatever period it is, says: &ldquo;How do I know you are acting for the owner?&rdquo; The man says: &ldquo;The man who employs me is well off.  Look at my uniform. I am a person of authority&rdquo;&mdash; a centurion in the Roman army kind of thing, in this private army which this section, as it is now, will allow. I think the Government have a different kind of problem on their hands as regard a much more serious type of private army at the moment and, therefore, it is a bit too much that the Government should be giving recognition to one kind of private army <Col N="1503" /> when, in fact, they are seriously concerned about another kind of private army, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>Let nobody say that we, in this party, give countenance to private armies of any sort.  There is no question that, if these words are taken out of this section, it will become a completely different section.  Last night we had a lengthy lecture&mdash;I do not blame him for it at all; I understand there were similar speeches on this side of the House&mdash;from my friend, Deputy Carter; he was only carrying on the discussion but on several occasions he mentioned the politics of the streets.  Why do people take to the streets?  People take to the streets when they find there is literally no attempt to provide a solution, let alone provide a solution, for their problem. Therefore, the politics of the streets arise only when the Government have not attended to problems.  The politics of the streets in this city have evaporated compared with what they were at various times in the past.  An obvious cause for the politics of the street was the fact that there was a huge list of people looking for houses.</P>
      <P>As I said, the need for this Bill has gone, absolutely gone, and the Government should be turning their attention to other kinds of private armies&mdash;I am sure they are&mdash;rather than to this situation, a situation with which the Minister is pretending he is dealing belatedly.  All he is really doing is proving he is tough in relation to people who have been badly treated in not being provided with the houses that should have been built in the early sixties.  Deputy Carter said he had watched this attempt to interfere with the normal procedure of the law over the past few years.  On the whole, there is no squatting and it is against squatting this is obviously directed, despite the funny title &ldquo;Forcible Entry&rdquo;.  The only squatting in this city today, as far as we know, is that which arises in corporation houses where somebody, a nephew or a niece, or some other relation, moves into a house when the tenant dies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a genuine amendment, absolutely genuine, and, as a <Col N="1504" /> matter of fact, it would greatly improve the nature of the Bill.  It would improve the Bill very considerably, if it is accepted, because it would put on the owner the obligation to assert his right of ownership.  In the Bill as drafted unoccupied land is included. We are not so pressing on the means of subsistence in this country at present, with the population we have, that people should not occupy land for the purposes I have mentioned, putting a caravan on it, or something else.  It is obvious from the amendment introduced yesterday by the Minister that a caravan is not regarded as a mobile home; therefore, a caravan is a vehicle.  We want to remove this reference to a vehicle in this section, and properly so.  This kind of thing must not be left in the Bill.  This Bill is, on the whole, really a statement of the law as it exists.  Deputy Carter referred to Acts of 1381 that we were supposed to be depending on.  Any Act of 1381 which is still in operation is part of the common law and the common law as a whole preserves the rights of owners.  That is the purpose of the common law.  It may look well to make a joke about relating something to an Act of 1381 but the fact is the Act is not in operation still just because it was an Act of 1381; it is still in operation because it was an extremely sensible Act.  People forget most of the legislation which passed through this House in four or five years.  We have not misrepresented the aim of this Bill.  We have not done that at all.  We believe, and the facts have proved us right, that this Bill is unnecessary. The facts have proved us right.</P>

      <P>In this Bill, as drafted, the Government want the Members of Dáil Éireann to behave like lemmings just because the Department of Justice come up with nothing really new at all, except that the Government are tough.  That is the purpose of this Bill, to indicate that the Government are tough.  But the Government are not tough at all, not one bit They will not get us to behave <Col N="1505" /> like lemmings.  That is certain.  We will not have the ordinary liberties of the citizen undermined in this fashion by anybody.</P>
      <P>Earlier I raised a very serious point: this section, as it stands, does allow private armies.  As I said, if you go into a sand dune, which is now preempted by some fellow, he orders you off.  In the first place he has no right to order him off.  This was a law passed by the Fianna Fáil Government in the mid-1930s which had never been the case in this part of the country and the right to own sand dunes has been abolished in Northern Ireland.</P>

Despite the efforts of Sinn Féin, who established that people had the right to walk in, the action in the High Court was settled on the basis that there could be a charge for cars but I understand from some residents of the area that the site was a remarkable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there were efforts by certain Germans to change that tradition but they got their answer from the people of West Cork and rightly so.  If, by tradition, people have had access for a long time to such amenities, these amenities should not be taken from them.  We are not nearly as careful about these matters as they are in England.  In this Bill the Minister has included unoccupied land and to make matters worse it is proposed that anybody can act on behalf of the owner.  It is a well established tradition in this country that people do not object to others walking over their land so long as they do not cause any damage to crops or fences.  In fact, there are walks through private property by riversides all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worst aspect of this Bill is in relation to the seaside where land is of no value whatever except as a means of making money that should not be made at all.  That is about all <Col N="1507" /> I wish to say on the Bill.  I am glad to see Deputy Davern applauding me. It is nice to know that my efforts are appreciated.

      <P>May I deal with the amendment which is nominally before the House?  The amendment seeks to confine exemption from the commission of an offence under the Bill to the owner personally and to exclude from that any person entering on his behalf. It clearly is impossible to accept this amendment because one of its results would be that the ordinary common law right which any citizen has at <Col N="1511" /> present to try to recover possession of his property which has been wrongfully taken from him by a trespasser would be abrogated and done away with.  The allegation has been made and continuously repeated that at the moment an owner has no right to act other than personally and that this Bill and, in particular, the words which are now sought to be deleted confers some new or additional right on an owner to act through agents.  It is alleged that this right does not accrue to an owner of property at present. This is totally false.  An owner has and always had the right to act through his agents.  This Bill does not increase or affect in any way that right.  The amendment that seeks to take away the right of somebody to act through his employees or agents endeavours, therefore, to make a major change in the existing law.  The Bill, as drafted on this point, makes no change whatever and it is so ludicrous and absurd to seek to do what this amendment does that I think the best way I can demonstrate this to the House is to give some examples.</P>
      <P>A very great deal of property in this country or in any other country is owned, not by individuals, but by limited companies which have a legal significance and existence quite separate from the individuals who hold the shares in them or make up their membership. Individual shareholders or directors do not own the property of the company; the company itself is the owner and the company only is the owner.  In this amendment, therefore, we have a suggestion that any property owned by a limited company cannot be cleared of trespassers because only the company, which is a piece of paper, is to be allowed to go to the house in question and remove those trespassing, squatting or forcibly occupying it.  The directors and employees of the company would have no right to act on behalf of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country there are many people who are wards of court because they are minors or perhaps mentally ill or they may have been taken into wardship for a variety of reasons.  All their property is vested in the President <Col N="1512" /> of the High Court.  He is the owner on their behalf of all that property, and the legal and equitable estate-in all that property is vested solely in him.  A very great deal of property of all kinds is vested in the President of the High Court in his capacity as trustee for wards of court and minors. Acceptance of the amendment and deletion of the words would produce the equally ludicrous situation that the incumbent for the time being of the Presidency of the High Court is supposed to traipse up and down the country endeavouring personally to eject people who are trespassing or forcibly occupying the property of the many hundreds of wards of court under his care.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to ordinary trustees who hold property on behalf of infants or persons of unsound mind or other beneficiaries.  Similarly, in regard to someone who happens to be in hospital or on holidays.  I am told that a lady living in Dublin came to the House the other night and spoke to a number of Deputies complaining that she had just arrived back from her holidays and, to her horror, found her house occupied by squatters who had been put in there by a subversive organisation in her absence.  This is an old lady living on her own who is quite incapable, physically, legally and every other way of getting those people out and resuming occupation of her property.  But this amendment would put on her, as it would put on the man in hospital, the sole duty of ejecting such people.</P>
    <P>These are the facts about this amendment and it is a terrible reflection on this House that last night and this morning we had to listen to hours and hours of unmitigated rubbish talked about it.  We had statements made without reference to fact or having any basis in fact.  We had headlines even in this morning's papers that acts which are now against the criminal law will be allowed and will not be criminal under this Bill, if passed, and particularly if this amendment is not accepted.  That is equally arrant and total nonsense and is absolutely untrue.  It is spelled out in subsection (5) of section 1 that nothing <Col N="1513" /> in this Bill shall be regarded as conferring on any person any right to entry or occupation of land which did not exist immediately before the commencement of this Bill.  There is no act which at present is an offence against our criminal law that will not be an offence under our criminal law if this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>That is the incontrovertible fact and, no matter how often it is alleged from the benches opposite that that is not so, they cannot get away from this fact.  Unfortunately, by constant nonstop repetition of misrepresentation about the contents of this Bill, I fear there may be many people who have been so grossly misled that they genuinely believe that things which are crimes at present will not be crimes if this Bill is passed.  It is flouting democracy to create this situation. As I pointed out yesterday, the converse case is the next step in that unfortunate effort to flout democracy. The converse case is that if people are to suggest in regard to a particular Bill that there are not provisions in it which are, in fact, there, people can well be hoodwinked and misled into allowing a Bill to be passed that could contain the most dangerous provisions about which they did not know.  The present situation is the converse of that.  The Bill is being obstructed and a number of people are worried about it because they have been misled into believing that it contains things which, in fact, are not in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt this misrepresentation will continue for the remaining ten amendments on this Stage and all I can do is stand up on each amendment and point out the facts as I have done now.  I must leave it to the conscience of the people who have misrepresented this Bill so consistently throughout the debate.  Let them examine their consciences about the damage they are doing to democracy by trying to demonstrate that there are things in the Bill which, in fact, are not in it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister feels <Col N="1514" /> that his threat to keep us here until September if we do not give him this Bill quickly has any effect on these benches he should dismiss that idea from his mind because we are determined to fight this Bill and every section of it and to expose it for what it is. We shall not allow ourselves to be curtailed by threats from the Minister or anybody else.  The Minister was less than honest in his reply to this debate. He had the audacity to charge the people who spoke from these benches with making all kinds of wild statements and to say that the speakers on these benches spoke without knowing whether he was going to accept or reject the amendment.  This is less than honest because the Labour Party speakers gave ample opportunity to the Minister to express his view on this amendment.  However, the Minister did not offer to speak on any occasion.  He could have offered after I moved the amendment but he did not do so.  Now he has the audacity to criticise us for speaking on the amendment without knowing whether he was going to accept or reject it.  Of course, there were opportunities for other Fianna Fáil speakers to express their feelings on this amendment but the only time Fianna Fáil members came into the House was when the quorum bells rang.  That was the only time they kept the Minister company during the debate on this amendment.  If the Minister had wished to speak he had ample opportunity to do so.  We hope he will do his duty as Minister during discussion of the remaining amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed to answer the case made in support of this amendment.  The case was repeated by speakers that the section as it stood would encourage the formation of private armies and of private gangs of bullyboys.  The Minister has not refuted that allegation; neither has he refuted the allegation that the homeless person and the person in the gate lodge of a big estate will be in a much weaker position if this section is passed.  In fact, it is difficult to reply to the debate because only two speakers were against the amendment.  One was Deputy Carter who did not speak on the amendment at all and the other was the Minister&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot reply to his contribution to the debate because it was well wide of the amendment. The case was made that the Bill would be weakened by acceptance of this amendment.  This is wrong.  The Bill introduces into the criminal law activities that were heretofore in the civil law.  Because of this, we consider that only members of the gardaí should have these rights to act on behalf of owners.  Every speaker who spoke on this amendment made that point.  The Minister did not mention the Garda Síochána in his reply. The Labour Party are for law and order.  We are not in favour of the creation of private armies or the protection of bullyboys by this type of legislation. We want the people who are properly <Col N="1516" /> qualified&mdash;the members of the Garda Síochána, who have shown during the years the greatest sense of justice in their administration of the law&mdash;to administer the law.  No one should be given the right to employ others, whether private armies or individuals, to enforce the law.  It is little comfort to the unfortunate victim who may have his skull cracked with an axe handle by some thug to be told that the thug will be prosecuted and may be fined a few pounds.  This is no answer to the arguments that have been put forward in support of this amendment.</P>
      <P>We appeal to all Deputies to support this amendment in order to restore respect for the law.  It is measures such as this now proposed that will bring the law into disrepute and public odium and, in the long term, will lead to all kinds of problems and difficulties in enforcing the law.  This will happen when it is realised that the law will be used to protect the strong against the weak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  A person other than a member of the Garda Síochána who forcibly removes from any land or vehicle any other person or the goods of any other person shall be guilty of an offence and it shall not be a defence to a prosecution under this subsection to show that the person charged was the owner of the land or vehicle or acted on behalf of the owner or that the occupation of such land or vehicle by such other person, or the presence therein of the goods of such other person was unlawful.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessary because of the nature of this Bill, a Bill proposing to confer powers under the criminal law on people other than members of the Garda Síochána.  The administration and implementation of the criminal law should be confined solely to members of the Garda Síochána.  The Minister may argue that this amendment would impose extra duties on the Garda Síochána but, as has been pointed out already, this Bill proposes to confer certain powers on owners of property and on people acting on behalf of owners of property.  These are very dangerous powers indeed.  The Minister may also argue that these private armies, these gangs of bullyboys, will be subject to the same laws to which they have always been subject, but that is very little consolation to unfortunate victims of assaults by these groups, unfortunate victims who may have their skulls smashed in with the handle of a pickaxe. It will be no consolation to such victims to be told that these gangs will be dealt with through the normal course of the law.  We want to prevent that type of situation arising.  The old saying is that prevention is better than cure.  We believe this amendment is the only way in which to give some shred of responsibility to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for me to make the case that the Garda Síochána are the only people who should implement the criminal law and ensure that it is enforced.  There is no need for me to make the case that they are and have proved to be the most suitable people to do this.  We have been accused by the Minister of being in favour of all kinds of lawlessness.  That is quite untrue.  We want to see the law properly administered and implemented. We want to see the law properly honoured.  We want people to abide by the law.  We believe all this can be achieved only if the law is administered and implemented by those best <Col N="1519" /> qualified for that task, namely, the Garda Síochána.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that proper respect is shown for the law and that adequate protection is given to occupiers of property as well as to owners.  We believe this is the best way in which to safeguard the rights of both owners and occupiers.</P>
    <P>There is provision in this Bill to make occupiers of property responsible for damage done to that property, damage done on behalf of the owners of the property.  This could lead to abuse.  I see no good reason why the Minister should not accept this amendment. He need not accuse us of giving extra duties to gardaí or bringing gardaí into an area of the law in which they have not been hitherto involved, because the Minister himself has already done just that.  He has brought ownership of property into the criminal law and, having done that, the least he can do is ensure that the law is administered in the fairest possible manner.  We submit the Garda Síochána are the only people qualified to do that.  They are the only people who will command the respect necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be practical about this amendment.  We have to ask ourselves are we going to have law and order.  A previous Deputy introduced the idea that this is a criminal law that is being brought in instead of civil law.  That is not true. If I should go home tonight and find squatters in my house is it not a crime for them to be there?  Must I stay on the roadside or sleep in the back garden and tell them that they are very welcome? If, however, I eject that individual from my premises, am I, then, a criminal?  If they refuse to leave after being asked gently to do so and if I should then use a little force in order to eject them, am I a criminal? A man is entitled to his own property and in this measure we are only trying to protect the decent people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to endure again what happened in this city because of actions taken by the parliament of the street&mdash; those people who can say anything <Col N="1520" /> they wish about public representatives. This Parliament is a sacred Assembly that was created for the purpose of administering law fairly.  It is the parliament of the street that is responsible for the Bill being introduced and these people are being helped by others. According to Deputy Pattison, I am a criminal if I eject from my home anybody who may be there illegally. Where are we going in this country? There are pressure groups outside this House who have people within the House to talk on their behalf.  Are we to abolish Dáil Éireann and leave the country to these street parliamentarians? I have seen enough of the actions of these pressure groups in Dublin city and county during the past few years.  It is because of them that the honest and decent person who is waiting his turn for a house cannot get it.  I saw an ex-Member of this House, a decent man, the late Deputy Seán Dunne, being hit with a rat while leaving a corporation meeting where we had been trying to do our best to obtain houses for people.</P>

Do they wish that the street parliamentarians would do whatever they wish?  Those of us who have been here for any length of time, while we may be as charitable as anybody else, are fed up listening to this type of drivel.  So far as this party are concerned, we are charitable towards everybody but if anybody decides to break the law he must be penalised.  There are citizens who should be responsible but who are backing up those pressure groups.  If, when I go home this evening, I find 20 squatters in my home, I shall not send for the gardaí but they will get out as fast as possible.  Those parliamentarians of the street who have a number of agitators here to speak for them do not care what they do.  Men died to free this country.

So far as Deputy Browne's colleagues are concerned, they wish this Parliament to be governed by the mob in the streets. They do not want recognised democratic rule of any kind.  I advise the Minister to stand up to all of this criticism.  We are behind him.  It is not our intention to interfere in the rights of any decent man or to say that a man is a criminal so long as there is civil law to deal with whatever may be the problem.  However, it is up to us to ensure that law and order prevail.  I hope the day is not too far distant when these mobs will be told that they must obey law and order or else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My opposition to this Bill initially was that it sought to bring what was essentially a matter of trespass within the realm of criminal law. I have pointed out that all that was needed to avoid this Bill was to update and streamline the civil law relating to trespass.  I pointed out that one very important aspect of the existing civil law was the right of any owner of property to personally eject a trespasser on that property and to use whatever force might be reasonably necessary to achieve that end.  That <Col N="1524" /> is still my belief.  For that reason I regret that I am unable to support this amendment as it is drafted.  I sympathise with the spirit of the amendment because, unfortunately, the spirit of the Bill is so repressive and can lead to such undesirable consequences and can definitely lead to the position of unscrupulous owners employing private armies to do their dirty work in a situation never envisaged by the civil law.  I can sympathise with the spirit of the amendment when it seeks to prevent that situation arising and to ensure that the only person who would be involved in a situation like that would be the member of the Garda Síochána.  Unfortunately, as drafted, I think this amendment could interfere with that very ancient common law right of the owner of property to eject and to use whatever force might be reasonably necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>This highlights what I have always held about this Bill&mdash;that the law as it stands is adequate.  All that is necessary is a change in the rules of procedure to allow an aggrieved owner to move quickly.  Statutory changes are not necessary.  In England which had a bigger problem of the type which this Bill is alleged to be aimed at it was not found necessary to bring in new criminal repressive legislation. The English, with all their faults, have a great feeling for democracy and a high respect for the rule of law.  They were prepared to update and streamline the existing civil law so that property owners would have a speedy and effective remedy.  If the Minister was prepared to do that here all the acrimony and all the disquiet which this Bill has raised would have been avoided. He was not prepared to do so.  At the same time when the civil law is still there I should not like to see the rights of property owners in any way diminished.  Consequently I regret, while in full sympathy with the spirit of the amendment, I do feel that if passed it will have the harmful effects I have referred to.</P>

      <P>As I was saying before the usual interruption which is called every time I stand up to speak in this House in an effort to prevent my speaking because there are certain people in this House who would wish to deny the right of free speech to anyone except themselves and those who think like them, this amendment, if adopted, would interfere quite unnecessarily and in a drastic way with a person's right to defend and protect his property.  Under existing law if Deputy Pattison, or any other Deputy or citizen, returns to his house some night and finds it unlawfully entered by a stranger who is squatting in the parlour and refuses to leave, the Deputy is entitled to eject that intruder and to use such force as is necessary to enable him to do so.  I see no reason why the Deputy should not continue to be entitled to act in this way without being threatened with the sanction of the criminal law if he does so.  I see every reason why the Garda should not automatically become involved which is what this amendment would entail.  Where property is forcibly entered or occupied by unauthorised persons the law has always recognised that it is primarily a matter for the lawful occupier to regain possession of the property with only such assistance from the Garda as may be necessary to prevent a breach of the peace or to protect human life or to obviate any risk of serious injury to any person or serious damage to property.  It is not the job of the Garda to enforce the private rights of individuals unless such action is necessary to prevent crime or to bring to justice those responsible for crime already committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment would produce such ridiculous effects as making it necessary for an owner to call in the gardaí to eject a stray horse which he finds grazing in his front garden or to remove a neighbour's cattle that have broken into a field of wheat.  This Bill is concerned only with the unauthorised and forcible entry and occupation of other people's property by persons who have no semblance or colour of right to the property.  I must emphasise again that <Col N="1526" /> there is nothing in this Bill that confers on any person any right to enter or occupy land which he does not have at present and there is nothing in the Bill that condones or authorises conduct in any way contrary to the existing civil or criminal law.</P>
    <P>Many of these amendments are ridiculous but this one exceeds them all in the ludicrous extremes in which it would seek to place the owner or occupier of property.  If a man is to be a criminal, as Deputy Burke has pointed out, because he tries to eject a trespasser or squatter out of his own parlour, then law has come to a very unfortunate position.  As the Deputy also pointed out, this is what certain people in this House would like to see.  They would like to see no law, law reduced to the situation in which it was a complete joke.  If ever an amendment was proposed to any Bill that would make law and order a complete joke it is the present amendment. That is why this amendment is tabled &mdash;because there are men in the House who would seek to reduce this country to outright anarchy&mdash;but this Government and this party will stand in their way as long as we exist in this House and we will halt the anarchy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputies opposite wish to prolong the time on this Bill I do not mind.  I am quite prepared to stay here.  We in the Labour Party have made it abundantly clear that we are opposed to this Bill as a whole and we are offering our amendments not as frivolous amendments&mdash;which they are not&mdash;but as an attempt to palliate some of the worst effects which we fear from this Bill. We regard the Bill as a whole as quite unnecessary, and probably many members opposite secretly agree with us, and it is being pushed on by the personal <i>amour propre</i> of the Minister for Justice who wants to put through this unnecessary piece of legislation.  In order to temper its worst results we have put down certain amendments of which this is one.  We think that the whole matter of the Bill could have been handled differently and if the Government and the Minister had shown a little consideration for our amendments or some appreciation of at least the kernel of our concern, things could have gone more smoothly and the debate need not have been so prolonged and acrimonious as, unfortunately, it has been from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People of the city and of the country who were shocked by the occurrence <Col N="1528" /> at Hume Street when strongarm men, commercially employed, used violence on defenceless people were concerned about it.  Whether these amendments are perfectly calculated to achieve their ends or not, they refer to a real subject of concern.  This has not at any time, either in relation to the last amendment which, of course, is linked with this or to this amendment, been conceded by the Minister.  On the contrary, he has treated all the amendments offered as beneath contempt, not merely in form but in substance, and he has discerned behind them all sorts of sinister intentions of reducing this land to chaos unless his silly little Bill is passed with the minimum of discussion.  On these benches we think that this attitude of the Minister is not conducive to the discharge of the business of the House nor is this insistence on getting this unnecessary Bill through at all costs helpful to parliamentary government and to the kind of consensus which can exist and which other Ministers have known how to elicit on other questions.</P>
    <P>We also think that the callous failure to acknowledge the danger we have in mind, that is the use of private armies, is in itself disquieting.  The emotional quality of the resistance which is shown to these amendments reveals something of the spirit in which, under such a Minister, a Bill such as this could be administered.  That is the source of our disquiet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney had criticisms of substance to make of this amendment and we would have hoped that the Minister would have pursued the discussion in the same reasonable tone which we can provide on matters here when we like and which has, unfortunately, been abrogated and from which we have wandered in this discussion. It has been suggested that if this Bill, as it stands, without any amendment is not passed, the rule of law in this country will in some way fail.</P>
    <P>In relation to the previous amendment, the Minister said that if the words we sought to have omitted were omitted an ordinary common law right would be abrogated.  It is an exaggeration to claim that a right <Col N="1529" /> which exists in common law could be suppressed by the omission of certain words in a statute which has yet to be passed.  At the moment the words do not have force in law and we fail to see how their omission could abrogate a right in common law.  Nor do we see that this cranky&mdash;and possibly unconstitutional&mdash;statute can add anything to the power of the rule of law or to respect for the law.</P>
    <P>We were accused by Deputy Burke, in a moment of emotion, of seeking rule by the mob in the street and of seeking chaos.  In a personal remark, which in a cooler moment I think the Deputy will withdraw, we were accused of encouraging the kind of people who threw rats at our colleague, the late Deputy Dunne.  That was an unfortunate thing to say.</P>
    <P>We have no such intention.  We are as concerned for the rule of law as any other party in this House and we have shown our concern for it and for the avoidance of violence more consistently than have the Government party. The rule of law involves and extends protection to people with property but it also involves protection of other people in their relations with the owners of property.  The balance between those two kinds of rights always has been a delicate matter.  As we know, the law at one time was almost exclusively concerned with the protection of the rights of people of property and there are still vestiges of that remaining. The trend of legislation in modern times in most civilised countries has been to extend more sensitive protection to people without property in their relations with owners of property.</P>
    <P>This Bill as a whole goes against that tendency.  It tends to unleash the arm of property which can be used in such form as K Security.  The Bill tends in that direction and the disquiet this has caused in our ranks and in others is serious.  While the letter of the Bill is open to serious objection, the spirit in which the case for the Bill has been argued is more dangerous.  If that spirit is to be the spirit in which this Bill is implemented, we consider we should redouble our opposition to it <Col N="1530" /> and to press our amendments as far as we can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to be brief on this subject and simply to add my voice concisely to those who support this amendment.  I think the Ceann Comhairle was in the House for the contributions of Deputy Burke and the Minister and I trust he will extend to me the opportunity to deal with matters he permitted those speakers to deal with.  Before going on to my general considerations of this amendment, I should like to refer briefly to the speeches of Deputy Burke and of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke raised the objection at the beginning of his contribution that if a person finds squatters in his house he has the right to eject them.  Deputy Cooney has pointed out that there is an ancient common law right to protect one's property and in the history of this Parliament the Labour Party have never tried by the various mechanisms available to them to introduce legislation to abrogate that right.  I can say without any danger of contradiction, or without any need to ask anyone's opinion on the matter, that we uphold that ancient common law right, as I am sure do all Members of this House.</P>
      <P>However, the reality is that trespass, which is a well-understood though complex and ancient category of transgression in law, is brought by this legislation within the criminal law. This poses a new situation.  The transfer of trespass into the criminal law is implicit, and, in fact, explicit, in this legislation, and we must point out the dangers of that course and the anomalies that will exist if the Bill is to become an Act of this Parliament.</P>
      <P>Of course, people in possession of their houses object if they find squatters on their property.  All persons of all descriptions in possession of a home protect their property&mdash;one could generalise and say that this applies to every living thing.  The protection of a home, of territory, or a nest, is a basic instinct of all living things.  It is right that this should be recognised by legislation and that the right should be protected by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> To pose such unpleasant possibilities for people in possession and occupation of homes is to distort entirely the real nature of the problem of squatters. People do not want to squat for fun, they do not do it out of wickedness, and they do not do it on a major scale. They squat out of need, out of exasperation, out of outrage.  When real need is expressed in such actions as squatting, when there is real exasperation because of the unavailability of adequate accommodation, when there is outrage at the contrast, on the one hand, between the provision of insufficient housing&mdash;which creates the pressure&mdash;and certain kinds of commercial buildings, on the other hand, there is a situation in which a small number of people&mdash;never a significant number of the entire population&mdash;do things for reasons of protest and of expressing their outrage and indignation.</P>
    <P>You can deal with that sort of genuine problem in two ways.  You try to crush it by legislation or you can deal with the point that is producing their outrage.  I said a long time ago that agitators&mdash; and there are agitators in Ireland&mdash;are symptoms and not causes. At times it is improper to agitate, and at other times it is obligatory. When the housing situation gets to the stage it has got to in Dublin, agitation is, in fact, obligatory and not an offence, not a crime, not a socially undesirable action.</P>
    <P>To say that every home peacefully occupied by the population of this country is under threat by squatters is to say something that is a ridiculous distortion of the real situation.  I noticed a word occurring a number of times in what Deputy Burke had to say. He said: &ldquo;We are only trying to protect the decent people of this country.&rdquo; He said later on in a totally different part of his speech: &ldquo;We are not going to interfere with any decent man.&rdquo; I wonder if by &ldquo;decent&rdquo; people Deputy Burke means people he and his party approve of.  People have the entitlement to legal protection whether they are decent or whether they are rotten.</P>
    <P>You cannot say on somebody's arbitrary judgment that something is <Col N="1532" /> a characteristic of decent people whom the law will protect and with whom we will not interfere, leaving other people out.  The law has to protect everyone.  You cannot make judgments as to who is decent and who is not decent.  Other than in the explicit carrying out of that law, the State must not interfere with people whether they are decent or not decent.  If you start creating categories like this you move into the authoritarian area which is in the mood of thís Bill, the mood of the Government Party, and the mood of the current times.  You face the possibility of the abandonment of fundamental civil rights, of internment, of the use of the whole oppressive apparatus of the State against those who are not, to quote Deputy Burke's phrase, &ldquo;decent people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He says that we have suffered from the parliament of the streets.  The Labour Party have played their part in the history of this Parliament to uphold it and defend it.  He says we want anarchy.  The Minister said there were certain people in this House who would like to see no law, certain people in this House &ldquo;seeking to reduce Ireland to anarchy&rdquo;.  I will come back to that in a moment.  He said that we in the Labour Party want to replace the Parliament in this building, of this nation, with the parliament of the streets.  I think those things were said in anger, in irritation, in chagrin, and I do not propose to take them too seriously.  I do not propose to spend time in trying to rebut them.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the point that when ordinary citizens who are trying to live reasonably useful lives take to the streets in large numbers, it is not because of agitators, but because of real issues that are not dealt with. If you want to have a reasonable, decently functioning, calm, legal Parliament which is not being pushed by the parliament of the street, you must remove the cause which results in ordinary citizens going out on to the streets.  We must never try to legislate street demonstration or agitation out of existence.  When people's irritation with the proceedings of this House, when people's fury with the unsolved problems such as the problem of housing, <Col N="1533" /> express themselves in waves of public demonstrations, serious public representatives must listen and must see what the cause is and try to remove it.</P>
    <P>We must not make conflict situations between this Parliament and the parliament of the people.  The parliament of the people in the streets in a structured legal sense is subordinate to us but, in fact, the word we use to describe members of this assembly, the name we call ourselves by, is a good name.  We call ourselves Deputies. We come here as the Deputies of the parliament of the streets, the houses, the fields and the villages all over the country.  In fact, in the long run, the people are sovereign, not this Parliament.  If large numbers of them come out on the streets on serious issues it is for serious reasons.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the speech of my colleague from North County Dublin, Deputy Burke, was a Fascist speech.  This is a Fascist piece of legislation but I do not think his was a Fascist speech.  Yet there are the beginnings of these authoritarian echoes, the echoes that we protect decent people and that those we do not characterise as decent are outside the law, the echoes that the parliament of the streets is something alien, something wicked, something not to be listened to, something in conflict with this Parliament and something which, if it becomes too serious and too extensive in the end, must be repressed.</P>
    <P>I do not see a conflict between the parliament of the streets and the Parliament that sits here.  I would very much regret the day that there ever came to be such a conflict.  We are Deputies and we must listen to the streets.  We must try to find the real causes that put people there.  If the grievances are real, we must try to remove them.  That is the only way that agitation, the parliament of the streets, demonstrations, can be ended, not by repression.</P>
    <P>We were accused of hypocrisy by Deputy Burke for trying to oppose this Bill.  Had I got up sooner I would have said rather bitter things about this word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo;.  If I simply refer to it as having been uttered by Deputy <Col N="1534" /> Burke, those who know him will know what I mean without my being more explicit.  He accused us of not wanting law and order.  He said we do not want Parliament to exist.  I will come to that later in a different context in regard to what the Minister said.</P>
    <P>I thought we were having a reasonable discussion on this Bill and on these amendments until this was injected into the debate by Deputy Burke and by the Minister, until they were permitted to do so by the Ceann Comhairle. That having happened, we have no option but to take up those points and answer them.  I would turn his own word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; back on Deputy Burke in the context of last year, when the threat to law and order in the most central and profound way in the heart of the Government came from his party and when the Minister introducing this legislation is kept in office by persons against whom that threat can be made legitimately.  This is where the law and order threat in Ireland is coming from at this time.  When that member of that party has the effrontery to stand up and hurl from those benches that accusation, then he has brought it on himself and on his party that we reply in the way in which I am now replying.  Nobody in that party has the right to make threats or accusations about law and order at this time in this Parliament and about wanting the Parliament to exist.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you were not in the House and I realise you may be wondering at the relevance of what I am saying to the amendment we are discussing.  I am following it, Sir, as quickly as I can because these were points permitted to be raised on this amendment by speakers on the Government benches; I am following it, Sir, entirely in that sense and I am dealing with quotations from things which they said and which they introduced into this debate.  I realise I am talking not directly to the amendment, but I am talking to the points made by previous speakers and, so long as I stick to the points made, I have the right, I understand, to reply to them and I feel this ought to be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We were accused of not wanting law <Col N="1535" /> and order to exist and I think I have given the reply to that.  We were accused of not wanting Parliament to exist. But where has the threat to Parliament been in the last couple of years? I am amazed at the effrontery that can make that charge from those benches. I am also amazed at the foolishness and the forgetfulness of the events that have been convulsing Ireland in the last year.  They have not originated in either of the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke also accused me of making false statements.  I do not propose to pursue that except to say that I still await the rebuttal of those statements.  I still await an answer.  I have been waiting now for some time. If they were false Deputy Burke and his party owe it to this country to show how they are false.  A simple statement that they are false is horrible and ridiculous, a bald statement without any indication as to the way in which they are false.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the extraordinary accusation made by the Minister for Justice.  I do not propose to spend a great deal of time on the petulant interjections of the Minister for Justice and the extraordinary accusations from a man in his responsible position that we are seeking to reduce Ireland to anarchy.  There are certain people I am quoting, certain people in this House, who would like to see no law.  There are certain people in this House who would wish to deny the right of free speech.  These ridiculous and petulant interjections are unworthy of the Minister and the same observations I have made about Deputy Burke's charges apply to him also. As Minister for Justice he must be aware more than anybody in this House as to where the threat to law is coming from in this island at this moment.  It is his responsibility to know that as Minister for Justice.  He must be aware as to where the threat is coming from in this island at this moment.  He must be so aware in his professional capacity as Minister for Justice.  For him to hurl, in the possession of the knowledge he has as Minister for Justice, these accusations at us is so ridiculous as to give one yet further reason, if further reason <Col N="1536" /> be needed, to doubt his competence to fill this sensitive Ministry, an important post at an important time.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the direct content of this amendment.  I think it is generally recognised, if one compares populations with different ethnic origins in countries in which there is a mixture of ethnic groups, such as the United States of America, parts of Britain, Australia, and so on, that we, as Irishmen, have a national propensity to come to blows with each other rather more rapidly than other ethnic groups.  This may have racial origins, to the very limited extent that the Irish are a race.  It may have origins in the distant ethnic past of our country, but it also has more recent origins in our behaviour and our attitude towards each other.</P>
    <P>I think there is a bullyboy tradition on the Irish political scene.  I think, and I say this seriously, that if one were to look at the documentation of the history of every general election, particularly since the late twenties, one would see that in the main the exponents of that bullyboy tradition came from within the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The willingness to &ldquo;lurry up&rdquo; the people, if I may use that phrase, with whom one does not agree, this tendency&mdash;in the past, fortunately, not expressed in a very structural way, just the little but of intimidation here and there, the little bits of the offer of physical violence here and there&mdash;this tendency built on top, of course, of what I have already admitted to, far transcends the tradition of party politics. This tendency to come to blows with each other is, I think, a national characteristic, and a regrettable one. But, then, in recent years, far from an effort on the part of the Government party, which has been in power and has been the largest, in many ways the most influential party, and, therefore, an extraordinary source of reaction of influence in this area, far from seeing a deliberate and conscious effort to move away from this national tradition, which, I think, all of us will admit is a national tradition, and a regrettable one, the evolution has been all the other way.  We have not seen the structural effort to move away from it <Col N="1537" /> and I believe that this Bill is an example of just that and it is with that that Deputy Pattison's amendment is specifically concerned.  We have seen by the Government party a strengthening of the tendency towards the bullyboy approach, rather than a weakening of it, rather than a deliberate effort to remove that tendency from the public scene.  We have seen this, to me, strictly distasteful sight of the growing up of private security groups under the guise of the protection of private property but which were, in fact, on the road to becoming paramilitary organisations functioning similarly to the police, dressed like the police, carrying batons, but not, of course, subject to the control to which the police are subject.  We did not have to wait for Hume Street to see the emergence of groups, which were formerly allegedly designed to protect private property, being used on the streets in a way I consider to be altogether wrong.  We saw it at the time of the general election.  We saw a security group being employed and used by the Government party.  I think that was a retrograde evolution. I think it was one that any political party should have set its face against but, above all, one against which the party in power should have set its face.</P>
    <P>To come to the events then which had a significant part in the genesis of this Bill: we had the events of Hume Street, a formal justification for the protection of property and, yet, it is implicit in the 1916 Proclamation, to which Deputy Burke referred so fulsomely, that the heritage of the Irish people is more than just the property of a person who happens to have legal title to that building.  We saw a specific organisation&mdash;K Security&mdash;used in what was to me an authoritarian, arbitrary, ruthless and disgraceful way. Of course, if you dress people like police and give them some of the physical force equipment that police possess, batons and the like&mdash;in this case they had pick handles&mdash;and if they function in circumstances in which they believe they have the approval of the Government, one must not be surprised if the individual loses the distinction between what is permissive <Col N="1538" /> legally and what transcends the limits of legality.  On that particular occasion these people behaved disgracefully and beyond what ought to be permitted in a democratic society.  It was an escalation of the bullyboy tendency that I believe to be a fundamental part of the thinking of the entire Fianna Fáil organisation.  This time their actions were structured.  They had uniforms and pick handles and they believed themselves to have approval of the Government and of the entire Fianna Fáil Party.  Indeed, nothing has been done since then that would give rise to any doubt in their minds as to the existence of such approval.</P>
    <P>If we take a parallel with the treatment of the students who were trying to preserve the Hume Street buildings&mdash;we have a tradition also of pushing around tinkers.  I suppose it is more polite now to refer to them as itinerants but the usage of a more polite term does not help them in their dilemma as people who are outside society&mdash;Irish men and women who are deprived of their rights. They have always been pushed somewhat more than have other citizens and they have been intimidated more too.  We have known of scandalous cases in some parts of the country where they were intimidated by this bullyboy psychology to which I refer. That is the sort of treatment that, from ordinary people, deepens their sense of alienation and makes more difficult their integration into our society.  I know that in many ways they constitute a problem that is a source of irritation but we have a responsibility to integrate them because if we keep them separate from the rest of the community we are then faced with a totally different set of rules and attitudes towards them.  The only possibility is to treat them as equal citizens and to do everything possible to integrate them.</P>
    <P>Briefly, that is the background against which Deputy Pattison moved this amendment which I am supporting because were it to be simply an effort to take away the ancient common law rights of a person to protect his property, it would be one which I am convinced our party would not have put forward and would be one which <Col N="1539" /> I would not support but that is not the point.  The reason for putting down the amendment is that this ancient recognised category of transgression which is known as trespass, by this extraordinary and, to my mind, scandalous piece of legislation that is being pushed now through petulance rather than for any better motive, has been brought within the criminal law. The object of our amendment is to emphasise the impossibilities, the anomalies and the ridiculous situations that will arise if this Bill is enacted. When one gets into the category of a relationship regulated by criminal law, one must use the evolved mechanism of the police for regulating that sort of relationship.  One must take the force of what the Minister said when he talked about the situation that would arise in removing animals from a field in which there were crops of corn.  The situation can arise, too, in relation to rights of way and in relation to children who stray.  All of these actions would constitute trespass&mdash; actions that occur normally but which are sometimes deliberate or malicious or which sometimes are devised for the purpose of deliberate political demonstration.  Who are we with our historical evolution to deny the validity of the trespass which occurs in the pursuit of political protest? Deputy Burke said that this House was sacred.  If by that he meant it was a place that must have the respect of every Irishman, I agree with him but it is worth saying that this House and none of the institutions of this State would exist if, during many years, Irish people had not, at times, had to choose to break laws.  There could be very little demonstration of a valid kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the value of Deputy Burke's distinction but my understanding is that the vast bulk of our common law from which trespass is being removed is, in fact, the carrying into the legislation of our State of what was the common law in England.  While I know that the source <Col N="1540" /> of that legislation was an alien government, at the same time, the content of the law is the common law of England which is, in fact, the source of our common law.</P>
      <P>The point I was making is that ridiculous and impossible situations arise, situations that make impossible the working of law and order to which so much reference has been made and for which all of us profess allegiance, once trespass is transferred into the area of criminal law.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At noon on Friday last our ambassador in London, on instructions from the Taoiseach, made urgent representations to the British authorities.  The British authorities were urged to arrange for a special inquiry into the two fatal shootings in question and to announce it immediately.  The value of announcing an inquiry at that time would have been its effect in allaying the grave disquiet and sense of alienation <Col N="1544" /> from authority of the people of Derry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the decision forced on the Opposition in Stormont to establish an alternative assembly and withdraw from Stormont because of the refusal of Stormont to grant an inquiry signals a deepening of the northern crisis and would he agree that in present circumstances all our diplomatic effort with Britain should be directed towards getting a new administrative deal for that area, which would be confined to Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My regrets.  Does the Minister accept that on the basis of reports of all impartial observers of these shootings a <i>prima facie</i> case seems to exist for an impartial public inquiry?  Would he personally convey this view to the British Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary thus avoiding further bitterness, bloodshed and recriminations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not have heard that at noon on last Friday we made it quite clear what we felt was the action that should be taken. I did add, and I think it is an answer to Deputy O'Leary, that the value of an inquiry at that time would have had the effect of allaying anxiety and the feeling of alienation from authority which exists.  I would not like anybody to get the impression that there was any consultation or otherwise between any of us here or the Opposition parties' decision in the North of Ireland. All I would say is that in a very abnormal situation, such as exists there, one has to sympathise with elected representatives anywhere who feel that their representations have been refused an adequate response. The action that has now been taken does, I believe, create a very serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider any further initiative?  I do not think we should merely lapse into despair.  I am sure the Minister accepts the view that further initiatives could possibly be taken by the Government if necessary in consultation with the leaders of the Opposition parties on a joint basis.  Would the Minister consider that type of approach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The House can take it that you do not have to ask us to take initiatives.  The situation in the north has taken a certain turn which the Government realised it would take.  For that reason we made representations to allay anxieties and certain frustrations and so prevent that happening. The development of the situation in the north is bound to involve us and we have consistently been making representations and proposals and expressing the views of the northern minority and we intend to continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to ask the Minister whether we would direct all our efforts&mdash;this is very important on our part&mdash;to getting a settlement confined to that area?  If we have asked in the last few days for the British to make a certain move under the Ireland Act equally on our part there should be a constructive attempt to help the situation.  I think that would be helped by not having suggested solutions from our side tied automatically to ideas of unity, in other words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important. We are not playing politics in this situation.  We are talking about a whole community rending itself apart. I think down here we must make certain sacrifices to gain that sort of co-operation in the area.  It has reached the point of seriousness now that our diplomatic efforts with the British should be devoted to getting a settlement confined to the area in a new form of administration which would be confined to the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that from the very beginning of the most recent activity in the situation&mdash; when I say recent I mean about two years&mdash;we have dealt with the immediate problem.  Deputies may remember that we took the problem of civil rights and reforms as being the one for immediate handling and we sought to have that dealt with in so far as we could influence the situation. The present situation as I see it is this gap between the elected representation of a sizeable part of the community <Col N="1547" /> there and authority and this will have to be handled, but I do not think there is any reason in the world to drop any other aspect of our policy to seek these solutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another question asking for a statement which covers what would normally be about five or six specific Parliamentary questions. It is very long and as we did agree <Col N="1548" /> among the Whips that I would circulate these but if there are specific points arising out of these which Deputies want answered I will certainly answer them next week.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have them.  There is no problem.  I would welcome an exchange here.  I have been doing this to try to oblige the House. The only way you can win a fight is to say nothing.</P>
      <P>We have had two meetings with the Communities in recent weeks&mdash;one at Deputies' level on 29th June and a Ministerial meeting on 12th July.  Substantial progress was made at these meetings on a number of important matters.  I shall be making available to Deputies next week a detailed report on the progress of our negotiations to date.  As arranged I propose to circulate a reply to the question summarising the main developments at these two meetings.</P>
      <P>The following is the reply:</P>
      <P>We have agreed to the proposals put to us by the Community in regard to our contributions to the financing of the Community up to and including the year 1979 after which the Community system of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; will apply fully.  Under the agreed proposals, we shall assume a share in the Community budget in the years up to 1979 equal to our share of the gross national produce of the enlarged Community, that is 0.6 per cent.  Our share will, however, be paid up only to the extent of 45 per cent in 1973 rising to 92 per cent in 1977.  Our actual contribution will depend on the size of the Community budget but can be estimated at about £4 million in 1973 rising to about £9 million in 1977 and to around £13 million in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also reached agreement with the Communities in regard to representation for Ireland on the Council of Ministers, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Economic <Col N="1552" /> and Social Committee.  We shall, of course, have a seat on the Council of Ministers; there will be a Commissionership for an Irish national, ten Irish representatives in the European Parliament and nine Irish representatives on the Economic and Social Committee.  This representation will give us parity with Denmark and Norway and is quite satisfactory from our point of view.  The agreed proposals cover also the system of weighted voting in the Council of Ministers to be used in the enlarged Communities in cases of decisions taken by qualified majority.  Under this system, Ireland will have three votes, the same as for Denmark and Norway, and the qualified majority will be 43 out of a total vote of 61.</P>
    <P>The arrangements agreed between Britain and the Communities in regard to New Zealand butter and cheese were put to us by the Communities. It is intended under these arrangements that the prices at which these products will be marketed in Britain should not endanger the market for the disposal of the products of the countries of the enlarged Communities and, in these circumstances, we were able to accept the arrangements.</P>
    <P>Agreement has also been reached with the Community in regard to Ireland's subscription to the capital of the European Investment Bank, a contribution to the bank's reserves and representation on the organs of the bank.  Ireland's share in the bank's capital will be 15 million dollars, 20 per cent of which will be paid up. This paid up portion will be paid over a period of 2½ years after accession. We have also agreed to contribute to the reserves and to the reserve-type funds of the bank.  As regards representation on the organs of the bank, we shall have a seat on the Board of Governors and a seat on the Board of Directors.  The proposals put to us by the Community do not, however, provide for any representation for Ireland or for Denmark and Norway on the bank's management committee. We have, therefore, proposed that representation on the management committee, which under the Community proposals will consist of a President and four Vice-Presidents, should be <Col N="1553" /> supplemented by a further Vice-President and that this Vice-President should rotate as between a number of the smaller countries.</P>
    <P>As regards fisheries I have kept the House fully informed in reply to questions about recent developments.  At our Ministerial meeting on the 12th July the Community informed us that the matter was still under consideration and that they were not in a position to put proposals to us.  The Community have in fact set up an expert group to make recommendations.  I made a statement to the Communities in which I again emphasised the problems which common access to our fishery waters would create for our fishing industry and I urged them to give full consideration to the proposal which I made on the 9th June.  Deputies will have no doubt noted from press reports that Britain has now put forward proposals similar to the Irish proposals.</P>
    <P>We have now submitted to the Communities a detailed memorandum on the question of regional policy and I made a statement at the meeting on 12th July introducing this memorandum. The text of the statement is being made available to Deputies.</P>
    <P>In an initial reaction to our case, the Communities have formally recognised the special position of Ireland in regard to regional development.  This statement by the Communities is of major significance to us.</P>
    <P>The development in the negotiations of the greatest importance is, of course, the agreement in regard to the motor car assembly industry which I concluded with the Communities at our meeting on 12th July.  The outcome on this major issue in our negotiations is highly satisfactory from our point of view.  The Communities have agreed, in response to the case which I made, that the scheme at present in operation for the assembly and importation of motor vehicles in Ireland should be maintained after our accession to the Communities until 1985.  There are other details in the agreement of a rather technical nature and these will be set out in the progress report to be circulated to Deputies next week.</P>
    <P>My whole concern in negotiations on this issue with the Communities <Col N="1554" /> was to protect the employment of our workers in the motor car assembly industry. This has been achieved in the agreement reached with the Communities which will also provide a fair opportunity to the motor car assembly industry to adapt themselves to the new situation which will be created by Ireland's membership to the Communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say in respect of the Ministerial meeting on 12th July in connection with fisheries what Ministers attended?  Will he state if there are negotiations on any industry other than the motor car assembly industry?  Would he now be able to elaborate on the very short paragraph in regard to regional development?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a meeting of the Ministers of the Six, the Community as they already exist, and that meeting was confidential.  Whatever went on at it, no proposal was made to me.  I gathered that the Community were not in a position to put a proposal. They were not able to arrive at an agreed proposal at their meeting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a meeting at which the Ministers of the Six met me and we had a provisional agenda. Fisheries was on the agenda but because they had been unable to find an agreed position among themselves in the morning they were unable to put proposals to me.  The chairman told me that.  Notwithstanding that, I made a statement about our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>They had meetings but they were not at our meeting and they did not have any offer on fisheries at their own meetings.  The negotiators for Denmark and Britain both had meetings with the Community that day but in neither case was an offer from the Community made on fisheries because the Community had been unable among themselves to find an agreed position.  Perhaps Ministers and other negotiators did as I did and made their own statements, but there was no negotiation on fisheries.</P>

      <P>This is still mooted&mdash; what we talked about last week&mdash;in the newspapers and if you like in the corridors where things like this are rumoured.  I should tell the House that I have made it quite clear that I think that any solution on fisheries should be equitable in itself and among the applicants and I still think my proposal is the best one to provide a solution.</P>

      <P>To date, yes.  There has not been a graded timetable but the date for finishing negotiations and signing was given as 1st January, 1972, <Col N="1556" /> with one year for ratification and there is no reason to think that will not be met.</P>

      <P>Arising from the two paragraphs in the reply about regional policy, while we would regard it as a step in the right direction that the Community should formally recognise the special position of Ireland in regard to regional development, would the Minister not agree that 12th July was rather late to make the submissions described here and that if, as was urged by members of this party much earlier, the question of regional policy and Ireland's special position in relation to it had been raised much earlier, then Ireland would now be in a better position than that in which in fact it finds itself?  The Minister was slow to wake up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy has denied this before.  The day after the introduction of the regulations on fisheries we had a meeting ahead of the Norwegians and so I was, according to the mechanics, the first.  If they had had a meeting before me they might have raised it first.  I raised regional policy at this early date also and I have repeatedly raised different aspects of it so as to convince the Community of our real interest in it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, in regard to Question No. 8, the Ceann Comhairle is aware that this is a four-page typed reply to a general question. It was agreed that the Minister should introduce it on the basis that he would read the first paragraph. It is a lengthy statement dealing with <Col N="1557" /> extremely important issues and, in those circumstances, the Chair should allow us to ask supplementary questions which arise on parts of the text the Minister did not read&mdash;which he was permitted not to read in order to save time.  There are some pertinent supplementary questions that arise in connection with the Minister's statement.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies want to go back to the point where we mentioned fisheries and the problems involved, they will find that they go well beyond that date.  When the fisheries regulations became an actuality, I was the first to raise the matter at the negotiating table.  We had raised it before that time in another form.  I do not think the House need worry about that.  I have read what the Deputy is claiming for himself about fisheries and he is quite wrong.  He has a propaganda campaign going for himself but someone will catch up with him in his own constituency.</P>

I am telling the Community that these tax incentives, from our point of view, have been very successful and they should be continued.  I think the Community will have to see that, having regard to our stage of development and the rate of growth we require, if these tax incentives are not permitted something very substantial which will compensate &mdash;and even more than compensate&mdash; will have to be done with the help of the Community.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.  The tourist industry in all parts of the country including County Donegal has been experiencing difficulties in attracting tourist traffic since 1969.  The reasons for this situation are external and outside our control, and include economic difficulties abroad.  In the meantime, both Bord Fáilte and I have kept the situation under continuous review to see what effective steps could be taken to improve the position and to counteract adverse tendencies.  In this regard, Deputies will recall that an additional promotional campaign in our main markets costing £395,000 was commenced by Bord Fáilte in late 1970 to give a special impetus to traffic growth in the current season.</P>
      <P>I have arranged to meet the National Tourism Council later this afternoon for a mid-season review of traffic.  The chairman and the director-general of Bord Fáilte will also be present at the meeting.  In the light of the very full discussion, which I propose to have with this very representative gathering of tourist interests, the question of taking additional measures will be considered.</P>

Will he now provide the funds necessary to ensure that the inquiry which he specifically promised will be undertaken, in view of the public pressure on this issue?</P>

      <P>As I have already made clear in my reply, the scope and nature of the inquiry will depend on the issues raised in the course of consideration of the plans when they are produced. It is not, therefore, desirable and it is certainly not necessary, to make financial provision for an inquiry at this stage when we do not know the scope and nature of the inquiry.  I have already explained that.  I am glad that on this occasion Deputy FitzGerald has talked about a Government inquiry because he will recall that last week he said I had said that there would be a public inquiry.  I did not, of course, say any such thing.  In Deputy FitzGerald's terms, he was misleading the House.  That is what I was referring to on the previous question. That is the kind of approach Deputy FitzGerald adopts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will review the turnover tax exemption limit of £2.60 for books imported from abroad in view of the hardship and delays caused to people importing books for educational purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>Books, other than certain types of religious books which are subject to a protective duty, are free of ordinary customs duty and all books are free of wholesale tax.  Where the customs duty, including tax, on goods in any one parcel is less than £0.13 the duty is statutorily waived and books, including gifts, to a value, with postage, of £2.60 are covered by this exemption.  Gift parcels coming from outside Europe are admitted free up to £5 in value.</P>
      <P>The value-limit for exempt gifts was fixed after careful consideration and I am not prepared to raise it either generally or in the case of books.  An exemption for books imported for review, besides being open to abuse, would be contrary to the comprehensive nature of the turnover tax and would invite applications for exemption in other cases claimed to be equally meritorious.  Accordingly, I cannot agree to provide such an exemption or to increase the exemption limit of £0.13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this decision has caused <Col N="1572" /> great concern and will interfere considerably with the whole normal process by which books come in for review and by which books are bought for educational purposes?  Would he not agree that the situation is unprecedented? Books for review have to be sent through the customs procedure and there is a long hold-up involved in getting the books out.  This is most unwise and could easily be dealt with by an administrative exemption in respect of books for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am informed that it would not be easy by any means to deal with it on an administrative basis. There is the other consideration that I mentioned of doing so constituting the basis for a claim for other exemptions which people might contend were more important than this.  Furthermore, the recent change was brought about largely in the interests of Irish booksellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the answer he has given is couched very much in administrators' terms?  While I can understand an administrator trying to simplify the process of administration and submitting such a reply to the Minister, I think the Minister ought to reconsider it. Does he not agree that it is intolerable that a book cannot be sent for review here over the price of £2.60&mdash;and very many books are over that price &mdash;without going through this long and complicated procedure?  This will interfere very much with the ordinary process of public enlightenment.  The reviewing of books is a very important feature of the whole process of public enlightenment and education.  Will he not agree as a Minister to look again at this matter?  There are very considerable complaints about it.  As a Minister concerned to take political decisions in the public interest, he ought to look at it again and not be unduly influenced by whatever administrative problem may exist.  Would he not agree to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated, one reason for this change was the interests of Irish booksellers because there was a strong contention that the then existing situation discriminated <Col N="1573" /> against Irish booksellers.  I do not think this can be described as an administrative decision.  Neither do I believe&mdash;although as the Deputy says there has been a good deal of complaint about this&mdash;that it has been demonstrated that this decision will affect in any significant or substantial way the availability of books or information. If it should emerge that there should be any substantial or significant interference in this way I would certainly look at the matter again.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in view of the delay in implementing the increase in income tax in this year's Budget he will take steps to ensure that arrears, when eventually sought, will be deducted from people with small incomes over a period of some weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget this year contained two proposals which affected wage and salary earners generally. The first was the withdrawal of the reduced rate relief on the first £100 <Col N="1574" /> of taxable income.  The other was the raising of the exemption limit for persons with small incomes.</P>
      <P>In order to give effect to these changes revised certificates of tax-free allowances were needed to enable employers to make the appropriate adjustments in deductions of tax from the weekly or monthly earnings of employees.  Before the new certificates could be issued, however, it was necessary to obtain from employers particulars of the current level of employees' earnings.  This was done during May and the issue of the revised certificates commenced at the beginning of June and will be completed within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>In some cases the changes have meant that persons are no longer liable to tax and others have had their tax reduced.  Where there is additional liability, however, the increased deduction could not be more than 22½p a week so that the maximum &ldquo;arrears&rdquo; which could be deducted would not amount to much more than £4.</P>
      <P>In any case where an element of hardship might arise consequent on the deduction of the full arrears in one sum, the Revenue Commissioners would have no objection to employers spreading the deduction of the additional tax payable over a reasonable period.</P>

      <P>The position is that for this purpose pupils from Northern Ireland are treated in similar manner to those from the rest of the country.  Thousands of pupils from that area have over the years attended schools within the State and the schools have made special arrangements to enable them to acquire the necessary knowledge of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that very considerable hardship is caused to people by this rule in its present form and that there should be some modification? Where, for example, a bank manager serving in Northern Ireland is transferred to the Republic and the children have already completed a number of years in school in Northern Ireland he should not be put into the position in which he dare not send his children to school in the Republic lest they fail to acquire a sufficient knowledge of Irish and, because of that, fail their terminal examination.  Such parents are forced to send the children to boarding schools in Northern Ireland, as is the case in the particular instance in which I have been in communication with the Department, and would the Parliamentary Secretary agree to look sympathetically at particular cases of hardship of this kind, which affect both the religious minority and also, in some cases, the religious majority whose children have been at schools not offering Irish in Northern Ireland?</P>

      <P>To be more precise, first of all, pupils who have come from other countries, apart from Northern Ireland, who have difficulty in acquiring, in the first instance, English because they have not been using English as a spoken language, receive special consideration.  Now the question arises of refugees who need special consideration.  Special consideration is being given in that area as well.  No provision has been made as yet for the type of case about which the Deputy has made representations and, until such time as the other matters are cleared up, no decision can be made because one has to rely on the previous experience of pupils from that area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will make provision to ensure that where a secondary school has extended the range of subjects offered by employing at its own expense, in the absence of fully-qualified teachers with the higher diploma in education, teachers otherwise qualified in these subjects, and where, either because these unqualified teachers are moved elsewhere or because qualified teachers become available, the school seeks to employ such qualified teachers, it will not be inhibited from doing so because of the restrictions on staff increases in the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in this matter is that every case is considered on its merits.  Factors taken into account include the existing staffing <Col N="1581" /> and the range of subjects provided in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases like this where a school has endeavoured to widen its range of subjects and been unable to get qualified teachers and unqualified teachers are not transferred elsewhere and it can get qualified teachers, would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the rigid application of the rule by his Department is simply narrowing the range of subjects and forcing schools so to narrow it and would he not agree that in cases like that sympathetic consideration should be given and that the additional teaching staff should be permitted so long as they are within the norms applied to secondary schools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point.  What the Deputy is arguing is that we should sanction unqualified teachers to be replaced by qualified teachers, and, when the Deputy says so long as they are within the norms, I agree with him.  However, I must confess that I had some difficulty in interpreting the Deputy's question in the first instance.  His question seems to imply that we should sanction the position where unqualified teachers who are not on incremental scales would be replaced in schools by qualified teachers who would be on incremental scales.  That would be a further financial commitment on the part of the State and in many instances it would be creating a precedent whereby if unqualified teachers were taken on in one year, qualified teachers should follow the next year.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary misunderstands the case I am making which was of a school that would have been entitled to get qualified teachers under the ratios laid down by the Department but who could not find such teachers.  Now, when the school seeks to employ them within those ratios, this new provision is preventing them from getting them and is forcing them to reduce the range of subjects.  Would the Parliamentary <Col N="1582" /> Secretary not agree that, in the terms of his own reply, this case should be considered sympathetically?</P>

      <P>During the past five years I have on four occasions indicated to the fertiliser manufacturers that I would not object to certain increases in their prices which would compensate them in part for unavoidable increases in costs.  Particulars of the increases in price are as follows:</P>
      <P>1966&mdash;increases ranging from 1.4 per cent to 3.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>1968&mdash;a flat increase of 7½ per cent.</P>

      <P>July, 1971&mdash;a flat increase of 7 per cent.</P>

    <P>I do not exercise control over the prices of imported fertilisers except to <Col N="1589" /> the extent that importers and wholesalers may not increase their margins on these fertilisers without giving me notice in advance.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) the tariff numbers of goods affected by the interim measures announced in his reply to Question No. 52 of 1st July, (b) the value of imports under each of these tariff numbers in the year 1969 and (c) the value of output in this country in 1968 and, where available, in 1969 of each of the articles mentioned in respect of which details are published in the Census of Industrial Production, or, where such information is not published, his Department's best estimate of the value of such output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The tariff numbers of the goods affected by the interim measures referred to by the Deputy are shown in the Imposition of Duties (No. 191) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1971, (Statutory Instrument No. 205 of 1971). Copies of this Instrument are in the Oireachtas Library.  The number of tariff positions involved is 94.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imports are classified by Official Import List Numbers, which do not correspond precisely with Tariff Reference headings and sub-headings. Import statistics for particular tariff references cannot therefore be readily extracted.  Industrial production statistics are compiled on an industry basis by fairly broad descriptions, which again do not correspond with tariff reference numbers, so that particulars of production in the detail requested by the Deputy are not available.  A further difficulty in regard to production <Col N="1591" /> data is that a number of the goods covered by the interim measures are the product of single-firm industries, or industries dominated by a single producer, and cannot therefore be revealed. A special examination is being carried out with a view to providing the Deputy with as much of the desired information as can be made available in the circumstances I have outlined. This will take some time to complete, but the Deputy will be furnished with the information as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that where it is a single-firm industry, there are problems about production figures, but can I take it that in all other cases the best estimate will be furnished, and am I right in taking it that in so far as negotiations have taken place concerning these products, the Minister must have known approximately the value produced and the value imported for the purpose of carrying on these negotiations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very much approximately, and, as I indicated in the reply, the position is that the corresponding headings do not run parallel and it is not quite a simple job of subtraction, addition and division, as the Deputy outlined last week.  I have been looking quite exhaustively into this and this is why I am in a position to say that, with co-operation between my Department and the Statistics Office, we are going to try to provide the Deputy with as detailed an outlining as possible but certainly it will be necessary in relation to the single producer here to have a type of group arrangement whereby their figures cannot be specifically disclosed.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that robbery with arms and violence has become all too common in this country in the past few years and that no effort is being made by the Government or the authorities to put it down?  Is the Minister not further aware that men who committed serious crimes, crimes of robbery, are on bail for over two and a half years.  The Minister talks about this being a matter for the Garda Síochána but the Government themselves have turned a blind eye and have instructed members of the Garda Síochána to turn a blind eye because certain people connected with those robberies were members of an illegal organisation which paraded as a political or semi-political organisation.</P>

      <P>I hope to be in a position in the next session to introduce legislation to amend and consolidate the law relating to compensation for malicious damage to property.  The proposed legislation will not relieve local authorities of liability but it will provide for a number of changes which will reduce the cost to local authorities of malicious injuries proceedings.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the grave concern in North Tipperary arising from a very serious malicious damage claim which has been lodged against the council by Mogul Mines for a figure in excess of £1½ million and will he ensure that the figure, when analysed, will not include consequential loss, that it will only include damage, as the figure quoted in one of the papers for damage is not too serious but the figure for consequential loss is a very serious matter?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The awarding of damages in an application for malicious injury is entirely a matter for the courts.  It is not a matter for me to ensure things one way or the other. My understanding of the law relating to malicious injury applications is that consequential loss is not allowable, that only the cost of damage actually done is recoverable.</P>

In view of the fact that there may be an increase&mdash;it has been stated&mdash;in the incidence of such malicious damage as occurred in Tipperary, does the Minister think it fair that this burden should remain on different areas of the country, that they should still bear the cost and not the Exchequer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>There are five military barracks in Dublin, viz. Cathal Brugha Barracks, Collins Barracks, McKee Barracks, Clancy Barracks and Griffith Barracks.</P>
      <P>Four of these are fully used by the Defence Forces and, in the case of the fifth, Griffith Barracks, about 25 per cent of the buildings are in military use, the remaining 75 per cent being occupied by sections of Government Departments and by the Eastern Health Board.  The former soldiers' married quarters at this barracks have been in use for many years by the Corporation of Dublin for housing. The former Beggars Bush Barracks is not in the administration of my Department and is not in military use. It is under the control of the Office of Public Works and accommodates the staff of the Stationery Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of providing suitable <Col N="1603" /> new accommodation to meet the needs of a modern army is at present being examined by my Department. This would, of course, have considerable financial implications.  If and when such accommodation is provided some at least of the old barracks will be available for disposal and in this connection account will be taken of housing and other needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces, in common with State employees generally, were from the outset excluded from the scope of PAYE and consequently the question of issuing certificates of tax free allowances to them on their discharge or transfer to the Reserve does not arise.  Each non-commissioned officer and private of the Defence Forces on his discharge or transfer to the Reserve is issued with a form which, in conjunction with his discharge certificate, indicates his contribution record under the Social Welfare Acts.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that while the existing water supply in the Dublin area is adequate to meet normal domestic and commercial requirements the rapid development of Dublin city and its environs has tended to tax it especially during spells of hot dry weather, such as we have had recently, when there is a very great increase in the use and abuse of water.  This I understand arises to a considerable extent from the watering of gardens etc.  The Deputies are no doubt aware that the Dublin Corporation have found it necessary to insert public notices in the Press requesting the public to conserve water and to discontinue the use of water for non-essential purposes.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that the water position in the Crumlin/Kimmage area is as represented by the Deputies but if they supply the sanitary authority with names and addresses of complainants in that area these will be investigated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing authorities are required by law to allocate tenancies of their dwellings in accordance with a scheme of letting priorities the terms of which are decided by them and approved by me under the Housing Act, 1966.  Most of the urban housing authorities have found it necessary to include in their schemes a clause restricting lettings to residents of their areas in order to protect the interests of families who are longest on their waiting lists.  It has been my general policy to encourage authorities to get rid of these restrictive clauses as soon as it is practicable for them to do so and I will be prepared to consider sympathetically any proposal which any housing authority may themselves make to amend their schemes so as to modify the operation of a residency clause in this or any other way.</P>
      <P>Most of the approved schemes of letting priorities include a special waiver clause in respect of emergency cases.  I have no doubt that, where genuine hardship arises for a particular family from Northern Ireland who may be left homeless through no fault of their own, housing authorities would be ready to operate the emergency re-housing clause in favour of such a family and they would not require my approval to do this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received no report of a widespread oil slick off the coast of Waterford. With regard to the arrangements <Col N="1618" /> for dealing with clearance of oil pollution I would refer the Deputies to my replies to Question No. 72 on 11th February, 1971, and Questions Nos. 65 and 66 on 19th November, 1970.</P>
    <P>I would also refer to the provisions of the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts under which offenders may be prosecuted by the Minister for Transport and Power and, in the case of a harbour, the harbour authority.</P>
    <P>I consider that I have covered the question of water pollution fairly fully in my opening statement on my Department's Estimates, columns 451 to 457, volume 254, No. 3, of the Dail Debates for 27th May, 1971.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Are any funds made available directly by the Minister's Department to local authorities to deal with pollution?  Of course, this is very often a localised problem but, at the same time, the cost of carrying out the work is considerable.  Is there any uniform arrangement for dealing with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the Deputy can read my statement introducing the Estimate.  At the moment there are interim arrangements.  The local authorities were asked to establish machinery to deal with such an emergency. No specific assistance is being granted to the local authorities.  They are expected to make these arrangements and they are expected to meet the cost out of their own resources. They will also be assisted in grave cases from central funds.  The Department would help if a special emergency arose.  This is all an interim arrangement. An inter-departmental committee is considering this and the type of legislation which will be necessary to establish, on a firm footing, a proper organisation to deal with it in a comprehensive way.  Until we know exactly where we are going in relation to an overall national policy, these arrangements are in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

The Deputy can be assured that if we had a very serious case of the pollution of a beach and the local authority said they could not deal with it, I would certainly handle it very sympathetically and make sure that the matter was dealt with immediately. Lack of finance on the part of the local authority would not cause a delay in clearing this up.  I would take immediate steps.</P>

      <P>The letter which issued from my Department on 2nd instant requested sanitary authorities to review their dumping arrangements in order to ensure that public refuse dumps are always properly maintained so as not to give rise to any nuisance. They were also asked, when seeking new sites for dumps, to bear in mind the advantages to be obtained from the provision of large central dumps and to consider the provision in convenient locations of large transportable receptacles for the temporary deposit of rubbish.  They were also requested to clear up any dumped material currently lying in unauthorised places.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 98 and 99 together.  Requests for representation on the Broadcasting Review Committee were received from a number of bodies including that referred to in Question No. 99.  The members of the Broadcasting Review Committee were appointed on the basis of their personal suitability and not as representing particular sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question at all and he knows that quite well.  He lumps it in with two other questions and does not give any answer whatever to it.  This is not good enough.  My question is quite a simple one: &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why he nominated only two women to the Broadcasting Review Committee.&rdquo; I did not say one word about bodies or anything else.</P>

      <P>The members of the Broadcasting Review Committee were appointed on the basis of their personal suitability and not as representing particular sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether women represent a section of the community but I should like to ask the Minister did he invite any women, other than the two who were appointed, to be members of the committee. Did he approach any other women?  I am not trying to get him in a corner but did he, in fact, approach women other than the two who were appointed to a committee of 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the Minister has a very peculiar idea about the suitable composition of a committee of this sort if he thinks that two women out of a committee of 14 are sufficient representation for one half of the community.</P>

      <P>The wording of &ldquo;personal suitability&rdquo; which the Minister used is extremely vague.  Personal suitability to whom, for what, in respect of which?  By what criteria does he gauge personal suitability?  We accept what he says, that these are not representatives of any groups.  Therefore, what is the criterion or what are the criteria?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This makes it more confusing than ever.  The public were not aware that many of the people concerned had any particular experience in this field&mdash;rather the contrary. I wonder would the Minister agree that the real criterion is whether a majority of the people so selected are regarded as personally suitable by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not realise that there are many women who by reason of their experience in drama, music, and so on, would be extremely suitable for this body?  Did it really not occur to the Minister to invite more than two women to act on this committee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, does the Minister not agree that the Society of Independent Film Makers of Ireland were entitled to representation on this body because of the fact that they spent over £600,000 on the production of TV commercials for RTE and does he not agree that a body which has gone to that expense and has taken such an interest should be entitled to some representation?  Furthermore, can he explain why Actors Equity, which wrote to him as long ago as last June asking that they be represented on this body, have received by way of reply merely a formal acknowledgment and no further communication of any kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to tell the Deputy that many, many bodies and groups wanted representation on this committee.  If one wants a committee <Col N="1629" /> which will work and do its job then the committee just cannot be too big.  The case made for Film Makers is a case that could also be made for set makers and set renters and many other bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that a body which spent a sum of over £600,000 on the production of commercials for RTE should be entitled to representation?  Other people may look for representation but I wonder if these others would spend so much and take such an interest in the production of commercials for RTE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Belton is under the impression that because these groups have no nominees on this body their views will not be heard.  That is not so.  Anybody who is interested will be quite free to come along and make their views clearly known to the broadcasting committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>The Inland Post Warrant 1939 (SRO No. 202 of 1939) forbids posting, conveying or delivering through the post any postal packet having anything impressed or attached to any part of the side of the packet which bears the address at which the packet is to be delivered and which may hamper officials in sorting or dealing with the packet.  Such items are described technically as &ldquo;embarrassing postal packets&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>This amendment is designed to meet the criticism advanced by Deputy Cooney and others in relation to section 40 when it was pointed out that in the case of a family arrangement, if there were a sale, there could be a question as to the value and there could be a reassessment of duty and <Col N="1638" /> that this could stretch effectively for a period up to 12 years.  I undertook to reconsider this if it did not appear that it would provide a loophole for evasion.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is new, but as Deputies will see, what it is providing for is that the Revenue Commissioners will have power in their discretion to mitigate any penalty or to stay or compound any proceedings for recovery of a penalty and also after judgment, may further mitigate or entirely remit the penalty.  There are two reasons for this.  One is that it really should have been in originally anyway and was overlooked.  The other reason is that in the context of the debate in relation to the penalties it is clear that a situation could arise, even though we have provided for penalties not exceeding £500, and some of the penalties also provide in addition for double the amount of the duty, which is a very substantial penalty&mdash; it could so happen that a very heavy <Col N="1640" /> penalty would be imposed by the court and either it would be quite impossible for the person concerned to pay it or some circumstances might emerge which did not emerge in court and which would have led to a different decision.  It is desirable that in such cases the Revenue Commissioners should have power to be reasonably flexible in their approach to the recovery of the penalty.</P>

      <P>If I am in order, I would like to refer to some of the points occurring on the debate on <Col N="1641" /> Committee Stage which I undertook to consider and to mention to the House the results of my consideration of these points.  First, in regard to section 9 dealing with housekeeper allowance in the case of an unmarried mother, on Committee Stage Deputy O'Higgins raised the question whether the conditions which must be satisfied before a housekeeper allowance could be granted to an unmarried mother would exclude a case in which the mother while out at work paid, say a neighbour to look after the child in the neighbour's home and I undertook to look into this.  Where this type of arrangement is made, it would be accepted by the inspector of taxes that no relative of the mother is able or willing to take care of the child.  Otherwise, the arrangement would not have been made and as the person looking after the child during the mother's absence at work would clearly be employed by the mother for that purpose, the housekeeper allowance would be given.  In the case of a person who is employed to take care of a child, the section does not require that the person be resident with the mother, so that the case envisaged by Deputy O'Higgins would, in fact, be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Assuming that there was a case where a mother did not go out to work or where she had a small business and the child was living with her and it was necessary for her to devote her full time to the business, would she quality for a housekeeper's allowance in respect of someone living in the house with her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided it is full-time employment&mdash;in such a case, yes she would be entitled.  Another question that was raised was in regard to the income limit for the purpose of a dependent relative allowance.  Deputy Cooney suggested that the income limit for the purpose of dependent relative allowance should be increased to a figure which would enable the full allowance to be given where the relative's income does not exceed the amount of the old age contributory pension.  What we are providing at present, and have provided in the past, <Col N="1642" /> is that it is at the level of the old age non-contributory pension.  We have amended this limit in previous years to keep it in line with the amount of the old age non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that, on consideration, I have decided that I could not agree to this.  There are a number of reasons. One of them is that the cost is relatively substantial and I could not contemplate it certainly in the present financial year.  The cost would be in the region of £300,000, but apart from that I have some doubts on considering it as to the advisability of it.  An essential prerequisite to claiming the maximum dependent relative allowance is that, broadly speaking, the person in question must be dependent, and if his income rises above a certain level, the maximum allowance is automatically reduced by £1 for every £ of the excess.  To link the maximum dependent relative allowance to the contributory old age pension instead of the maximum non-contributory old age pension, which is itself directly related to means would be to move away from the concept of dependency on which the relief currently operates.  Furthermore, if the income limit for the purpose of claiming the maximum dependent relative allowance were raised, only taxpayers with relatives on incomes above the non-contributory old age pension level would benefit, and I think that other taxpayers with dependants on incomes which were on or below that level could justifiably demand a commensurate increase in their dependent relative allowance, so that for these reasons I am afraid I cannot accede to Deputy Cooney's suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised a question in regard to section 16, which was section 14 of the Bill as introduced.  He suggested that the lack of a reference in section 444 (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 to beneficiaries of a settlement, other than a child of the settlor, might have the effect in the case of a discretionary trust in favour of children, settlor and other persons of denying the relief provided by section 444 (a) in respect of income accumulated under such a trust, with the result that a charge under section 443 (1) would be created.  The Revenue Commissioners have examined the position and <Col N="1643" /> they have assured me that there would be no question of section 444 (a) being interpreted by them in such a way as to have the effect referred to by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 17, or section 15 in the Bill as introduced, I undertook to look into two points raised by Deputy O'Higgins.  First, the Deputy wished to know whether the practice would continue of not charging interest on tax which was being met out of a repayment of British tax arising under the residence agreement.  In practice, where a taxpayer mandates a repayment of British tax to the Irish Revenue, interest is not charged during the period from the date of lodgment of the repayment claim to the date on which the Irish tax is satisfied out of the repayment, and this practice will continue.</P>
    <P>The second point which Deputy O'Higgins raised in this connection was concerned with the imposition of interest in a case in which a taxpayer dies and tax cannot be paid until probate or letters of administration have been extracted.  The position is that where a taxpayer dies during the period of grace, that is when interest has not begun to run, it is the practice to allow a similar period of grace from the date of extraction of the probate or letters of administration within which the tax may be paid without attracting interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not stated specifically in the Bill.  That is what we were arguing about the other evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In another context.  This, in fact, is what happens and I am putting it on the record of the House now that it will continue to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure that the Revenue Commissioners read what he says about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be quite assured that they will.  Where the taxpayer dies after the period of grace, that is, when interest has already begun to run, the interest charge is maintained up to the date of payment on the basis that the tax should have been paid <Col N="1644" /> prior to the taxpayer's death.  That practice will continue also.</P>
      <P>A question was raised in regard to section 19 and a similar point was raised in regard to later sections in regard to the question of the taxpayer, or perhaps the executor in case of estate duty, having to pay the amount assessed to be due pending an appeal to the circuit court and if it is found that he has over-paid getting a refund with interest at 9 per cent.  This was objected to by some Deputies.  The first point that needs to be made about it is that in the case of an appeal to the High Court on a point of law section 428 (9) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 provides that notwithstanding the appeal tax shall be payable in accordance with the determination of the appeal commissioners. Section 17 of this Bill merely brings the provisions regarding the payment of tax where an appeal is taken to the circuit court into line with those which apply under existing law in cases of appeal to the High Court.  There is no new principle being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A bad one is being repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  It was suggested that if the appeal is not pursued interest at the rate of 9 per cent would still have to be paid anyway. While it is true I think it is understood that the primary purpose of the section and similar sections and different provisions of the Bill is to secure prompt payment of tax.  Again I would remind the House of the provisions in section 17 whereby any overpayment which emerges is refunded with interest at 9 per cent.  In these circumstances I do not think any injustice is being done nor are we creating any precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to section 20, that is section 18 of the Bill as introduced, arising out of two amendments to section 18 of the Bill which were put down by Deputy O'Higgins and others I undertook to look again at the definition of &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; which is applied by the section having regard to the criticism made that it would embrace a simple failure to make a return or an innocent omission from a return.  Deputies <Col N="1645" /> will recall that we have just passed an amendment on a similar point in relation to death duties.  This is in connection with income tax.  I indicated in response to the case made by Deputy O'Higgins that I wanted to ensure that somebody who is not guilty of fraud in its strict legal sense but is guilty of more than neglect in the sense that the layman understands it would be liable to the interest provided by the section.  I referred to the definition of &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; which is set out in section 186 (2) (d) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which has been imported into this Bill.  I do not want to complicate the issue unduly but I think the best thing I can say is this: Two kinds of cases can arise.  If it is the case of an incorrect return the inspector will have to show that this was not the result of an innocent mistake but that the taxpayer was guilty of negligence in the making of the return.  It may be taken that the appeal commissioners or the court to whom the taxpayer has recourse will not be lightly satisfied on this point.  The other case that can arise is one of failure to give a notice, to make a return or to furnish a list of documents or other information. In such a case the inspector will have to show that the requirement was not complied with within the allowed time and the provisions about a reasonable excuse apply.  In either of these cases the Revenue Commissioners are advised that the proviso to the definition of neglect would operate so that if the taxpayer had any reasonable excuse for making the incorrect return or for his failure to give the required notice or return it would not be possible to show that he was negligent.</P>
    <P>In addition to what I have said I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that when this original definition was before the House a discussion took place in which the late Deputy Sweetman was making the point that an ordinary mistake would not be excused under this definition.  At that time my predecessor gave a certain undertaking by which I am bound and which I am now repeating. Deputy Sweetman said:</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to <Col N="1646" /> come with me in this respect and is prepared to say that if it is held that this does not cover a genuine mistake will he, in his corporate capacity, not come in with amended legislation and do that?</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey replied:</P>
    <P>I will do that.</P>
    <P>I am repeating that undertaking.  I want to make it clear that no such case has arisen.  The Revenue Commissioners are advised that it should not and could not arise but to make assurance doubly sure I am making it clear that if any such case should arise I am undertaking in my corporate capacity, in other words, to bind my successor, that amending legislation will be brought in to cover that point.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 32 Deputies Fitzpatrick and Cooney inquired as to how interest would be computed having regard to delays in the assessment of duty.  An example was given of an account being lodged in respect of personalty within three months of a death and subsequently assessed after a delay of, say, six months.  The position in such a case is that as the account was lodged within the four-month interest-free period and as interest is not charged while delay occurs in the Estate Duty Office no interest would, in fact, be payable.  If the account was lodged nine months after the death, five months outside the interest-free period, interest would be charged for that five months only, irrespective of the date of assessment. If, however, the date of the case had to be queried and unreasonable delay took place on the parties' side in dealing with it interest would be charged for the period of the delay.  In other words, taxpayers are not prejudiced by delay on the part of officials in dealing with cases.</P>
    <P>Another point was raised by Deputies Fitzpatrick and Cooney which concerned section 32 (2) (b) which, it was suggested, was ambiguous.  Under existing legislation interest on death duties in arrears is payable at 4 per cent.  The section provides that interest accruing due after the passing of the Act shall be paid at 9 per cent. <Col N="1647" /> The subsection provides that interest on death duties payable in connection with the death of a person who died before the passing of the Act in cases where the duty is not being paid by instalments shall continue for a period of four months after the passing of the Act to be payable at 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I pointed out at the time, on Committee Stage, that the word &ldquo;continue&rdquo; could, I think, be interpreted as making clear that the rate continues at 4 per cent but, apart from that, the section specifically imposes the 9 per cent rate only on interest accruing after the passing of the Act.  So, it is quite clear that there is no ambiguity, that in all cases where there are arrears the question of charging 9 per cent on the arrears back over a few years cannot arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a suggestion in regard to section 21 (5) of the Finance Act, 1965 that the rate of interest in that should be increased from 6 per cent to 9 per cent but that, in fact, would be to the disadvantage of the taxpayer because section 21 of the 1965 Act deals with discretionary trusts and makes liable to duty benefits payable to a deceased who was an object of the trust.  The extent of that liability is limited to the proportion of the capital of the trust which is equal to the fraction which benefits which the deceased received in a certain period, represents of the entire income of the trust over the period.  In other words, the slice, if the person had reserved the right of residence, that slice related to the over-all amount of the estate, would be the amount on which duty would be assessed.  His income would be deemed, under this section to be 6 per cent arising on this slice which is chargeable.  If we adopted the suggestion to make it 9 per cent we would in fact be making the position worse for the taxpayer.  I do not think that is comparable with what we have been doing in the Bill.  I think, on consideration, Deputy O'Higgins will agree with me that we should not raise it to 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy O'Higgins made the complaint, particularly in relation to section 36 which <Col N="1648" /> deals with the difficult problem of controlled companies, that this suffers from a lack of definitions and in support of this contention they referred to the fact that the British Finance Act, 1940, which has somewhat similar provisions, incorporates several definitions. The whole question here is one of approach to what is admittedly a very difficult and complex problem. We have attempted to deal with it in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible.  The alternative to this is comprehensive sections with watertight definitions and that also is open to objection and might well defeat its own purpose.  It is well to remember that the British legislation, where they have so many definitions, had to be amended at least eight times and their legislation has been repeatedly criticised for its complexity.</P>
    <P>Definitions in themselves can create difficulties and often provide loopholes. On the whole, while admitting that all the right is not on one side I think we have adopted the better course.  I should also say that since the matter has become quite complex and since there are references in a number of different Acts, if in the course of time further amendments of this legislation relating to controlled companies should become necessary, we shall give further consideration to this matter and also, perhaps, to the question of incorporating them all into one section because I think the matter is becoming rather difficult for anyone to follow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Some day some Minister for Finance will do this.  Unfortunately, the pressures which operate all the time tend to prevent this being done but no doubt it is a very desirable thing if it could be done.  Deputy Bruton raised a question about the statutory authority for the interest-free period of 12 months in relation to real property. Section 32 of the Bill increases the rate of interest which accrues after the passing of the Act.  This is effected by amending section 18 of the Finance Act, 1896 which reads, in so far as it is material, as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> Simple interest shall be payable on all estate duty from the date of the death of the deceased or, where the duty is payable by instalments, from the date on which the first instalment of the duty becomes due.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (8) of the Finance Act, 1894, provides that estate duty on realty may be paid by instalments and that &mdash;I quote:</P>
    <P>... the first instalment shall be due after the expiration of 12 months from the date.</P>
    <P>Since the duty on realty is payable by instalments interest commences to accrue only from the date when the first instalment is due, whether the duty is, in fact, being paid by instalments or not and that is on the expiration of 12 months after the date of death.  This is the authority for the 12 months grace period on realty, and is so accepted in all the authorities on this branch of the law.  The section in this Bill which gives four months interest free on personalty does so in relation to death duties other than these so that I think the statutory authority from the interest-free period is clear.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill as it comes for consideration now is somewhat improved as a result of the Committee debate and the Report Stage just concluded. Nevertheless, it is not a Bill which we can commend in view of the measure it contains.  As Finance Bills go, it is undoubtedly a Bill which contains many penal provisions.  It is also distinguished by the removal of concessions given in previous Finance Bills which were of significance and value to the less well-off people. Section 2 of the Bill ends a relief which was given only last year under which every person, in relation to the first £100 of his taxable income, obtained relief.  This was of considerable benefit to those with smaller earnings and perhaps smaller tax bills. They certainly appreciated the value of the concession much more than those <Col N="1650" /> with larger incomes or earnings and larger tax bills.  As a result of the ending of that concession&mdash;which had been in operation for only 12 months &mdash;there has been imposed on everyone, irrespective of income or means, precisely the same increase in taxation of the order of £11 per year.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains provisions whereby for the first time gifts made in consideration of marriage are regarded as voluntary gifts.  The social view has obtained for many years that this kind of gift should be encouraged by equating it to a transfer for valuable consideration.  This has been ended, according to the Minister in the interests of tax avoidance.  I should have thought that the need at the moment particularly would be to encourage the transfer into active hands of agricultural land so that it might be more energetically used, that it might yield a larger income and, as a result, that the country might be better equipped to meet our entry into Europe.  The provision in this regard renders the Bill objectionable.</P>
      <P>There is also the increase in the rates of estate duty.  We discussed the provision in this respect on Committee Stage.  It is proper to point out that the Bill provides for a punitive increase in the rate of estate duty applicable to estates valued £55,000 and upwards. The increase in these rates has taken place at a time of inflation, when money values have fallen, when the paper value of estates has risen, and at a time when without any increase in the rate of estate duty, by reason of inflation there would be a perceptible increase in the revenue from death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the abolition of another concession made a few years ago.  As a result of debate, argument and dialogue in this House, it was provided that in relation to the liability to death duties or voluntary transfers, a sliding scale should apply and that the nearer to the five-year period a donor or the person who transferred property lived, the lesser would be the rate of estate or death duty.  This ending of a concession that was valued is symptomatic of the <Col N="1651" /> approach adopted in this Bill.  With the cry of eliminating tax avoidance, all these little concessions whereby the lot of the smaller people and the taxpayers could be made easier, are being abolished.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a revenue-raising Bill but under the guise of eliminating tax avoidance more money is being raised. Concessions, perhaps not of great significance to the richer people but of value to the poorer sections, are being ended. It is proper that these matters should be pointed out at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the debate there were suggestions that certain relatively minor changes in some cases, and major changes in a few cases, in the tax law should be introduced.  In the last hour I commented by way of interruption, that this kind of thing should not be done by way of such a Bill.  It is unfair to the Minister and to the House to bring in legislation which is introduced with the object of putting into effect the Budget proposals and then including in it many unrelated items which have been thought up in the interval between the introduction of the Budget and the introduction of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I am surprised at some of the things that have been done in the Bill.  I am particularly appalled that the Minister should decide in his first full year as Minister for Finance to take away the concession which had been heralded with many trumpets last year&mdash;the first £100 of earned income to be taxed at 4s 8d. The Minister tried to cover it up in a way unworthy of him.  He spoke about the extra people who are being put outside the tax net and implied that in a peculiar way this compensated for the removal of the concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that increased wages and salaries during the year brought many more people into the tax net than those who were excluded. There was the suggestion in the Minister's speech a short time ago when certain concessions were being suggested that this was not the time to grant the concessions.  May I tell the Minister that if concessions for the <Col N="1652" /> lower income people are not introduced now they will never be introduced. Last year there was a very substantial increase in the amount of direct taxation by way of income tax taken from the people's wage packets and, if my figures are correct, the Minister proposes to increase the amount of income tax taken from the workers.  It is the lower paid group who pay the majority of the income tax.  The amount will be increased from £129 million in the financial year to £141 million.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not consider that in a year when he will get an extra £12 million in taxation that he could give a little concession to the people who are contributing this money?  The Minister gives a few minor reductions in taxation or increases in the amounts of benefits but he does not make any effort to deal with the badly paid persons. As has been pointed out in this debate, 15 years ago these people were able, on their tax free allowance, to earn some money on overtime without paying tax.  Now they are being taxed on about one-third of what even the Agricultural Wages Board laid down as the minimum wage required to keep body and soul together.  The whole thing has gone completely screwy.  I was hoping that the Minister would be the man who would do something to redress the wrongs that have been done over the years.  He has not done that.</P>
    <P>Not alone has this extra taxation been put on, but no effort was made to deal in a reasonable way with the increased cost of living as it affects taxpayers.  A few minutes ago the Minister said that he could not take into consideration the contributory pension as a basis because he felt this would affect the general tax structure dealing with allowances for pensioners. Does he suggest that a married couple who have in their house aged parents, or one aged parent, can keep those people on £5 per week?  That is what he is saying, that they can maintain them on £5 per week in 1971.  If he goes amongst the poorer classes and the lower income groups he will discover that they are finding it extremely hard to keep body and soul together. Yet, all the time the State is looking for more and more out of their small incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> The Minister missed an opportunity when he did not do something substantial this year.  I made this comment before and I will make it again.  I hope it does not happen, but if for any reason war were declared, we would find £50 million or £60 million in one year for defence and the next year nobody would remark on the extra taxation.  It would be completely forgotten. We have a national emergency every year because our poor people are not being treated properly and our lower paid workers are not getting a &ldquo;fair do&rdquo; with regard to taxation.  Yet the Minister has not done anything about it.</P>
    <P>The incidence of taxation on overtime is all wrong because somebody who is working overtime and earning money, if he is paying tax, has to pay 7s in the £ and, if he is living in a local authority house on a differential rent, he will possibly be paying another 3s 6d per £ rent on top of that. For every £ he earns in overtime wages, the ordinary wage earner can bring home only 9s 6d to help to rear his family.  The State takes 7s and the local authority take 3s 6d.  Even on the 9s 6d taken home the State collects turnover tax and wholesale tax, and tax after tax.  The amount of money which ordinary working people can really call their own is terribly small. We must do something about this. There is no point in just allowing it to go on from year to year.  That is one reason why I feel the Government have fallen down badly on the job they were given to do.</P>
    <P>The marriage grant has been referred to by many people and because of the fact that we argued about it for so long I do not propose to delay this House except to say that it appears obvious that when this was introduced the idea was to get at the million-pound parents.  I suggest that there are no million-pound parents in this country.  The people who were giving marriage grants to their children were people who had made a reasonable amount of money: relatively small farmers, middle size farmers, small shopkeepers, business men and sometimes ordinary artisans who had a few pounds and decided they would help <Col N="1654" /> their children to set up homes when they were getting married.  Yet the State feels that they are a source of income, that they are people who can be &ldquo;got at&rdquo; and that some of this money must be taken from them if the generous parent dies within five years of the grant made on marriage.</P>
    <P>The State wants a portion of what was given to the children even though the children may only have a house or a small farm.  What are they to do? Sell portion of the house or portion of the farm in order to get the money which the State says it requires?  The Minister admitted that a relatively small sum will be taken in here.  The biggest objection I have to the Finance Bill is that there are so many niggling proposals in it which, according to the Minister, will take in relatively small amounts of money but, we are told they are included to prevent tax evasion.  This is a rather ridiculous argument.  There must be some other reason for doing it.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that in this Bill the Minister would have tried to help the people who have to travel to work.  I am sure the Minister is sick and tired of hearing me suggesting to him that he should do something to try to alleviate the hardship caused to people who, rather than stay unemployed and go to the labour exchanges and draw whatever paltry sum they would get, travel long distances to work.  To do that they must purchase a motor vehicle of some kind.  They must pay tax and insurance on it.  They must pay for the running costs, repairs and everything else.  Many of my constituents start off for work at 6.30 a.m. or 7 a.m.  They drive to a building site and work hard all day.  Very often in the summertime they barely get home with the light.  Yet they are required to pay income tax on everything they earn over a certain amount.  They are given no allowance whatsoever for travelling up and down.  This must be wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Haughey, admitted it was wrong.  The reason he gave for not doing anything about it was that it would cost too much and would cause too much trouble.  He did not try to justify it by saying it was right to tax these people. <Col N="1655" /> He said it would cost too much and cause too much trouble.  If the people who drew up this income tax code were put in the same position it would not be too much trouble for them to try to remedy it.  A section in a Bill was introduced&mdash;I wondered how the Minister got it into the Bill&mdash;to deal with a group of people called &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; employed on building sites. When the Bill was going through, it was specifically stated that the section was intended to deal with those who were employed on contract work on building sites.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was passed on that basis, the Revenue Commissioners decided that they would not administer it that way.  When they got the names of those people who applied for a tax certificate on the grounds that they were sub-contractors, it was ruled that they were not sub-contractors and would have to pay PAYE.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of that.  The people who were engaged in that work simply packed up and left the country.  They left the job.  Because they had not got tax certificates they were involved in a lot of expenditure which they just could not meet. All the little petty regulations which could be thought of were used to prevent them from getting a tax free certificate to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>What really annoys me is that when this section was going through the House the Minister said&mdash;and he is on record&mdash;that it was put in specifically to deal with these people we refer to as lumpers, men who take a lump job on a building site.  Yesterday evening the Minister admitted that, in his estimation, this was the reason why it was put into the Bill.  Now it is being twisted around and suggested that it deals only with contractors who have a set business place, who have a billhead and who, in addition to doing contract work, are supplying material, and what have you.  These people are supplying the tools which do the job. They are, in fact, sub-contractors; they are lumpers; they are entitled to be covered.</P>
    <P>There are so many other things wrong with this Bill that we could talk <Col N="1656" /> all night about them.  I know the time is limited because most people are anxious to get other legislation through. Therefore, I do not propose to detain the House any longer except to say that I am bitterly disappointed that the Bill does not do the many things the Minister could have done with it in the light of the amount of money he will have available to him out of the pockets of those with whom this Bill deals.  The Minister has not taken that opportunity and I regret that he has not done so.  I cannot say to the Minister, as I did on a previous occasion, that I hope he will do these things next year because, frankly, I hope he will not be there to do them next year.</P>

      <P>Disappointment has been expressed with this measure by both Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Tully on this Fifth Stage.  Deputy O'Higgins says that the Bill is still completely unacceptable, even with the slight improvements that have been made in it.  I, too, want to express my disappointment.  I tried very hard, not only this year but in years past, to get the relief of income tax on exports extended to a wider group.  I regret to say that, even though the time could not be more opportune and even though the Minister had no real opposition to the case I was making, I still got nowhere with my recommendations.  I think this was because the Minister for Finance invariably seems to come in here in a rigid frame of mind; the Bill he is bringing in is the Bill that must go through the House and, whether or not a good case is made, he will accept no amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to overtime.  I think nobody could make a better case for those who, in many cases, are almost compelled to do overtime, for those who might even lose their jobs if they refused to do overtime, and, while I do not propose to cover the same ground, I do want to say that not only is this a hardship on the people to whom Deputy Tully referred but it is also an embarrassment to employers in many cases because, with PAYE, an employer may hand out at the end of the week different amounts to two men who did exactly the same work, one getting more than his fellow-worker <Col N="1657" /> or <i>vice versa</i>.  There is no relationship between the two sums.</P>
    <P>I want to come back now to the extension of tax reliefs on exports. Sometime subsequent to the point at which I raised this here a deputation came to see me.  It was then too late for me to do anything about their problem but I said that if I could raise it within the Rules of Order on Fifth Stage I would mention it to the Minister and ask him if he would consider their position before he brought the Bill to the Seanad.  Again, it is an extension of the relief of tax on exports, but it is of peculiar sort of extension, if you like. Nevertheless, this is a very real request. The deputation was a deputation from people engaged in the hotel business, people who cater entirely for foreign visitors coming in here.  They claim they are working package deals and they are dealing in an export business. They are getting money indirectly from outside the country.  As well as that, when these people come in here, they are fed on Irish food and they get Irish services for which they must pay.  This is bringing in money from outside. That is the purpose behind exports. The tourist business is in very bad shape at the moment and this relief would be a great fillip to it.  The point made was that, if this were conceded, you would be paying for performance; you would not be giving money to a group that did not deserve to get it. They have the proof that this is, in fact, money that is brought in from outside.  I would recommend very, very strongly to the Minister that, before he goes to the Seanad, he should consider if something could not be done for this very deserving group, a group which is in a very poor way at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to confine my remarks solely to income tax.  I went up and got the Estimates for Receipts and Expenditure.  One would think that on the basis of the taxation imposed on incomes last year, with an increase in yield from £113 million to £133 million, an increase of about 18 per cent, the Minister would not have dreamt of interfering with the system, except to improve it&mdash;that is to say, to give some further concessions.  Instead <Col N="1658" /> of that he took away the miserable concession given last year.  This is deplorable.  The result is that there will, in fact, be an increase arithmetically of 25 per cent in the amount that will be taken in income tax this year.  Of course, as I said on Second Reading, section 2 of this Bill now puts back into the income tax net people who should not be in it at all, people who are below subsistence level.  What shocks me is that this is happening despite the inadequate provision in the Budget for the transport companies, some semi-State transport bodies and for education.  When this House comes back, if it does come back here after the recess, what will be displayed will astonish the people.  As I said the other day, there will be at least £20 million required for a subsidy for the transport organisations.  The Minister did in a way try to minimise certain things of which he was well aware.  That was obvious from his reactions here.  It was obvious he was well aware of certain matters and he did try to get over them as best he could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that this is a very good approach.  He did say in his Budget speech that by keeping down costs he was restraining inflation to 12½ per cent.  That, of course, was not true at all.  Suppose we allow that he understated a bit at that stage, had he told the whole story the House could reasonably be satisfied, but he did not tell the whole story.  There is no question about that.  There will be massive losses which will have to be met by further taxation in the autumn. I must say that any reasonable person would regret the fact that a man paying £100 in income tax last year will this year have to pay £110, instead of it being the other way around.  The cost of living is up by about 12 per cent and the amount of income tax a man should pay should be down instead of up.  I am assuming his income has not changed, but the yield is such that it is obvious that most people's incomes have, in fact, changed. Although the Minister professed to deplore inflation, in fact, he utilised it all the way along.  But even this massive inflation shown by this yield from income tax was not sufficient for the <Col N="1659" /> Minister's purpose and he had, therefore, to do this miserable business about income tax and, having done that, running right through the Bill there are all these small, niggling, as they were called by Deputy Tully, bits and pieces.</P>
    <P>We ought, I think, express our appreciation here of the hard work the Fine Gael Party put into a relatively unremunerative effort politically on this Bill.  I certainly think it is a poor Bill, but it is one degree better now than it was when it came into the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the high level of taxation imposed in this Bill but, before I do so, I should like to thank Deputy O'Donovan for the praise he has given the Fine Gael Party.  I do not mean that I would share in that praise; it was my fellow Deputies sitting here in front of me who put in a great deal of work on this Bill.  They have highlighted certain aspects of the increase in taxation and the difficulties these increases are causing sections of our people.  I am glad that Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Fitzpatrick, as well as other Deputies, adverted at various Stages of the Bill to the proposed increase in death duties.  I am sorry that the Finance Minister has seen fit to increase those duties and that he has gone back on the concessions that were made to people who made <i>inter vivos</i> gifts.  Those people who have made gifts of the money which they, perhaps, saved from their hard won earnings and who wish to pass this money on to their children or to relatives, now find that the State is stepping in and that the five year sliding scale is being discontinued.</P>
      <P>It is particularly hard for elderly people who wish to be able to leave some money to relatives who may be in need of such money and who believe that they themselves can dispose of their own money in a way that is more acceptable than the way in which the State would dispose of it.  Those of us on this side of the House would be very much in agreement with their line of thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have adverted to <Col N="1660" /> the question of overtime and have expressed the opinion that there should be some concession in relation to income tax payable on money earned as a result of overtime.  This is a dangerous road to travel.  Much as I would wish to see concessions being given to people under almost any grounds especially people who have worked hard for their money, I would not consider this to be a practical proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative is a substantial increase in the overtime rate, which is what must come next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That, in itself, will carry it.  I have heard people say that they did not wish to work overtime because it was not worth their while.  That is rubbish because this would apply too to every other taxpayer to a greater or lesser extent. What is the difference between a man who is paid, say, £5 per week extra for overtime and a man who, without doing overtime, but because of his exertions too, also earns an extra £5 per week? Is the exemption to be denied to the latter who may have worked equally as hard as the other person but, perhaps, in a different capacity, because his work was not designated as overtime?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the House that I spelled out in detail what was involved&mdash;it would involve for taxpayers a sum of less than £12 per year.  The fact that I referred also to the increased allowances being made in the old age allowances and in the small income allowances and that the effect of this was to take 20,000 taxpayers out of the net and to reduce the tax liability of 40,000 other taxpayers was not an attempt to cover anything up. It was a factual statement in relation to a provision contained in the Bill. Deputies who have spoken have been eloquent about the additional taxation proposed and about the effects of inflation. I did not hear any Deputy talk about the effect of inflation on the expenditure of the Exchequer.  Neither did I hear any Deputy talk about the fact that approximately 25 per cent of the work force in this State is paid either directly or indirectly from the Exchequer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy O'Donovan consider it fair to talk about the increased taxation accruing as though it were available and that we should have taken taxation from the lower paid sections of the community, ignoring what was done anyway?  The point I wish to make about all this is that one cannot comment on it with any degree of rationality without referring back to the economic situation in which these changes were made.</P>
      <P>I do not intend going back over them now but I want to put on record that any consideration of the taxation changes in this Bill must be considered in the context of our overall economic situation and in the light of the objectives we have been trying to achieve and which, I am glad to say, as evidence indicates, we are on the way to achieving.  Apart from these income tax allowances and the changes in income tax and apart from the allowances to blind people and others&mdash; small concessions and fairly substantial concessions to widows and dependent children in the case of death duties&mdash;apart from these things, I would suggest that the main theme of this Bill is not what has been suggested by Deputy O'Higgins.  It is that there is a clear concern to ensure as far as we can that people who have heretofore been able to avoid liability for tax or death duties are being served with notice that we are determined to try to prevent them from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes have been referred to as niggling changes because they are not going to bring in very much money. <Col N="1663" /> I have conceded freely that they are not, but I make no apology to anybody for trying to ensure as far as I can that there is equity as between one taxpayer and another, and that people who are succeeding in getting away with it in relation to paying their taxes should be got after, and one of the categories in respect of which action was taken in that regard were the people known as lumpers.  Deputy Tully referred to this, and I did mention before, but I want to remind the House, that so far the indications are that this has been extremely successful and that many thousands of people who were engaged in lumping, not paying tax, not paying social welfare contributions with all the attendant problems that have arisen for everybody, including trade unions, have gone back into their jobs and are now paying tax and social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully complained that the Revenue Commissioners are administering this in a way which was not intended or indicated in this House.  I want to ask Deputy Tully to go back and have a look at the Bill.  He will find there set out the basis on which the regulations under which the Revenue Commissioners are operating, and there is a specific reference to the question of having a fixed place of business in the Bill.  It is not something imported by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  It is a misinterpretation of it and you yourself said that you realised that it was introduced for the purpose of dealing with people who were lumping jobs, and <Col N="1664" /> these are the lumpers.  The others are a different group altogether, who are rightly caught, but the lumpers are an entirely different group and you are misapplying the Bill to them.  However, we will discuss that matter another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue it but I do not agree.  I want to say, too, that one of the alleged examples of niggling provisions of which complaint was made was the provision in this Bill dealing with gifts in consideration of marriage.  I have heard what I can only describe as the most exaggerated claims made in relation to that provision.  When one realises that we are talking here about, first of all, a very limited number of cases in which there is any gift in consideration of marriage and of those, we are talking about the very small percentage where the person making the gift dies within five years of the gift&mdash;that is what we are talking about in terms of numbers &mdash;but when you have regard to the effect of it, both on the rural and non-rural community, I have already explained about the application of the artificial valuation system on the rural side&mdash;but if you look at the situation on the non-farming side, I think Deputy Tully illustrated here a few months ago the heights of absurdity to which people will go on a matter like this.  He may not recall it but I wrote down the words he used when he was talking about the non-rural side.  He talked about an ordinary artisan being affected by this.  I would ask Deputy Tully does he know any ordinary artisan who can afford to give a gift of £5,000 to one of his children, not to mind all of the children, because I do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If ordinary artisans in this country can afford to give £5,000 to even one of their children on marriage, they are a great deal better off than Deputy Tully has been pretending to us.  They are in fact better off than they were but nothing like as well off as that.</P>

I hope that message will go forth loud and clear as to what happened in this House on this Bill, as to the approach taken not alone by Fine Gael, who are more or less expected to take it, but by the Labour Party who pretend that they do not take that view, but there they were solidly defending every effort to get at the rich people who were avoiding taxation in this country and they opposed every one of them.  The message is going forth and I add to it as much as I can.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I will not delay the House much longer.  I want to say this final word, that I would like to add to what was said by, I think, Deputy O'Donovan when he referred to the contribution of members of the Fine Gael Party.  I would add, by some members of the Labour Party also. Whether we agreed or disagreed, some Members who took part in this debate worked very hard at it and I would like to acknowledge that contribution and to acknowledge also that as a result of their efforts, the Bill has been improved&mdash;whether substantially, I do not know&mdash;and I think that is seen in the amendments brought in here today. Deputy O'Leary was not in on it and did not do any work on it so that he is not involved in this little homily I am giving at the end, one way or another. I do acknowledge the efforts of these Deputies and I do agree that in so far as the Bill has been amended on foot of that debate, it has been improved and Deputies can take at least that much satisfaction from their efforts.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2) A person other than a member of the Garda Síochána who forcibly removes from any land or vehicle any other person or the goods of any other person shall be guilty of an offence and it shall not be a defence to a prosecution under this subsection to show that the person charged was the owner of the land or vehicle or acted on behalf of the owner or that the occupation of such land or vehicle by such other person, or the presence therein of the goods of such other person was unlawful.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I was commenting on the remarkable interjections and the remarkable contributions to what was, in fact, a fairly simple discussion of the amendment of Deputy Séamus Pattison by my co-Deputy for North County Dublin, Deputy Patrick Burke and also by Deputy O'Malley, the Minister for Justice.  In the interval since the adjournment of the debate I have had the opportunity to peruse the transcript of these, I repeat, very extraordinary contributions to the debate.  Since both these Deputies were permitted at the time to introduce this extraordinary matter into the discussion of this amendment, on behalf of my party as well as, indeed, on behalf of myself, against whom entirely irrelevant accusations were made, I would ask you, Sir, to permit me to reply to some of these matters as I feel it ought to be done as soon as possible in the course of the same discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the remarks in question were not relevant, and the Deputy agrees they were not relevant, I cannot see how he can continue to discuss them on this particular amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, of course, be guided by the Ceann Comhairle in matters of procedure but I understood that where specific accusations were made it was permitted to reply to them. You, Sir, were in the Chair at the time and if they were admitted by you into the discussion, it is therefore permitted to other people to reply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has read the script as he says he has he will have seen, I am quite sure, that the Chair intervened and said that this was not relevant or in order.  I agree that they were said and if the Deputy feels that he has an explanation to give, then I will allow him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention, in fact, of dealing with the specific accusations relating to myself and, indeed, also, I have no intention of dealing with matters where an indication was given from the Chair of their irrelevance.  Deputy Burke brought up <Col N="1670" /> more than once what is to me and I think to all of us a central matter in this Bill and in every section of it.  It is a slightly general matter and yet it is one which illuminates every section, every subsection and every amendment. This is the question of law and order in the community and the question of our attitude to law and order.  There were four separate times in his contribution where Deputy Burke made reference to law and order.  He said: &ldquo;It is up to us to ensure that law and order prevails&rdquo; and then he said: &ldquo;Are we to have law and order or are we to have chaos?&rdquo; He said right at the opening: &ldquo;We must ask ourselves are we going to have law and order?&rdquo; and then, having made various sorts of accusations against members of the Labour Party, all named, he asked a further question: &ldquo;Is it their wish that law and order should not exist?&rdquo; He was, in fact, attributing to us that wish.</P>
      <P>We had, indeed, a comparable statement in the following speech from the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, which I will deal with separately but in his case it was not a reference to law and order, it was a reference to anarchy which, I suppose, one might define as the absence of law and order.</P>
      <P>Therefore, since this phrase is a phrase that has been widely used in the discussion of these amendments and is widely currently used all over the world in all sorts of contexts, it is worth teasing it out a little in reply to the charges that were made.  It is a phrase one hears continuously in recent times on the lips of such people as Enoch Powell, a phrase one hears continuously on the lips of the white races in the southern States of America and, indeed, on the lips of the white races in South Africa.  It is a phrase one continuously hears on the lips of such people as Messrs.  Craig and Paisley in Northern Ireland.  It is a phrase, in fact, that is frequently associated with repression and with a desire to strengthen the powers of government as this Bill and as the section we are discussing are intended to strengthen the powers of government in order that the Government may bash people that they do not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; is a <Col N="1671" /> phrase that must be understood to mean repression as it is understood by the sort of people I have enumerated. Nonetheless, as properly understood and as I propose to define it, I am in favour of it and my party are in favour of this concept of law and order.  In order to reply to the charge that we are against law and order it is necessary for me to say what I believe it to mean.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that in the most authoritarian regimes now and in past times there has been order if by order you mean that the power of the State is used to suppress dissent of every kind.  In that sense once he had interned or slaughtered his opponents one could say that Hitler had produced order inside his Reich.  Indeed the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; is and has been a favourite one of fascists.  One could argue that in comparison with the protesting blacks of northern cities of the United States order exists in those southern states where they are kept in place by lynching and by direct intimidation. The point of that sort of order is that it is order without law, it is order against law, it is order against the spirit of all of the legislation of the last century since democratic ideas have emerged in a more concrete form and have been embodied in the structure of states by laws.</P>
    <P>One might argue that at the height of the power of Mr. William Craig, when he was Minister for Home Affairs, when he had his B Specials and when he had the whole structure of repression in Northern Ireland and when people of the minority who tried to express their disapproval of the situation existing were smashed up and physically intimidated order then existed and those persons of a unionist viewpoint in Northern Ireland hark back in a nostalgic way to the happy days of the law and order of Mr. William Craig.  I suggest that it was order without law, order in violation of the law, order that did violence to the spirit of all modern legislation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when I claim for myself and for my party that we are upholders of law and order I also claim that you cannot have one without the other. Specifically, you cannot call for order <Col N="1672" /> without good laws and a democratic structure which is democratic and is seen to be democratic.</P>
    <P>I suppose in a sense this lies right at the heart of our objection to the whole of this Bill.  This Bill is concerned with order but not with the order of people who are disciplined because they are satisfied with the situation.  It is concerned with the sort of order of those people who do not protest because they are afraid to do so.  It is concerned with the sort of order which takes away the right of dissent, the right of protest, the right of the free expression of outrage at a scandalous situation.  It is, therefore, an effort to make an enactment which does violence to the progressive and humane aspects of the principles of legislation, which does violence to the whole tendency of the evolution of legislation towards the enshrining of liberty and democracy.  Laws have not always been concerned with enshrining these things.  In a sense law is neutral. If you have an authoritarian milieu then you have authoritarian laws.  Our milieu, our society, our Parliament, the whole structure of our State, claims to be democratic and to be concerned not just with the protection but the extension of human liberty.  The essence of our objection to this legislation is that it seems to us something which will produce order of a fascist kind, order by intimidation, order by repression, at the cost of doing violence to everything that we believe good and democratic legislation to be.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Burke says we will have law and order in Ireland and that it is our wish that law and order should not exist I do not think he is entirely clear about this.  I do not think he has thought it through.  I do not think he recognises the implications of what he is saying.  I think he is acting foolishly rather than wickedly but I think he is concerned with order of a formal, imposed, external kind, not with order which is the self-discipline of a society concerned with its own uplift and that he is concerned with law not at all.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer.  Many of us in this House have no legal knowledge beyond what is accumulated in the ordinary course of living but I have <Col N="1673" /> seen legal arguments particularly by a professor of law making the point that this legislation is entirely unnecessary. Within the existing framework of the laws currently obtaining in this country we could get the end result the Minister professes to desire without this legislation at all, without this extraordinary transfer of the action of trespass from the area of civil law into the area of criminal law.</P>
    <P>This is why I am spending a little time trying to articulate that I believe, and I am convinced my party believe, that society should strive for law and order, that these are valid and desirable social objectives, that the sort of calm and peace and tranquillity in which people can carry on their lives and tasks is something every society strives after but that, as far as we are concerned, the uttering of phrases about law and order, be they from people in the North of Ireland like Mr. Craig, from southern racists, from the Enoch Powells or even from the Deputy Burkes of this House, is a concept which will produce spurious, transitory and imposed order and will produce bad law and consequently the violation of law.  Though it is a term people suppose they know the meaning of and use frequently to indicate repression, if they think about it they will see that you can only have real internal order on the basis of good legislation, you can only have respect for the observance of that law if it is good law.  It is our conviction that the basic illuminating ideas behind this Bill are anathema to the concept of real law, are unnecessary, punitive, retrogressive and we strongly suspect unconstitutional. Were it not for the malice and petulance that the Minister for Justice has demonstrated so unmistakably, even in his interjection today, this Bill would not be proceeded with.  We are opposing this Bill root and branch, line by line, with all our strength because we believe, not just that the particular content of this particular Bill is repugnant to the people and the Constitution but because we believe it is part of a retrogressive authoritarian trend of what in the end &mdash;not using the word as abuse but as the most accurate description I can <Col N="1674" /> find&mdash;can only be defined as a fascist trend.  This is authoritarian, punitive, vindictive legislation.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with this extraordinary classification that Deputy Burke produced: people were either decent people or others.  We cannot legislate for categories as nebulous as that.  We would have to set up machinery to decide who decent people were.  We must legislate for every person.  We were accused in Deputy Burke's speech&mdash;I quote the accusation: &ldquo;There are pressure groups outside this House who have people within the House to talk on their behalf.&rdquo; This is also nebulous: this is politics by innuendo and smear, because he does not name the pressure groups outside and neither does he name the persons in the House whom, he alleges, speak on their behalf.  He has parliamentary privilege to do so; he could have done so, but he threw it out as a careless, passing accusation.  So far as I am concerned, coming after him and speaking from the benches of this Party against which he threw this accusation, this simply will not do.  Parliamentary privilege is a precious thing which was gained with difficulty and will be hotly defended.  He had the responsibility, if he thinks there is an improper connection between any outside groups and members of this House, to reveal it here.  If he does not possess such information then he has an obligation in honour&mdash;although I am satisfied it is an obligation he will not carry out&mdash;to withdraw the accusation.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the matter of pressure groups because every organisation, if one does not like it, can be described as a pressure group.  Personally, I would proudly accept&mdash;not as an accusation&mdash;I would proudly affirm that I consider myself the spokesman of the trade union to which I belong and, indeed, of the trade union movement as a whole.  I should like to think myself as a spokesman of organisations such as ACRA, and NATO.  I should like to consider myself the spokesman, where some material matter arose, of farmers' organisations.  I should be proud, if the circumstances arose, to be the spokesman of the professional organisation and the profession to <Col N="1675" /> which I have the honour to belong.  All of these could be described as pressure groups and, therefore, innuendo could be made in some way that improper pressure was being exerted.  For &ldquo;pressure groups&rdquo; one is expected to read in the jargon of the Fianna Fáil Party &ldquo;political organisations that the Fianna Fáil Party do not like&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the heart of the matter.  This is a Bill to beat over the head such organisations as the Dublin Housing Action Committee and one bit of the Sinn Féin Party. When we get these innuendoes of pressure groups, that is the essence of it. I am not a member of the Dublin Housing Action Committee and never have been.  In some ways I agree with and applaud what they do; in other ways, I think it is ill-judged and foolish.  I have said this here and in public elsewhere but in so far as they raise the issue of the conditions of housing of Dublin people they are doing a valuable national service and, personally, I would be proud to consider myself their spokesman.  But in that there is no surreptitious arrangement, no membership on my part. There is no reason why it should not be so, but the fact is that there is not any communication between them and myself.  This is an example of the smear and innuendo, &ldquo;pressure groups outside this House who have people within the House to talk on their behalf&rdquo;&mdash;nothing validated, nobody named, just a suggestion that something improper and sinister is going on. If something improper and sinister is going on you are entitled, Deputy Burke would argue, to uphold the sort of legislation that would put the boot into these improper pressure groups. It seems to me that if people have legitimate reasons for this they are exerting a democratic right and also their own wit and common sense by setting up pressure groups to right those wrongs and there is nothing sinister there.  That was innuendo.</P>
    <P>Are we to abolish Dáil Éireann, asks Deputy Burke, and leave the country to these street parliamentarians? I spoke earlier and I do not propose to repeat myself about the relationship between the parliament of the <Col N="1676" /> streets and the Parliament in this building.  I said that it would be a bad day for our institutions were we to come into head-on and protracted conflict between the parliament of the streets and the Parliament in this building because we are simply the highest structure of all the democratic institutions of this island.  There should be no conflict between ourselves and other democratically-structured organs of opinion.  In the end, what is more democratic, if you look at the etymology of it than the rule of the people expressed by the whole people? Ideal, full democracy such as has existed in very simple societies was a situation in which power was exerted by the whole people without any of these structures: our society has grown so big and complex that structures have become necessary to delegate this representative function we try to carry out.  That is embodied in our name as &ldquo;Deputy&rdquo;.  But there is no conflict between the parliament of the streets and ourselves if we are acting correctly and expressing the will of the people and solving the people's problems.</P>
    <P>We then come to what is to me a most ridiculous but, by me, a deeply resented accusation.  We are first told that the hypocrisy&mdash;I am quoting&mdash; being displayed here on behalf of those trying to oppose this Bill is disgusting. So says Deputy Burke.  Then he says, in regard to the pressure groups which he accuses us of improperly representing here: &ldquo;It is because of them that the honest and decent person who is waiting his turn for a house cannot get it.&rdquo; It is because of the pressure groups, let me repeat.  This is the accusation by somebody with great experience of local government.  It is because of the action of the pressure groups concerned with the acute crisis in housing that &ldquo;the honest and decent person who is waiting his turn for a house cannot get it&rdquo;.  That accusation occurs in a sentence next to the sentence which contains an accusation of hypocrisy towards other people.  Words have lost their meaning.  This is an Alice in Wonderland situation where things become their opposite&mdash;if the action of others is hypocrisy but one's own action in saying that those trying <Col N="1677" /> to solve the housing crisis are causing the crisis is considered a true and fair statement of the situation.</P>
    <P>There is a housing crisis because there are not enough houses.  It is as simple as that.  If there were more houses there would not be squatters, there would not be the Dublin Housing Action Committee, there would not be protesters.  No amount of juggling of the existing square footage is going to produce the extra accommodation needed.  Those people who protest about the lack of accommodation are carrying out a patriotic duty towards themselves and towards all the young people who are trying to establish homes for their families.</P>
    <P>Those in this House who try to express their interest and to defend their right to free protest are accused of being hypocrites and the protesters are accused of causing the problem they are setting out to solve.  It would be funny if it were not so tragic and so ridiculous.  It would be a subject for laughter were the members of that party not now in the process of trying to ram through this House a Bill which is repressive and punitive and which does nothing to solve the problem that has generated the protest but which strives to make that protest illegal.  To use a simile, this is a Bill whose purpose is to screw down the safety valve. If that is done, in the long run you put up the pressure until ultimately the system bursts.  You solve nothing by taking away the people's right to protest.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the words of the Minister when speaking on amendment No. 6.  He said, to me with full evidence of paranoia: &ldquo;Every time I stand up to speak in this House there is the usual interruption in an effort to prevent my speaking because there are certain people in this House who would wish to deny the right of free speech to anyone except themselves and to those who think like them.&rdquo;  This is an extraordinarily interesting charge coming from someone who is trying to pilot through the House a Bill which denies the right of free protest, denies the right of free speech, and which even makes it an offence to report the free speech of other persons, and makes <Col N="1678" /> it an offence unless you dissociate yourself specifically from assenting to the free speech of other persons.  I think the Minister was a great deal less than balanced when he made that accusation. I do not think that is the accusation of a man in possession of his cool&mdash;it is not the accusation of a man who is able to see objectively the situation as it is.  He is losing his grip on reality if he can say something so ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Our party have been manning these benches conscientiously in the course of the debate, as have Fine Gael.  Let us take a spot check of the attendance in the House now.  Neither I nor anyone else had any warning that this was coming.  For Fianna Fáil, there are three present out of some 70 members of the party, I note the absence of the Minister; Fine Gael, four out of 51; Labour, four out of 17.  I do not think we need worry about the strictures of the Minister in regard to the manning of the House.  Incidentally, many times during the day there have been more than four Labour members present.</P>

      <P>Although I feel different from them, I think in our need to eat, to rest ourselves and to breathe the fresh air we are not greatly different.  Anything in that respect which can be applied to members of the Government party can be applied also to members of the Opposition. Although I feel different in other ways, I admit to shared humanity in those respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were worried about the interruptions to his right of free speech in this Chamber by our calling for a House on what we consider an <Col N="1679" /> extremely important and scandalous piece of legislation, with the 74 people at the command of his party he had merely to put in a sufficient number to make our calling for a House impossible. If he did this, the effort to throttle his free speech which he alleges in this paranoiac way would be impossible.  This is all the Minister need have done but when he still alleges that we are trying to strangle his right to free speech he is losing contact with reality.  In the odd illogic manner of disturbed people he is hurling at us the accusation which rightly belongs to him.</P>
    <P>He has said that there are certain people in this House who would wish to deny the right of free speech to anyone except themselves and those who think like them.  I agree there are such persons in this House.  I have seen and heard them in action today but I submit they are on the Fianna Fáil benches.  In making his accusation, perhaps haunting the Minister's subconscious is a sense of shame at what he is doing and, therefore, he verbalises to hurl it over at us.  All the evidence shows that the threat which he enunciated in discussing this amendment comes from him, from his legislation, and from his party&mdash;not from the opposition to this iniquitous Bill.</P>
    <P>In the accusations I am concerned to rebut before they grow too old to be worthy of notice, the Minister says of us: &ldquo;They would like to see no law, law reduced to a situation where it was a complete joke.&rdquo;  It is the Minister for Justice who is behaving in such a way as to reduce the law to a complete joke.  The consequences in any evolved society of reducing law to a complete joke are exceedingly dire.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about anarchy, but the introduction of this Bill which we are now striving to amend, when it is unnecessary&mdash;because the power exists to do what he wishes to do if we are to believe he is <i>bona fide</i> in what he says he wishes to do&mdash; is the Minister's responsibility. The alternative is that he wishes to behave in a vindictive and punitive and sectional way towards persons and organisations who <Col N="1680" /> have irritated him.  That is reducing the law, to use his phrase, to a complete joke, but a very bitter and dangerous joke.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest, therefore, that it is not Deputy Pattison's amendment which we are now debating which would bring criminal law into the area of trespassing.  It is this piece of trivial and vindictive and ridiculous legislation which the Minister has introduced. We have, indeed, a ghoulish and ridiculous situation where the law on trespass which, I suppose, has exercised the minds of lawyers since the days when the law was handed on from one to another by word of mouth, since before it was written down, is lengthy, complex, well evolved but, perhaps, not easy.  I do not know the law but I would think that in an area of this historic and physical complexity it would not be a simple law.  It is highly evolved.  It is being transferred by this section which we are now striving to amend to the area of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>The Minister used great rhetoric about making a criminal offence of the action of persons who try physically to throw squatters off their property or, indeed, who act to throw squatters off other persons' property.  It is a ridiculous situation all right, but it is a ridiculous situation of the Minister's making, because we would not be in that area of legislation at all were it not for his efforts to produce a sledgehammer to crush a small, perfectly reputable and rather tough nut.  We object to that concept.  We will resist it with all the strength we possess.</P>
    <P>I commend this amendment to the House for the reason that it takes the Minister's logic and follows it to its logical conclusion.  The logical conclusion to bad logic is often a bad conclusion but you cannot have the first part of the Minister's ridiculous action in transferring trespass to the criminal law without accepting some consequences. As the Minister truly pointed out, it would be a ridiculous situation if it were a criminal offence to put stock off your land, or if it were a criminal offence to see a trespassing child who was trying to steal your apples physically off your premises. That would be ridiculous, yes, but it <Col N="1681" /> is a ridiculousness that is being imported into the Irish legal situation by the Minister.  We are following that ridiculousness to its ridiculous conclusion. If that conclusion is ridiculous, the simple solution is to chop off this ridiculous branch at its ridiculous root, in other words, drop the whole section and, indeed, my colleague beside me says &ldquo;and the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Although we have had a good deal to say on this section, the really obnoxious and degrading section is the section to come.  I can promise the Parliamentary Secretary that we will fight it as we have fought this.  If there is the challenge of the perfectly normal tiredness of the staff, if there is the challenge of the perfectly normal desire shared by all Deputies who are human to have their holidays after a lengthy period of hard work, we understand that tiredness and that desire but it is not we who are fighting scandalous legislation who are keeping people here.  It is those who introduced this scandalous legislation and who are trying to ramrod it through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is, indeed, regrettable that highly controversial legislation of this nature should be presented to the House at this time of the year.  As we have seen today in various exhibitions from the Minister, it is not likely to get reasonable consideration at Government level.  I do not know whether the taking of the Committee Stage of this measure in the dying days of this session of the Dáil was in the hope that it would be rushed through or accepted.  I do not intend to labour the point but I think this follows a pattern.  A few years ago we had the controversial Marts Bill brought in here at the very same time. It was not rushed through the House because this party opposed it.  Parts of it have since been held to be unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I rise to deal with amendment No. 6.  Our attitude to this amendment highlights the impossible position in which certain sections of this Bill place Members of this House. Speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill I said, and I repeat, that we accepted sections 2 and 3 subject to amendment, subject to a change in the definition of ownership, subject to the complete withdrawal of section 4, and subject to other amendments, including an amendment of section 5 and an amendment of the arrest without warrant section.  The only section on which the Minister has given way is section 5, the onus of proof section, which he met with an amendment.  He did hold out some hope during Committee Stage <Col N="1683" /> that he would consider amending the definition of ownership, the definition of which I take such serious objection. He has not done that.  And now we have this amendment.  As the definition of ownership stands, it means an owner entitled to occupied property and it means an owner who is not and may never be entitled to occupy the property.</P>
    <P>In the light of that definition of ownership Deputy Pattison introduced this amendment, the purpose of which is to make it an offence for anyone other than a member of the Garda Síochána to remove other persons from property, or other property from property, and it provides that it shall not be a defence to such a prosecution that the person who ejected the offending person was the owner of the property in question.  That is very far-reaching. It would mean, if this amendment were accepted, that it would be illegal for a person to eject an intruder from his own house.  It would mean that, if a Deputy were to go home tonight and find an intruder, a trespasser, in his house, he could not himself throw him out.  He would have to go and get a member of the Garda Síochána to do it.  As we understand it, if the owner ejected the trespasser that would be a violation of the common law and of the rights of ownership which have always been enjoyed by private individuals; it has always been accepted as a right of ownership that the owner can use such force as is necessary to eject a person who wrongfully takes possession of the owner's property.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Pattison in this amendment because the definition of ownership, as insisted upon by the Minister, is so outrageous and so unnecessary&mdash;I cannot repeat this often enough&mdash;that any merit that there is in the Bill is to protect the owner of property entitled to occupation of that property.  It is never intended to protect the remote landlord.  It is never intended to protect people who are not entitled to the occupation of property.  I have a feeling that that is the reason that prompted <Col N="1684" /> this amendment.  Were we to support it with our votes we would, in my opinion, be violating the right of the individual to protect his own home from all and sundry.  It may be that on another Stage of this Bill, or when it is being considered by the Seanad, we will be able to draft a further amendment, accepting the spirit of Deputy Pattison's amendment and, at the same time, protecting the right of the individual to protect his own property.  For these reasons I do not propose to support the amendment. I see the idea behind it.  I appreciate the spirit of it and, when the Bill comes before the Seanad, we will endeavour to draft an amendment designed to prevent the employment of private armies and, at the same time, retaining the principle that a man's home is his castle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the remarkable aspects of this Bill is the very few contributions that have been made by Government Deputies in this debate on what is accepted by everybody as an extremely important and far-reaching piece of legislation, with a number of very disturbing features in it.  We were, however, given the opportunity of hearing at least one member of the Government party this morning, Deputy Burke, on this amendment.  His contribution was very disturbing because of its content.  He adopted an extraordinary attitude of very venomous criticism of what he regarded as the obstructionist tactics of the Labour Party Deputies in regard to this Bill, trying apparently to give the impression that the Labour Party were anti-democratic, did not want to see this Parliament continue to exist and, in fact, wanted to have a Parliament dominated by what he called politicians in the street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is a very difficult charge to sustain on the record of the Labour Party and the labour movement over the years.  If one looks at it from the historical point of view, of all the parties in this House the Labour Party's record in relation to the maintenance of Parliament and respect and regard for Parliament and the democratic organisation of Parliament, and all that that implies in our community, <Col N="1685" /> is easily the finest, is easily the one which stands out as almost too supinely respectful of the need at all times to behave in a peaceful way and to abjure the use of force or brute violence of any kind.</P>
    <P>Both major parties have to admit that there have been periods in their histories in which they have set aside, or were prepared to set aside, the machinery of Parliament.  This cannot be said about the Labour Party, whatever other things can be said about them, in all their 50 years of history. This cannot be said about them and, if the record of the members of the labour movement over the years is examined, even in this particular Dáil, even today, the record of our Deputies in legislation and their contributions to legislation, whether it be finance, education, defence, foreign affairs, agriculture, or anything else, is a very fine record.  The contributions to the debates are on record.  They may be of varying degrees of merit, but they are there.  Amendments, Motions, Bills of one kind or another, and so on, they are all there.  We have a record of which we can be very proud when it is considered in the simple context of the record of the democratic process and the democratic functions of this House.  It compares very favourably and I think that any honest and honourable person would concede that it is the most consistent record of regard for the democratic processes in this House.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair of Deputy Burke to impute these dishonourable motives in our very grave concern for the underlying alterations that are implicit in this legislation.  Of course, the truth is that it is the anti-democratic nature of this legislation to which we object. It is we who are attempting to retain to the maximum this very precious and very difficult to realise concept of democracy in our society.  It is for that reason that we are opposing this Bill to such extent.  It is no pleasure for any of us to spend an unnecessary day or even an unnecessary minute in this House.  Contrary to wishing an end to Parliament and to seeing the development of an anarchistic situation, it is because of our reverence for the whole fabric of the democratic processes and <Col N="1686" /> institutions such as this House and the Seanad that we oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke made a number of petty, malicious and venomous references to our association with outside organisations &mdash; subversive organisations. This was a petty attempt by him to denigrate by inference our attempts here to defend the democratic processes. Nobody, not Deputy Burke nor the Minister, has denied that there is this problem to which these people to whom he refers are applying themselves and about which they are trying to do something, that is, the problem of the homeless in our society.  I am not in the least worried or frightened about smear tactics when they are applied to me.  So far as I am concerned, they have been going on now for the best part of 20 years but for the record I should like to make it clear that I have not approved of the methods adopted by the housing action committees.  I have made this clear to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I do not approve of the methods of these committees to which I have referred, I do not see any reason why they should not continue to act in this way and their right to protest should be defended.  From listening during the years to speeches of the type made today by Deputy Burke, I have <Col N="1687" /> always been struck by the extraordinary insolence of the condemnation of protest groups by the older generation of parliamentarians.  I dislike having to say this but on both sides, these people who are so censorious, who are so critical and who condemn in such venomous terms the activities of groups of this kind are people, who in their time, protested in arms against the activities of one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I dislike also these people behaving like latter day saints in their dotage having regard to the record of disrespect they had for the first Parliament established here and their attempts to destroy that Parliament but who are now the people to lecture us on the democratic processes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating dealt with the reality of the present situation&mdash;this whole conflict within the party about the continued use of force to achieve their other objectives.  We are disturbed by the implications of this particular section and we are grateful to Deputy Fitzpatrick for his interpretation of the amendment.  We are grateful, too, for his criticism of it.  If the amendment is not accepted by the Minister, and it is not likely to be accepted by him, I hope that with his special knowledge and understanding of this particular problem and of what he had in mind, he he will be able to relate the two and that in the Seanad we might get an amendment that would incorporate our underlying idea as well as providing for the safeguard referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke raised this point as to what happens when he goes home and finds somebody in his home.  Should he throw him out?  All I can say is that personally I would not try to throw anybody out.  Rightly or wrongly, I do not feel that I should.  I feel that this is a matter for the gardaí but that is simply a personal feeling about being faced with such an unpleasant situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> We are not in fact dealing with that situation.  Deputy Burke over-simplified the whole problem by bringing it down to this plea about the old lady, or the Minister bringing in the man in hospital or the ward of court, or the mentally deranged person and all these other <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeals.  We are concerned&mdash;and the Minister and Deputy Burke know it&mdash;with the speculator, the speculative land developer, and the powers he has, the growing powers he clearly has in our society, and we believe that in this section, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, there is the power to create a private army.  That is our great single fear.  We have our own army and we have the Garda&mdash;one, a defence force and the other, keepers of the peace.  We have trust in the gardaí.  We know that they have a record, generally speaking, of responsible behaviour in situations of this kind.  We believe that a situation of this kind, where people have taken possession of property as a form of protest, or simply because they are homeless, is a very delicate situation which should be dealt with with considerable circumspection and care.</P>
    <P>We believe that the people best equipped to deal with that problem are these people, the Garda, because of their training, because of their experience, because of their knowledge of the law, because they are people who have their warrant from us in Parliament, their authority from us, because they are a uniformed force, because they are identifiable as a uniformed force, with numbers, because they are subject to discipline, because they must observe certain clearly laid down defined procedures and practices, if they feel they are dealing with somebody who has transgressed, who has broken the law and who in the community's interest should be brought before our courts and tried and convicted, if so, but these all must be carried out in accordance with a very clearly defined procedure.  There has been no case whatever made for setting aside this procedure which we have all come to understand and respect, no case whatever made for giving this permission to an individual or to a group of individuals&mdash;and we <Col N="1689" /> have seen them in action; this is not fantasy&mdash;we have seen these private armies, private police forces develop. We see them in the streets every day and we see them proliferating at a frightening rate.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for it?  Has the Minister come to the state to which Deputy Keating referred at which the Government Party, at its final rally, finds it necessary to protect itself with a private police force?  To me it was quite an astonishing sight.  I have been at very many political meetings over a long time now, some of them hectic and very stormy meetings, but I have never been in the position in which I had the slightest fear that the gardaí would not be perfectly competent to deal with any situation at all that arose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the method for the enforcement of law and the case we are making is that we are now beginnning to believe that this <Col N="1690" /> man, who knows more about the police force than any of us could possibly know, as Minister for Justice, has now come to the conclusion, because of his special knowledge, that the police force is no longer able to cope with the deteriorating situation in our community as a result of government by Fianna Fáil over such a long period.  Quite obviously, so it appears, the Minister is becoming particularly frightened, particularly apprehensive, of the development of a state of anarchy within our society which the police force will not be able to control, and for that reason he is allowing these people, these property owners, to use their cheque books, allowing these speculative builders to use their fat cheque books, to create any size, any number of a police force they wish to create.  We are now being asked to give them that authority, and we are not told and not asked to insist that any specifications will be laid down as to the kind of people that will be employed to carry out the various functions which these are to be authorised to carry out, the removal of persons or goods from property.  There are no specifications as to their qualifications or experience.</P>
      <P>We have made it clear a number of times, although it does not prevent our being misrepresented just as frequently as we protest, that we are not making any attempt to defend the individual who takes possession of corporation property.  This charge was made again this morning by Deputy Burke.  While there is a shortage of houses through the failure of the Government to build houses we believe that the limited number of houses available are fairly allocated by local authorities generally throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, however, concerned about the homeless person who because he has nowhere else to go decides to go into an empty house.  That house may remain empty for months or years in order that it will appreciate in value and can then be sold at a speculative price by a very wealthy person who does not want to live in it, and his family will not be subjected to any degrading, humiliating, brutalising treatment <Col N="1691" /> by any of the people likely to be employed by the speculative landowner, property owner, builder, whoever it may be.  It is for that reason Deputy Pattison has put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>We do not want to see the development of supernumerary police forces. Is it the Minister's case, and Deputy Burke so implied this morning, that the gardaí do not have the authority to do this but that can be their function?  If there is any limitation in the law this is the right place to correct that limitation. If the gardaí do not have sufficient authority let us give them that authority but, of course, the real answer is, as Deputy Keating pointed out, that the Government should build more houses.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know who Deputy Burke was referring to when he said that the Government simply wanted to defend decent people.  What is wrong with a homeless man and his family? Are they not decent people because they are homeless?  Why should such people be subjected to the fear, anxiety and brutal treatment&mdash;I have seen the behaviour of these people in Hume Street&mdash;of these people if they are told to clear a house?  It is no good saying that these people have their redress in the law.  As it happened, the little girl who was beaten up by the thugs at Hume Street won her case with the help of a well-known public-spirited lawyer, but if that wealthy man had wanted to pursue that case right through the courts she could not have followed him.  That, of course, is the truism about the law courts.  They are open to everyone, like the Ritz, so long as one can pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very anxious he should not be placed in this position <Col N="1692" /> and he would not be placed in this position if Deputy Pattison's amendment was accepted.  His amendment ensures that in situations like this, one is not faced with an individual employed by a speculator but by a man who is employed by the community, namely, a member of the Garda.  If Deputy Pattison's amendment is accepted, then the homeless individual has the right to bring the garda to the station sergeant, I have done it myself, and charge him if he feels he has exceeded his power.  One may be quite wrong but, nevertheless, one has a right to do that.  That is the protection which the individual has.</P>
      <P>We would ask the Minister for Justice to try to understand this profoundly felt resistance on our part to what we believe are the authoritarian trends implicit in this legislation.  This kind of law is not going to prevent pro-protests. The only way to prevent protests is to remedy the wrong about which people take to the streets and seek to protest.  I am continually amused to hear the jeers of Deputies on the Government benches about the terrible tyranny of the socialist countries, their insistence on uniformity, the lack of the right to protest, the fact that people will be put into jail if they differ from the party line, the authoritarianism, the insistence that everything is taken from the top and there is no right to dissent.  This is the case that is constantly presented about what they call the socialist countries or the communist countries.</P>

      <P>What we are trying to do is to make it clear that our protest here is a perfectly legitimate protest.  It is based upon our own beliefs as members of the Labour Party.  It is based on our belief that the section which we are trying to amend is a particularly dangerous section because, in our view, it opens the road to the evolution and the proliferation of the uncontrolled, uncontrollable, undisciplined private army, private police force.  To that extent it will lead to the gradual undermining of the whole democratic process in our State by reducing the right of individuals to differ and, when they differ, take to the streets if they wish to, criticise Deputies if they wish to. Deputy Burke was very annoyed this morning because, he said, they had dared to be offensive about this Parliament and Deputies of this House.  I do not see why we should be immune either in this Parliament or as individuals to criticism from outside the House.</P>

      <P>We are asked in this amendment, as I said, to create a new criminal offence and this amendment is to be written into our legislation. It is no excuse to say that while it conveys certain powers very clearly and explicitly, those ill-advised but well intentioned people with liberal or tolerant views did not really mean it to go that far.  The courts that will interpret this legislation will have to interpret it as it is presented to them.  Anybody who has even the slightest knowledge of the law will know that to be the case.</P>
      <P>I have often listened and even sympathised with Opposition Deputies saying that while they appreciate that certain things may be necessary they would ask the Minister if he is quite satisfied that the power he is conveying to any particular Department or to the authorities cannot be abused.  If ever there was a case of power capable of being abused being conveyed, it is conveyed very effectively in this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked to turn back the clock on the whole basic principles of the common law and, indeed, of statute law for very many generations.  It has always been accepted that a person is entitled to use reasonable force to eject a trespasser from his property, reasonable force in circumstances that can be determined by the civil law or the criminal law afterwards.  Now we are being asked to make it an offence <Col N="1695" /> if a person uses any such reasonable force and the Labour Party in this Parliament are asking the public to create that offence.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for them to say that what they really meant was something else.  This is the most naive, ill-informed, nonsensical approach to legislation or amendments to legislation that any party in any House could ever propose.  They must accept the responsibility that if by any chance the Minister were to accept the amendment it would confer those powers and create that new criminal offence.  They have to accept that if, as might already have been pointed out&mdash;the thing is so ludicrous that I am quite sure many have pointed it out&mdash;if it came, in fact, to a case of removing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to extend me the courtesy of not interrupting.  This amendment is repugnant to the whole basis of law, to the whole principles of the criminal law and the civil law on normal life and behaviour.  If the Labour Party do not understand that, it is no wonder the Irish people find themselves in little sympathy with the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be faced with a situation that a person who endeavoured to remove from land or a vehicle any person or goods, which under the law, of course, includes animals, from his property forcibly&mdash;which, I suppose, means against the will of the animal &mdash;would be guilty of an offence.  Is it seriously suggested in this Parliament at this time that that is the will of the Irish people?  It evidently is the will and the wish of the Labour Party but, surely, they cannot then set themselves up to be the guardians of civil liberties, the protectors of individual rights, if they are creating an offence where individuals in the normal protection <Col N="1696" /> of their property remove goods or animals, or people for that matter, from their property, using such reasonable force&mdash;and I use that term, &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo;&mdash;as is necessary to do so.  If they say that is an offence they are out of tune with the law, with all the established principles of the law for generations and they are about to create a whole new class of criminals, the whole new class being all normal Irish people who will have from time to time occasion to remove goods forcibly from their property, be they inanimate goods, animate goods or other goods, and indeed from time to time to use such normal and reasonable force as is necessary to remove people who have come on to their property and taken unlawful occupation of it.  Deputy Browne suggested that he personally would not take the decision to remove a person from his property if he found him in such unlawful occupation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Forcibly, as the Deputy may or may not know, simply means having to apply to that person an element of what one might call physical persuasion that that person rejects. One might ask the Deputy, because this is what is involved in this amendment, if perchance he found a person in his bedroom, would Deputy Browne be so tolerant as to leave that person in his bedroom when he came home or would it be an offence for Deputy Browne, though apparently he would not be inclined to do so, or for the other Deputies of the Labour Party, to apply physical force and say: &ldquo;Please get out of my bedroom&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are now telling us that the offender would not be the normal person, the person answering his domestic responsibilities, the normal person who decides in protecting his wife or family to take this step.  It is not enough to say they had not that in mind because if they know anything about legislation, and God knows we sometimes doubt it, they will have to acknowledge and concede that their amendment creates that offence.  It is about time the public became aware <Col N="1697" /> of the responsibility of a party who would put down an amendment of that sort after due consideration and consultation. Is it suggested that the law should be drawn up and implemented at the whims of Deputy Dr. Browne or the other members of the Labour Party, that if they feel they would not do it this should be the standard for all reasonable and normal people in this country?</P>

Let them acknowledge now that in pursuing this amendment that is their intention.  Let them not complain if at some later stage any Deputy from any party says, on an election platform or elsewhere: &ldquo;That is the kind of thing the Labour Party want.&rdquo; Let them not complain because they have done it themselves after consideration, one would assume after advice, and I do not know whether after rational thinking or not.</P>

      <P>I should like the Deputies, in replying, to tell the Irish people that they think things have come to the stage that it is wrong to remove animals from one's property, that in fact it is an offence and if you happen to be in some remote part of Ireland you will have to tolerate the situation until you can get a member of the Garda Síochána.  The Deputies from the Labour Party of course do not know very much about the situation in remote parts of Ireland because <Col N="1699" /> most of them live in comfortable suburbia in and around the city of Dublin but if they did know a little more about remote parts of Ireland they might realise the utter nonsense and absolute stupidity of a suggestion, apart from the legal principles involved, that one would have to wait to remove the cow, the horse, or the box from the property until such time as one could get a garda to do it.  Otherwise you would be not in peril of committing an offence but would have <i>ipso facto</i> committed an offence which could of course be proved without very much difficulty.</P>
      <P>I hope the Labour Party will now admit that far from being the custodians of civil liberty they are the new masters of imperial aggression&mdash;that is one of the terms that is in vogue&mdash; of fascist domination.  What term would we use to convey what this amendment involves?  Whatever it is they are the new masters of that repression and the Irish people are entitled to know that they are so.</P>

      <P>It will be very interesting to hear the informed reply of the collective wisdom of the Labour Party.  It will be interesting to hear how it is that they propose to write that into legislation. We must consider that we are a Parliament, that our function is, between all of us, to create the corpus of the laws which will govern this country.  It is not unknown for amendments to be accepted.  They may not be quite the common pattern in legislation but they have been and will be written in. Deputies in Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil and Independents are being asked to create a new offence at the instigation of the Labour Party. I speak personally on this and I find myself appalled at such a thought, sickened to the extent of not being able to tolerate within myself the notion that such an amendment could be put down by a party in this country, particularly by a party professing to be concerned with legal rights and the liberal exercise of normal views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne apparently takes umbrage at the fact that when he talks <Col N="1700" /> of protests&mdash;although I cannot see the relevance of protests and I do not intend to mention protests in connection with this; I shall keep to the section&mdash; he has often been referred to areas where protests are not allowed.  I say in passing that the only thing that will prevent protests at any time is absolute repression of protests.  This has proved quite effective in many countries.  It is the only thing that will ever prevent protests.</P>

Apparently, they cannot distinguish between the function of discussing a section on Report Stage and the objects of the Bill.  I am concerned only with the section and the amendment.  The object of this amendment goes further than even the most totalitarian regimes in restricting protests.  This amendment intends to create a body of criminals. <Col N="1701" /> Who is to say that when I go home and find some property left there by some person, deposited from a passing car or otherwise, if I forcibly remove this property I shall not become a criminal?  Or, if I find an animal plodding around the house or in front of it that by chasing him out, I or my son or anybody attempting to do so will not become a criminal?  That is what we will become under the amendment.</P>

      <P>Apart from these smart, casual interruptions by the Labour Party will any one of them now&mdash;and I shall yield to him if he will &mdash;tell me that anything I have said at this point is not possible and is not so under this amendment?  Can any one of them honestly say that this will not be an offence?  They might say: &ldquo;Well, judges should know&rdquo; or something of that sort.  They themselves want to create the offence.  I challenge them here and now to say that they are not creating an offence.  If they are capable of being responsible, informed parliamentarians, never mind legislators or being informed about the law or the consequences of amendments of this sort, let them consider what they are about.  It is not enough to try to obstruct the legislative programme of the Government by putting down amendments.  Every amendment put down must be considered as if it will eventually become law.  This certainly can hardly have been considered by the collective wisdom of the Labour Party, if there is such, or of their advisers, if they have any, in putting down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of them have travelled far and wide as some of us may have also in defence of civil rights and liberal traditions and all that many of us hold dear.  Along the way, they may have picked up some ideas but I wonder where any of them could pick up this idea which is here in the name of Deputy Pattison.  I do not think it emanated from the constituency of Carlow/Kilkenny which I happen to know reasonably well, having practised as a lawyer there for a considerable time.  As a lawyer, I should be <Col N="1702" /> ashamed, either as prosecutor or defender, to have to come before a court in which a person was charged with an offence as envisaged under this amendment.  Let the Labour Party &mdash;they are not so good at this&mdash; acknowledge that far from being the custodians of liberty&mdash;and let the public know it also&mdash;they are now the creators of a new crime because the amendment creates the crime and ensures that on the following morning following its passing we shall have 5,000, 10,000 or 20,000 new criminals in the country.</P>
    <P>If that is the kind of legislation they want, let it be known.  If they want to abuse the privileges of the House by introducing that sort of amendment it is well that should be known because I and most others who have been aware of the lack of progress of this Bill and aware of the attempts to obstruct it, know that this amendment and others like it are not put down with any serious intent but are merely there to obstruct the business of the House and frustrate the purpose for which we were sent here and make a mockery of law.  If ever that was done, it has been done very effectively by the great guardians of civil liberties in these Labour Party benches in putting down this amendment which is contrary to the whole tradition of law and normal living.</P>

      <P>This is a section and a Bill which, to say the least, has been treated with considerable contempt by the spokesmen of the socialist party in this House.  It is worth stating exactly what this amendment means. It should be analysed, parsed, word by word, line by line, sentence by sentence and comma by comma.  It is probably one of the most shocking and outrageous amendments tabled to any legislation in this Dáil.  It is one of the most frightening amendments ever tabled in this House.  What the amendment says is worth writing into the records of the House as often as the opportunity arises and I should like to make it very clear that on this side of the House at any rate the opportunity will arise as long as we can keep it going.  We believe the public should <Col N="1703" /> know that after all the criticism we have incurred for our proposal to introduce the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970&mdash; most of it unfair and uninformed but some of it, let it be said, criticism out of concern: one does not in any democracy dismiss somebody who disagrees with one; on the contrary, and we would be the last to do that&mdash;this amendment proposes to do more than the Labour Party are suggesting the Bill itself does.</P>
      <P>Everyone who speaks on this amendment must ask himself the following question to justify his argument and I put it forward for consideration by the committed socialists on the other side of the House.  If any member of the socialist party goes home this evening and finds that a number of people have taken over his home without permission, what does this amendment propose he should do?  It proposes that, without laying a hand on the people or even talking to them, the owner should ring up the gardaí.  This is one of the most extraordinary amendments that has ever been before this House.</P>
      <P>Is it reasonable that any citizen, either living in a corporation house, a middle income house in suburbia, or in a higher income house in the city or county of Dublin, who finds his house in the possession of another person is not entitled to eject that person by force&mdash;reasonable force?  It has been a principle of law throughout the ages that the amount of force should be reasonable and this has always been so interpreted by the courts.  It is not to suggest that the owner of the house should use a blunt instrument if persuasion will get rid of the people on his property and we are not suggesting this.  We are suggesting that if the people do not leave when asked to do so, one would be entitled to persuade them with a slight push and this would be reasonable in the circumstances. If the push does not do the trick, a slightly more reasonable amount of force would be necessary and if this is not effective one could use a slightly more reasonable amount of force.</P>

      <P>It never becomes unreasonable. This is the lack of philosophy behind this amendment.  The socialists in this House can sneer and make snide remarks but it will not deter us from exposing the dangers of this amendment.  I should like to pay a tribute to a Deputy on the other side of the House, Deputy Cooney.  He has sincerely and with integrity voiced his concern in relation to other sections and amendments on this Bill but he can see the demerits and dangers contained in this amendment and he stated categorically this morning that he could not support it.  This is a man who has been in 99 per cent agreement with the Labour Party in their opposition to this Bill but in his honest fashion he has declared that he cannot support the amendment.  I should not like anyone to think I am using the Deputy's contribution&mdash;on the contrary, I have too much respect for him to attempt anything of that nature.  He has made an honest and convincing contribution on this proposed legislation but he does not hesitate to tell the Labour Party that he cannot support them on this amendment.  None of my remarks is in criticism of Deputy Cooney: I merely point out to the Labour Party that one of their greatest allies on this Bill has made his stand on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been described by various socialist Deputies as totalitarian, as introducing the concept of the bullyboys and introducing the element of private armies.  There are many definitions one can use to bolster up one's argument, but what exactly is meant by a private army?  Is it suggested that a private army is the security corps people?  If that is what is meant it should be stated clearly.  Who are the bullyboys in this so-called private army?  I hold no brief for the suggested behaviour of the people in Hume Street and I should imagine that if they behaved as reported all right-thinking Deputies would condemn such behaviour and dissociate themselves from the type of force used in Hume Street.  I was not present but I accept what I have read and what people tell <Col N="1705" /> me.  Those who suggest that Fianna Fáil support such behaviour are dishonest. We do not support the bullyboys or the so-called private armies. The only legitimate army we support is the Army of the State and the only legitimate force of law are the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The contents of this proposed amendment should be put on the records of the House.  I shall quote it and analyse it briefly:</P>
    <P>A person other than a member of the Garda Siochána who forcibly removes from any land or vehicle any other person or the goods of any other person shall be guilty of an offence and it shall not be a defence to a prosecution under this subsection to show that the person charged&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is the important point</P>
    <P>&mdash;was the owner of the land&mdash;</P>
    <P>how shocking, how outrageous</P>
    <P>&mdash;or vehicle or acted on behalf of the owner or that the occupation of such land or vehicle by such other person, or the presence therein of the goods of such other person was unlawful.</P>
    <P>If we falter on this side of the House in our opposition to this amendment, we will be doing Dáil Éireann and our country one of the gravest disservices ever perpetrated upon it.  This House is entitled to know from whence this amendment emanated.  I am not in any way reflecting on Deputy Pattison.  He is a Deputy of this House who has the respect of all Members of the House. I am not being personal.  It is not in my nature to be personal.  That is a fact.  However, I think that Deputy Pattison has an obligation, when he is concluding on this amendment, to analyse it and tell us how he arrived at the philosophy behind it.  Did Deputy Pattison sit down one evening and, in his wisdom, produce this masterpiece of non-law?  How long did he spend producing this proposed amendment?</P>

      <P>If it was a cliché or a piece of bad grammar, so long as <Col N="1707" /> I communicated with the Deputy that is the important thing.  Deputy Donegan is too intelligent a person to fall for this sort of pretence.  It is not fair to ask him in any way to sully himself by even considering what is proposed in this amendment.  I am sure he knows already, but I would not ask him to exercise his mind too much on it.  I am sure he dismisses it out of hand as every member of our party intends doing.</P>
      <P>What this amendment means is that, if a person goes home in the evening, or at any time of the day, and finds his house in the hands of some other person, he is not entitled to use force to get rid of the person in occupation. This is one of the most tragic pieces of thinking ever proposed in this House. This is why I would respectfully urge with no question of any malice, no question of bickering, no suggestion of any personal animus against Deputy Pattison, that he should explain to the House exactly how he arrived at the proposed amendment.  What was the thinking behind it?  This is just a small suggestion.  We are entitled to know how he arrived at the thinking on the amendment and what was the philosophy behind it.  It is important that we should know what is the philosophy behind it.</P>

      <P>No.  The socialist party in this House are putting up a pretended defence to this Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill. They then come along and fall into their own trap by producing an amendment of this nature which, with great respect, far exceeds anything that could be described as very bad in the Bill itself.  It far exceeds any other part of this Bill which they describe as bad, or shocking or outrageous.  As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Kennedy, said with tremenduous force and vigour, this is one of the most frightening and nauseating amendments ever to emanate from any Party in this House.  As Deputy O'Kennedy said, the socialist party are holding themselves up as the <Col N="1708" /> great liberators, the liberals, the free thinkers, with the philosophy&mdash;and maybe there is something in it&mdash;of being on both sides.  They never come down on one side or the other but go part of the way with everyone.  I am really astounded that some of the people in the Labour Party who hold themselves up&mdash;and let me say rightly so&mdash;as intelligent men, men who have a contribution to make in this society &mdash;I will not deny that&mdash;should associate themselves with this amendment.</P>

      <P>Oh, my country indeed, an excellent opera! I am not commenting on the absence of anybody. I do not want to enter into that field.  There are people in the Labour Party, who, in their own way, have a tremendous contribution to make and, indeed, have made a tremendous contribution. I include Deputy Dr. Browne in that for whom I certainly have the deepest respect and sympathy.  I may not share his views or his pronouncements but that is a matter for Deputy Dr. Browne.  I respect his independence and his democratic right to say what he says.  There is a lot of that needed in the society in which we are living, if I may pay him that tribute.  I am amazed that he should be associated with this amendment on the basis of his previous statements on many issues, issues on which I disagree with him in the main.  Nevertheless, having regard to his pronouncements, I am astonished and, indeed, shocked and disappointed that he should associate himself with this amendment.</P>

I really think that Deputy Dr. Browne and one or two of the other doctors in the Labour Party should hang their heads in shame in connection with this amendment.  It is an amendment which must frighten the most liberal amongst us.  It cuts across the very basic philosophy of the law, which is the bedrock of the society in which we are living.  It cuts across the thinking of all right-thinking members of the society in which we live.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most shocking, outrageous and frightening amendments ever moved in this House.  I am sure Fine Gael will either vote against it or abstain from voting on it.  They must.  Fianna Fáil will, of course, do their duty.  They will protect the people against the type of thinking revealed in this amendment.  We have an obligation to do that.</P>
      <P>I would make a final appeal to Deputy Dr. Browne to reflect on what is intended by this amendment.  I would ask him to take it carefully and not to rush it.  I would advise him to go out and have a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and ponder over the amendment.  When I resume my seat&mdash;I am quite sure the Labour Party would like me to resume my seat at this point of time&mdash;I shall be delighted to go out and have a cup of coffee with Deputy Dr. Browne, with whom I am on friendly terms, and I will, of course, pay for it.  I would go so far as to do that to convince him that this amendment is unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I am not quite ready to conclude since I thought there would be more speakers.  The &ldquo;soldiers of destiny&rdquo; indicated that they had a great deal to say about this amendment. As it turned out there were only two speakers and the Minister against the amendment.  In view of the earlier indication I was quite prepared to wait some time before I would have an opportunity of replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach did not direct his appeals for calm consideration of this Bill to the Government party and particularly to the Minister for Justice. It is a pity he did not invite the Minister for Justice for a cup of tea over which to have a chat with him about the repugnant provisions in this Bill, provisions designed to muzzle the Press, to muzzle free comment and prohibit freedom of association.  It is a pity he did not consider all these aspects over a cup of tea with the Minister for Justice.  Had he done so there would <Col N="1711" /> have been no need for this amendment and we would be dealing now with more constructive, more essential and more urgent legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said, very few speakers on the benches opposite have seen fit to speak on this amendment.  The Minister, of course, had to speak on it.  It has been dealt with in complete isolation from the other aspects of the Bill and the overall effect of the Bill.  All the criticism directed against this amendment could be directed with equal force against the Bill as a whole.  This amendment was designed to take its place in a Bill which has been described as most objectionable and repugnant to all the principles we have hitherto upheld.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from a notable contribution from Deputy Gallagher on the Government benches, the other contributions are scarcely worthy of comment.  The scarcity of contributions from the Government benches makes us wonder what support the Bill actually has or what knowledge of the Bill Government Deputies have.  This amendment seeks to ensure that private armies and gangs of bullyboys will not be given a free hand.  The last few speakers asked a question and I will ask the same question: what would happen if I went home tonight and found someone in my home?  What would I do?  The first thing I would not do would be to tackle the intruder on my own.  That would be the sensible thing, I think.  The second thing is I would not send for a private army because I could not afford to send for one.  But that is what the Minister wants people to do.  He said, in opposing this amendment, that he could not allow a situation in which the gardaí would be used in circumstances like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if this amendment is not accepted the only effect of the section will be to provide protection for those people who can afford to hire private <Col N="1712" /> armies and who can afford to pay for private gangs of bullyboys.  All we are seeking to ensure in this amendment is that the Garda Síochána will be available for this duty and that it be stated clearly that they are the proper people to administer action of this sort because they are the only people qualified and experienced in handling such situations.  There is no argument against that.  The poor man who cannot afford to hire gangs of bullyboys but who goes home and finds that his house has been taken over will have to rely on the Garda Síochána for protection.  There is no need for me to spell out the breaches of the peace that would occur in the event of private armies being employed.</P>
    <P>This Bill introduces many new criminal offences.  I was amazed to hear previous speakers criticise this amendment on the ground that it created new offences, whereas the entire Bill creates a wide range of new offences that will affect every newspaper editor, every journalist and every person who makes either a written or a verbal statement on any of the activities which this Bill seeks to prevent.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to protect not only the weak unauthorised occupier of property but to protect also the weak owner who is not in a position to hire a private army and who, physically, might not be able to eject people from his property.  I cannot understand how the purpose of the amendment could be so grossly misrepresented by speakers opposite, both of whom are lawyers.  I have not the privilege of attaining those heights but if I were in that position I would hate to be going into a courthouse as a lawyer to try to deal with a case involving some of these people, some of these bullyboys acting on behalf of owners, who could be in foreign countries, a case of serious assaults having been carried out by these people.  It would be little consolation for the unfortunate victims of these assaults to be told that the law would deal with the people who assaulted them.</P>
    <P>As I said, the whole kernel of this <Col N="1713" /> amendment was completely sidetracked by the speakers opposite.  The previous speaker spoke of Deputy Cooney's contribution on this amendment, but Deputy Cooney stated quite clearly he was in sympathy with the principle of the amendment and that he understood and sympathised with the motives behind it.  It was strictly on a legal point that he would not subscribe or agree to this amendment, a legal point which possibly I as a layman, without the knowledge of the law which Deputy Cooney and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach have, might not appreciate.  But here again, as I said before, this is an assembly of laymen and we have to make our contributions with the knowledge and experience available to us, so there is from Deputy Cooney a clear and sympathetic understanding of what motivated this amendment, and in view of the glowing terms used by the Parliamentary Secretary and his willingness to quote Deputy Cooney, why did he not accept the amendments in Deputy Cooney's name?  He had a few amendments tabled and still has a few to come.  We hope this change of heart will transform itself into something more concrete than mere empty words.</P>
    <P>We have heard people referring to cows and how to remove cows, but this is a Bill relating to forcible entry, and I would pose the question: how is the Minister for Justice going to deal with a cow which forcibly enters property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the alternative is to create private armies instead of increasing the numbers of gardaí. That is what the Deputy wants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have it from Deputy Burke that the reason the <Col N="1714" /> Minister wants to oppose this amendment is that he does not want to increase the number of gardaí, that he wants this duty put into the hands of private armies, private thugs and police forces.  I am glad that Deputy Burke came in at this late hour to clarify that point.</P>
      <P>This amendment stems entirely from the completely inadequate and completely anomalous definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in the Bill.  I think that if the Minister and Deputies opposite studied the definition given to &ldquo;owner&rdquo; and &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; in the Bill, they would understand more fully, if they could be got to understand at all, the purpose and the need for this amendment, because it arises directly from the wide definition given to ownership.  We recognise the difficulties and the possible anomalous situation that this amendment could create but it was put down because it is the only way we could try to protect unfortunate people from the kind of treatment which we had experience of in Hume Street, where we saw what these private armies can do and, unfortunately, some people physically felt what they can do.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it may, as Deputy Cooney pointed out, impinge on long-established common law practices but this is not our fault.  It is the fault of the Government during the past few days.  If this amendment is all that the last two speakers said it is then so is the whole Bill because, apart from the Minister for Justice, Deputy Gallagher, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and Deputy Burke, no one else, either inside or outside this House has supported this Bill.  All associations and all the media of communications have condemned the provisions contained in this Bill.</P>

We want to ensure that they will continue to do that and that their functions will not be replaced by private armies or usurped by private thugs who use weapons and force of all kinds.  It will be little consolation to the people who have suffered at the hands of these people and have had their skulls crushed or their bones broken to be told that they used too much force and will be summoned and dealt with accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 34, after &ldquo;who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;verbally (otherwise than on radio or television)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 4, which is the most notorious section in this most notorious Bill.  In fact, it is the most notorious and infamous section that has ever been legislated for by our native Parliament, because it provides the extraordinary principle of vicarious criminal liability.  It is a section which has been roundly condemned by people other than politicians and people who clearly would have no axe to grind, whose only concern would be with the idea of personal liberty and with the idea of justice and the sacredness of the rule of law.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed in some way to soften the retrograde effects of this unfortunate section.  Subsection (1) as drafted says that a person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of the Act shall be guilty of an offence.  It provides that where a statement which itself is an offence under subsection (1) is made by or on behalf of a group of persons each member of the group may equally be guilty of that offence.  Section 2 is a completely new offence in our statute law, the offence of forcibly entering.  Section 3 is another new offence, the offence of remaining in forcible occupation.  Section 4 says that anyone who encourages or advocates the commission of either of these offences shall himself be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1718" /> There is considerable apprehension that, whether it is intended or not, it is implicit in it that this section can have a censorship effect in so far as it uses the rather vague, nebulous term &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; and that any person who does either of these things can find himself guilty of a criminal offence and subject to the very severe penalties prescribed by this Bill.  To that extent it seeks to discourage comment and discussion because either of these things could fall within the heading of &ldquo;encourage or advocate&rdquo;.  In that sense it has within it the seeds of censorship and worse still the seeds of Press censorship.  The one mark of a regime that is heading along the path towards naked fascism is a desire to muffle the organs of opinion, to muffle the newspapers of the nation.  It has been a traditional characteristic of all the dictatorships that we have seen in this century in Europe that their first enemies were the newspapers of the country in which they sought to grow.  It would be a disastrous thing if we in this Parliament, a young Parliament, a young democracy, should allow to pass through this House a section which even remotely might contain within itself the seeds of censorship of the mass media.  It is to avoid any such imputation in this section that I have put forward this amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, as I have no doubt he will, protests that censorship is the last thing on his mind I say to the Minister that if that is the case there is nothing to prevent him from accepting this amendment.</P>
    <P>The subsection reads:</P>
    <P>A person who encourages or advocates...</P>
    <P>I want it to read:</P>
    <P>A person who verbally (otherwise than on radio or television) encourages or advocates...</P>
    <P>That leaves the Minister with his offence of encouraging or advocating but it removes from the commission of such offence people who might be commenting in the mass media on the subject matter of a situation subsequently to come within the courts as constituting an offence under this Bill. <Col N="1719" /> It removes any inhibition from a newspaper to support a plea for the preservation of an historic building.  We have to go back to the oft-quoted example of the Hume Street episode when a well-intentioned group of people, with serious concern for this capital city, took certain action to prevent an aesthetically beautiful part of the city from being destroyed.  In that action they were supported and encouraged by the newspapers of the land.  If this section and this Bill were law when that particular episode took place, not merely could those well-intentioned citizens have been prosecuted as criminals but the newspapers who expressed admiration for their activities could also have been prosecuted under section 4.  My amendment seeks to ensure that in this democracy such a situation cannot and will not arise.</P>
    <P>The amendment is simple.  It merely makes it an offence to encourage or advocate verbally otherwise than on radio or television.  In other words, expressions of support in newspapers would be excluded from the scope of this section and a newspaper would be entitled to carry out its legitimate function of commenting, of expressing a point of view either in praise or in criticism of a particular action or a particular agitation which might unwittingly find itself under this unfortunate section a criminal action.  A newspaper should always have the right, untrammelled in any way whatever, to make whatever type of comment it pleases.  If there is any diminution of that right we have taken the first step towards totalitarianism.  If the Minister, representing a party and a Government who pride themselves on the epithet &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; has any real appreciation of what that epithet means he will accept this amendment. The essence of Republicanism is equality, fraternity and, above all, freedom.  Freedom in its most important manifestation, in this age of instant communication, is freedom of the Press.  This section as drafted definitely discourages, inhibits and cuts down the freedom of the Press because if a situation arises in which the Press comments either critically or in an <Col N="1720" /> opposite vein, especially in an opposite vein, a complaint could be laid that the person writing the article to the editor of the newspaper was encouraging the commission of an offence under either of the two offence sections. No newspaper should ever be put in that position.</P>
    <P>The amendment is simple.  It merely seeks to exclude a newspaper from the possibility of committing this offence. It also seeks to exclude the commentator on radio or television.  I would be particularly careful to ensure that those persons would be protected and would be absolutely immune from the effects of this nefarious section because we have already had straws in the wind in regard to the attitude of this Government towards the television and radio services and towards what the Government think they should or should not present or how they should or should not present any particular problem.  I have only to point to the infamous and unnecessary 7-Days Tribunal which was appointed to decide whether the programme on money-lending was an accurate reflection of a situation in Dublin.  There is no doubt that the gist of the finding was that that programme exposed a dirty situation in the capital city of our nation.</P>
    <P>We recently had a commission set up to review the activities of our national television station.  Also it is notorious that there have been behind-the-scenes attempts by Ministers to muffle or blunt some of the comments on current affairs made on our radio and television.  These people who, by and large are responsible journalists and who are in a position akin to the newspapers, should be completely untrammelled and free to express the point of view of public interest without being in any danger of committing an offence, an offence so vague that to encourage or advocate will constitute it.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that, because of its wording, my amendment, if accepted, will exclude newspapers from the scope of this subsection.  The Minister may take exception to it on the grounds that it may also have the effect of excluding handbills or broadsheets <Col N="1721" /> or a similar type of instant print but, even if some informal printed matter of that nature were to escape, the harm that could be done by it would be minimal compared with the damage that might be done if the amendment is not accepted.  The Minister may also feel that the organs of opinion issued by some of the subversive organisations would escape.  Some of these organs are newspapers issued regularly, published in accordance with law and with a very definite circulation and once they fall into that category they are entitled to be issued and printed.</P>
    <P>The amendment is simple but the effects are serious if it is accepted, and I fail to see how the Minister can reject it if he is true to what he pretends and says is the tradition of his party, that of republicanism.  It is an amendment designed to ensure that our Press will never be muzzled.  It is designed to allay the unease of the people working in the communications media in regard to this Bill and this section particularly, the most infamous section, in my opinion, that has ever been introduced in this Parliament.  It is designed so that that section will never act adversely on our popular Press.  The section, as drafted and amended, if the amendment is accepted, will still get at the type of scruffy subversive that the Minister says the whole thing is aimed at.  If the Minister wants the jackboot to squash these people this amendment will not in any way blunt the steel on the heel of the jackboot.  It will be available to him to wield it as mightily as he wishes. But the amendment will protect the newspapers, their writers and proprietors, the editors and publishers.  It will protect journalists whose vocation lies in broadcasting either on radio or on television.  It will protect the independence of these people to make their comments on current affairs.  It is an integral part of our tradition that these people should have the right to comment as they think fit on current affairs.  I shall be most disappointed in&mdash;but not surprised at&mdash;the Minister and his party if this amendment is not accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support <Col N="1722" /> strongly the amendment proposed by Deputy Cooney.  In some respects I believe the amendment arose from a statement made by the Minister on 26th May, 1971 when the general ministerial thinking behind the introduction of the Bill became quite apparent to us.  The Minister said then, as reported in column 230 of the Official Report of 26th May, 1971:</P>
      <P>Newspapers are not any more immune from the law of the land than any other individual or company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald aptly remarked at that juncture:</P>
      <P>Here comes the threat.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the country and if a newspaper at the present moment sees fit to write editorials or articles advocating crime of one form or another ...they are guilty of an offence. They can be guilty of incitement or of participating in crime as principals in the second degree or accessories before the fact, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>Reading the Official Report I found it profoundly disturbing to see such a simplistic, dangerous and repulsive political assumption residing in the mind of the Minister in regard to the role of newspapers.  It certainly illustrates the total failure of the Minister to appreciate the role of newspapers in society and the role of our national communications media.  His petulant attitude throughout this debate has shown the necessity for an amendment of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the section, in any event, is quite unconstitutional.  The real importance of the discussion tonight lies in the future challenge in the Supreme Court which will undoubtedly come in regard to this Bill and particularly this section.  Under Article 40 of the Constitution, the Bill will, I am certain, be found unconstitutional. Article 40 enshrines the right of our citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.  It is under that section in regard to the role of newspapers and communications media that the Supreme Court would be most likely to find this Bill unconstitutional. <Col N="1723" /> The Minister's attitude tonight will go on record in that regard.  Every Member of the House, particularly Fianna Fáil Members if they have any sensitivity left in regard to this Bill, should oppose the section and support the amendment.</P>
    <P>There is widespread public unease about this section.  It is not often one finds an occasion on which almost all national and provincial newspapers are unanimous in their view on this section of the Bill and in regard to the opening up of a new vista of legal definitions affecting freedom of expression, of comment, newspaper publication, and reportage in regard to such offences. This is an extremely serious situation. I come from the south.  I have never regarded the <i>Cork Examiner</i> as being a notoriously radical or reactionary newspaper.  When the <i>Cork Examiner</i> speaks out in violent opposition to the Government's policy something must be radically wrong.  For the Minister's edification, I shall quote from the editorial in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on 4th June, 1971.  Under the heading &ldquo;Dangerous Legislation&rdquo; it stated:</P>
    <P>It is not often that the press in this country feels compelled to object strongly to measures put forward by the Government which would tend to limit its traditional freedom.  We live, after all, in a democracy, and by and large, there is no undue interference with the work of newsmen.  But issue must be taken with certain sections of the Forcible Entry Bill, which has just gone through the Dáil, and which if allowed to pass unamended into law, will almost certainly seriously curtail the liberty of the press to report and comment on matters which it feels to be in the public interest.  We refer specifically to that section of the Bill which makes it an offence &ldquo;to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence&rdquo;. It is quite clear that comment, or even mere reportage in certain circumstances, could be construed as incitement, and it is intolerable that such an enactment should be made, not only against a press which has always shown itself to be highly responsible, but against ordinary <Col N="1724" /> members of the public who may feel constrained to speak their minds on public issues.</P>
    <P>This is a rather historic editorial in a newspaper in the Taoiseach's constituency. He pays close attention to editorials in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and I hope he will read this editorial again. The <i>Cork Examiner</i> continues:</P>
    <P>Let it be quite clear that we recognise and support any measure which is aimed at safeguarding either private or public property, and we do not take issue at all with those portions of the statute which are directed towards that necessary end. But this could have been achieved without resorting to undue interference with the right of association, the right of free speech and liberty of written comment.  The proposed legislation, as it now stands, is drafted in such a manner that it is almost absurd.  Indeed, were it not so potentially dangerous, it would almost be possible to laugh it off as being undeserving of any further attention.  A number of Dáil Deputies gave some examples of its possible consequences which were not at all as exaggerated as they may have seemed at first glance.  The blunt truth is that, if this measure is allowed to become law in its present form, newspapers and the communications media generally will be unable to criticise anything, lest in so doing they may tend to incite people to commit an offence.</P>
    <P>What this means in effect is that the press will no longer be able to fulfil its essential and time-honoured function as a public watchdog: it will be unable to point to injustice and deprivation, much less to resort to any form of crusading journalism. It will become a fettered press, unable to speak its mind, unable to act in the interest of the public it serves, and ultimately reduced to a pale spectre of its former self.  We have no doubt whatever that the people of Ireland do not want such rigid control of journalism.  We have no doubt that it would not be at all in their interests to have it so controlled. Equally, we have no doubt that it will be roundly denied that <Col N="1725" /> any attempt is being made to impose such control.  This we refuse to accept, as we will refuse to accept any spurious assurances about the intention governing this far-reaching and dangerous legislation, which smacks of naked dictatorship.  We will, in fact, refuse to accept anything less than comprehensive amendment of this section, or its abolition, simply because we happen to believe in a free press, in freedom of association, in free speech, and we refuse to accept any interference with those basic freedoms, no matter how well intentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest I be accused of being provincially partisan, I shall quote an important editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> dealing with this section of the Bill.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> is not reputed as being the most radical of papers in the country and it is not often that one finds a newspaper of this type dubbing a Bill as a &ldquo;Fascist Bill&rdquo;.  The editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> must have &ldquo;done his thing&rdquo; in a big way in reacting to the Minister.  I should like to point out that the Minister was so appreciative of this particular editorial he did not even write a letter to the editor&mdash;at least the Crosbie family of Cork had been much more honoured by the Minister's reaction.  The editorial is worth placing on the records of this House.  It dealt eloquently with the Forcible Entry Bill.  In fact, the Labour Party could not have said it better&mdash;<Col N="1726" /> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> is not even affiliated to the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>The editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> said that three repressive proposals stand out: (a) the giving of powers of arrest without warrant to the gardaí; (b) the placing of the onus of proving himself innocent on an accused and, (c) the attempt to muzzle the Press&mdash; which is relevant to this amendment. The editorial continued:</P>
      <P>Sacrificed also are the interests of the community as a whole because freedom of speech and the corollary right freely to be informed are essential to the interest of a free society.  This being so the Bill can fairly be termed Fascist.</P>
      <P>The Minister should pay due regard to that.</P>
      <P>I will not quote the many provincial editorials, copies of which are available, but it is important in relation to this section of the Bill that the Minister should pay heed to the views of a reputable national professional trade union, the National Union of Journalists. As an organised professional group, that union has been extremely sensitive not to indulge, or be seen to indulge, in party political matters.  It has always maintained appropriate non-involvement in such matters.  However, so irate has been the NUJ in relation to this Bill and so conscious of the tremendous restraint it will impose on its membership, it has taken the liberty&mdash;an historical and proper liberty&mdash;of circularising all Members of the Dáil and Seanad with the views of the chairman and secretary of the Dublin Branch of the NUJ.  It is proper to challenge the Minister to refute the views expressed in this communication. It relates particularly to this section and the amendment we are discussing this evening.  The circular stated:</P>
      <P>A recent meeting of this Branch, which represents 400-500 members working in Dublin, unanimously passed a resolution expressing grave concern over certain provisions of the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill and resolving to seek your assistance&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, the members of both Houses&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" />&mdash;in having section 4 withdrawn or satisfactorily amended.</P>
    <P>This, it will be recalled, is the section which provides heavy penalties for anybody found guilty of charges that could arise from the investigation, reporting, photographing, commenting on, or otherwise editorially dealing with, for publication or broadcast, specified activities, in a hitherto legitimate manner.</P>
    <P>I do not think that even with his expertise, Deputy Cooney could have summarised it as succinctly as that.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of our members' work, it is only with the greatest reluctance we take any action that involves us directly in issues of public controversy such as this.  However, up to the present advanced stage of the Bill's passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the efforts of individual Deputies, which we fully appreciate, and those of others have not met with any significant success where our members' interests are concerned. Therefore, left with no alternative, we and our immediate colleagues in the national press and fellow-members throughout the country now feel it is our duty to declare publicly our professional and ethical concern over the obvious threats to working journalists and grave dangers to fundamental press freedom posed by the Section.</P>
    <P>The resulting dangers to the public interest and the implications for our most cherished concepts of democracy are, we feel sure, matters of common concern to all Irishmen, whether electors or legislators.</P>
    <P>We are awaiting a meeting with the Minister for Justice and, in the meantime, we look forward to having the widest support of Members of both Houses.</P>
    <P>It is signed, &ldquo;Yours sincerely, Michael Ó Croinin (Chairman), Niall Connolly (Secretary).&rdquo; I think at this juncture, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should call for a House in the hope that the trade union committee of the Fianna Fáil Party will come into the House <Col N="1728" /> now so that I can gauge reactions to that correspondence.</P>

We should also place on record the articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> yesterday and today headed appropriately &ldquo;The Wrong Remedy&rdquo;, two articles by Senator Mary Robinson, admittedly not a confidante of the Fianna Fáil Party.  She argued very effectively in both of these articles that this Bill is quite unnecessary because at present criminal law could deal with adequately, and cope with, any problems that arise.  In relation to section 4 she said in the second article that it has caused grave alarm to responsible groups in the country, including the Dublin Branch of the NUJ. I certainly fully support the clear-cut amendment in which Senator Robinson has offered alternative outs to the Government if they are disposed to accept it, or to accepting any sensible amendments at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that what is at stake in the section is the fundamental right to public expression of opinion; what is at stake in the section is public freedom of speech; what is certainly at stake is freedom of public comment, and the more appropriately and more definitely endangered in this section is the freedom of the press, television and radio to report and comment within the normal limits of the law, and to do so without being hauled through the courts by the Minister for Justice.  I am extremely conscious that our present Minister is so petulant, so narrow-minded, so vindictive and so inexperienced&mdash;I would not say he is incompetent for he is a well-briefed man but briefed in the wrong direction frequently&mdash;that I do not think he should be allowed to enjoy the opportunity in the next 12 months, <Col N="1731" /> which one would anticipate would be the length of his Ministry at the very outside, of bringing newspaper reporters and editors through the law courts at his whim, simply because he has decided to introduce a particular piece of legislation because some small groups in the country went off half-cocked in relation to squatting and forcible entry.  These groups could have been quite effectively dealt with under the existing processes of the law without the complete and total waste of Parliamentary time that we are now obliged to endure in a farcical situation, solely at the whim and instigation of the Government.  It is a situation which certainly has brought this House into further disrepute with the public at large at a point in time when our economy is in dire need of being strengthened in relation to the development of freer trade and when our country should be endeavouring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is that under section 4, if we pass it as it stands, the freedom of public opinion to be expressed and reported will be called seriously into question, and even Deputy Andrews with his extensive knowledge of mediaeval jurisprudence will not deny that any national legislature which decides to take to itself the power to muzzle the newspapers is taking an awful lot for granted and as far as I am concerned, it deserves to be fully opposed, as we are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In order to appreciate this amendment, and more particularly to appreciate the necessity for it, if this Bill is not to leave this House as an extremely dangerous piece of legislation, it is necessary to understand section 4 of the Bill which this amendment proposes to amend.  Section 4 says that a person &ldquo;who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be <Col N="1733" /> guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  That means that if anybody encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under sections 2 or 3, he shall be guilty of an offence.  &ldquo;Anybody who advocates the commission of an offence&rdquo;&mdash;what does that mean?  It is easy enough to understand the expression &ldquo;advocates&rdquo;. It means somebody who calls for the commission of an offence, somebody who makes a case for the commission of an offence, somebody who speaks in favour of the commission of an offence or somebody who, speaking publicly or in writing, states or leads others to believe that it is necessary to commit an offence.  That is what I would understand by the word &ldquo;advocate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>But there is another word in the first two lines of this section which says that a person &ldquo;who encourages or who advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or section 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo; I would invite the Deputies, the general public and the Press to consider seriously the meaning of the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  It is a vague word, a word which is hard to define.</P>
      <P>A person could encourage another to do a thing in a variety of ways. He could encourage him by coming up to him in the street and standing looking at him; he could encourage him by giving him a friendly smile. He could encourage a person to do a thing by writing in a newspaper.  For example, if somebody was taking possession of a house in order to demonstrate the hopeless state of housing in this city, in order to bring before the general public the fact that the Government had fallen down hopelessly on the job of housing the people, if that was the object of the protest, and the protest took the form of squatting forcibly in a house, and a national newspaper came out during the currency of this protest and wrote a leading article saying that, while illegal acts could not be condoned, it was easy indeed to understand feeling running very high when one considered the appalling conditions in which families were living in this city&mdash;that type of leading article could be regarded as encouraging forcible squatting, or what-have-you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> That is one of the appalling ingredients, in my opinion, of section 4.  It seeks in its vague way to take power to control the Press, to stifle opposition, to prevent the Press from putting before the public their views for the purpose of forming public opinion.  That is what subsection (1) of section 4 does.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>Where a statement in contravention of subsection (1) of this section is made by or on behalf of a group of persons, every person who is a member of the group and who consented to the making of the statement shall be guilty of an offence under that subsection.</P>
    <P>Suppose there was a partnership and one of the partners happened to be the editor, sub-editor, or feature writer in a newspaper and he wrote an article in the newspaper explaining why people were protesting&mdash;that is all he would have to do&mdash;that could certainly be taken as encouraging the protest and not alone would the author of the article be guilty of an offence but all the partners would be guilty too. Indeed, it might be said, though I do not say this with the same conviction, that all the directors of a newspaper might be guilty although it could, I suppose, be argued that, if it were a limited company, it would be an artificial individual and all the directors or the shareholders would not be liable.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>In a prosecution of a person (in this subsection referred to as the defendant) as a member of a group for an offence under subsection (1) of this section in relation to a statement made by or on behalf of the group, if, having regard to all the circumstances (including the constitution and rules, if any, of the group, and the extent to which the defendant had participated in the activities of the group), the court thinks it reasonable to do so, it may regard proof of the defendant's membership of the group and of the making of the statement by or on behalf of the group as proof of consent on the part of the defendant in the absence of any adequate explanation by him.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House, and I put it on <Col N="1735" /> the record of the House, that that is as drastic a subsection as ever was sought to be inserted in a Bill.  I have been consistent throughout the debate on this Bill, right from the Second Reading down to this Report Stage.  I have said that I believe in private property. I have said that I believe in the right of private ownership and private occupation. But there are objectionable sections in this Bill.  There are objectionable definitions in this Bill.  There are sections in it which no legislative assembly conscious of its obligations to the public would allow to be enacted.  This section 4 is the most objectionable section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I made it clear on Second Reading that I would oppose this tooth and nail all the way.  It is true that, on Committee Stage, in response to criticism on the Second Stage, the Minister did introduce an amendment.  In the Bill, as originally drafted, it was stated that, in order to free himself from guilt if he were a member of a group or organisation and if he wanted to dissociate himself from any encouraging words published by any individual member of the group, then he, and all the other members of the group, would have publicly to dissociate themselves maybe by hiring newspaper space, maybe by hiring a loudspeaker van, or maybe by going on radio or television and saying: &ldquo;We disagree with our colleague.  We did not authorise him to say that.  We do not accept what he said and we do not approve of what he said.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was pointed out to the Minister on this section.  It is true that he brought in an amendment, but it is also true that the amendment he brought in, instead of improving matters, makes the position worse because under the Bill, as drafted, an individual knew under section 4 what he had to do to prove his innocence.  It might have been inconvenient and expensive but he could at least take the necessary steps to show that he was not guilty.  In his efforts to improve the situation the Minister wrote in subsection (3) which says: &ldquo;In a prosecution of a person .... as a member of a group for an offence under subsection <Col N="1736" /> (1) of this section in relation to a statement made by or on behalf of the groups, if, having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;<i>et cetera, et cetera, et cetera</i>&ldquo;the court thinks it reasonable to do so&rdquo; it may accept as sufficient evidence the fact that the accused person is a member of the group in order to saddle him, and saddle him fully, with the guilt of his fellow-members in the group.  That is guilt by association.  That is an innovation as far as I am concerned in the criminal law.  We sought on Committee Stage to have this section removed from the Bill.  We did not succeed. We put down an amendment and we opposed the section and put it to a vote, but the Minister, with his majority, steamrolled the section through the House.</P>
    <P>It is in those circumstances that we have put down a number of amendments to this section, including the amendment we are dealing with now. This amendment is one of the amendments which proposes to protect the freedom and independence of the Press to express its opinion on matters of public concern.  It is unnecessary to point out that the Press in this country wields a very powerful influence in forming and guiding public opinion and that has been so since the foundation of this State.  I do not think it can be said that the Press has gone too far or that it has abused the position which it holds on any occasion. I had occasion to say in this House about 12 months ago that the Press did not go far enough.  I said then and I repeat now that if the Press had been keeping a closer eye on the Taoiseach and on other members of this Government and had been taking up the hints and direct charges made from this side of the House the Government would not be in the sorry mess they are in today or that they have come through during the past 12 to 18 months.</P>
    <P>It would be a sorry day for this country if, by any action of this House, the Press was put in a position in which it had to stop to think before conveying its views to the public on a matter of public concern.  If we ever get to that stage we shall be beginning to tumble <Col N="1737" /> down the slippery slope towards the end of true freedom and true democracy as we understand it and as I hope it has been enjoyed in this country. It is for that reason we on this side of the House are determined that this section will not be passed at least until the people know what is involved in it, until the people know the dangerous precedent that it proposes to establish and until the people realise that it could well be the thin end of the wedge in attacking the Press and muzzling public opinion.</P>
    <P>In the immediate past there was an example in this House of Government thinking as a whole and of the thinking of the Minister for Justice in particular in regard to the Press and the publication of national newspapers.  I propose to spell that out in black and white tomorrow morning before I conclude my remarks.  I will not have to go any further than the Official Report of 13th July, 1971.</P>
    <P>I have been saying that the Press wields a powerful influence in forming and guiding public opinion.  I believe that the free Press of a country is a greater bulwark against the infringement of the constitutional rights and the ordinary rights and privileges of the citizens of a country than Parliament itself.  It is possible to have a position in Parliament, as we have at the moment, where the Government have an absolute majority and are united superficially and numerically at any rate and as long as they are they can steamroll their will through this House.  They can steamroll legislation through this House however stiffly that is resisted from these benches.  The Opposition can oppose strenuously at <Col N="1738" /> length and eloquently but unless the Press is free to report to the public at large we might as well be wasting our time.  That is particularly so in the modern world where the other mass media, television and radio, are controlled to some extent or another by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>In a small country like this at any rate it is essential that the national television and radio service should be a monopoly because otherwise it could not be sure of success.  That situation has been availed of in this country to give the Government of the day an opportunity of getting a stranglehold on television and radio.  Indeed, television and radio is operated here under the control of a board nominated, appointed and kept in office by the Government of the day.  With the best will in the world that organisation, which is Government controlled, has to respect the wishes of the Government and, indeed, can be directed by the Government under a section of the Broadcasting Acts to do or not to do as the Government wants.</P>
