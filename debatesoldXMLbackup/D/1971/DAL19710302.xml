      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is anticipated that a period of approximately one year would elapse between the completion of the negotiations with the European Communities and the coming into force of the agreements of accession.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate when in the course of that period the necessary changes in the Constitution would be <Col N="2" /> effected.  They would in any event need to be effected before the agreements of accession are ratified.</P>
    <P>I would consider it desirable that, as far as possible, all amendments to the Constitution should be put to the people on the one day.  Amendments to the Constitution to enable us to ratify our instruments of accession to the European Economic Community may, however, have to be voted on separately depending, <i>inter alia,</i> upon the timing of the successful conclusion of negotiations for membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not go so far as to say there would be votes at 18 before the next election. If he was quoted to the contrary that is a misquotation.  I announced here that the Government were examining the legislation necessary to enable votes to be had at 18 and that is still the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>A part of the question does relate to the EEC. Would the Taoiseach, in view of the number of speeches made on the subject recently, concede that there are reasons within the island of Ireland which call for changes in our Constitution?  Does he concede to this need for urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede there is a need and I concede that there is some urgency, but urgency is relative. As I indicated in the main reply, it would be desirable, as I see it at the moment, to have whatever amendments will be seen to be necessary, introduced on the one day, even though I acknowledge it may be necessary to isolate those applying to accession to the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach admits there is urgency in relation to the points referred to here by Deputy O'Leary would he not consider holding a separate referendum? I do not think expense should be a major factor in this when such changes as those to Article 44 are agreed upon by the Taoiseach and I think the House should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, negotiations are proceeding for membership of the EEC and it could <Col N="4" /> be within a year and a half to two years that a referendum would be held to decide whether or not the constitutional changes necessary for accession to the EEC would be passed.  If it is possible to have a referendum in that period I think we should consider including the other amendments at the same time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has made a number of statesmanlike speeches at the Ard-Fheis and elsewhere. Would he agree that the time has come for some action on this matter of the Constitution?  While study may be necessary in the situation, would he agree that an admirable model for the ideal Republican constitution could well be found in the original Irish Free State Constitution, before the sectarian constitution of 1937 was introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not agree.  I was not at the age of political maturity when that Constitution was passed by the people.  I was at that age when the second one was passed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last October, when President Nixon was here, I had an exchange of views with him on the main problems of the current international situation.  I also indicated to him my views about the situation in the North of Ireland.  I hope to resume <Col N="5" /> discussion of such matters with him when he receives me this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, under existing American legislation the EEC is regarded as a fully-developed area and one, therefore, not enjoying tax concessions which are applicable to Ireland which, under American legislation, is treated as a less than fully-developed area as a result of which we have received American investments which we might not otherwise have received.  Would the Taoiseach use this occasion to impress on the distinguished President of the USA the urgency, from Ireland's point of view, that these tax concessions should continue to apply to American investors in Ireland, both those who are already here and those who might be encouraged to come here if those concessions were to continue to apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not major concessions and I doubt if the use of the plural is justified in this context. Nevertheless, the Deputy may be assured that any matter affecting the interests of this country <i>vis-à-vis</i> the American Administration will be mentioned by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the statement I made on 25th February.  As I indicated in that statement I am hopeful to see the beginning as soon as possible of expert examination of practical matters in economic development in which co-operation would be to the benefit of both parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach refresh my memory on this point?  I recall that we had an agreement that there would be a new Ministry for Planning.  Deputy Blaney's name, incidentally, was mentioned.  I presume that this would not apply now.  Can the Taoiseach say whether any new ministries are being planned or whether he is satisfied with the performance of the people in his Cabinet? Can the Taoiseach say whether any new ministry is contemplated, especially one for physical planning?</P>

      <P>No, except what I have just mentioned.

      <P>Reliable figures for net emigration are available only for intercensal periods.  For periods since the last census of population the only indicators of net emigration are the figures of net outward passenger movement by sea and air.  For the 12 months ended November, 1970, the most recent period for which figures are available, the net outward passenger movement by sea and air was 7,696 persons.  This compares with a figure of 13,410 persons for the 12 months ended November, 1969.  It must be pointed out that the net passenger movement figures have proved unreliable as a measure of net emigration in some intercensal periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies will appreciate that it is not possible to give an accurate estimate for this and I would point out too that, in comparing payments to doctors under the new service <Col N="13" /> with those under the present service, one does not compare like with like, because of the change in the nature of the service.  Subject to these reservations, I would say that it is thought that additional payments to doctors might be of the order of £500,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy what is a fairly enlightened guess, and that is all.  We have made our own estimates of the average number of services that an active doctor, taking proper leave, would perform per year in a general practice.  We have made an estimate of the number of services per patient that might come on a doctor's list under the scheme.  All these matters are estimates, so when I say £500,000 I am saying deliberately it is an enlightened guess.  I cannot go any further than that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The full information sought in the first part of the question is not available.  However, the daily average number of persons attending dispensaries for general practitioner services, as recorded over a recent six weeks period at 12 of the principal dispensaries in the Dublin Health Authority area, was 29 per district medical officer.</P>
      <P>There are 86 posts of district medical officer in the Dublin Health Authority area.  A district medical officer has been appointed for each of these posts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the records of the number of persons attending a dispensary in a particular period are not kept by all doctors, particularly in the smaller dispensaries in the less populous areas.  Therefore we chose the dispensaries where receptionists are employed in order to get some reasonably accurate figure.  I could not say whether we could apply that figure of 29 services per day all over the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it was based on knowing the number of attendances at the dispensaries where receptionists are employed.  Then we had discussions with the medical profession on the matter.  We were also very lucky to have surveys available in both rural and urban parts of Northern Ireland where we were able to get some idea of what a busy doctor would do; and some doctors themselves had figures.  The Deputy will be aware that in relation to the choice of doctor scheme, this would be the case <Col N="15" /> where doctors would have their private patients to add to the patients under the choice of doctor scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the addition to the basic rate of old age contributory pension in respect of a dependent wife or invalid husband had been repeatedly increased in recent years at a rate which was not only greater than the rate of increase in the basic rates of pension but was also greatly in excess of any increase which would have been warranted by reference to the rise in the cost of living, a further increase in October, 1970, following that already awarded from January, 1970, would not have been justified.  Moreover, I would remind the Deputy that in October, 1970, the basic rate of old age contributory pension was increased by 87½ new pence a week, which brought the total payment for a man <Col N="22" /> and wife to £8.50 a week.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>Under the law the onus of complying with industrial safety requirements rests primarily with the employer.  Co-operation by the worker is also called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial inspectorate of my Department provides an advisory and accident prevention service to industry, including building and construction; <Col N="27" /> and where necessary, prosecutions are taken in the courts.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate works in co-operation with the National Industrial Safety Organisation, a voluntary body representative of employer, worker and other interests concerned with industrial safety.  This body also includes representatives of the industrial inspectorate and it receives financial assistance from the Labour Vote.</P>
    <P>Following a comprehensive review of the inspection service a few years ago, the number of inspectors has been increased, and further inspectors are at present being recruited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the sad position now is that the number of accidents has doubled in the last 12 months?  Does that not clearly indicate to the Minister that it is imperative that further steps be taken to save the lives of those workers in view of the fact that twice as many people have been killed in accidents on building sites last year than in the previous year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all reasonable care is taken, as far as the Department are concerned, to eliminate accidents.  It is virtually impossible to completely eliminate accidents because, unfortunately, very often the worker himself is careless.  It is very difficult to do much to eliminate that except by frequent education and advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Minister has no solution to this very serious problem?  He should not ignore the fact that twice as many people were killed in this type of accident last year as were killed the previous year. Surely the Minister has a responsibility to see that some additional precautions are taken, or legislation is brought in if necessary, in order to remedy this serious matter?</P>

      <P>About £41 million of Government stocks fell due for redemption on 15th July, 1970, but owing to the bank closure the redemption date had to be postponed to 1st February, 1971.  As an alternative to redemption the holders of the stocks were given an offer of converting their holdings into any of three new stocks. Holders of stocks amounting to about £14.7 million opted for redemption. These have been paid with interest at 8 per cent for the period 15th July to 1st February.  Holders of stocks amounting to about £24.2 million opted for conversion.</P>
      <P>About £2.4 million stock has neither been redeemed nor converted.  This is due, partly to instructions from British holders being delayed by the British postal strike, partly to the legal requirements which have to be complied with where holders of the stock have died and partly to replies not being received from certain holders.  In order to facilitate all these holders the conversion offer will be kept open for some time longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 36, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of present land settlement policy is the structural reform of uneconomic holdings throughout the State with special emphasis on the relief of the acute congestion which prevails in western counties.  The selection of allottees is a matter exclusively reserved to the commissioners. There is a statutory obligation that the Land Commission must be satisfied as to the competence and intention of all allottees to work the land; that apart, there is no statutory order of preference but, broadly speaking, the applicants who are considered to have the strongest claim to allotments are: displaced employees, local uneconomic holders, migrants, trustees for communal purposes, cottiers and other applicants.</P>
      <P>Where lands are not required for structural reform of uneconomic holdings or other priority commitments, the claims of landless applicants in any locality are always carefully considered by the Land Commission.  Preference is then given to those who have experience of the working of land and who have sufficient capital or stock to enable them to work any land that might be allotted to them.  In practice, however, with so many already on the land in sub-standard units, the needs of the structural reform programme are such that landless men must, of necessity, take a low place in the allotment queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Meath, as elsewhere, eligible local smallholders have a first claim on land being distributed after due provision has been made for displaced employees.  Indeed, all efforts are directed towards the allotment of enlargements to uneconomic holders living within a radius of one mile of the acquired lands.  This limit has long been regarded as probably the safest distance consistent with the effective <Col N="36" /> working of an enlargement.  It is not a rigid mile and policy is sufficiently elastic to cater for some who may be marginally over the mile.  Additionally as sometimes happens, a pocket of congestion found outside a distance of a mile from an acquired estate may be dealt with by migrating one or more of the smallholders and dividing the surrendered lands amongst the remaining deserving uneconomic holders.</P>
    <P>Lest the impression should gain force that in the disposal of land acquired in County Meath the Land Commission cater exclusively for migrants, I should like to point out that of the aggregate area of 10,678 acres distributed in that county during the past five complete financial years, local i.e.  Meath applicants received 6,206 acres or almost 60 per cent of the total allotment.</P>
    <P>Since 1962 land settlement policy has been that holdings and enlargements are planned to provide family farms of 40 to 45 acres of good land or the equivalent in land of mixed quality. As I have already indicated on a number of occasions recently, the whole question of the future policy of the Land Commission and land policy in general is under active consideration by the Government.  Pending a decision on the various issues involved I think it would be premature to comment further on the matters the subject of these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the consideration which the Minister says is taking place, would he agree that sympathetic consideration should be given to landless men who have been taking land over a substantial period on a substantial scale and that, in fact, they are just as much farmers as people who are fortunate enough to own their land and should, therefore, be considered? Would he also consider, in view of the modern pattern of agricultural production, particularly with reference to EEC conditions, that 45 adjusted acres is not sufficient to support a small family at the standard to which farmers are attaining and have a right to attain to at the moment?  Would he also agree to reconsider this one mile limit?  In view of <Col N="37" /> the improved transport within agriculture one mile is no longer a prohibitive distance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Supplementary Estimate the last day I indicated my intention to deal with references made by members of Labour and Fine Gael to the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Inquiry.  We have heard Deputy Desmond deplore the fact that any inquiry was held.  He went to great lengths to indicate his displeasure at the holding of the inquiry.  However, it is an indication of the type of logic that prevails within the Labour Party that Deputy Desmond should on one occasion deplore the action of the Government in setting up an inquiry after the inquiry had been conducted while, some time earlier, he had asked for an inquiry.  To illustrate my point I quote Deputy Desmond from column 1571 of the Dáil Debates for 20th November, 1969:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a point of order, the question I addressed to the Taoiseach has <Col N="40" /> now, I note, been referred to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by the Taoiseach.  I would point out I asked the Taoiseach if he would hold a public inquiry.  Now that question has been referred to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who presumably will deal with it next week.  Frankly, this kind of shuffling off of Ministerial responsibility is a matter of grave concern.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Taoiseach was not setting up, on that particular day, an inquiry into the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme was a matter of grave concern to Deputy Desmond.  This is the type of two-faced dealing that we have come to expect from the Deputy and other members of his party.  If an inquiry had not been set up, the Government would have been charged with cowardice but since the inquiry was set up, the Government have been accused of carrying out a witch hunt.</P>
    <P>Not only did Deputy Desmond call for a public inquiry into the matter but so also did the Leader of his party, Deputy Corish, and also Deputy Keating.  Deputy Keating went much further than the Government on that occasion and said that if there was any truth in what the Minister said, those responsible should be subject to imprisonment. We can be sure that no matter what inquiry may be set up in relation to any aspect of national life we will always have this two-faced approach from the Labour Party. Deputy Desmond is not behind the door in this respect on any occasion. These are the sort of tactics he has used since coming here.  One day he expresses one view and the next day, another view.  It is remarkable that on the last occasion on which he spoke he had expressed one particular view before moving the Adjournment but later on the same day when the debate was resumed, he expressed quite a different view.  Perhaps he thought the visitors to the gallery had changed as he had changed on that particular occasion.  Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins was against the setting up of the inquiry but the leader of her party was in favour of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrigidHoganOHiggins" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be seen from the debates that the Leader of Fine Gael was in favour of setting up an inquiry at that time as were leading members of his party.  As the Minister has stated, those people who were entrusted with the responsibility of carrying out the inquiry did so in an effective way.  I might mention that Deputy Desmond's mind was not very clear on this aspect of the matter because, prior to the setting up of the tribunal, he displayed how biased he was by referring to the people to be appointed as people who might not carry out their duties in a responsible and impartial way.  Whatever may have been the findings of the tribunal, we know that the inquiry was conducted in an effective manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond had every opportunity of presenting himself at that inquiry, but he did not do so, although members of his party&mdash;Deputy O'Leary's name was mentioned&mdash;supplied some of the material to some of the people concerned in that inquiry. People have told me that they conveyed confidential information to a Labour TD and that information was used by that Labour TD and conveyed to other sources, namely Telefís Éireann or the people responsible for the production of these programmes. That was a breach of confidence and the information conveyed was distorted or twisted by those who were responsible for the accumulation of information. People should know the tactics adopted by some Labour Deputies on that occasion.</P>

I do not want to go over the ground again, but on 20th November the man <Col N="42" /> who now states he deplores the fact that an inquiry was held actually called for an inquiry.  This double-dealer raised this matter at column 1571 of volume 242.  Deputy Desmond said on that occasion:</P>
      <P>On a point of order, the question I addressed to the Taoiseach has now, I note, been referred to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by the Taoiseach.  I would point out I asked the Taoiseach if he would hold a public inquiry.....</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond now deplores the fact that an inquiry was held.  This is the double-dealing type of approach he has used time and again not alone in relation to the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; inquiry but in relation to other matters.  One thing is said one week and the opposite is said the next week.  This is the type of approach Deputy Desmond has used since he came into this House.  Double-dealer Desmond.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should read the debate of 20th November and refresh his memory.  He stated the Labour Party deplored the fact that the inquiry was held.  Deputy Corish, the leader of the Labour Party, if he is still the leader, said that, on behalf of his party, he welcomed the Taoiseach's decision to take steps to establish a judicial inquiry.  Deputy Keating wanted these men sent to prison.  We are, of course, used to these tactics. This is the type of witch hunt Deputy Desmond always pursues.  Both sides of the House are well aware of his tactics.  This kind of double-dealing does not go down in this House.  It does not go down with the people. Deputy Desmond did not give evidence <Col N="43" /> before the inquiry but confidential information given to a Labour Deputy by a constituent in relation to personal affairs was passed on.</P>

      <P>May I point out to Deputy Dowling that it is not in order, and it has never been the practice, to criticise Members of the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we establish a new practice?  People in my constituency were concerned to hear statements made in a House of the Oireachtas about increasing television licence fees.  A number of Senators indicated that they would be prepared to support an increase from £6 to £14. This is very disturbing to working class people who can hardly afford to pay £6 fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Senator said that it would not be a bad thing to have a high licence fee in order to rid ourselves of the <Col N="45" /> necessity to have advertising on radio and television.  He went on to say he would not oppose a further substantial increase in the licence fee in order to rid us of advertising.  It was also stated in the Seanad that if television licence fees were put up to £12 or £15 we would be getting a good bargain.  These gentlemen may be willing to pay £12 or £14 in order to look uninterruptedly at their colour television sets, but people in working class districts do not have colour television sets and are hard put to pay the present licence fee.  In fact, reception is very bad in some parts of the city and in these cases the fee of £6 is too much.  I would suggest to the Minister that consideration be given to reducing the licence fee in proportion to the type of service received.</P>
    <P>It was stated during the course of the debate that the licence fee in Sweden was £14, in Austria £13, in Denmark £12, in Norway £12, in Switzerland £11, in Belgium £8, in Italy £8, in France £7 and in Britain £6.  No comparison with the income of workers in those countries or with a television service provided was made.  In some of these countries one can tune into seven, eight and even nine stations at any one time compared with only one here.  For that reason it is unfair to compare licence fees.  A section of the community may well be able to afford to pay £14 for a licence but the Minister should also consider the other section of the community who want to avail of a television service at the lowest possible price.</P>
    <P>People who are able to get UTV, ITV and BBC are probably getting good value, but those people who do not have the 40 or 50 foot aerial necessary to get this reception, are not getting value for money.  I understand £1 of the £6 licence fee goes to Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>Television spongers have been mentioned and it is appalling to note that so many people do not pay their licence fees.  If we could get people to meet their responsibilities fully we could probably have an effective system.  The combined total of unrewened licences at 31st March, 1970, was 39,511.  This is a substantial number and I am glad to hear the Minister intends doing something about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Cigarette advertisement is being phased out at a loss of £300,000 revenue a year to the Authority.  I agree entirely with that and I trust this will be offset by a more realistic approach to advertising.  The quality of advertising at the moment is very low.  The station should be highly paid for putting on such advertisements.  A set of standards should be applied to advertising on television.  We should not be led by the BBC in this regard.  Advertising personnel in this country are capable of producing better advertisements than those we see on television. The Minister should establish advertising standards for television.  We should be ashamed of some of the advertisements.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the times at which the advertisements are shown.  These times are arranged to suit the advertiser.  Sometimes a programme is cut or curtailed in order to fit in an advertisement.  I can see no reason why advertisements should not be shown at the end of a programme, before the next programme begins.  Why should the advertisers be able to dictate to the Authority on when and how their advertisements are shown?  I deplore this dictation in relation to the showing of advertisements during peak hour programmes.  Programmes should be uninterrupted.  Perhaps if a programme is very long there might be one break for the purpose of advertising. There should not be advertisements for one detergent or another every few minutes.  Some of these advertisements are most misleading.  I am sure the Authority are conscious of this point. The Minister should consider the question of advertising standards.</P>
    <P>The news programmes on both radio and television are of a very high standard. We can be proud of them.  Some programmes such as &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; and &ldquo;What it says in the Papers&rdquo; are very effective programmes. One can listen to them with pleasure. &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; should be re-run the following morning.  This programme is produced late at night because of the time of the Dáil sittings. It should be re-run the following morning so that members of the general public can listen to it.  It is a very effective programme.</P>

      <Col N="47" /> The sports section on television and radio are producing good programmes. Their coverage is excellent.  Improvements have been made in recent times, which are appreciated by all.  I am sure that the staff of RTE will continue to upgrade these programmes.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; is a very good programme.  RTE can be proud of this programme.  Sometimes there is a slant in it with which I do not agree.  There should be a responsible attitude in relation to developments in the life of the community.  The irresponsible elements should not get too much attention. We often see groups who are creating trouble, attacking the establishment and attacking responsible sections of the community featured on television.  They are getting widescale coverage.  I hope this pattern will not be followed.  A responsible attitude in this matter must be developed.  The people who are making genuine efforts to solve problems should get more coverage.  There are many trouble-makers throughout the country and I feel that some of them are financed from outside sources.  Otherwise, they could not remain out of work for so long.  If the funds to support such people are not coming from outside the country we are in serious trouble here.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; is an excellent programme. The timing of good programmes should be varied.  A person may be out of the house at a particular time and may miss a programme. More home produced programmes should be shown.  We have a variety of such programmes in our own libraries since the establishment of RTE. People would like to view some of these programmes again.  A re-run of such programmes would not cost RTE any money.  The savings involved in this policy could be utilised for making better programmes.  The canned programmes from the US become monotonous. I know that canned programmes cost less and help to finance the station.</P>
    <P>There should be more Irish features like the &ldquo;Newcomers' Hour&rdquo; feature on radio.  The people in RTE should go into every county looking for talent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> Otherwise people in the country with talent may never be discovered.  It appears that television teams go in one direction all the time.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the provision of some programme over a number of weeks, taking each county into consideration, so that the talent available would be projected. The Abbey Players should be seen more often on television.  At the end of a run, particularly, people who have no opportunity of visiting the national theatre should be able to see them on television.</P>
    <P>In relation to all-Ireland programmes it should be possible to tie up with UTV so that there would be overall coverage of news or events rather than just local coverage.  While we have RTE reporters in Belfast doing an effective job we would get both sides of the story if we had this tie-up. There does not seem to be any reason why UTV and BBC or the three authorities could not produce sports programmes jointly.  A person interested in sport in this part of Ireland is also interested in sport in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  This would liven up programmes.</P>
    <P>I am confident that RTE will do a good job on the Eurovision Song Contest. They have proved they have the capacity to meet the big time and they are as efficient as any other television authority.  Last Sunday night we heard the eight songs that were selected from the couple of hundred that were composed. It could be that some of the songs that were not heard on Sunday could reach the top if they were broadcast to a wider group than those who selected the winner on Sunday.  This contest aroused a great deal of interest throughout the country.  Almost every household was watching it.  I would ask the Minister to consider having a couple of these other songs broadcast, a couple every week, with local talent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That would take seven years.  It would be worse than the seven year itch.  There were 700.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were 7,000 we could still select some of them. We do not have to be as ridiculous in our approach as Deputy Tully indicates <Col N="49" /> I am approaching it.  We would never get them through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said a couple every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple every week would be no harm, even if we did not get through them all.  There were people who spent quite an amount of time and energy composing songs for this contest and they are entitled to some consideration.  Maybe the best song did not win the contest.  Maybe the best song was not on the show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe more people listen to radio than look at television.  According to the Minister's figures 149,000 sound licences were issued.  The news programmes presented by Mike Burns and the other programmes on which I have heard Deputy Desmond and other people on Sunday afternoons are very good programmes, despite the fact that they have had some queer artists on them.  The financing of radio is difficult to understand, but I take it a portion of the licence fee goes to radio.  Nevertheless more attention should be paid to radio, and we also need a shortwave station.  Many years ago efforts were made to set up a shortwave radio station but due to an unfortunate change of Government at the time the Turks got the equipment. I hope the Minister will consider the provision of a shortwave transmitter if any new equipment becomes available, so that we can extend our voice to our exiles and correct the distorted reporting that takes place on foreign stations, sometimes on stations not too far away from here, especially when possibly a week or two weeks elapse before newspapers or letters arrive to correct the erroneous impressions that have been given to exiles.  The distortion in some of the reporting by the BBC and by the other broadcasting authority not so far away sometimes causes confusion and may create an erroneous impression in the minds of other people, our own people possibly in danger areas in the North and elsewhere, and may create a situation in which violence might be used.  For that reason our voice should be heard throughout Britain and the North.  If <Col N="50" /> we could achieve this we would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the new radio centre in Donnybrook is well under way.  I trust that this will improve the reception in many areas where it is bad at the moment.  I see no reason why our television programmes should not be beamed into the North.  Any step to broadcast responsible programmes and attitudes would be welcomed by everyone concerned.  Getting to know one another is the important thing.  For that reason no effort should be spared to beam in our material and we have some very good material.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and some Senators had some very painful criticisms to make of our current affairs programmes.  They said they objected to the attitudes of some of the interviewers in pushing their own personal ideas and political beliefs down the throats of the people being interviewed. If that situation is developing, and if that matter has not been corrected, some action should be taken.  The authority should take note of what has been said by Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>Once again I would ask the Minister and the authority to use their good offices to ensure that the people who are out to disrupt the community do not get the coverage they got in the past.  The threat now is: &ldquo;If you do not do this, we will get the cameras here.&rdquo;  It seems that they can get the cameras.  It is frightening to think that irresponsible people can threaten responsible people with television cameras.  They say: &ldquo;We will expose you with the cameras.&rdquo;  There is nothing to expose, but once the camera appears at the gate the name of that person is tarnished to a degree, and quite an amount of erroneous information is circulated about him.  This television group have in no small way assisted these irresponsible elements to develop this type of threatening tactic. I hope that will be ended now that this view has been expressed on all sides of the House and in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I know he will do a good job <Col N="51" /> because he is a young active man.  I was surprised at one omission from his speech.  I am particularly interested in the setting up of Decca stations around the coast.  I am told that they come under the Minister's Department.  Up and down the coast the trawlermen have now installed the Decca system in their trawlers.</P>
      <P>Recently the Parliamentary Secretary made the point that these stations would be on the way shortly.  Perhaps the Minister was not aware that the Parliamentary Secretary said this. When he is replying I should like him to tell us how far this has gone, because there is no point in the fishermen undertaking this extra expenditure on the instalment of the Decca system if it is not to be a reality in the very near future.  I hope the Minister will take note of that because I am particularly interested in it, for obvious reasons.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that there are somewhere in the region of 14,000 people waiting for telephones.  It is a pity he did not break down the figure and tell us how many are waiting in each county, because there is a rumour to the effect that hardly anybody in West Limerick is waiting for a telephone. I do not know whether the Minister has heard that rumour but it is certainly flying around this House. The Minister should also tell us how long some of these people have been waiting.  Is it three years, four years or five years?  If it is, the Minister should not accept fresh applications.  He should say that he is not accepting any more applications because there is no hope of getting a telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People would respect that, because they are under the impression now that public men can do something extraordinary for them and get their names jacked up on the list, which is more or less a physical impossibility unless there are extraordinary circumstances attached to the case.  It is about time the Department gave a firm answer to those people and told them in no uncertain way: &ldquo;You will not get a telephone for three years.&rdquo;  Perhaps a lot depends on the locality they are living in, or perhaps there is a technical side with which I am not fully conversant.  I <Col N="52" /> should like the Minister to tell me how this list is made out and why they keep taking fresh applications and telling the applicants that they will get a telephone in the next financial year, when they know they will not get it in that financial year.</P>
    <P>I want to be a little parochial now and talk about my own county.  We just have one line from Dingle to Ballyferriter and back to Feoghanagh. When the telephone rings for one house it rings for every house.  There are three rings for one house, four rings for another, and five rings for another, so everyone knows the other person's business.  I think the Minister will agree that that is unacceptable in this day and age.  In our area, with the Gaeltacht colleges, and with the tourist development that has taken place, it is embarrassing in the summer months to have two rings for one house and three for another.  The whole thing is a bit strange in 1971.  Perhaps the Minister might make a special effort in my locality because the position is unsatisfactory at the moment and it is causing great concern, especially to the traders and the guesthouse owners.  When bookings are made other people know about them and confidential information is given to others.  In other words, there is phone tapping to a large degree in West Kerry at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was very glad that the Department of Finance announced last November before the Donegal by-election that a Gaeltacht radio station would be set up.  There are many questions to be answered.  In the papers today there is a statement from Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta that if it is not locally managed they will be far from happy about it.  The RTE Authority should run the radio but, at the same time, people from the locality where the station is to be located should have some say on the board, not necessarily to a large degree, and also some say in the programmes.</P>
    <P>By and large the RTE Authority is urbanised and this will be a rural programme. I do not think there is anybody from the Gaeltacht on the RTE Authority.  I am open to correction on that.  If I am wrong, I am wrong.  The Cearta Sibhialta people <Col N="53" /> who are doing good work for the Gaeltacht in Donegal, Kerry and Galway&mdash;and there is no point in saying they are not doing good work &mdash;should have a say in the running of this radio.  Perhaps a member of that group could be on the board which will probably be set up to run the Gaeltacht radio.  I am sure there will be a subcommittee of the RTE Authority and perhaps there could be somebody from the Gaeltacht co-opted on to that subcommittee. The people in the Gaeltacht areas should have a say as to the type of programmes which will be broadcast. This is a very welcome trend and I compliment the Minister on it.  I hope the stations will be in operation before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The provision of £250,000 for five stations is very small, representing £50,000 per station.  I do not know what the price of equipment is nowadays but the stations will be working on a very tight budget.  The Minister may have a special type of prefab building in mind and he may get the land cheap although usually when it is known that a State Department are involved the price of the land increases considerably.  I hope it will be possible to buy the land without the public being aware of the purpose for which it is being acquired.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make an extra allowance to sub-postoffices for the summer months.  In sub-postoffices in tourist areas in the summer months one sees long queues waiting to be served. This has happened in many areas in Kerry recently.  There were complaints from Killarney and Dingle.  Extra money should be allowed to subpostmasters in tourist areas for the provision of the extra staff needed for July, August, September and perhaps the end of June.  The Minister should seriously consider giving extra money to those sub-postmasters.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not critical of subpostmasters. They are doing an excellent job and are the subject of undue criticism in regard to something that is not entirely their fault.  If stamp machines were installed in tourist areas tourists would not have to go to the sub-postoffices for stamps.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> People imagine that tourists have a lot of time on hands but usually they are in a great hurry to get out of post offices.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with Telefís Éireann.  The only criticism I have is that there are not enough Irish programmes. A document was issued by Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Éireann some time ago to a number of TDs regarding Irish programmes.  Over 40 signed this document.  Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Éireann had a programme on every Saturday night before the News and it was a pity that RTE did not renew their contract.  I am not sure what the financial structure was but it certainly was a delightful programme.  It was refreshing to see Irish boys and girls singing and dancing.  I would ask the Minister to do what he can to see that more programmes of traditional Irish music and dancing are shown.</P>
    <P>I would not like people to think that Irish produced programmes should be the only programmes shown.  However, some time should be given every night to the Irish language, Irish music and culture.  We have to tolerate many programmes which were not filmed in Ireland.  In some cases people just switch off, because the films are not suited to their tastes.  Irish plays performed by Irish actors or English plays performed by Irish actors would have much more appeal for people in rural Ireland.  I do not know the tastes of the city people but as far as rural Ireland is concerned that type of programme is much more acceptable than are canned programmes.  The Minister should tell the RTE Authority that he would prefer to see more of those programmes.</P>
    <P>There should be a religious programme every week, whether it is the Mass or a Protestant service.  Recently I visited a hospital in Dublin on a Sunday morning when Mass was being televised.  I waited until Mass was over and afterwards one of the people I visited said to me that it was a pity he could not see Mass every Sunday.  A weekly religious programme would benefit people in hospital and also old age pensioners, whose numbers are increasing every year.  Most of them have now got a free television licence <Col N="55" /> and they would like to see Mass in their own homes.  It would not be too much trouble for RTE to televise Mass every Sunday as there is a radio broadcast of the Mass.</P>
    <P>I asked the previous Minister a question about a public telephone box in Ballinskelligs.  There is an Irish college there and now they are getting a factory.  The provision of a public telephone box is overdue in this area.  If there is a priority list as far as telephone boxes are concerned perhaps the Minister would give special consideration to Ballinskelligs.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to television reception in the Dingle Peninsula. There is no reception in some areas in this peninsula.  The dealer who is concerned in this states that there is no reception and there are black spots in parts of Dunquin, Ballyroe and Ballyknockane. He maintains that there are other areas where only intermittent reception is obtained.  This man has gone into great detail about this.  I will give his letter to the Minister.  Before colour television is introduced it is only right and proper that everybody in the State should be able to get black and white television reception.  The Minister might consider putting a booster station in the Dingle Peninsula because in some areas they get very poor reception. In fact, the load is so low that this dealer says he cannot understand why people bother to view television at all.  Dingle town is surrounded by a range of mountains and two peninsulas. The reception is not good.  Perhaps the Minister could have the whole of the Dingle Peninsula, from Tralee, outwards, examined and, perhaps, a booster station, which might not cost very much, would be the answer.  I have details here from the local dealer which I shall give to the Minister to pass on to the technical people later on.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy with Radio Telefís Éireann.  Some of the people there do not deserve the criticism they get at times.  They are performing a service. They are being paid to do a job, just like ourselves and if we are critical of any particular person on any programme we can be sure there are people up and down the country who do not like ourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrigidHoganOHiggins" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be tolerant. Whether they have long hair or short hair, Mrs. O'Higgins, we must say: &ldquo;That is their taste.&rdquo;  If people wish to present themselves in a certain way that is their business.  I hope those people do not take the remarks that are made in this House to heart and I am sure they do not.</P>
      <P>Finally, I appeal to the Minister to improve television reception in my locality, to put a telephone box in Ballinskelligs and to install the Decca system for which the fishermen have been waiting.  I am sure we will find when we go into the EEC that all foreign trawlers are equipped with this Decca system.  It could be an instrument which would save many lives. Perhaps if it had been installed along the coast the Greek ship which sank might have been communicated with. The Decca system is vital for fishermen especially if they go eight or nine miles off the coast.</P>
      <P>I would strongly urge the Minister to give that priority and to disregard the remarks of Deputies of this House about the personnel of Telefís Éireann. These people are only human beings. They are being paid to do a job and like ourselves they are trying to do the best they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Begley I should like to wish the Minister well in his onerous task.  He has the ability to at least display a courteous attitude.  I think he discovered a long time ago that a smile gets one further in this House than a scowl.  If some of the Ministers who sat where he is sitting had learned that lesson earlier they might still be Ministers of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled by part of the contents of Deputy Dowling's speech.  I regret he is not here because I do not like speaking about somebody when he is not present.  I will stay within the rules of order, but, with your permission, Sir, I should like to describe his statement that confidential information given to a member of the Labour Party was transmitted to somebody <Col N="57" /> before the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; money lending programme as entirely untrue.  I would be much stronger if the rules of the House would allow me.  It is typical of the stuff we hear from people like Deputy Dowling who apparently have no regard for either the characters of their opponents or, as some of their colleagues in the party have discovered, the characters of their colleagues either when it comes to a thing like this.  It is appalling that this sort of nonsense should be allowed in the House.  I protested to the Chair at the time and he said that, unfortunately, he could not do anything about it.  It was unfortunate he could do nothing about it. The only reason for raising a matter like this was to interfere with and blacken some Deputy of the Labour Party.  If Deputy Dowling had the information which he claimed he had, the least he should have done was name the person to whom he was referring.  He had not even got the decency to do that.  There is no feeling of guilt in this party.  We do not do things like that.  We do not stab people in the backs.  If somebody comes to us with a confidential complaint it is dealt with in the strictest confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling's reference to the fact that an inquiry was requested by the Labour Party is quite true.  I should like, though, to quote the whole of the comment which Deputy Desmond made at column 1570 of the Official Report, volume 242, No. 9, of 20th November, 1969, which Deputy Dowling was anxious to have on the record of the House.  I quote:</P>
    <P>I, too, gave notice of such questions both to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Justice.  I did this in view of the very serious implications contained in the Minister's statement which if true, mean either the integrity of the staff concerned is in question or they are unfit for their posts.  Alternatively, if the Minister's allegations are untrue, we should have his resignation in this House. I further asked the Taoiseach if the allegations made by the Minister for Justice were untrue.</P>
    <P>Subsequently the Minister for Justice was requested by the Taoiseach to tender his resignation and we can draw <Col N="58" /> our own conclusions.  I do not want to go any further with that.</P>
    <P>With regard to Radio Telefís Éireann it is rather unfortunate that we are not in the position to pour very much more money into our broadcasting system.  If we could do that we would, I am sure, have better programmes than those being produced across the channel where there is a tremendous amount of money being spent.  I am one of the people who have been referred to here as being lucky enough to be able to get four or five stations for the price of one licence.  I find myself spending most of my free time looking at Telefís Éireann.  That speaks for itself.  The standard of RTE programmes is really very high.  We get a lot of trash from the other stations.  We get trash from Telefís Éireann, too, occasionally.  I agree with one thing Deputy Dowling said&mdash;there is far too much violence shown.  They should stop showing the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis altogether because it is corrupting the children of the country to show violence like that.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann, by and large, try to give as good a cross section of the entertainment which they think the people of the country want as is possible. Their sports programmes are excellent.  A number of the programmes of general knowledge which they have been doing are enjoyed by young and old.  I, like some other speakers, think they do not give enough time to traditional Irish music.  I am unashamedly a fan, and I have always been, of Irish music and dancing.  They could do a lot more of this and it would be accepted as good viewing. Unfortunately, we have I suppose on the board of Radio Telefís Éireann, as in this House and elsewhere, people who feel that while one is proving himself a great Irishman by speaking Irish on every possible occasion one does not have to show any interest in Irish culture after that.  Irish dancing, Irish music and Irish games are just as important and more important in many cases than the Irish language.  I wish many people would realise that.  I hope Telefís Éireann will give more time to this type of programme.  If they do, there will not be many complaints. There are people who would <Col N="59" /> like to see the programme they like being shown all the time.  Some of my neighbours with small children would look all the time at cartoons.  I have other neighbours whose teenage sons and daughters cannot understand why there is not pop music all the time. Those of us who are older can see that people are entitled to balanced viewing. That is all we ask.</P>
    <P>Newscasting is usually good.  One thing irritates me and it is if I get the news headlines at 7.30 in the morning, the news in full at eight o'clock, again at nine and right through the day hear the same piece of news repeated again and again, even though that piece of news would be of very little interest to most people.  I am only expressing a personal opinion now. Also, in regard to the preference that is given to foreign news, I believe that many people would prefer to be told about something that had happened here at home rather than to listen to a detailed report on, perhaps, some discussions which took place between two African chiefs or something that was said by an American Senator.  While these matters may be of great importance in the countries concerned, they are usually of very little importance to us.  Again, I am expressing a personal opinion but I think that a brief reference to such matters would be sufficient. I must say at this point that our news readers are excellent.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the cost of television licences and the question has been raised as to whether the cost is too high or too low.  However, it is ridiculous for anybody in this House to quote&mdash;as Deputy Dowling attempted to do&mdash;from something that was said in the other House on this matter.  There are enough representatives there of all parties to deal with the problem.  We have enough problems of our own here.  Those people in certain parts of the country who can get only poor reception have cause for complaint, but I do not think that those in areas where reception is good, even if it be from our own station only, have any cause for complaint. There are places in which several stations can be received quite easily, but <Col N="60" /> I am sure if the people in those areas were asked to pay more they would complain, because they relate the licence fee to RTE and not to the other stations, and rightly so.  There are a number of areas in the country where, apparently, there is interference from the Irish station on some other stations.  At one time some people thought that this was being done deliberately.  I do not think it is, but it should be prevented.</P>
    <P>Even if it would cost more money, an attempt should be made to beam the Irish television and radio programmes across the Border.  What is the point in talking about what we would like to see done in the North or about talking about our way of life if we cannot put these facts to the people in their homes?  Radio and television provide us with the opportunity of doing this and I do not believe that many people would complain about any expenditure on this.  Of course, I do not mean that we should make any attempt at brainwashing because that could not be done.  Because of actions both north and south of the Border there is sometimes grave reason for doubt as to the civilisation of some people.  However, in the main, we are a civilised race and it would be of help if our programmes could be beamed across the Border in such a way as would ensure good reception for those who wished to know of our way of life. Somebody mentioned here that Mr. Paisley won his election because of the publicity he got on RTE.  Of course, that is nonsense, because Telefís Éireann programmes cannot be received much further north than Dundalk. Therefore, there is no point in anyone speaking that sort of nonsense.</P>
    <P>We could have more discussions on Telefís Éireann.  I do not mean one-sided discussions.  I regret that the political discussions which were featured over a number of years have been dropped.  It is my personal opinion that one person from a political party can do much better on a television programme against two or three from the other side.  During the years we have heard politicians from the same party contradict each other in an attempt to score their own petty points whereas one <Col N="61" /> person can keep the one line.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might endeavour to have such discussions again on television as we had on a one, one, one basis.  Current affairs should be discussed on these programmes because there are people who believe that politicians talk a peculiar type of language in the House&mdash;a language that is not generally understood.  Maybe we, ourselves, have created that myth, so I would suggest that important matters are discussed on television at the time they are happening.  I agree entirely with those Deputies, including Deputy Dowling, when they say that there is a tendency on the part of Telefís Éireann to pick on something hardly worth talking about, to blow it up to a matter of major importance and attempt to create dialogue on it. This should not happen.  All of us are mature enough to discuss matters which are of importance to the country.</P>
    <P>The question of Common Market entry is one which could not be over-discussed on television.  The Government must be prepared to tell the country both the good and the bad points of membership and Telefís Éireann is the medium by which they should do this.  They should not be afraid to meet representatives of the other parties and answer any questions they might be asked.</P>
    <P>It would appear that some people forget there are still many people who use radio.  There are many people who still prefer a radio in their home and there are also those who cannot yet afford to have television or who may have no electricity supply.  There are also others, like myself, who travel a lot, particularly at night, and who listen often to radio.  To get back to the question of licence fees, I would advocate the abolition of additional radio licences for various types of radios.  If a person holds a receiving licence, that licence should cover whatever type of apparatus he may have.  I believe that the law in relation to licences for radios for motor cars is honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  In any case, most people who have a radio in their car hold a licence for a radio or a television in their homes.</P>
    <P>I would agree that those people who <Col N="62" /> do not hold a licence for either their radio or television set should not be allowed go free.  The tendency to give them what might be described as a humorous warning only gives them the idea that they are like the poacher of long ago who considered that he was doing something that was funny. What they are doing, in fact, is preventing people who are prepared to pay for the service from getting a licence at a reasonable cost because, if television and radio licences have to be increased, the blame must rest on those thousands upon thousands who have never taken out a licence in their lives. I have great sympathy with those who cannot afford to do so, but the old age pensioners do not have to worry about radio licences and neither do the blind. There are, however, thousands who think it is funny not to take out a licence.  They should not be allowed to get away with this.</P>
    <P>A greater effort should be made to encourage piped television.  The hundreds of aerials that one sees in every village, town and city do nothing to improve the landscape.  Something should be done.  The firms involved in the manufacture or sale of television sets should offer a prize to anyone who creates a small aerial.  I believe it will come; I believe the day will come when an aerial no bigger than one's finger will be produced.  An effort should be made to produce it quickly. In the meantime piped television should be allowed to take as many stations as possible into as many homes as possible.</P>
    <P>UTV do an excellent job with Irish music and dancing and the Irish programmes they produce are a credit to the station.  We might do worse than follow their example in RTE.</P>
    <P>I have a number of thorny queries I should like to put to the Minister.  I have a letter here from a gentleman who tells me he had 44½ years service with the Post Office and he wants to know if the Minister will talk to the Minister for Finance about getting something done to improve the pensions of those who retired from the Post Office some years ago and who are trying to exist on very small pensions. This is a fair query.  Someone <Col N="63" /> who has given that length of service should be entitled to more than a few paltry shillings.  Had this man been born 20 years later he would probably have twice the pension he is getting now.</P>
    <P>The gratuity paid to auxiliary part-time postmen is an improvement. Credit where credit is due: it is an improvement on the days when they got nothing at all.  Nevertheless an effort should be made to give these people a pension.  It is too bad that they should have to depend on whatever old age pension they get and the charity of their children, or of their neighbours, as sometimes happens.</P>
    <P>The Post Office Workers Union has negotiated with the Department and relations are reasonably good.  I do not want to cut across anything they are doing.  There is, however, one anachronism to which I should like to refer.  The man who is appointed to the smaller post gets the lowest rate and he works for a number of years before he gets the full rate.  Even then his wages are low and as soon as he gets an offer of a better job he moves out. It is extremely difficult to get anybody to replace him because no one wants to start at such a very low wage.  There are areas where ladies sometimes act as postwomen for a while, get fed up and chuck the job.  Children just out of school do it for a while and give it up. An effort should be made to make the job a decent one.  It should be motorised if necessary to ensure that it is done properly.  A decent basic wage is the first requirement.  Apart from the fact that it is an onerous job it is also very hard on people awaiting the delivery of their mail.  Sometimes the mail is incorrectly delivered because the postman does not know the area. It is, perhaps, a minor matter, but it is something in which the Post Office might take more interest.</P>
    <P>I raised a matter here a couple of years ago and it was just left hanging. To show how important it is I have again been requested to raise it.  It is a matter relating to Sligo post office. About two years ago a district justice tried a member of the post office staff who had stolen some postal packets <Col N="64" /> and he made a statement which, I think, should never have been made. Justice Barry said that he could do no more than record a conviction against the defendant and he suspended the sentence on condition that the defendant kept the peace for a period of two years.  He also said that he was giving warning that, in the event of his finding anything wrong in the post office in future, he would send the staff to jail.  Can anybody imagine the sheer audacity of a district justice warning decent people, simply because there happened to be one thief, that he would send them to jail?  This should have been taken up by the Post Office authorities at the time and I have now been asked to raise it again because the staff regard Justice Barry's remarks as a grave reflection on their integrity and to the general public the statement seems to imply that dishonesty is rife in Sligo post office.  The allegations were unjust and unwarranted and an abuse of the high office he holds.  The justice should be told that, because one person in an office is dishonest, that is no reason for him to make allegations against decent, hardworking staff like the staff in Sligo post office.</P>
    <P>Loughrea telephone exchange is pretty close to Tynagh and, because of the activities there, trunk and local calls have increased considerably.  Plans were on hands some time ago to rectify the very bad telephone service there, but local people claim it is the telephonists who are at fault.  What can one do when ten times the volume of phone calls come through than the system is able to handle?  There are very limited facilities in the office and complaints have been made of delays of over an hour.  Now, it is quite possible that arrangements may be made eventually for having automatic working there but until that happens I would ask the Minister to have some temporary arrangement made which will allow these people to discharge their duties better than they can at present.  It is no fault of the telephonists.  With industries such as you have there and with the tourist pressures on the telephone system maybe the Minister might consider routing the calls to that area through some other exchange, if that would be possible.  Take them away <Col N="65" /> from Galway anyway.  If this could be done it could relieve the pressure.  It is bad now but what it is likely to be in summer when all the tourists will be using the lines is hard to imagine. Some effort should be made to deal with this matter before that time comes.</P>
    <P>The five-day week for postmen has been put into operation in some places. Last year I raised the question of the abolition of Saturday deliveries and some progress has been made since then.  The Minister said at the time that this was being done.  Postmen must be the most patient body of workers in the country because in relation to their numbers and the manner in which they are spread over every town and village they have just been left there.  Everybody else is important but it appears that they are not.  There are people who say there should not be a five-day week for postal services but the extraordinary thing is that most of the clamour comes from people who themselves have a five-day week.  I have no sympathy with people like that who have their Saturday off but feel that postmen should not have it off.  The postmen have shown a sense of responsibility but the Department should not take advantage of that and leave them without doing something about it.  I hope that this year we will see the end of this problem in regard to the five-day week.</P>
    <P>I read recently that a firm of consultants were carrying out some kind of Gallup poll in relation to Saturday deliveries but I can tell the Minister, without any poll, that the public, apart from the few I have mentioned, would be prepared to do without Saturday deliveries.  Most of us would be glad if we did not get any letters on Saturday. The postmen, who seldom work off their impatience by doing anything out of the way, should get the Saturday off concession which they so richly deserve as a measure of relief for their neverending and irregular morning duties.</P>
    <P>Another thing which could possibly solve this problem is a different plan for posting arrangements.  Perhaps the Minister could get in touch with his colleagues about this.  It seems to be a must in most business places from which a lot of correspondence goes out <Col N="66" /> that all the letters should be held until 5 o'clock in the evening and all posted at the one time.  Very often half of the correspondence could be posted at lunch time.  Worse than that, there seems to be the idea that the proper time to post the greatest volume of correspondence is on a Thursday evening or a Friday evening.  I do not know why this is so, and a campaign should be started to try to have the posting of letters and parcels done at irregular times during the day.  If at all possible some should be posted before lunch.  If this were done it would lead to smoother sorting and a faster and more accurate delivery service.  Thursday could be used instead of Friday for posting a lot of correspondence in Departments in which they have got into the habit of working late on Fridays.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also get in touch with the Minister for Social Welfare in regard to issuing money at week-ends and try to have these letters sent out on Thursdays because this causes one of the greatest hold-ups.  These must be sorted and must be delivered and why not send them out on Thursdays? Friday is now the general shopping day and recipients of this money would be only too glad to have it a day earlier.  Some planning in this direction would do a lot of good.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been raised here, not alone during the life-time of this Government but back down the years&mdash;and every time the matter is raised we are told the solution is just around the corner&mdash;is in regard to the civil rights of postal workers.  A man who climbs an ESB pole is entitled to belong to a political party and to express his political views but a man who climbs a telephone pole is not; the man who delivers letters is not entitled to belong to a political party.  Post Office staff are debarred from being members of political parties. They cannot stand for election and if they do succeed in standing for election, as some of my colleagues have learned, they are told, and the Minister is aware of this, that they must resign or become independents; they must leave the political party.  Of course, some of them do not and the people <Col N="67" /> concerned are sensible enough not to take any action against them.</P>
    <P>We appreciate this, but is there any reason why a teacher who is dealing directly with the minds of grown up children can not alone be a politician but can stand for this House while a postman cannot?  Where does the catch come in?  I do not suggest that senior officials who might be dealing with confidential documents in the Minister's Department should be entirely free although some people believe that they should be.  If I had my way I would give free rights to all of them because I am aware of senior officials in other Departments who apparently find no difficulty in being politicians, or at least they speak at election meetings even if they do not use their own names, from time to time.  The Minister should at least extend this right to the Post Office staff.  It has been granted to a similar type of worker all over the world.  If there is some reason of which the Minister is aware why they should not be allowed this civil right he should let us know.  God knows we have been talking about this for long enough in this House and outside it and it is about time it was brought to a head.  I am not blaming the Government completely because we had a Government some years ago which we supported and they definitely should have done something about this but they did not.  I can assure the Minister that if he does not do it it will be done the next time.</P>
    <P>I read recently in a union journal about the setting up of local consultative councils to which the Minister has referred.  These seem to embody new grievance procedures and an easing up of old disciplinary measures.  I should like to compliment the Minister and his Department on this fresh approach to the matter.  There seems to be imaginative developments in it and it will be a great help in improving relationships which badly need improving in many cases.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the ordinary worker on the floor should have a direct approach to his immediate superior officer.  There is a danger that the immediate superior officer, <Col N="68" /> busy with pressing administrative problems, may get divorced from the aspirations and legitimate grievances of rank and file workers.  The setting up of these councils should at least ensure that they are tuned in on how the workers think and how the workers believe improvements can be effected. It is generally recognised that nothing is lost by listening to the workers' views, and even if they are not acted upon, they very often make points which would otherwise be lost or over-looked. I honestly believe if they were listened to more often there would be less industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>I had an experience, which I hope to refer to during Private Members' Time, recently when attempting to negotiate with the representative of a semi-State body, who was the rudest individual I have ever met.  The biggest objection he had to negotiating with me was the fact that he read the Dáil Debates.  I told him he reminded me of the William Martin Murphy type of negotiator and this apparently gave him the right to be rude not only to me but to my colleagues as well.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this is true in the Post Office or that it is generally accepted in the country but there is a danger that those who get up to a certain level in the hierarchy of a particular government Department or local authority feel they are superior to those lower down the line.  It boosts their ego to try to belittle and bemean those at a lower level.</P>
    <P>The Minister's idea will be a good start if it is done properly.  I hope the people on whose lot it will fall to work the new machinery will not carry on as if they were in their old entrenched positions because this would bring about a situation in which the cure is worse than the disease.  This is the real danger.  There is no point in saying: &ldquo;We will talk to you&rdquo; if the attitude which this &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; adopted is accepted.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to take a personal interest in the running of these councils.  He should ensure that the councils are made work.  Local supervising officers should clearly understand the stated intentions <Col N="69" /> of those who drew up the scheme.  If this development works satisfactorily the Minister may have started something which could very easily be copied in industry and help to bring about peace in the very difficult situation we find ourselves in at the present time. Perhaps the Minister will tell the House when it is proposed to introduce these councils in all areas.  Certainly, that information would be of considerable assistance to us.</P>
    <P>Can anything be done to help staff about income tax payments in respect of unforeseen overtime in particular? Overtime has to be worked in the Post Office at Christmas and other pressure periods.  In many cases the result is in the following year when overtime may be less and family circumstances may be more difficult, the staff find themselves having to meet large bills with reduced earnings.  I am sure the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners should be able to devise some scheme which would help to reduce the difficulty. I can never understand why PAYE does not apply to Government Departments.  There may be a reason for it, but I do not know what it is. Because of the system which is operated at present the unfortunate official who drew overtime will find, even though he is on the basic rate, that he has been stopped for last year and it is gone with the wind.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister might look at the question of union representatives participating in deliberations on international postal bodies.  Recognition for the postal trade union movement is being sought by the International Postal Trade Union movement and it cannot be denied that personal experience must have a very big contribution to make.  I gather from reading postal journals that such a move is being opposed by some postal administrators, including our own.  In view of the fact that we hear so much about joint consulation and worker/employer relationships and so much newspaper space, television and parliamentary time are taken up discussing these matters it is almost unbelievable that Ireland, where we hear so much about freedom, lines <Col N="70" /> up with administrations opposed to such a development.  I notice the West Germans support the proposal, which is certainly food for thought.  If the Germans with their supposed rigidity and discipline are democratic enough to accede to joint consultation of this type, surely the Irish postal administration will lose nothing and gain much by harnessing the talents not alone of the administrators but also of the workers and their representatives as well.  I beg the Minister to give full consideration to the suggestion.  It may be a little out of the way, but he is a young man with ideas and if he looks into it he will find there is a great deal to be said for it.  It would be an excellent example to set.</P>
    <P>The introduction of standard time has created many problems for postmen. Streets are poorly lit and they have not been provided with the proper types of lamps for this work.  Has the Department given consideration to the provision of suitable lamps or could a later schedule of deliveries be arranged for postal deliveries in the winter?  If, of course, we are going back to Greenwich mean time, some of the problems will be solved but letters will still have to be delivered in the dark.  In view of the difficulties created by standard time if the Department allowed postmen to come in later in the winter, that part of the problem would be solved.  I see no need for postmen to have to struggle with bundles of letters and string in dark, wet, wintry mornings.  The extra hour would make some difference.  Would the Minister at least ensure that a proper type of lamp is issued so that they can see where they are going?  An argument in favour of starting the first delivery a little later is the fact that offices and shops are not opened very early.</P>
    <P>In new housing schemes it is considered to be the in thing to have the letter box at the bottom of the door.  I wonder how a designer's back would stand up to the strain of having to stoop down to 400 or 500 letter boxes in order to put letters in them?  In addition, there do not appear to be any regulations with regard to sharp edges. It is not unusual for a postman to put <Col N="71" /> his hand in a letter box and on taking it out find he has left a portion of his finger inside it.</P>
    <P>In Britain the Minister responsible for post offices took the matter in hand and he travelled around with a postman on his city delivery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That gives the Minister a head start on the Minister in Britain.  However, when he discovered the shortcomings he rectified them as soon as he could.  With the Minister's experience he should certainly know what I am talking about.  The Minister should make a recommendation to the Minister for Local Government that a special type of letter box be devised which should be placed high enough to enable the postman to deliver letters without having to stoop down to put letters in.  This would take some strain off his already overstrained back.  This may be a very simple matter, but I think the Minister appreciates the point.  I would ask the Minister to do something about it, now that it has been brought to his notice so forcibly.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, bearing in mind the necessity of striking a balance between its rights and the need to safeguard the commercial freedom of semi-State bodies, requests that a permanent Dáil Committee, representative of all Parties, should be established for the purpose of examining and reporting on the activities of these bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are few points I wish to speak on, except to ask the Minister if he will seriously consider <Col N="72" /> this question of a Committee of the Dáil to examine the question of semi-State bodies.  It is of importance in the public interest that we should know what the stated management objectives of these companies are.  Every company should have a stated management objective.  We do not know what the stated management objectives of many of these semi-State bodies are.  They might be incompatible with the national interest and also they could be such as to eliminate competition.  We would also like to know how money is spent by these companies in the fulfilment of these stated management objectives. CIE are engaged in the transport business as are Aer Lingus and the B &amp; I company.  There might be duplication of work by these three bodies engaged in transport.  The objectives of one might conflict with the objectives of another.  Another example of this duplication could arise where the fertiliser policy of the Sugar Company might not be compatible with that of Nítrigin Éireann.  It would be important for the future programme of development and co-ordination of these companies that we should know this. The public, as shareholders, are entitled to this information.  I can accept the fact that we have two types of State-sponsored bodies&mdash;those engaged in State monopoly and those in commercial competition.  We, in the Labour Party, appreciate that there might be secret information about the commercial processes employed by Erin Foods which should not be made known to those in the private enterprise field.  It would not be in the public interest that such information should be made available.  It would not be in the interest of the particular State-sponsored body such as Erin Foods if they were in competition with Batchelor's Foods to disclose such information to a Select Committee of the Dáil.  The information might appear the following day in the newspapers.  We would have to have common sense and to know that secret information about commercial companies would not be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a large amount of money is involved in State monopolies, such as CIE, we think that the taxpayer is entitled to information.  There is no <Col N="73" /> doubt but that in some companies there is wasteful expenditure.  How can we justify the opening of a CIE office in Los Angeles?  The people in CIE are not responsible to anyone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How can any Minister for Finance imagine that a CIE office in Los Angeles would bring in many tourists?  If there was public accountability for companies such as this we would not have an office in Los Angeles.  We would be more realistic and would cut our cloth according to our measure.  As long as a company like CIE are permitted to spend money as lavishly as they do, this alone justifies the approval of this motion of the Labour Party.  There should be an account of the CIE operation and the spending spree on which they are engaged every year with the public's money.  The realisation by them that there is no accountability is not helpful.  I know of an instance where machines were actually ploughed into the ground and cemented over in the CIE works at Inchi-core. The Minister for Finance would agree that there is no accountability there.  Where there is a possibility that money is being misspent&mdash;and we have not got this money to spare or to throw into a company which shows no real regard for its responsibility&mdash;there should be accountability.</P>
      <P>I have instanced cases of CIE mismanagement and wastage of money before.  It is a great pity that there is not public accountability for such wastage. I wish to refer briefly to Irish Steel Holdings Limited where there is another glaring example of things going wrong and where an accountant resigned because he was dissatisfied with the way in which the company was being run.  This man proved his point.  This is another case in which there is not public accountability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether he left or not I felt he was dissatisfied.  When we <Col N="75" /> brought forward this motion on behalf of the Labour Party we were not denigrating semi-State bodies.  We were far from that.  We believe that where it is in the public interest we should have this, where possible, and more and more of it.  We do not, of course, accept that you can set up a State body and have it completely outside the realm of accountability to the public or to the Houses of Parliament. This would be wrong and would be contrary to all concepts of what socialism is.  The whole idea is that these bodies be set up where the public interest would be better served by so doing.  I must pay tribute to Bord na Móna for what it has done.  As a semi-State body it has done an enormous amount of work and certainly we have to feel proud of its achievement over the years.  Deputy Tully represents the workers employed, but I say that as a semi-State body its achievement is remarkable.  Who would have thought it would have had the success it has had?  I have quite a regard for the ESB.  I will never say a word against the ESB because it has recognised the social need, and this is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not think that the directors of these companies should have anything to hide and I do not think they would want to be completely unaccountable to anyone, and, therefore, I do not think we should have a vote on this matter.  When I mentioned this in a Dáil question to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, he did say they would consider it and I think the present Taoiseach said it was being considered. No matter what Government is in office the setting up of this committee should be seriously considered.  This would eliminate suspicion about these companies.  It would, perhaps, enable them to operate a little more efficiently. There is no question whatever of interfering with the day-to-day activities of these companies.  I do not think this was intended in this motion, because if there was such interference it would do more harm than good.  If they were accountable to some committee the element of competition would enter into it.  There would be more incentive to <Col N="76" /> direct their operations towards their targets.  It would eliminate this sluggish attitude which may be prevalent in a few of them.</P>
    <P>I know we get reports from some of these semi-State bodies.  However, I have seen a list of such companies and I must confess I have heard nothing about them.  I do not know whether Tea Importers Limited is still in operation. There are a few of these bodies about which we know nothing, how they operate or anything else.  I would like to know exactly what their purpose is, why they were established, what they are doing at the moment, and what money they receive.  If there was a committee such as we have suggested more up-to-date information might be available on such bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of establishing a Parliamentary committee to examine and report on the activities of our State-sponsored bodies&mdash;or our community-owned enterprises as they sometimes like to be called and not without reason, I think&mdash;has been under active consideration by the Government for some considerable time.  Having regard to the growing importance of these bodies and the amount of State money invested in them, which is now very considerable, the Government recognise that some form of Parliamentary review of their activities other than we have at present may well be desirable.</P>
      <P>There are, in all, more than 30 State-sponsored bodies engaged in commercial activities, and there are as many more again of a promotional or developmental nature.  I take it that in discussing the question of Parliamentary review our interest is mainly in the commercial bodies.  One of the difficulties in devising suitable arrangements for a review of the activities of State-sponsored bodies is the need to ensure that the managements of these bodies are not deprived of the initiative and flexibility which is essential to any successful undertaking.  Indeed, the terms of the motion before the House at present acknowledge the importance of protecting the commercial freedom of our State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> A major consideration in the setting up of these commercial State-sponsored bodies as independent units was the need to ensure that they would have the necessary freedom of action in their day-to-day affairs to enable them to operate efficiently.  Therefore, any undue scrutiny of their affairs by the Oireachtas would clearly negative this benefit.  There is a further difficulty to be considered and that is that Ministers have certain responsibilities imposed on them by statute in relation to the control of some of these bodies, and in that regard the Ministers concerned are accountable to the Oireachtas. It would be essential in setting up the kind of committee envisaged in this motion to ensure that the work of such a committee in reviewing the activities of State-sponsored bodies should not trespass on the statutory Ministerial responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have to change the law to do that and this is the point to which I am trying to draw attention.  What is envisaged is a committee to deal with a lot of these bodies together.  If we were going to change the law on this we would have to take each one by itself and consider on its merits whether this should be done, and I think we would come to the conclusion in almost every case that we would not change the law in that regard, that is, the accountability of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I think, fair to say that Deputies are kept reasonably well informed in regard to the activities of our State-sponsored bodies, although I freely acknowledge that from time to time there have been protests from individual Deputies who felt that this was not so.  Under our present arrangements Deputies are provided with information <Col N="78" /> principally in four different ways: first, the annual report of the particular State-sponsored body which is laid before the House; secondly, in the course of the annual Parliamentary debate on the departmental estimate which provides funds for individual bodies; thirdly, through the Parliamentary question; and, fourthly, when amending legislation is brought before the House from time to time.</P>
    <P>The State-sponsored bodies are encouraged to include as much detail as possible in their annual reports and accounts and I think it will be acknowledged that in this respect they measure up to the best standards in the private sector.  Where funds are being voted for a paritcular State-sponsored body, there is ample opportunity for Parliamentary debate on the affairs of the body concerned.  The Minister directly concerned usually gives a full account of the policy objectives and the programme of the particular body and, at the end of the debate, he answers specific queries raised by Deputies in the course of the debate.  The Parliamentary question is, of course, a further means available to Deputies for procuring information apart from purely day-to-day matters of routine administration.  In giving replies, Ministers have to ensure that these semi-State bodies are not subjected to such a degree of Parliamentary scrutiny as would undermine their ability to operate in the commercial world.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear enough from the terms of this motion, and the debate, that Deputies on all sides of the House are very conscious of this necessity of not depriving these bodies, which are operating in a commercial field, of the necessary freedom to operate in that field.  There are, of course, some people &mdash;they are becoming fewer in number as time goes on&mdash;who, as a matter of ideological conviction, are opposed to such bodies, or feel that where they exist, all of their activities, no matter what they are, should be open to full public scrutiny.  I think that most people, and certainly most Deputies, recognise that this is not possible if we are to have any community-owned enterprises engaged in commercial activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> However, I was dealing with the position as it is at present, and reviewing the opportunities that are available for review of the work of these bodies.  One of the matters I mentioned is that from time to time legislation dealing with these bodies comes before the House.  The normal practice, where money is provided by the Exchequer for the activities of these bodies, is to have an authorisation by statute for an amount which would normally cover their activities for a period of about three years.  This ensures that periodically new legislation has to be brought in dealing with the particular State body, thereby providing a full opportunity for both Houses of the Oireachtas to debate and review the general policy and activities of the particular State body.</P>
    <P>In reply to recent Parliamentary questions on the subject of bringing the activities of State-sponsored bodies under review by a Parliamentary committee, the Taoiseach stated that the position is being re-examined in the light of the recommendations in relation to these bodies in the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group, or the Devlin Report as it is commonly known.  While that report is mainly concerned with the restructuring of the Public Service, and an examination of Oireachtas functions was outside its terms of reference, the general recommendations contained in it in relation to State-sponsored bodies are relevant to the question of Parliamentary review.</P>
    <P>The recommendations envisage, first, that the non-commercial bodies will become units of Civil Service Departments under the title of executive agencies while still maintaining their traditional structures and, secondly, that so far as organisation is concerned, the commercial bodies will retain their present position but will operate as far as possible to commercial standards with clearly defined goals, and will be recouped by the State for any losses arising from activities of a social as distinct from a commercial character.</P>
    <P>It would appear that, if these recommendations are implemented, the non-commercial <Col N="80" /> bodies at least would probably come under closer scrutiny by the Oireachtas as part of the executive units of Departments.  These bodies would, presumably, be included in the annual departmental reports which, it is recommended, should be submitted to the Oireachtas.  As regards the commercial bodies, it would seem that the implementation of the recommendations in the Devlin Report would not significantly affect their present position so far as Parliamentary control is concerned.  However, the annual departmental reports which I have mentioned might possibly contain some data in relation to the activities of these bodies&mdash;that is, the commercial ones&mdash; and, to this extent, they might become subject to closer Parliamentary scrutiny than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The recommendations I have referred to are related, of course, to the basic recommendation in the Devlin Report that the Public Service be divided into aireachtaí responsible for policy, and agencies responsible for the execution of policy.  Until such time as decisions have been taken on this basic recommendation and its implications for State bodies have been fully assessed, I consider that it would be inappropriate to set up a Dáil Committee to review the affairs of State-sponsored bodies.  It is clear that the decisions on the Devlin recommendation might have a very important bearing on the form and the content of any Parliamentary review machinery that might be introduced.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may recall that in November, 1964, the Committee of Public Accounts, in the course of its report, referred to the substantial sum of voted moneys paid to State-sponsored bodies, and to the absence of any provision in the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann for referring the accounts of these bodies to the committee for examination and subsequent report to the Dáil.  The committee suggested that, as a first step, provision might be made for the reference to it of the audited accounts of bodies that receive subventions from voted moneys.  In subsequent reports the committee has referred again to this matter.  Its suggestion has been considered in detail and the general conclusion has been that, <Col N="81" /> if it is decided in principle to introduce a system of Parliamentary review, it would be better to devise an arrangement that would be of wider scope than that proposed by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>However, as I have already said, the whole position must now be reassessed in the light of the recommendations for the reorganisation of the Public Service.  As I have indicated, these recommendations are basic to the way we would approach any Parliamentatry review of the activities of the State-sponsored bodies.  A detailed examination of these recommendations is going on at present, and I would hope that the Government would be in a position to make decisions on these basic recommendations in the Devlin Report in the fairly near future, and then the other question of how the Parliamentary review of State-sponsored bodies might best be effected could be tackled, and I think in a more realistic way than at present, because the matter is somewhat up in the air until we know what line has been taken on the Devlin Report.  So, this is very important in any consideration of this motion.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I think it is not inappropriate I should refer to, that is that we have at present some experience of the operation of a committee of this House in circumstances other than its traditional mode of operation.  I am, of course, referring to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

It would also be unrealistic, I think, not to recognise that there may be some people whose views on the necessity and the desirability of Parliamentary review of State-sponsored bodies might be somewhat tempered by their experience of what is happening at the moment, at least <Col N="82" /> to the extent of wanting to be quite sure of the kind of safeguards which it would be necessary to build in in any review of this nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a Parliamentary inquiry into the operation of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's point is that the present procedure should not be regarded as the norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Deputy, that is a help.  I think the Deputy has put the other side of the coin but it is the same coin.  If the present procedures of the Committee of Public Accounts were to be regarded as the norm then I think many people who have been enthusiastic about the idea of stricter Parliamentary control of State-sponsored bodies would not be nearly so enthusiastic.  I say that should not be the norm and need not be the norm.  I think it would have been unrealistic of me not to make this reference but, having said it, I want to make it clear that in the light of consideration going on in regard to the Devlin Report and other matters I have mentioned I have to ask the House to reject the present motion. I hope, however, I have made it clear that in asking the House to reject the motion I am not dismissing the possibility that when decisions have been taken on the main recommendations in the Devlin Report we may be able to devise some suitable form of Parliamentary review of the activities of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion.  I can appreciate the Minister's concern at the moment but I <Col N="85" /> would refer him to the terms of the motion, which is very carefully and reasonably worded.  It stresses the need to safeguard the commercial freedom of semi-State bodies and requests that the Dáil, who represent the people and who provide the finance for those semi-State bodies, should set up a committee to inquire into their activities. If the motion is considered in that light and with that intent hanging over it I do not see how anybody could find it unacceptable.</P>
      <P>It is a most reasonably framed motion and does not give rise to any ideological difficulty.  The Minister made a lot of play with the Devlin Report and said that until decisions are taken on the recommendations of this report it would be unrealistic to go ahead with anything of this nature.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Minister that we will hear the Devlin Report mentioned many times in the future as a reason for doing nothing.  I cannot see that there would be any conflict between what this motion proposes and steps that would ultimately be taken on foot of the Devlin Report or, indeed, any steps that might be taken by way of review of Parliamentary procedure. The Minister mentioned this aspect, too, as being another reason for deferring the action requested by this motion.  I cannot see that the motion as framed could not be investigated further, adopted and a suitable body set up, a body that would not frighten any of the whiz kids in our semi-State bodies, a body that would have as its guiding spirit the idea of being in co-operation with these bodies rather than being a watchdog.  Granted there must be an element of the latter but it would, I would hope, be a minor element in the activities of any such body that might be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems an extraordinary thing and I know it is something that causes puzzlement and concern to many people outside parliament that these semi-State bodies, financed in the main by public moneys and very often performing a monopoly service to the community, are not subject to review in the full light of publicity.  Many people are concerned and puzzled as to why this should be so.  They cannot <Col N="86" /> understand why these bodies should have this great power which they have and this control over so much public money and yet be so little subject to review by the parliament that provides this money.  If parliament is to reflect the wishes of the people the Government should accept this motion.  It would be a reassurance to the public at large that this House and the Government are concerned as to how public money is spent.</P>
    <P>It is an arid answer to say that the idea is good but we must wait until we have the Devlin Report considered, until the question of Parliamentary reform is considered.  That is begging the question.  The need for the review is acknowledged and once the need is acknowledged all that is wanted to put it into action is energy.  I would suggest that the Government should show the energy necessary to establish the review body asked by this motion. It would satisfy public demand, it would reassure the public at large and it is only proper that this House which provides the money as trustees to the people should be represented in overseeing expenditure of that money.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important, too, when we regard the widespread commercial and social ramifications of these semi-State bodies.  They have proliferated over the last ten or 15 years and their activities impinge on all sections of the community and in all parts of the land.  The Minister mentioned a number of ways in which parliament can exercise control and keep an eye on these bodies.  It is wrong to say that any of these ways allows parliament to exercise control.  All that these methods which the Minister mentioned can do, as far as parliament is concerned, is to enable parliament to get some idea of the workings of these bodies without being in any way able to influence their workings.  He mentioned that on the Estimate of a particular Department responsible for the semi-State body there can be some review in that regard but the reality of the situation is that a Deputy comes in and he makes a speech concerning the Minister's Department and touches on the semi-State body which comes under that Department. It is, unfortunately, so many <Col N="87" /> words in the wind.  This House is too remote from the semi-State body for the remarks made here by the ordinary rank and file Deputy to have any effect on the semi-State body and on some of the mandarins in charge of some of the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary question which can be a good weapon of review is too often blunted by the Minister's reply: &ldquo;I cannot give this information.  It would interfere with the commercial integrity of the semi-State body and it would interfere with its day-to-day running&rdquo;.  If the Parliamentary question were allowed to be used in the sense that a full answer would be given to all questions touching semi-State bodies it would represent a very valuable weapon in the hands of parliament for reviewing the activities of these bodies but it is a weapon that is very blunted because of the attitude of the Government towards these questions.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, too, amending legislation.  Again, this is something that crops up only infrequently. We did have an example here lately when the Minister for Transport and Power had to ask for a further subvention for CIE.  That gave an opportunity to debate CIE but it was no different from a debate on the Estimate and again when there is no direct link between parliament and the semi-State body the views expressed here are too remote to have any practical effect on the workings or on the personnel operating in that semi-State body.</P>
    <P>I have been receiving the annual reports since I became a Member of this House.  Some of them are detailed but I get the feeling that the majority of them do not go into the same detail that one would expect to get in a set of commercial accounts.  I find a lot of space taken up&mdash;CIE's annual report is a prime example&mdash;with colourful pictures and graphs that really mean nothing.  The information given on two colourful pages of CIE's report could be given in a short paragraph. The actual accounts themselves, to my mind, do not give detailed information of the type that should be given if these reports are to be a help to parliament and if they are to be put forward as a reason for suggesting <Col N="88" /> that there is information enough without the review bodies requested by this motion.  In the CIE report dealing with the canals working account there is a big increase in the figure for maintenance and buildings and the maintenance of waterways and works but there is no explanation among the notes as to how these increases are arrived at or what causes them.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing thing which I see in these reports is the fact that they are not all audited by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Some of them are audited by commercial firms.  I want to make it very clear that I am not casting any reflection whatever on the professional integrity or the probity of these firms but, nevertheless, it is a bad principle that where public money is concerned it should not be entirely in the hands of the Comptroller and Auditor General and, if necessary, his staff expanded to enable that to be done.</P>
    <P>Another feature I have noticed about semi-State bodies lately is that they are tending to invest in commercial ventures connected with the particular venture in which they may be engaged. Some of these investments are not altogether happy.  I certainly think there would need to be some machinery so that before a semi-State body would think of investing what, in effect, are public funds in a private commercial enterprise there would be a full-scale investigation into the viability of that proposed enterprise.  One example of an unfortunate investment was the investment by Irish Shipping in Palgrave Murphy.  This investment was made at a time when the warning signs had shown themselves in many parts of the transport world.  But Irish Shipping, a semi-State body invested our money in a concern which, shortly afterwards, went to the wall.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company have taken shares in a commercial venture involved in the setting up of holiday cottages.  This is a good idea provided there is ample commercial investigation beforehand and provided that the investments are not a manifestation of what I might call &ldquo;the old boy network&rdquo; in a particular type of business.  We can well <Col N="89" /> imagine a particular type of business where the world involved is small, where everyone knows everyone else, where a lot of business can be done informally at social gatherings and where a new development can be inserted in a non-commercial environment.  It could be difficult for the executives of a semi-State body to resist a request to invest in a purely private commercial enterprise.  They should be taken out of that position of difficulty by the setting up of a procedure which would prevent them from being allowed invest in a commercial enterprise except under certain strict prior conditions.  This is important and could be achieved if a body such as is requested by this motion, were set up.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister, who was walking on a very tight rope when he spoke of the activities of the present Committee.  I am prepared to interpret him in the way I interjected while he was speaking.  I agree with him that it would be unrealistic if anyone were to think that a body such as this motion has in mind would operate in a similar fashion.  That is not what is intended, as will be seen from the reasonable wording of the motion.  However, we must remember that the particular body which is functioning at the moment was set up to consider an extraordinary situation.  It is not good logic or fair arguing to draw the operations of that Committee into this debate when one has regard to the origins and to the facts that gave rise to the present deliberations.</P>
    <P>Indeed, while the Minister was speaking the thought occurred to me that this whole question of review of these bodies by this Parliament is something which these bodies would regard with apprehension.  I do not speak of the general public when I say that because they would welcome review, but having regard to the way in which politics and politicians have become almost dirty words during the past 12 months, I am sure that some of the dedicated people working on these bodies would view the motion before us with some apprehension.  It is unfortunate that that should be so, but all the events of the past 12 months, culminating in the Ard-Fheis, where some of the Minister's colleagues, <Col N="90" /> I am sorry to say, allowed themselves to be seen publicly in a state where one of them was incoherent with rage and hatred while another was pathetically protesting his innocence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much more to say except that I consider this to be a very important motion and, in particular, it is a motion that would <Col N="91" /> meet the wishes of the vast majority of the people of the country.</P>
      <P>There is considerable disquiet because of the autonomy allowed to some semi-State bodies.  Some of their activities are puzzling to the ordinary layman.  If a Dáil Committee were set up to oversee these activities, much of the apprehension would be allayed.</P>
      <P>One matter that has been mentioned to me repeatedly in relation to expenditure by semi-State bodies is the persistent and expensive advertising done by the ESB.  That body is a monopoly. There is nobody else selling electricity in this country; nobody else can do so. What is the point in advertising a monopoly product with all the expense that such advertising entails?</P>
      <P>For the past few months there has been considerable apprehension about the working of Bord Fáilte.  We were reassured here by the Minister for Transport and Power in this regard and the Taoiseach, in reply to a question put down by Deputy Begley and I, stated that he was perfectly happy with the working of Bord Fáilte, that they were doing and had done an excellent job and that there was no need for any drastic changes in the structure of that body.  Yet, some days ago the <i>Irish Times</i> carried an article which showed that, far from all being well in Bord Fáilte, the opposite is the case.  We read that a report had been received by Bord Fáilte which was strongly critical of their activities and, more important still, alleging that the figures which had been determined for earnings from tourism did not represent a proper picture of the real tourist earnings.</P>
      <P>This report on a body such as Bord Fáilte, which expend so much public money, should have been made available to the Dáil or, certainly, to a Committee of the Dáil.  It is not a matter that should be thrashed out in private within the inner councils of Bord Fáilte.  This is something that should be available to the Parliament of the people. sums of public money is not administering its affairs in the most economical or efficient manner then it should be</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a body in receipt of large <Col N="92" /> subject to review and the people should know that review was taking place.  The Minister is, I think, satisfied there is a case for such review.  He has conceded that the principle in the motion is a desirable one.  It is begging the question to put it off until such time as a decision has been taken on the Devlin Report or until such time as there is some Parliamentary reform.  If the principle is accepted I see no reason why the body requested should not be set up forthwith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take more than a committee to put some of the things right in some semi-State bodies. Aer Lingus some time ago invited Members of the Oireachtas to visit the workshops and discuss its method of financing, its accounts and the various systems adopted.  That was a realistic way of bringing Members of the Oireachtas up to date in relation to the affairs of the company.  Aer Lingus have done that on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Deputy would be serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>They have done that on a number of occasions.  I and other Members of this House got a realistic insight into the running of the company. If there was the same approach by other semi-State bodies we would be in a better position to assess the situation.  I should like to see an expansion of this kind of contact.  Contact is important.  It is important that we should get a comprehensive view of the affairs of these bodies.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I and other Deputies visited CIE.  Many erroneous impressions were corrected as a result of that visit.  We had full and frank discussions with the management.  I should like an expansion of this so that we could see for ourselves at ground floor level the conditions under which the employees work, the methods adopted and the problems that exist in certain departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These semi-State companies are very important bodies.  When we ask questions here we are invariably told that the particular Minister has no function. The Minister would want to reconsider <Col N="93" /> his position in relation to the whole set-up.  Much of the information sought, and refused, is information that should be given to Deputies.  I trust that in the not too distant future such information will be supplied.  It is not good enough that Deputies should be treated in this fashion.  Some semi-State bodies have an anti-trade union bias.  That is another matter the Minister should take into consideration. He should ensure the elimination of any such bias.  The present situation is an unfortunate one.  It is appalling that there should be victimisation in some semi-State bodies.  That victimisation will continue so long as the present system persists.  I am sure the Deputies in the Labour Party know what I am talking about; they have from time to time tried to eliminate this anti-trade union bias.  Many of the semi-State bodies do not have this bias but the controlling personnel in some are definitely anti-trade union. The result is that the workers are dissatisfied and there is strife.  I trust this matter will be examined without delay.</P>
    <P>It is disconcerting to find varying wage and salary scales in the semi-State bodies.  This, again, is a matter calling for examination.  It is something that must be tackled from the top to ensure that we have happy workers and the co-operation so necessary and so desirable between workers and management.</P>
    <P>For some time I have been concerned about the position in CIE.  The relevant Estimate is discussed and certain sections of the Official Report, together with the Minister's reply, are handed to personnel in CIE.  In some instances the information is not all that correct.  At the moment the workers there are disturbed for many reasons. If we had more contact we could come to a better understanding perhaps of the situation and solve some of the problems which are causing the workers concern.</P>
    <P>There are personnel in CIE who vet men.  They question workers and some of the questions are really absurd.  A list is sent to workers.  One question asked was, if a worker saw a person approaching whom he did not wish to <Col N="94" /> meet, would he cross to the other side of the road and the worker answered quite truthfully &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  There are few of us who have not adopted that subterfuge from time to time.  This worker was told he had failed because he was not a man of character.  This kind of thing is causing problems.  You have these so-called specialists who know more and more about less and less and who know very little indeed about the problems of workers because they were never workers themselves.</P>
    <P>If a committee were set up to examine the problems of workers I would support it, but I think the best we can hope for is an extension of the system Aer Lingus adopted last year. All Members of the Dáil and Seanad were invited&mdash;whether they went or not is another matter&mdash;to visit the workshops and the offices, and they had the opportunity of seeing the computer as well as questioning the personnel and discussing finances.  In this way we got a very good picture of the problems within the concern. There is no reason why the other concerns cannot afford the same facilities. As a matter of fact, these concerns give little recognition to Members of the Oireachtas at any time.  We see on some application forms in small print the words &ldquo;canvassing will disqualify&rdquo;. This comes from people who themselves canvassed for the job they are in.</P>
    <P>Where a person gets a letter of recommendation it depends on how it is interpreted by the personnel officer whether or not he will disqualify that person.  If he does not like the Senator or Deputy whose name is on the letter, then he will disqualify on the basis that this was canvassing, whether it was a character reference or not.  Most people applying for appointments merely want a character reference from a Deputy or Senator or someone else and then depending on the personnel officer the job is at his mercy.  I know a Senator who recommended a young girl for the position of air hostess and the Senator received a letter saying that the girl had been disqualified.  The girl was also told that she was disqualified from sitting for that particular examination and this was at a time when they could not get hostesses.  This is nonsensical in the extreme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> We have these little dictators setting themselves up within semi-State concerns and the sooner we get rid of some of them the better and the sooner we educate them how to treat Members of the Oireachtas the better.  It is time we made our position clear to the Minister concerned so that we will not have this type of nonsense &ldquo;canvassing will disqualify&rdquo;.  If people go for an interview and the interview board are not competent, then I would say that canvassing should disqualify but if the board are competent there is no reason why they should be influenced one way or the other by any recommendation from anyone outside the board.</P>

We supply the money but if I table a question to the Minister for Transport and Power about a semi-State body under his control his reply is that it is no function of his and I am availing of this opportunity to say some of the things I wanted to say about labour matters and workers' problems and I have no apology to make.  If we had an extension of the facilities which some semi-State concerns made available to us, then they would be in a position to hear our point of view and we would be in a position to question them on their attitudes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was not here for all of the Minister's contribution and that I only heard part of it.  It was purely accidental that I was not here.  I gathered that he was not really opposed to the spirit of this motion but that he had two reasons for not wanting to do anything about <Col N="96" /> it just now.  One is the matter that is the concern of the Committee of Public Accounts at the moment and the other is the Devlin Report.  Without wishing to reflect in any way on Mr. Devlin or on the expensive body of industrial consultants he employed, I like people to take on jobs which they are competent to do and with all due respect to Mr. Devlin he allowed himself to be put in the position of attempting to do a job for which he was not competent.  So much for Mr. Devlin.  As regards the matter before the Committee of Public Accounts, that is a temporary position and if the Minister has any inhibitions about it, considering that the last serious and full scale discussion about this matter took place in the Seanad 21 years ago, I do not think another few months is going to make a big difference.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a full understanding of what is intended in this motion.  To use the expression used in England, there is a vast no man's land existing between major policy questions, which everybody agrees should be decided by the Government, and the day to day work where these companies should be entirely independent and in this no man's land there should be some check on their activities. Let me take as an example something at which I merely hinted when moving the motion.  I think this is a good example and I am not picking out this body particularly for any reason, but take the moneys which have been paid out by way of grants for hotels particularly in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestions one hears, and in the absence of a committee of this sort there is no check on whether or not these suggestions are correct, are that individuals got such amounts by way of grant or guaranteed loan as were very much greater than the total cost to them of the hotel.  The only method of checking on that is through a committee of this sort.  I do not think Deputy Dowling understood what exactly is intended.  The intention is that they would have to appear regularly. It need not necessarily be annually, it could be bi-annually or tri-annually. It would not really matter so long as <Col N="97" /> an examination and a report on the activities of these boards could be carried out.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these investigations would be to ensure that there was an examination of matters which were causing concern.  This country is sufficiently small that such a Committee of the House would not have any difficulty in hearing about matters that were causing concern.  I made the specific suggestion that the Committee should have a competent person as an investigating officer who would report to them.  The Committee should be prepared to hear suggestions, criticisms or reports from other trustworthy people.</P>
    <P>Despite a period during which I was closely concerned with industrial relations in the ESB, I was never aware of any anti-trade union feeling in the ESB.  I am not quite sure if that was the body Deputy Dowling was referring to.  I was under the impression he was referring to CIE, but I am not aware of any anti-trade union feeling in CIE either.  I do not think any of us, including the Minister for Transport and Power, will learn anything next Saturday when we go to the Aer Lingus reception.  We are not suggesting here anything like that.  What we have in mind is a serious investigation of the financial affairs of these bodies and the manner in which they are conducting their business.</P>
    <P>It is true that big bodies tend to become more careless.  In the ordinary commercial world what happens, as in the case of United States Steel, is that young rivals come along and cut chunks out of the empire.  This does not happen in the case of State enterprise because they are usually monopoly concerns.  If they decay the effects are felt in the community without there being any method of curing them. Aer Lingus, CIE and the ESB have an annual turnover in the region of £30 million.  They have a greater annual turnover than any commercial concern, with the sole exception of the Guinness company.  Some years ago when I was speaking to a member of the Guinness company I said to him: &ldquo;You know, the ESB has shown a greater growth rate than your company.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Yes we are aware of it, we had noticed it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> The fact of the matter is that there are these enormous bodies and it is no use, as I said, when moving the motion, expecting the Comptroller and Auditor General, where he is the commercial auditor of these bodies, to be able to do something about it.  As commercial auditor he is in exactly the same position as any other commercial auditor.  An entirely different system is needed.  I am not going to pretend it is an easy problem.  Obviously, if it was an easy problem it would have long since been solved in Britain where they have massive companies like the Coal Board and British Railways.</P>
    <P>This is really acceptance of the fact that we should have a counterpart of the Swedish system.  When this Committee of the Dáil is being set up I hope a visit will be made to Sweden to find out how they work.  It would be a great deal more useful than any visit to Aer Lingus or CIE.  It is a very serious matter that there should be this vast lacuna in the Government system, where vast sums of the money are spent.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that the Minister was in favour of the motion as a whole but then he started to look round, I thought, to find excuses for not doing something about it at the moment.  It is 20 years since the matter last had an airing and I do not think it is going to worry the Labour Party if the Minister does not do anything until he has examined the Devlin Report which, to me, does not appear to have many useful suggestions in it. The Minister has, to give him his due, set up a services Department for the State services and that is one of the most useful suggestions in the Devlin Report.  It is, however, a pity that the Minister was not more specific. He could have said: &ldquo;Very good, when present troubles are over and we have examined the Devlin Report we shall certainly do something about it&rdquo;.</P>

It has almost fallen into desuetude.  It does not get to grips with things the way it used to when Deputy Seán MacEntee was Chairman of it from 1927 to 1932.  It had a great deal more teeth in it then than it has nowadays and it was a great deal more effective. I am not worried about how many people are on the Committee, it could be ten or 20.  I do not mind how it is composed, but there should be a committee to cover the day to day operations of these bodies such as the dismissal of a bus driver from CIE, to the vast problems of policy which would usually involve the expenditure of some millions of pounds which concerns the Government&mdash;all the normal operations of these bodies.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the present Bill is to raise the ceiling of borrowings which <Col N="100" /> may be guaranteed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, for Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. The present limit is £1 million and the proposal before the Dáil is to increase it to £3 million.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is aware that Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. is a wholly owned State company with equity capital of £6 million subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  It manufactures steel, principally re-inforcing steels for the construction industry, from basic raw materials, operating on a single open hearth furnace.</P>
    <P>Following advice from external consultants who made a thorough study of the company's operations and potential, the company is embarking on a major expansion of its steel-making capacity.  The principal item in this programme is the installation of a second furnace, which will be an electric arc furnace, and there will be additions and modifications of the rolling mills and other parts of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The expansion now commencing almost double the basic output of steel ingots, bringing it up to between 135,000 and 150,000 tons per annum. The main point of it is however, that it will introduce processing by electric arc furnace for the first time.  This will give faster and more flexible production and will also open up the possibility of getting into the more lucrative side of the trade in special steels for the export market.  It must be said however that, while this expansion will give a greatly increased capacity for ingot production, the addition to the employment force will be a modest one.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that it introduces a new and up-to-date method of steel production, and holds out the prospect of putting the company's unit costs of production at a competitive level in the coming free trade era.  We all hope that this development into the electric arc furnace method will be only the first of further expansions, but this will depend on the efforts of everybody connected with the company to make it an efficient and competitive undertaking.</P>
    <P>The cost of the present programme <Col N="101" /> will be in the region of £3 million. The company is proposing to finance this from its own resources and from borrowing over a fairly short term.  The company at present has borrowings of £½ million guaranteed by the State. The Bill before the House will lift the limit of guarantee up to £3 million, although not all of this will be required for the present transaction.  The company itself has built up some resources from its profits particularly over the past three years.</P>
    <P>There are other related amendments to the Principal Act made in the Bill. Section 2 (b) is for the purpose of being able to give a State guarantee where credit is got from a supplier of equipment on a deferred payment system instead of outright loan.  Section 3 (1) is to deal with the position in which this company got its original guarantees for loans under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, and to bring all these guarantees into the one group.  This will enable a single statement of guaranteed borrowings by this company to be given annually to the Oireachtas. More details about this can be given at a later stage if required.  I am confident that the object of the Bill commends itself to the Dáil, and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are pleased to support this Bill because we feel that, as we advance towards the Common Market, there is a necessity to rationalise our industry in every way possible.  We all regret if rationalisation sometimes takes the sad path of seeing the depression of an industry, the extinction of it or the reduction of it in employment capacity.  We support rationalisation where the effort is being made and the nettle is being grasped on the basis of further investment on advice. I want to make it very clear that the advice is the important thing about it. On the advice of international consultants we have had this decision made to expand the activities of Irish Steel. I am aware of the valuable employment which has been given in Cork by Irish Steel Holdings Limited.  I am pleased to see that steps are being taken to ensure that this employment will not be in any way endangered <Col N="102" /> but will, if possible, be expanded when the new furnace is installed and when the new system is in operation.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask certain questions. That is the job of the Opposition. How much more employment can we expect from the installation of this new equipment?  I would hope that there would be a good increase in employment as a result of the installation of equipment costing some millions of pounds.  I should like to know how, in fact, the installation of this new type of furnace will affect the future of Irish Steel, and whether or not there have been any contacts made or any arrangements made with steel manufacturing companies or marketing companies abroad whereby, within the Common Market, the viability of Irish Steel and the marketing force and ability of Irish Steel will be preserved. This is important because, unfortunately, as the world grows smaller and as the freeing of trade comes on us, even in the smaller Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement situation, one finds that the big operator can often exclude the small operator from business. I should like to know if plans have been made on marketing and also, as the Minister said it was the first of many steps, how much more money can we expect will need to be voted for Irish Steel over the next decade so that it will become a really good steel foundry which will survive under modern conditions.</P>
      <P>These are the points I want to bring up.  I would then ask whether the figure of 135,000 to 150,000 tons per annum for production capacity is a large or a small figure by European standards, or whether that amount can be regarded as something with bargaining power.  I should also like to ask what is our tonnage usage of steel in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to express the view from this side of the House that as regards both Verolme, which is purchasing goods from Irish Steel in large quantities, and Irish Steel there is a realisation in Fine Gael that both these companies must be protected as far as possible from anything which would injure the employment therein.  They must be improved, modernised and expanded, <Col N="103" /> so that every job that is there will be safe and that there will be more jobs besides.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 (b) guarantees can be extended to machinery which is not bought outright but bought by a deferred payments system.  This is a normal procedure in heavy industry today and I see nothing wrong with it. It is something which should have been in various Bills.  It should have been in the principal Bill and is being inserted in this one for the very good reason that it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I also commend section 3 (1) which tidies up certain things and which puts the guarantees into one group.  We in the Fine Gael Party want to see Irish Steel Holdings Limited go from strength to strength.  We want to see more people employed there and we will go with the Government in trying to reach that end.</P>
    <P>The rest of the Bill, perhaps, might be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I do not foresee amendments from this side of the House in Committee but there may be when we have examined the Bill in more detail and in relation to what the Minister says in reply.  The decision made by the Government has the backing of the Fine Gael Party. Every worker and every director in Irish Steel may take it that the entire Fine Gael Party is behind them in their every effort.</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention names in great detail, but the work of Mr. Hogan, Mr. Devlin and Mr. David Frame is well known.  I know a few of the executive management and their reputation is high.  Whereas Irish Steel Holdings might, perhaps, if left as it was, have gone to the wall, as some industries could go to the wall in Common Market competition, I am glad that the right decision has been made, that the nettle has been grasped in increasing the capacity and production of the company and safeguarding the jobs there if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I am glad that external consultants have been brought in for a thorough study of the company's operations and potential.  Within Europe a whole new situation is sure to develop.  That new situation is unknown to people in this <Col N="104" /> country and could not be known to them because we have operated here, even if we had exports or import connections, within our own little cloister.</P>
    <P>Very often I do not agree with the views of the reports of consultants and find their recommendations unsuited to our small country.  However, if we are to remain in the production of steel this is a field where there is the necessity for external consultants who know the European market at least.  I am glad the decision has been made after a report from external consultants.  It is a pity that the advice of these consultants, in part at least, was not made known publicly and to the Members of this House.  However, that is a decision of the Minister and we will not be churlish with him about it.  Perhaps if we read the pros and cons, the decisions that had to be made and risks that had to be taken, we would discover it would not benefit Irish Steel if such information were to be given to their competitors.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for Fine Gael on Industry and Commerce I wish to say we are in favour of the expansion of Irish Steel, the protection of every job there and the production not only of steel but of more jobs if at all possible.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to be able to welcome unreservedly a proposal from the Government. While the Minister did tell us about the financial end of this Bill, which of course, is a financial Bill, he was rather reticent about the activities of the company.  However, their financial success up to the present is indicated by their balance sheet at 30th June last when their debtors exceeded their creditors by £700,000 and they had, in addition to that, cash amounting to £600,000.  There is no question but that the people who run this organisation deserve any encomiums we can give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that just before the Korean War broke out, about 20 years ago, there were the most awful complaints about the operations of Irish Steel Holdings, that they were compelling certain manufacturers to pay more for steel of the type they were <Col N="105" /> producing than these manufacturers would have to pay on the international market.  Then the Korean War broke out and supplies of all kinds of raw materials dried up overnight and fellows were fighting one another&mdash;if I might say so without intending to be rude&mdash;in much the same way as people were fighting at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis a week or two ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making an analogy.  It was fabulous to hear the comments of people who were groaning and complaining, and, of course, Irish Steel Holdings continued to supply the people who had been stuck with them as customers when the going was hard and the other people were inclined to find it not too easy to get their supplies.</P>
      <P>Despite the careful report of the chairman that the situation could not be expected to be as financially successful this year as it had been the previous year, 1968-69, nevertheless, it is obvious that in recent years the company have been doing extremely well.</P>
      <P>One would expect that even if there is no large-scale increase in employment, the introduction of processing by electric arc furnace will render the employment in the company more secure at a time when so many of our industries seem to be under pressure without our being in that disastrous situation of being in the Common Market at all.  Therefore, if this is to be a form of security against that disastrous day when we might go into the Common Market, I am all for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other angle that interests me, that is, that the company have had the advice of consultants. Like Deputy Donegan I have an ambivalent attitude towards consultants. There are more charlatans among these industrial consultants than any other professional occupation in the world today, but it gives me great pleasure when the chairman of the <Col N="106" /> company is able to say in the report on last year:</P>
    <P>In April, 1970, we commissioned the consultants, who had prepared earlier feasibility studies and recommendations, to prepare rapidly a detailed scheme for additional steel-making facilities and for improvements in other installations, the scheme to be such that it would give the industry sufficient capacity to meet the company's production and marketing programme in 1972 and immediately succeeding years and would, at the same time, be such as to fit into any further development of the industry that might be decided upon later.</P>
    <P>The scheme recommended by the consultants was adopted by the board, subject to minor modifications. Early in July the Government Departments concerned and the Industrial Development Authority were informed of the company's proposals and of the necessity to order the required equipment at an early date if production and marketing problems in 1972-73 are to be averted.</P>
    <P>I believe in that kind of consultancy. You get a firm of consultants, they are with you on and off during a period of time, you find their work first-class and you continue to live with them. There is no point in my pretending that there are no first-class firms of industrial consultants.  There are of course, but, as I say, there are more charlatans in that business than in any other business I know of.  There is an element of in the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king in this type of thing.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill without any reservation whatever.  It is nice to see that, in fact, this will be done without the Government having to do it by putting their hand into the taxpayers pocket.  As I say, out of the moneys already in the company, and out of the additional powers it gets here to borrow money, the company will do it itself.  It is right, perhaps, that I should mention that I heard criticism about undue preference being given to particular scrap merchants.  This was mentioned in the House before and it <Col N="107" /> seemed to me that the Minister admitted that there was an element of truth in that.  This is the only criticism I have heard of this company.</P>
    <P>We saw the list.  Most Members of the House saw the list of prices.  It seemed to me that the very much higher price paid for large quantities of scrap could not be justified in logic. If one supplied 500 tons a week&mdash; which really could only be supplied in this country by one scrap company &mdash;one got a very much better price, in fact almost double what the small man got who could supply only 25 to 50 tons a week.  It is only fair to say that the proof of any commercial operation is in the financial result and, on that basis, this company is to be trusted to carry on its business effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Minister states that this is a completely State-owned company which was set up originally by a donation of £6 million from the Minister for Finance.  It would be interesting to know if the company pays any rate of interest on that money.  So far as I know, Irish Steel Holdings produce the raw material for manufacturing purposes and, unless there has been any radical change in the past year or so, the cost of this raw material is in excess of the cost of material bought outside this country.  I believe it was agreed that Irish firms would have to take the raw material from Irish Steel holdings for anything they manufactured for the home market, but that when they are manufacturing for export they are allowed to buy their raw material outside the country.</P>
      <P>I know that the agricultural manufacturing firms of which at one time there were two in my constituency&mdash; they are now amalgamated into one&mdash; found themselves faced with considerable difficulties.  When they were manufacturing for the home market their raw material cost them considerably more and, therefore, their costs of production were higher.  If and when we enter the EEC I take it that there will be no restrictions on the importation of raw materials, and that any existing restrictions will disappear after a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to put to the Minister is this.  Is this a viable firm?  It got <Col N="108" /> £6 million from the Minister for Finance. If it pays no rate of interest and no dividend, to anybody, possibly it is viable.  In fact, it is in a privileged position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the ordinary private enterprise industrial firm.  If it is not now able to provide the raw material for manufacturing as cheaply as raw material can be procured in other countries, that poses the question: is this a satisfactory State investment? The Minister said that a firm of external consultants advised him that this firm will become fully viable.  He has not given us any further information. He has not told us who the firm of external consultants are.  He has not elaborated on that in any way.</P>
    <P>I am raising this point because I was engaged in many negotiations with the Department, long before the Minister became Minister for Industry and Commerce, in relation to the manufacturers in my constituency who were continually complaining about their high cost of production because they had to buy from a national company whose prices were dearer than they were elsewhere.  The Minister also said that the new furnace will be electrically controlled and that this will lead to cheaper production costs.  If we are to give credit of £3 million to a State-owned company, I should like an assurance that it will be fully viable and that it will be able to produce the raw materials at a cheaper rate to the benefit of industries using steel.  I should also like an assurance that it will be able to hold its own for the foreseeable future.  I have never been terribly keen on a completely State-controlled industry because that is usually a case of its being nobody's business.  Whatever our political sentiments are, whether we think right or left, I think we all agree that it is usually more costly to run a State concern.  It is very often controlled from an office in Dublin, especially if there is a big State investment in it.  Though it may have local advisers and a local manager, they have to come back to the source of their remuneration to get their instructions.</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance on those points.  Is this a fully viable company? Is it fully competitive?  Is it paying a rate of interest on the money loaned <Col N="109" /> to it by the State?  At the present moment, is it producing the raw material at a more costly rate than raw material can be produced elsewhere? What restrictions are imposed on firms in relation to buying raw materials where they are forced to buy from Irish Steel Holdings, based in Cork in the Taoiseach's constituency so far as I know?  Is the Minister satisfied from the advice he got from these external consultants, whoever they may be, that the company will be able to produce with the new furnace at exactly the same price as other companies, and will be fully competitive with them?  Is he fully satisfied that, in the event of our entering the EEC, this company will be able to exist and function and carry on, and meet the greater competition it will be meeting, because steel will be very competitive in an open market?  I should like the Minister to clarify those few points for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I am pleased with the welcome this Bill has received in the House.  It is quite obvious that, in the main, the principal spokesmen for the two Opposition parties fully accept the good work which Irish Steel Holdings are doing and there is general overall goodwill for their continued welfare.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable the ceiling to be raised to allow them borrow up to a limit of £3 million.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde seemed to infer that the Bill visualised the State advancing a further £3 million for investment in this company, but such is not the case.  The position is, as Deputy O'Donovan said, that this company have been operating quite successfully over the past few years and they have shown a profit in that period. Nevertheless, at no stage have they been in a position to pay any interest, to pay back any of the capital originally invested or to pay any dividends. It is a fully owned State subsidiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan, while welcoming the Bill, asked why, since we were enabling the company to raise this additional money for improvement of their operations, there was no sizable <Col N="110" /> increased employment.  I said in my opening remarks that the additional employment force would be a modest one.  I would point out that there are approximately 830 people employed by Irish Steel Holdings at the present time.  It is anticipated, when they get the improvements works under way, that the employment level will be raised to almost 1,000.  This of course, is quite a modest increase in employment in relation to the outlay proposed. It is quite obvious, however, that they hope to have a more efficient and productive operation there and to be in the position of being able to produce a less costly product.</P>
    <P>The consultants employed by the company were referred to.  I am fully conscious of the fact that Deputy O'Donovan is rather sceptical about the qualities of some of the consultants who may be engaged.  In regard to some of the remarks that have been made in connection with the quality or otherwise of the consultants, one must assume, as has been said by Deputies O'Donovan and Donegan, that the consultants in this instance know their jobs.  I think this is so. Deputy Esmonde drew attention to the fact that, while I mentioned external consultants, I did not for some reason indicate who they were.  I do not see any reason why I should not say who they are.  They are Messrs.  Guest, Keane and Nettlefold, known as GKN. They are a highly thought of firm of consultants and Irish Steel Holdings Ltd.  can look forward confidently to being able to trade satisfactorily, having taken the advice of those consultants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan asked if the output of steel ingots, which it is hoped will be between 125,000 and 150,000 tons per annum, is high, low or economical by world standards.  That output is quite low by world standards.  However, as we see it, there is room for a small versatile steel mill and this is what it is hoped we will have in the reconstituted mill of Irish Steel Holdings Limited.  It is certainly small by world standards, but the operators there feel that we will be able to remain quite competitive even following our accession to EEC.</P>

I am quite satisfied from the short experience I have had of meeting the directors and studying their operation that the tribute paid to them is well deserved.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donovan said that in my opening remarks I appeared reticent about the affairs of the company, that I did not say a great deal.  In my opening remarks I endeavoured to give the reasons why this Bill is before the House.  I acknowledge that the Deputy paid tribute to the company also.  He went on to say that at some stage the Minister admitted there was preference given to certain scrap companies. In reply to a question in the House on some occasion I made a statement in regard to the prices paid for certain quantities of scrap.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I do not think that at any stage I said there was preference given to any particular scrap company.  In fact, as the Deputy mentioned, there are different rates paid for different quantities of scrap sold to Irish Steel Holdings Limited.  One reason why disagreement might arise is that higher rates are paid for the bigger quantities delivered.  This is quite understandable from the point of view of a company which is dependent to such a great extent on scrap as a basic raw material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to provide for the regulation and control of the supply and distribution of fuels.  There is no immediate need for the measures proposed; these measures are purely precautionary and I would hope that the Bill, if enacted, would go into cold storage and that it would never be necessary to avail of its powers.</P>
      <P>In the light of what I have just said, Deputies will no doubt wonder why the Bill has been introduced.  I should explain firstly that the decision to have the Bill prepared and ready for enactment at short notice was taken several years ago as part of an OECD programme of a general preparedness to deal with peacetime emergency shortages. This preparatory work, including the drafting of orders, permits, <i>et cetera</i> was carried through by my Department so that controls could be introduced at short notice if the need arose.  I repeat that there is no immediate need but, because of the growing importance of energy sources in the economy and because of recent changes in the world energy situation, the Government have considered it prudent to have this Bill enacted so that the necessary powers will be immediately available if they are ever required.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned changes in the energy situation as a reason for this Bill.  These changes affect primarily fuel oil and coal.  Both these commodities, at fairly short notice, have become in short supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demand for fuel oil has been increasing rapidly in the western world. There are various reasons for this. There has been a steady growth in economic activity and industrial expansion. Fuel oil used either directly or as converted energy in the form of electricity is now the accepted source of motive power and heating for industry. <Col N="114" /> Similarly, fuel oil is rapidly replacing solid fuels for domestic heating and with the growing standard of living the standards of domestic heating have been going up with consequent increases in energy consumption.  This situation of increased level of demand for fuel oil has coincided with short-falls in other energy sources.  The rationalisation of the coal mining industry in Europe has resulted in the closure of many uneconomic mines and an overall reduction in production. The programme of nuclear energy stations for the production of electricity has fallen short of targets. Reduced rainfall in a number of European countries in the year 1970 reduced the production of hydro-electricity. While there have been some gains through increases in the production of natural gas in Europe, this has, so far, had only a small impact on the overall energy supply position in Europe.  In the USA, which depends heavily on the production of natural gas, production has been lagging with consequent heavier demands on other energy sources.</P>
    <P>The combination of these circumstances gave rise to a greatly increased and unexpected demand for fuel oil and this situation was aggravated by some fall-off in oil deliveries from the Mediterranean area.  The situation has been such that if the weather this winter had proved very severe supplies would have had to be restricted to some degree.  Fortunately, the weather has so far, been relatively mild.</P>
    <P>The scarcity of fuel oil has created an extra demand for coal particularly for power production.  This extra demand, combined with the reduction in the output of coal in Europe, has given rise to some concern about our coal supplies.  This country still consumes about one million tons of coal a year mainly for domestic purposes. We are now dependent to the extent of about 80 per cent of our requirements on European coal sources and other countries are competing sharply with us for the available supplies.  Unforeseeable circumstances such as a dislocation of transport facilities due to severe weather could in this tight situation lead to a shortage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> It will be noted that the Bill also provides for the control of supplies of electricity.  We are now dependent on fuel oil for the production of more than 50 per cent of our electricity requirements and a scarcity of fuel oil could lead to a situation in which it would be necessary to ration electricity.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, realise that powers to regulate and control the supply of fuels would be of little use to us unless supplies are available to control and regulate.  Precautionary measures were, therefore, taken some ten years ago to maintain within practical limits, a stock pile to safeguard against a short-term interruption of supplies.  On Government direction, the ESB and CIE carry substantial reserves of oil.  The oil companies also carry reserve stocks and, in addition, we participate with other OECD countries in a scheme for control and sharing of oil products generally which would be activated in the event of a scarcity of supplies. The coal trade in this country safeguards the supply position as far as possible by entering into long-term contracts and by diversification of supply sources and I am glad to say that their efforts successfully averted a shortage during a period of temporary supply difficulty last year.  Arrangements have now been made to continue coal deliveries during the coming summer at the rate supplied during the heavy usage winter months.  This should ensure a substantial reserve stock entering next winter.</P>
    <P>I should say that the big difficulty with stock piling is the question of cost. It is estimated that it costs £6 million to store one month's supply of oil alone.  There is, therefore, an early limit to what it is possible and practicable to store in present circumstances. At present we have in stock between two and three months supply and are considering methods by which we can increase this level.  These estimates are, of course, at normal rates of consumption. With the aid of the powers I am seeking under this Bill it would be possible for me to ensure that, in an emergency, fuels would be used only for essential services and stocks could therefore represent a much longer period of essential supply.  Any settling <Col N="116" /> of priorities for use of fuel in an emergency would, of course, be done in full consultation with all the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I have outlined, Deputies will I am sure agree that it is no more than prudent to be in a state of preparedness to deal with a shortage of fuel supplies if the need should arise instead of waiting until an emergency is upon us.  Enactment of this Bill would enable the Government, under section 2 (1), to declare by order at any time they consider that the supply situation warrants it, that the Minister for Transport and Power may control the supply and distribution of any fuel or fuels.  The Minister would then be empowered to make orders under section 3 (1) to control, to the extent necessary, the supply and distribution of the various fuels covered by the Government order.  Drafts of orders which would be made by the Minister have been prepared and they could be made at short notice.  In addition, plans have been prepared to facilitate the speedy introduction of a rationing scheme, should this prove necessary.</P>
    <P>Any order made by the Government would expire after a period of six months unless continued in force by order of the Government, and any order made by the Minister for Transport and Power would expire with the enabling Government order unless previously revoked by him.  Deputies will be aware that this measure has already been debated and passed by the Seanad.  During its passage through that House certain objections were raised by Senators and to meet these objections I had a number of amendments introduced during the Committee and Report Stages.  These amendments are designed to ensure that (i) oral directions given by the Minister under the Bill would be confirmed in writing within four days (ii) persons would not become innocently or unwittingly liable for prosecution under the Bill (iii) an offence by neglect would only arise in the case of wilful neglect and (iv) the forfeiture of chattels provided for in the Bill would apply only to movable goods and would not include leasehold or freehold property.</P>
    <P>While, as I have said, there is no <Col N="117" /> immediate likelihood of a shortage of fuels, the Government consider it wise to make all possible preparations to meet such a situation should it arise. It is for this reason that I recommend the Bill to the House but I repeat that the Bill is precautionary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is unique and unusual in a number of ways.  As the Minister pointed out, it has been debated already in the Seanad, certain amendments have been accepted by him and the Bill is now before the Dáil.  This is the first time I can recall a Bill having received a Final Reading in the Seanad and then being passed to the Dáil.  This is a desirable development.  In relation to technical Bills of this kind I hope the Seanad will be utilised more frequently for the purpose of making prior examination of them.  This development is particularly welcome in so far as Opposition Deputies are concerned because we do not have access to the expert advice which the Minister has available to him.  Also, it is of tremendous help to Dáil Members to find that a technical Bill such as this has been already vetted by Members of the Seanad who are experts in this field.</P>
      <P>The Bill is unique for a number of reasons.  Firstly, it is purely a precautionary measure and, unlike any other legislation that I recall, it is not necessary at the present time and may not ever be necessary.  I would join with the Minister in expressing the hope that it may never be necessary to invoke the powers of the Bill.  We are legislating here for a peace time emergency that would arise in the event of the cutting off of our normal sources of fuel supplies.  This may be unusual in the sense that emergency legislation in relation to fuel supplies is normally enacted because of war time conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stands, the Bill does not contain anything very revolutionary.  The Minister is merely bringing this country into line with other European countries.  He is implementing a programme that was formulated some years ago by the OECD&mdash;a programme that would ensure, in so far as possible, that all the member countries of the OECD would have legislation <Col N="118" /> of a kind which would enable special steps to be taken by the various Governments in the event of any cutting off or blockade of fuel supplies during peace time.  It is an enabling Bill in the sense that it enables the Minister to take certain steps in the event of certain circumstances arising.  This is purely a precautionary measure and, to use the Minister's words, will go into cold storage.  It may never be needed.</P>
    <P>While the Bill does not contain anything revolutionary, it is significant in a number of ways.  For instance, it is significant in that it brings home to us in a very striking manner the enormous degree to which our economy and standard of living are dependent on fuel oil.  Also, in a very dramatic way it reminds us of the frightening consequences that would result to our economy, to our industries and to our people in the event of any emergency which might cut off our fuel supplies.  Of course, this dependence on fuel is not unique or peculiar to Ireland.  It is a normal feature of the economic development of most modern countries.  I have been endeavouring to obtain some figures that would illustrate our dependence on fuel oils. I do not know whether the figures I have are correct or not but from everyday experience, it would appear to me that they are.  We are almost 100 per cent dependent on petroleum products for transport particularly since the advent of dieselisation on our rail system.  It is said that by the end of this decade 80 per cent of the electricity that we generate will depend on oil.  Of course, this dependence on oil leaves us very vulnerable in the event of an emergency.  It is absolutely vital that we should have as wide a range as possible of fuel supply sources. For this reason, I am a little disappointed that the Minister, when this Bill was being introduced, did not avail of the opportunity to give the House some indication of Government thinking in relation to our future fuel requirements. In other words, my reaction to this Bill is that it is OK, we are taking certain precautionary powers on which we could draw in the event of a certain emergency arising but, as the Minister pointed out, there <Col N="119" /> is not much point in taking precautions for controlling fuel supplies if we have not got supplies of fuel.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what plans, if any, the Government or the Minister have for developing sources of energy and power other than fuel.  I am aware of the turf generating stations and the hydro-electric stations and the steps that are being taken to set up a nuclear energy board.  But this is all rather vague.  There is need for long-term planning and research into our future fuel requirements.  There is need for research into possible sources of power and energy, other than oil, coal or peat.  I understand a considerable amount of research into the development of fuel substitutes is being done in other countries.  I do not know if any similar research is being done here.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have given us some indication with regard to future oil requirements.  It is estimated that turf supplies will last for another 20 years and we will probably have a nuclear energy station by that time.  I understand the intention is to start phasing out the turf generating stations by degrees and to change over to other sources.  In a vague way we know what the plans are for the future but we have no definite evidence of Government thinking and planning in relation to future needs and future requirements from the point of view of industry and commerce and in the domestic sphere.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the tremendous cost of storing fuel; a two-months supply would cost something in the region of £6 million.  We have at Bantry Bay the Gulf Oil Company which maintains huge stocks of oil.  In view of the facilities we give them I am wondering whether, in the event of an emergency arising, we would have any priority in relation to the fuel supply held at the Gulf Oil terminal at Bantry Bay.  It has been suggested, and I support the suggestion, that the Government might be in a position to bargain from the point of view of special priority for accessibility to the fuel stored at Bantry Bay.  I understand discussions are going on between the Government and the Gulf Oil Company in <Col N="120" /> relation to this.  The Government should be in a very strong bargaining position.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of storing oil &mdash;I may be accused of being parochial now&mdash;the Shannon estuary is ideal for large-scale storage of oil.  It can accommodate tankers of up to 200,000 tons or more.  It might be possible to develop storage facilities at Shannon estuary at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>I support the suggestion that a national fuel supply council should be set up to enable the Minister, his Department and the Government to make long-term plans for future fuel needs and to carry out the necessary research towards that end.  I understand the Minister undertook to consider this, but he made no reference to it here this evening.  Perhaps he would deal with the matter when he comes to reply.  Such a council would be a very desirable development because it would place at the Minister's disposal the expertise of those engaged in the oil business, such as the Gulf Oil Company, of those engaged in generating electricity, namely, the ESB and the members of the proposed new nuclear energy board.  An advisory council would be invaluable to the Minister.  There is another reason though for such a council.  It could assist the Minister in co-ordinating the efforts and the advice of all the various interests engaged in fuel and energy supply.  The Minister will agree with me when I say there is a tendency on the part of State bodies to act very independently.  There are two State bodies directly involved in the generation of power, Bord na Móna and the ESB.  There are State companies which use both oil and other fuel.  The suggested national fuel supply council would serve a very useful purpose for the reasons I have mentioned.  The Minister would have available to him the experience and the special qualifications of those engaged in this particular industry and he would be enabled to co-ordinate efforts and to bring about a proper cohesion of effort by dovetailing plans, and so forth, thereby avoiding any clash of interests in the event of an emergency arising.  I do not know what the Minister's views are on this. <Col N="121" /> I contemplated tabling an amendment on the Committee Stage in support of this national fuel supply council but, perhaps, the Minister has looked into the matter since the Seanad debate and will tell us, when he comes to reply, what he intends to do.  The Bill as I say has been amended in the Seanad and I have no objection to it as it stands.  However, I am sorry that the Minister did not extend the scope of this debate to enable us to have a comprehensive discussion on the whole question of fuel and power supply in relation to the future development of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the Minister's assurance that there is no immediate need for this measure.  I suppose when the measure was being drafted it did appear that there could have been a need for it.  The Teheran oil conference which concluded successfully, even if it meant an increase in the price of oil, did at one stage appear as if it might not conclude successfully and that agreement might not have been reached too quickly and there could have been an oil supply problem in this part of the world.  Oil supplies to Western Europe now mainly come from the Middle East and North Africa and with the decline of Britain's influence it would appear as if that area is now able to make demands which perhaps a few years ago it could not make on the western world.  This of course is their business; oil is their main export and so they must look after their own interests first.  The increasing dependence on oil not alone in this country but in the whole of Western Europe and in the OECD group means that we must look to alternatives for supplying fuels in the event of a long-term dispute with these countries.  In the short-term this country, even at this time when our dependence on oil is not as great perhaps as other Western European countries, could be in a very grave predicament if there was a supply problem from these countries.  In the early fifties when the Suez crisis occurred this country's transport was hit.  We had not the same dependence on oil for electricity production at that time but if a similar crisis were to arise now it <Col N="122" /> would have grave consequences for us. It is only right that the Minister should have measures adopted so that he can take the necessary action should such a crisis occur.</P>
      <P>Fuels which would be controlled are listed in the first section of the Bill and although the Minister says this is not needed immediately it could be needed in the future and I note that two forms of fuel are not covered.  One is natural gas and although there is no likelihood of an immediate supply of natural gas from the sea or from the land here it is possible, judging by the increasing amounts that are being found around the North Sea and the coast of Britain, that natural gas might be found in the Irish Sea.  We must also consider the development of nuclear energy and already the Minister has introduced a Bill in the Seanad to provide for the erection of a nuclear power station in the future.  It would have been useful to have included these two items in this Bill.</P>
      <P>As a previous speaker mentioned our dependence by 1980 on oil for the production of electricity will be of the order of 80 per cent and this indicates to me that we should investigate the alternatives to oil as a source of producing energy.  In my own constituency the ESB pump storage system is going ahead and this will be a great advantage in storing electricity in the future.  This type of project could be repeated over and over again and while the capital cost is very high it would supply an alternative source of energy in the future.  The Minister has not said whether these measures could be used in the event of a strike which would reduce the supply of oil to electricity supply stations or other areas in which oil would be needed.  I wonder does the Minister intend to implement this Bill in some way in these circumstances.  It would be interesting to hear him on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last few years the building industry has been turning more and more to the heating of houses by oil or electricity.  Heating by oil seems to be the cheapest form of heating at present.  The capital cost of installing an oil heating system is very high and the person installing such a system <Col N="123" /> rarely bothers to consider having an alternative type of heating.  This is the difference between the modern house and houses built years ago which had an open hearth which could take any of several different forms of fuel&mdash;turf, wood, coal or anthracite.  Should one become scarce any of the alternatives could be used.  We are becoming more dependent on electricity and oil for heating and cooking in our homes. Houses are being built with these amenities installed and in the event of failure of supply people would be greatly inconvenienced.  I do not know what powers the Minister could adopt under the Bill to maintain a supply of oil and electricity in the event of scarcity, but I imagine this is what it is hoped to do by the introduction of this measure.</P>
    <P>The first section of the Bill sets out the types of fuel involved.  As the Minister has said, it deals mainly with coal and oil.  Bottled gas, which comes under subhead (h) is becoming increasingly popular in rural areas and it is also used by tourists who come on caravan and camping holidays.  Section 2 deals with the orders which the Government may make where:</P>
    <P>the exigencies of the common good necessitate the control by the Minister on behalf of the State of the supply and distribution of fuels.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned storage facilities and said it would cost £6 million at the present time to store two months supply of oil.  Are there any plans to enlarge the storage facilities?  It appears to me that if we require a Bill of this kind we also require extension of our storage facilities.  In the event of our becoming more dependent on oil it would appear that we need to expand storage facilities accordingly.  The previous speaker made a suggestion as to where the storage facilities could be located and I am sure there are many areas which could claim suitability for the storage of oil.  At this stage it would be sufficient for the Minister to tell us if he is contemplating the expansion of storage facilities.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister's speech sets out the broad necessity for the Bill, it would be interesting to know at what <Col N="124" /> stage the Minister will consider a fuel crisis is upon us and when these orders would be brought into effect.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the offences, prosecutions and punishments.  In the original Bill this section did cause some comment in the Seanad.  The Minister has accepted the amendments suggested there and the section has been tidied up very well.  Naturally, we would like to see that the penalties do accrue to people who deserve them.  I am glad to see the inclusion of words such as, &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; and &ldquo;willingly&rdquo;. In the event of a scarcity the people responsible for contravening the Bill would be penalised.</P>
    <P>The Minister has assured us there is no immediate need for this measure and I hope there never will be.  We, in the Labour Party, welcome the fact that should the need arise the Minister will already have in his possession measures to deal immediately with the fair supply of fuel to those areas which require immediate and constant supplies in order to carry on their necessary tasks.  The Bill is acceptable to us.  I am glad the Seanad had an opportunity to deal with it first.  This has made our task a little easier because people with more specialised knowledge than we Deputies, have already tidied it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the House for the constructive discussion of this Bill.  I am glad there has been an appreciation of the fact that this is essentially an emergency measure designed to meet a situation which we hope will not arise.  It is designed to give the Government and the Minister for Transport and Power the appropriate authority to take, by way of order, limited in time, the necessary powers whereby immediate action can be taken to control storage, the rotation of storage, distribution and the placing of basic fuels that are necessary for the safety of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that this does raise the larger question, which we shall have a full opportunity of discussing in the course of my Estimate which will be before the House shortly, of the necessity to avoid over-dependence <Col N="125" /> on any particular form of fuel, both from the fuel point of view and the power point of view. This, I feel, is all important.  The whole thinking of the ESB, as can be seen from their annual report, is designed to ensure that as far as possible in future this over-dependence will not arise.  This is the main thinking behind the very urgent task that the ESB are now well advanced in preparation towards the erection of a nuclear power station here which will be the largest single power station in the country with a minimum of 500 to 600 megawatts&mdash;a nuclear power station is not economical below that figure.  This will again disperse the fuel and power sources available to the community, which is all to the good. At the present time oil provides over 50 per cent of the fuel requirements for the generation of power.  By the time the nuclear power station is completed in 1978 it will be less than 50 per cent and looking very far ahead towards nuclear fusion the world as a whole will work its way out of dependence on oil.  I am talking now in terms of the next generation.  Oil resources are not inexhaustible.  The future appears to lie in the further, more economical development of both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.  The development of a type of generation from this power that can make use of almost any materials of the earth, particularly water which is the most obvious source, lies in the future.  It is essential to seek so far as possible to spread out the various fuel resources so that there is not over-dependence on any particular one.  We have done this ourselves by utilising our turf and milled peat resources.  Turf and milled peat resources are now ahead of coal in regard to supplying power in this country.  They supply nearly twice as much as coal for power.  They are behind oil, but ahead of coal.  Our own resources are supplying twice as much as coal towards our power grid.  It is of importance to emphasise that.</P>
    <P>I have not referred to the hydroelectrical development which, in regard to immediate power development, has been pretty well exhausted through the <Col N="126" /> Liffey, the Erne and the Shannon schemes but is now being utilised for a new conception of power storage for use in off-peak areas.  This is the purpose of the Turlough Hill project in County Wicklow, which is well on the way to completion.  It will be completed in 1974.  Investigation is being carried out into a similar type project in the Comeragh Mountain area in County Waterford.  This type of development does not produce more power but conserves power for utilisation at peak periods so that the maximum use is made of the power available.  There is detailed planning by the ESB on this aspect.  Their plans are laid ahead to 1980 covering all resources such as turf and milled peat, coal resources, oil and the immediate development of a nuclear power station in regard to which plans are well advanced.  Fuller details will be emerging in the next 12 months.  We are at the Report Stage of the Nuclear Energy Bill in the Seanad.  There will be a board to supervise the whole development of nuclear energy not alone in regard to power generation but in the whole field of training and research aspects as well. I will go into greater detail in this respect on the Estimate debate.</P>
    <P>It is important that this House and the public should be made fully aware of the ESB plans which are in preparation and of the projections in regard to our power requirements.  The graph of our power utilisation is the highest in Europe at the present time.  It is running at 11 per cent for the past three years.  This represents a very reasonable barometer of economic and social progress. Deputy T. O'Donnell asked me to look into the question which Senator Alexis FitzGerald asked me in the Seanad and this is the question of appointing a fuel council.  I met many amendments in the Seanad.  Some of the amendments were suggested by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  I could not see my way to accepting this amendment.  What is needed in this type of emergency legislation is an Act which will enable a Government and a Minister to move swiftly by way of order to take immediate action.  I am in favour of having councils to advise Ministers in regard to developments in every field, <Col N="127" /> but I do not think a council is appropriate in this field.  This particular Bill is not in a field where there would be long-term research or continuous investigation. It is a measure designed to meet an emergency situation which would require me, if the order was made, to take immediate action to free supplies, to stop a ship or to control supplies in any one of a number of ways in regard to essential fuel set out in section 1.  The Fuel Section of the Department of Transport and Power maintain constant contact with all the interests involved in this industry.  We have contact with the ESB and CIE and with the various oil companies and coal suppliers.  Last autumn when we were worried about the coal supply situation here, we had day-to-day discussions with the coal importers with a view to ensuring that the requisite supplies were made available.</P>

      <P>We maintain this day-to-day involvement.  It is an important aspect of my Department's activities to ensure that we have sufficient fuel and power available.  We are near the whole nerve centre of the community's activities in this respect. Deputy T. O'Donnell and Deputy Kavanagh referred to the question of storage.  I emphasised the fact in my opening statement that we are at the moment in consultation with the various oil interests to secure a greater degree of storage capacity here in this country. I am not altogether satisfied with the fact that we have at the moment in stock between two and three months supply.  I am hoping to do better than that.  With a view to achieving a higher degree of supply, I have initiated discussions with the various oil interests concerned with a view to maximising the available storage space which they have and other storage space which we may be able to make available, the purpose being to extend that supply to possibly three or four months <Col N="128" /> supply.  We are aiming at that.  I have got nothing but co-operation in the Department in this aspect.  I feel that we will have a fruitful conclusion to our discussions.  It is wise to make use of available storage.  If the companies concerned would carry a greater reserve this would benefit the community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh raised points of definition in regard to section 1.  I thought the Deputy had a point at first, but on closer reading of this section I am satisfied.  The Deputy raised the point about natural gas not being included.  I am satisfied that natural gas can only be in one of two forms, either town gas which is covered under the definition of fuels in section 1 and further down under (b) there is a reference to petroleum oils including liquefied petroleum gas, so that gas in any form, be it natural gas or otherwise can only take two forms, either the fuel form which is town gas or the petroleum oil form which is liquefied petroleum gas.  Therefore, it is covered in that respect.  He also said the nuclear aspect was not covered.  Again that would be purely for the purpose of the production of electricity and that is covered in the definition of fuel which includes petroleum oils, coal, peat, town gas, electricity and firewood.  In view of the wide coverage in the definition of fuels and the definition of petroleum oils, there is no need to add what Deputy Kavanagh has suggested.</P>

      <P>No, but when it reaches the stage of bottled gas it is liquefied gas.  I looked at this very carefully and, as well as that, my advice is that it is covered.  It is important that we should have complete cover in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> As Deputy Kavanagh said, the urgency of this Bill really arose about two months ago when we and, indeed, the whole of Western Europe were concerned with the oil supply situation and at the same time we were faced with a diminishing coal production situation in Europe and in America.  Happily that situation appears to have eased but, at the same time, it is still a crucial matter.  Obviously the oil producing countries are better organised than heretofore and the dependence not just of Ireland but of all Western Europe is so great that it is essential that every Western European country should have legislation to deal with this situation in an effective manner if it arises.  All of the OECD countries with whom we are associated in the common oil pool are bringing in a similar type of legislation at the present time.  It is very important that it be done, and it is an elementary precaution that should be taken on behalf of the community.  It is much better to have emergency legislation debated in a cool atmosphere and prepared in good time rather than when an emergency is upon us, I thank the Members of the House for the reception they gave this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have powers under the Insurance Acts, 1953 and 1969, to give guarantees with respect to the insurance of risks in connection with the export of goods and in relation to the rendering of design and planning services, the work on which is carried out in Ireland in connection with engineering or constructional works executed abroad.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the aggregate amount of the liabilities which may be assumed by me under the Insurance Acts, 1953 and 1969, for export guarantees covering the insurance of risks in connection with external trade.  This increase is made necessary by the recent introduction of a new scheme of export credit insurance.  It may be helpful to Deputies for me to say something about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Export credit insurance was introduced in this country in 1955, as a <Col N="131" /> result of an arrangement made by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce with a group of Irish insurance companies.  The companies provided insurance against commercial risks on their own account, that is, insurance against the insolvency or default of the buyer.  They also issued policies on behalf of the Minister covering political risks, these risks being entirely borne by the State; these policies provided insurance against the danger that action by a foreign Government would prevent the goods from being delivered or paid for, as well as against such eventualities as the outbreak of war and so on.</P>
    <P>This joint scheme worked very well for some years.  It was reviewed several times and improved in some respects, and over the years gave exporters who needed it valuable protection.</P>
    <P>In the 15 years since the present insurance scheme was drawn up, Irish exports have, as Deputies know, increased enormously, from £110 million to £468 million a year.  Exports are now spread over a much wider range of goods, and are going to much more diverse markets.  It became apparent in recent years that the scheme of insurance which suited conditions in 1955 no longer provides the facilities which Irish exporters need now, if they are to continue to expand their trade and develop into new markets, as they must.  A working group was, therefore, set up by my predecessor to examine the situation and make recommendations as to the changes or improvements that might be needed.  The working group consisted of representatives of exporters, insurers, Córas Tráchtála and Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The group confirmed that the old scheme was no longer adequate to meet the present and future needs of Irish exporters.  They pointed out that exporters are increasingly diversifying into new and more remote markets, where credit risks tend to be higher than in the well developed industrial countries and where reliable commercial information may be difficult to get.  They will be dealing with new and therefore unknown buyers instead of with firms they may have been supplying <Col N="132" /> for years.  An increasing share of our exports consists of capital goods, often sold on extended credit terms. These and other factors increase the need for export credit insurance and, since Irish firms must compete with exporters in other countries, the group pointed out that they need the same kind of facilities and at prices which are broadly comparable with those paid by their competitors elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In most countries of Western Europe, and indeed elsewhere too, export credit insurance facilities are provided by the State.  The working group concluded that it would be impossible for a commercial insurer to provide facilities comparable to those provided by Governments or with Government backing in other countries.  They recommended, therefore, that State support should be provided for a scheme covering both commercial and political risks, and that the insurance facilities provided and the premiums should be reasonably comparable with those of other countries.  These recommendations were accepted and the new scheme came into effect on 1st February, 1971.</P>
    <P>The new scheme of export credit insurance provides, in a single policy, cover for commercial and political risks.  This export credit insurance cover is available for exports of goods of Irish origin, whether sold on short term or extended term payment arrangements, and is also available in respect of fees due for design and planning services carried out in Ireland in connection with engineering or constructional works executed outside Ireland. There have been several improvements in the terms and the premium rates are reasonably comparable with those charged in other countries.</P>
    <P>The operation of the new scheme of export credit insurance has been entrusted by me to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd. which, for some time, had been the only company issuing policies covering commercial and political risks and which henceforth will act as my exclusive agent in the issue of export credit insurance policies.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a new scheme will result in an immediate increase in the aggregate amount of the liabilities <Col N="133" /> assumed by me under the Acts, since I will be taking on liability for insurance against commercial risks hitherto borne by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is expected also that the new and improved scheme will attract additional business as exporters realise the support they can get from credit insurance. Deputies will also be aware that, as announced by the Minister for Finance, a scheme of credit at preferential rates for exporters of capital goods is being prepared by the banks. The introduction of this scheme will lead to a considerably increased demand for credit insurance.  Because of these factors, the present limit of £10 million on the aggregate liability I may assume will be too low, and I am seeking to have it raised to £30 million.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the aggregate potential liability could become an actual liability only if all the risks covered by all the insurance policies issued should materialise.  This is, to say the least, an extremely remote possibility. It is, in fact my intention that, taking one year with another, the export credit insurance scheme should be operated without net loss to State funds.</P>
    <P>I recommend acceptance of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also recommend acceptance of this Bill.  I was here when the late Deputy Norton first invoked the section of the 1953 Act in 1955 providing the export credit which the Minister mentioned.  It is true that these insurances are necessary and that all the exporting countries are providing them already.  Other countries provide not only export insurances but also export credit over a long number of years for capital goods. When I say &ldquo;a long number of years&rdquo; I do not mean decades.  I mean a period of, perhaps, three years.  At present the British Government will underwrite, through certain credit houses, the purchase of capital goods payable over a period of three years at a reasonable rate of interest.  This Bill could have been extended to include that feature also.  It was stated by the Minister's predecessor, I think, that this was in their minds.  It has been <Col N="134" /> Fine Gael policy for the past five years. We must wait until we take office because what we hear from Fianna Fáil very often does not occur.  The extension of credit as well as insurance credit is most desirable and must be looked after.</P>
      <P>I do not want to comment on the details of the Bill to any great extent, except to say that, if exporters of goods to this country have this credit, then our exporters should also have it. There will be unknown buyers and there will be diversification of exports. I could tell the House of two experiences I had in my business life.  Having succeeded in exporting Irish flake oat-meal to America, I got an inquiry from Hong Kong.  I did not avail of the insurance cover there was then, and I sent off the goods to Hong Kong. The gentlemen who imported them are now in prison in Hong Kong as a result of lengthy correspondence between my firm and the police because those gentlemen never intended to pay.  They collected the goods and proceeded to sell them for approximately one-quarter of their value.</P>
      <P>I had another experience in relation to credit insurance with one of my other, perhaps, more unsuccessful business enterprises.  I imported three hogsheads of wine from Israel.  There was a barrel of red wine, a barrel of white wine and a barrel of rose wine. The red wine and the white wine were quite excellent and, in fact, were bought in cases even by members of the Press Gallery here until they ran out about a month or so ago.  The barrel of rose wine exploded on the quay in Dublin. I was in trouble with the Customs because the wine had exploded and I had imported it and my friends in Israel were in trouble because they had to get me to prove that the wine had, in fact, arrived here to collect their export credit insurance.  In the event, they succeeded and they were covered by an insurance rather on the same lines as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things have happened.  They can happen in a rather humorous manner although not so humorous for the gentlemen in Hong Kong.  Even in my small business I have had experiences which showed me that this Bill <Col N="135" /> is necessary.  Perhaps the extension of these measures should have taken place at an earlier date but let us not be churlish about it.  We welcome the Bill.  Because I did not use the existing provisions I lost money in my private capacity.  Therefore, I learned a lesson not to lose it in the future.  As spokesman for the Fine Gael Party, I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also recommend this Bill to the House, but with reservations. I see nothing in this Bill about a clause which is in all insurance policies and I am wondering why the Minister has omitted this most important clause, bearing in mind the fact that we know from our experience that insurance companies will avail of every loophole possible to evade the liability for which they accepted the full premium. There is also the fact that, having accepted liability for certain situations, in the event of a claim arising, the insurance companies can cancel that insurance without any licence good, bad or indifferent, leaving the insured person in the impossible position that he has been rejected by one insurance company and has to go hawking all over the country looking for cover&mdash; not only this country but other countries as well.</P>
      <P>I have a typical example of that here before me in a case that happened concerning the Wicklow Harbour Authority.  A letter was posted from the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Limited dated 11th December, 1970, to the Wicklow Harbour Authority stating:</P>
      <P>We have been considering the question of a renewal in this case and have decided we should not invite renewal of the policy.  However, in view of the short notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the policy was due for renewal on December 1st&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we have decided to extend the policy to December 31st and at no additional premium, to give you an opportunity of placing the risk elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a letter from the insurance company dated 11th December cancelling the insurance and the liability <Col N="136" /> without giving any practical reason and giving them until 31st December, which is 21 days, bearing in mind that the Christmas holidays intervened. This very same situation could arise in any other matter if the insurance companies are allowed, as can very easily happen in regard to this Bill, to introduce the average clauses, which is not mentioned here.  The Minister has carefully ensured not to introduce the average clause in any claim that would arise.  Insurance company agents are business men trying to get as much business as they can because of the commission.  They are in a competitive market.  Having paid the first insurance premium on any property the client is advised, as has happened, that the property is under insured and that he should increase the policy and consequently the premium to whatever amount the insurance company think the market and replacement value would be.</P>
    <P>In Limerick an insurance company insured property for £58,000.  At first the property was insured for £20,000 because that was the purchase price at the time.  The insurance company advised that the property was under insured and that another £10,000 should be placed on it.  In addition, another premises was insured for £28,000 making in all a sum of £58,000 insurance on the two properties.  That was in 1965.  The premiums were paid and on renewal day the following year the insurer was advised that he was again under insured.  He took the advice of the company and insured his premises accordingly.  When the disastrous fire occured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am basing my argument, with due respect, on the fact that the average clause is not included in this Bill and if a claim arises under this £30 million Bill the insurance company can go to arbitration, as they can do at the present time because of the average clause.  It is a very simple matter and I can see why the Minister has side-stepped the issue.  He knows that it is coming up tomorrow, I hope, and that we will bring this to finality one way or another.  He has not clearly spelled out here that if any person, any exporter, insures up to £30 million that the average clause will not prevail.  I want to make perfectly sure here that the average clause as it is applied, and as it has applied so unjustly in this case in Limerick, will not apply here.  The Minister has purposely avoided this in his statement here.  I want, because of that, to point out to him the necessity for the inclusion or exclusion, one way or the other, of the average clause in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, but I must relate the average clause&mdash;it is omitted here&mdash;to the way it works in other insurance policies.  I hope I know a little about insurance as I spent long enough at it and I know how these people work.  You will bear with me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when I refer to the specific case of the Wicklow Harbour Commissioners where, with a stroke of a pen, the company indicated to the Wicklow Harbour Commissioners that they were no longer accepting liability.  That means they are rejects.  An insurance company, having accepted liability and having accepted the premium when it was profitable to do so, and because a claim arose against them gave, say, <Col N="139" /> 20 days' notice, excluding the Chirstmas holiday period, to the Wicklow Harbour Commissioners so that they had to go in search of coverage having been rejected by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Ltd.  If insurance companies are allowed to carry on in this way, surely the same thing will apply here?  This is what I want to see avoided.</P>
      <P>I want to go further than that, with your permission, and specify as briefly as I can the position in Limerick.  A similar situation has obtained in regard to the Galway Harbour Commissioners. Their insurance was annulled out of hand.  I am a member of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and if we have an accident in the morning the same thing could apply.  These people are allowed to take the cream and when the cream is gone and only the skim is left one must then search for some other company to take one on.  Everybody knows that having been rejected by one company one would need a four-leaf shamrock to be accepted by another.  That is how they work.</P>
      <P>I want to impress on the Minister the experience I had with regard to this case in Limerick, where the average clause was introduced.  What is meant by the average clause?  The Minister does not really know judging by the reply he gave me to a question last week.  I quote from column 1981, Volume 251 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Mr. Coughlan asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that, because of the operation of the average clause in insurance policies, many people fail to obtain the full sum which they were advised by their insurance company was sufficient for the adequate insurance of their property; and if he will bring in legislation providing that in future such clauses shall be null and void.</P>
      <P>The answer I got was:</P>
      <P>I am aware that some people fail to recover the full amount of their loss through the operation of the average clause.</P>
      <P>So, he admits in the first instance that he knows of this.  He goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> The effect of this clause is to put on the policy holder the obligation of insuring his property for the full amount of its value,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>What that means nobody knows.  He does not know himself.</P>
    <P>&mdash;by providing that he must bear a <i>pro rata</i> proportion of every claim where the property concerned is insured for an insufficient amount. This is a practice which no doubt will be considered by the Insurance Committee and I should be unwilling to reach any conclusions about it before I have seen the committee's report.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is not the policy of insurance companies to take it on themselves to advise people as to the amount for which they should insure their property and that this is a matter for determination by the person taking out the policy.</P>
    <P>That is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister was misled on this issue.  If the Minister tells us that an insurer who insures for X amount and when the claim arises for X amount has to take a <i>pro rata</i> proportion of that claim he knows nothing at all about what it means.  If an insurance company accept liability and accept the premium on that sum they are in duty and in conscience bound, in the event of a claim, having investigated the case and found it to be an act of God or an accident or anything other than a malicious act, to pay to the last penny the replacement value of the property concerned or compensation therefor but because of the introduction of this average clause&mdash;what that means I do not know and the Minister does not know, &ldquo;average&rdquo; could mean anything &mdash;the insurance companies are allowed to hide behind this clause in order to fool and blind the people.  It is taking money under false pretences and it is, I believe, a criminal act.  The insurance company which accept liability for any sum of money knowing that in the event of a claim arising they will not pay that sum are committing a criminal offence.  The sooner the Minister moves <Col N="141" /> on this issue to save everybody the better.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the insurance companies should get that protection.  An unfortunate person who has insured himself is advised by his company that he is under-insured and should increase his insurance, in this case to the sum of £58,000, which he did, having paid maybe three or four renewals previous to this and on every renewal date being told by his company: &ldquo;You are under insured.  Property is becoming more valuable every day.  You must increase this.&rdquo;  He did increase it until it came to £58,000 and he paid the premiums accordingly.  When the claim arose they went to his architect and he advised that the premises could not be erected on the foundations as they stood as a result of the disaster and that he would not submit plans to the Limerick planning authority because they would not be accepted.  I quote the letter from the Architect concerned:</P>
      <P>I confirm my advice to you that I would not be prepared to incorporate the foundations of the above property in a new construction to replace the buildings destroyed by fire.  These foundations, built as they were of bricks and stone in lime mortar on alluvial soil, are very old and in my opinion have deteriorated considerably partly due to the fire and also to the exposure of the elements.</P>
      <P>Apart from my advice against the incorporation of these foundations in any new building I must say that I would not be prepared to submit plans incorporating these foundations to the planning section of the Limerick Corporation on the chance that you might get approval.</P>
      <P>There is the advice of the man's architect. I want to refer to the average clause in relation to what the Minister has said about this £30 million.  Bear with me on this a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>I agree but I am endeavouring to point out to the Minister the loophole in this Bill.  In doing that I am indicating what happened in the case of the insurance company concerned when a claim arose.  When the Minister is replying I want him to tell us if a similar situation would arise with regard to goods exported.  Will the average clause be invoked?  Will it be invoked in the case of a person who insures his exports for so many millions and who later has reason to make a claim?  Will he be told that he should bear a <i>pro rata</i> amount of the risk? What the Minister said to me last week was that the person himself was as much the insurer as the people to whom he pays the premium.  Why should any man pay a <i>pro rata</i> amount when he insures himself to the extent that he is advised by his insurance company?  I take it I am to proceed, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle?</P>

      <P>Following the acceptance of that, I come now to the most important point of all.  I know that this company should not be accepted and that is why I quote their action in relation to the Wicklow Harbour Commissioners. However, there was a bigger question involved here and that is the right of an insurance company to invoke the average clause.  I want to point out to the Minister the consequences involved in the invocation of the average clause.  Despite the advice given by a man of repute, an architect of national fame who said that the building could not be replaced on its present foundation and that he would not go to the trouble of submitting plans to the Limerick planning authority because they would not be accepted, the first offer from the insurance company on an insurance policy of £58,000 was £10,000.  Mr. Jennings was paying £4,500 in premiums.  Then, like the man at the fair, they tried to make a bargain and they increased their offer to £27,000.  This was flatly refused.  Their third offer was £32,000. This was also refused.  Recourse could not be had to the civil court.  Why I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance company did not take into account the cost per square foot of the replacement of the building.  The insurer was advised by his architect that the foundations were not stable. <Col N="146" /> I read the letter.  The arbitration was held and the arbitrator wrote to this man's solicitor on 7th January, 1970, stating that he did not calculate the cost of rebuilding at a rate per square foot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair cannot see what all this has got to do with the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has got to do with the underhand way insurance policies operate.  I know something about them.</P>
      <P>I did not calculate the cost of rebuilding at a rate per foot.  It appeared to me the foundations could be used again and I based my award on the evidence of the quantity surveyors called in by the insurance company but with certain upward adjustments which I considered necessary because the quantities had not been extracted from the proper drawing.  I adopted the evidence of Mr. Ashton in regard to the allowance of the new for the old and made an addition of ten per cent for professional fees.</P>
      <P>That is what the arbitrator said.  Mr. Jennings would not accept the award because the arbitrator had not full knowledge of all the facts.  He stated that in his letter; he did not assess the replacement value per square foot and he did not take into account the conditions of the foundations.  He made an award of £32,000, and award rejected <i>in toto</i> by Mr. Jennings.</P>
      <P>Mr. Jennings then consulted Messrs. Nicholas O'Dwyer &amp; Sons, consultant architects of world-wide renown.  They advised as follows on 14th August, 1970.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Nos. 127 &amp; 128 O'Connell St., Limerick.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kennedy of this office carried out an inspection of the above sites as requested.</P>
      <P>The buildings which formerly occupied these sites have been demolished to pavement level and the resultant debris fills the basement of No. 127 and part of the basement of No. 128.  Accordingly, it was not possible to examine fully the remaining sections of the basement walls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> However, the following information was obtained:</P>
    <P>(a) The remaining walls consist of a front wall, a rear wall, the party wall dividing Nos. 127 and 128 and a central wall between the parallel to the front and rear walls.</P>
    <P>(b) The thickness of the walls was generally found to be of the order of 24&rdquo;, though at one place the rear wall was 30&rdquo; thick.</P>
    <P>(c) The walls were generally found to be constructed in rough masonry, though in them were included quantities of bricks, seemingly at random.  Lime mortar had been used in their construction, and whilst in some places this appeared to be in reasonably sound condition it was definitely crumbling and in poor condition where it was examined at basement floor level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak because of the manner in which this type of insurance has developed.  People who export goods, it is held, have enough risks to run without having to run political risks or monetary risks.  Currency might be devalued, and so on.  Contrary to what some might wish us to believe, this particular policy was first introduced by the second inter-Party Government&mdash; that dreadful government that did nothing right.  Export credit insurance was first introduced in 1955.  In 1955 the amount was £2 million.  In 1969 it became £10 million and now it is proposed to make it £30 million.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Here we have now the proof of the usefulness of this provision.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Coughlan, that one wants to be assured as to the manner in which this will be operated. The Minister proposes to hand this over to a company which, of its nature, is a kind of side organisation of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The directors of it are all supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party and in addition to that, like a lot of other insurance companies, as Deputy Coughlan pointed out, it all depends on how they are going to handle claims.  It is very easy for insurance companies&mdash;and they very often do this, and it is worse in the case of a monopoly&mdash;to argue with an unfortunate exporter who if something goes wrong in relation to his goods&mdash;say, for instance, there is a political upheaval in Brazil&mdash;cannot be paid for his exports approximately what he lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> The fact that they are the only company who had been doing this kind of business for some time is no justification for the Minister to appoint them exclusive agents.  I have not forgotten the row in this House in 1944 when the then Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to make every exporter insure with this very company and would not allot shipping space to any company on the boats of Irish Shipping unless they insured with this company.  I am glad that one firm stood up and was counted and they beat the then Minister and his secretary to the ropes.  The secretary was allotting shipping space to himself in the boats at the time.  He was chairman of Irish Shipping and he was allotting space to himself to import prune wine. There was a debate in this House for several days on the matter.  The leopard does not change his spots.  This is the same company.  It was honest of the Minister to have come in and told us of this, but it is just as well that we should have long memories.  I admire the company that stood up at the time and told the Minister and his secretary what they could do with themselves. They got support in this House from the then Deputy McGilligan, in particular, and there was a cave-in.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that this is not an excellent company.  That is not the point.  They are an excellent company. The point is that it is a different thing for a Department of State to appoint somebody as their exclusive agent in the issue of export credit insurance policies.  I hope the Minister will reconsider that aspect and think about allowing any company who are prepared to do this business to do it. The phrase &ldquo;which for some time&rdquo; means presumably that there were other companies doing it in the early stages.</P>
    <P>There is now going to be an overall cover of £30 million.  I see the most serious objection to handling this kind of thing over to a company of this sort which has this kind of long-term background.  I am not unaware that insurance premiums can vary greatly. I suppose one of the most successful efforts in this country was the Exported Livestock Insurance Board which was <Col N="150" /> established here in the early part of the war when altogether abnormal premiums&mdash;30s per £100&mdash;were being charged by Lloyds of London on our cattle.  The Minister for Agriculture came into this House and this board was established and they started off by charging 30s per £100 until they built up, in no time at all, a reserve of about £500,000 and then they proceeded to bring it down until it was down to 2s 6d per £100.  That was 20 years ago.  I do not know what it is today.  Even during the war years it was reduced to 5s per £100 because of course no Irish boats were being sunk between here and Britain.  It was purely vindictiveness on the part of Lloyds because on the day that Herr Hitler's Government announced that they would regard Irish ships as neutral if they were lit up the under-writers met in Lloyds basement during an air raid and trebled the rates from this country to England because of the German announcement.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is appointing these people as his exclusive agents who is going to control the premiums?  I am to be taken as being in absolute support of the Bill as on paper but it is this angle that gets under my skin.  We were late into this game of insurance against the political or financial risks that are involved in deflation and so on but, as I say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  The amount was £2 million at that time and this £30 million is a lot more of an increase, related to £2 million, than our exports today are compared with 1955 even though our exports have increased enormously and there is a greater variety of exports and we export to many countries.  We are all naturally pleased to see this but there are more complications in this than the Minister's Department realise.  The Minister's Department have always been inclined to gloss over things.  When I was with the Department of Finance I was constantly fighting with them.  They had a completely different attitude from that of the Department of Agriculture who of course had to deal with reality.  With the Department of Industry and Commerce anything went.  I am afraid that there is an element of &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; in this proposal.  This is a small country <Col N="151" /> and very often it is not easy to get more than one organisation to deal with a specialised kind of job.  But this is a tricky business, to keep the thing even as between the small fellow, the exporter, and the big fellow, the insurance company.  Deputy Coughlan was right, insurance companies are a pretty tricky bunch of people.  That has been my experience of them anyway.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for anybody exporting goods to know what compensation he will get if the goods are destroyed, not paid for or the man himself goes bankrupt.  If he insures them at what the company think is too high a figure they will pay him only what they consider the value of the goods is and if he insures them at a lower value they will say: &ldquo;You insured them for only that much and we will pay you only that much.&rdquo; The insurance companies have it both ways. They never refuse premiums.  They take the premium and pay the insured person on the lesser value.  This is not peculiar to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland; it is universal in the business.</P>
    <P>Export credit insurance facilities are now quite common.  They have been brought about because of a variety of reasons.  It is a kind of composite insurance covering devaluation, the bank-ruptcy of the importer, political change in the country concerned and ordinary marine insurance.  It does give rise to very awkward calculations at times.</P>
    <P>The increase from £10 million to £30 million is an indication of the extent to which these facilities are accepted by our exporters.  In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is expected also that the new and improved scheme will attract additional business as exporters realise the support they can get from credit insurance.</P>
    <P>There is no question about that.  This is an increase in business.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the aggregate potential liability could become an actual liability only if all the risks covered by all the insurance <Col N="152" /> policies issued should materialise. This is, to say the least, an extremely remote possibility.</P>
    <P>It is only actuaries who go in for this type of calculation.  It is not reality at all, it is a kind of mathematical infinity. The Minister then went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is, in fact my intention that, taking one year with another, the export credit insurance scheme should be operated without net loss to State funds</P>
    <P>The State is going to be behind the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and the introduction of this principle is extremely objectionable.  The State is going to guarantee a private company which is going to make a profit.  It cannot but make a profit because if it runs at a loss the State will come to its aid.  If it makes a margin the State is not going to grant that margin.  The company will be quite free to charge premiums which in ordinary circumstances will always show a profit.  We all heard the letter which was sent to the Wicklow Harbour Board from this company telling the board they would not insure them.  This kind of thing does go on.  Will the company under the scheme be compelled to insure an exporter?  Supposing an exporter has a row with the company, takes them to court and beats them on a claim, will the company be in a position to refuse that exporter insurance in the future?  Monopoly organisations are able to take sanctions against companies which other organisations cannot do.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a most serious aspect of the matter.  If an insurer suffers a severe loss and there is a difference of opinion between him and the Minister's exclusive agent, who is apparently signed up for all time, and he is proved right, can they refuse to insure him after that?  The Department of Local Government did set up a scheme in connection with motor insurance whereby people who were refused insurance by every company because of bad accident records could go along to this group and get insurance. Certainly they had to pay for it; I do not say they had to pay too much, bad motor car drivers are bad <Col N="153" /> risks, but ships are not normally like that.</P>

I am glad the Minister is extending this business.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have listened to the debate with some interest.  The object of this Bill is to amend the Insurance Acts, 1909-1969. If we had time to go through all those Acts section by section we could find a great deal to say on this Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that section 2 of the 1953 Act is a very loosely drafted section which gives the Minister power to make arrangements with insurance companies in regard to this commercial insurance company risk.  It would be much better if the Minister had to lay before the House particulars of the arrangements which he had entered <Col N="154" /> into with these companies.  Under section 2 of the 1953 Act he is really given an open cheque.</P>
    <P>I want to join with Deputy O'Donovan in saying that I think it is undesirable that an exclusive agent should be appointed to a plum job of this sort.  As I see it the insurance company which is trusted with this type of insurance, if we are to accept the Minister's speech as accurate, is really nothing more than an insurance broker.  The company will not be undertaking risks to any extent because it will be underwritten by the State to the tune of £30 million.  The Minister has told us that barring everything going down at the same time and barring every consignee going bust at the same time that £30 million will never be called on.  It is of the utmost importance that we should get the keenest possible premium because the Minister has told us that in the long run this scheme will be operated at no loss to the State.</P>
