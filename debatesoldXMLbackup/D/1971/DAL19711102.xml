      <P>I am not aware of any basis for the Deputy's statement that provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution are nullified.  The resolutions passed by the Dáil and Seanad on the 2nd September, 1939, pursuant to Article 28.3.3º of the Constitution, are of no effect in the absence of the legislation which would require the protection of the resolutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach, having regard to the considerable anxiety at the reported confrontation between Army personnel and gardaí <Col N="650" /> and British troops at Munnilly on 28th October, 1971, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will detail events as they occurred on the Border area on 28th October, 1971, which resulted in a confrontation between the troops of the Irish Army and the British Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in view of the tense situation which arose between Irish and British troops because of the placing of explosives on this side of the Border, he will outline the steps taken to ensure that incursions of this nature do not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I issued statements in regard both to the incidents at Munnilly and at Dooard. Copies of both statements are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>I continue to be concerned about repeated incidents of this nature and in the protests recently made to the British authorities I have once more drawn their attention to the extreme danger inherent in these activities of the British Army.  I am keeping the situation closely under review and the Deputy can be assured that appropriate action will be taken should there be further frequent or serious Border infringements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if any suggestion has been made either by Army or Garda personnel that the area of the Border adjacent to this which has to be patrolled from a particular post is too long?  The suggestion is that additional posts should be provided there from which patrolling would be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No such suggestion or complaint has been made to me, nor to any of the Ministers that I am aware of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach state what appropriate action he has in mind should any further incident of this nature occur?</P>

    <Col N="651" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will depend on the gravity of the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If an incident of similar gravity occurs what action will the Taoiseach take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will depend also on the frequency of incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if any regret was expressed by the British authorities or was it recognised that this was a breach of the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not satisfied yet, subject to their own investigations, that there was in fact a breach, but if there was such they indicated they would be regretted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say to what extent property on our side of the Border has been damaged and what steps will be taken by the Government or other public authorities in this State to recover the cost of reinstating public property and to assist private persons in recovering the cost of damage done to their property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been no complaints as far as I know that serious damage was done to private property.  Some cratering was done with the intention of setting off explosives, but that was only trivial damage.  Some bridges have been blown up rendering the half that remained on our side completely valueless and ineffective.  I am afraid I could not give an intimation of that damage in terms of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated earlier on that there were contradictory reports from the British, that the British did not accept the Irish version of what happened on the Border at this particular time and in relation to the Castleblayney incident.  Could the Taoiseach elaborate further on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the recent incidents, the two in particular to which I have just referred, the result of the British investigations have not yet <Col N="652" /> come to hand but we are in touch with them on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Irish authorities are in possession of these explosives can the Taoiseach indicate the origin of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question and does not arise. I am calling Question No. 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question down to the Minister for Justice which will not now come up, I understand.  Could the Taoiseach tell me if, in view of the fact that the Army are at present posted probably ten or 12 miles from the Clones Garda District on the Border and probably over 20 miles from a further point at Moy Bridge, he would not think it advisable to move the troops closer to the Border, because it is possible that if a similar situation to the one last Thursday occurs local civilians will move in and take up action before the troops have an opportunity to get there?  Does the Taoiseach not think it would be advisable to move these soldiers nearer the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to Deputy Cosgrave in reply to his supplementary, I have not received any such complaint either from the Garda or from the Army.  The evidence of these two incidents indicates that both the Garda and the Defence Forces were on the spot very quickly.  I certainly will ask that the Deputy's complaint be looked into to see if anything further requires to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the admission of the person concerned, who has been on a waiting list for more than seven years, to a suitable institution is made difficult by the fact that he suffers from more than one handicap but that special efforts are being made at present by the relevant health board and a particular institution to achieve his early admission.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In view of the fact that, as the Minister now knows, this boy has been on the waiting list since 1965, would he be good enough to take a special interest in this case and get the boy admitted to a hospital?</P>

      <P>I have read the history of the case, which is a very sad one.  This boy suffers from a multiple handicap.  Apparently, there are very few children suffering from this who could be grouped together for appropriate treatment, but I understand we are reaching the end of a long and very sad story and the medical superintendent of a home is confident that this can be arranged within a few weeks.</P>

    <P>Note 1.  The number of institutions includes all public and private hospitals in which surgery is performed.  The number of beds quoted is the total bed complement of these hospitals.</P>
    <P>Note 2.  The term &ldquo;geriatric hospital&rdquo; has been taken to mean an institution or home catering specially for old people.  The number of institutions includes county homes and private homes for the aged and similar centres.  In addition to the number of beds in these institutions, it is estimated, in the Care of the Aged Report (par. 7.22), that there are a total of 8,690 beds in general and mental hospitals occupied by geriatric patients.</P>
    <P>Note 3.  Private mental hospitals are included.</P>
    <P>Note 4.  Private Nursing Homes catering mainly for old people are included under Geriatric Hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>In replies to questions by Deputies Hugh Byrne and John O'Connell on 15th June, 1971, I indicated the main measures which had already been taken arising out of the recommendations of the working party on drug abuse.  I also outlined in reply to a question by Deputy Byrne on 29th July, 1971, the general proposals for legislation containing more comprehensive measures for the control of drug abuse.</P>
      <P>The consultations with other Government Departments on certain recommendations of the working party on drug abuse referred to in my reply of 15th June, 1971, have been proceeding and certain progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I hope to introduce the legislation for the control of drug abuse in the present session, including provision for the two specific points referred to in Questions Nos. 13 and 14.</P>
      <P>On 27th October, 1971, in my reply to a question by Deputy Byrne I outlined details of a programme dealing with the opening phase of an education and publicity campaign on drugs, including the furnishing of advice to parents, teachers, <i>et cetera,</i> the preparation of leaflets and the making of a suitable film in regard to drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Question No. 12 the Deputy makes particular reference to the provision of special institutions for treatment of drug abusers and their rehabilitation. The position in this regard is that a special out-patient treatment and information centre is in operation at Jervis Street Hospital which provides a 24-hour telephone service for persons wishing to arrange <Col N="658" /> for treatment or to receive information or advice regarding drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In addition, a special &ldquo;closed&rdquo; unit for the treatment of drug abusers has been established at Dundrum by the Eastern Health Board.  Accommodation is available for ten patients.  The necessity for an extent of any additional accommodation which may be required in the future is now being assessed.  Patients discharged from the unit at Dundrum may attend any of the psychiatric out-patient clinics provided by the Eastern Health Board during their period of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The board also hope to open in January next a new &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre for adolescents and drug abusers at Usher's Island.  Adaptation and redecoration of the premises is at present in progress.  This centre will provide an advisory, treatment and rehabilitation service for drug abusers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is in consultation with me and other Ministers concerned in connection with an inter-Departmental committee which he is in process of establishing to make recommendations regarding the provisions which should be made in the context of court penological practice for dealing with persons, including drug abusers, who have come, or are likely to come, into conflict with the law and who may be in need of psychiatric treatment.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, provision in the Mental Treatment Acts to enable persons dependent on drugs to receive treatment on a compulsory or voluntary basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what were the results of the inquiries which he caused to be made last year with regard to this mission?  Is he aware that one of the persons who recently directed attention to the peculiar activities of this mission had part of his property seriously and substantially maliciously damaged within a few days of making his first report, and can the Minister say what inquiries he has made as to the possible relationship between this dastardly act and the complaints that were made about this mission which certainly is far more expensive and extensive than the paltry trade with Czechoslovakia justifies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that any damage, malicious as alleged in the question, is a matter for somebody else to investigate.  This type of inquiry is normally treated confidentially and I would not feel free publicly to state what the results were.  Of course I would be bound to take action if the inquiries showed evidence such as is suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not rather peculiar that there should be a four-person trade mission for a trade which we understand to be no more than £1.4 million annually in imports from Czechoslovakia?  There are many countries which have trade with us far in excess of that which have no missions here at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously explained, there is a wide variety of social security systems in the member countries of the EEC.  There is, therefore, no single standard to which Ireland would have to conform on accession.  To facilitate the free movement of workers, arrangements exist for aggregating periods of insurable employment, <i>et cetera,</i> in different member countries, and for payment of benefit anywhere within the Community.</P>
      <P>The implementation of these arrangements is largely an administrative matter, and is not likely to involve any significant changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said no such thing.  What I said was that there was no single standard to which Ireland would have to conform on accession. The other implication in the supplementary question which I want to <Col N="668" /> answer is that on entry to the EEC we hope to improve our social welfare plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in two publications available in the Oireachtas Library, the titles of which are &ldquo;Comparative Tables of the Social Security Systems of the Member States of the European Communities&rdquo;, 6th edition, 1 July, 1970 (French version), published by the Commission of the Communities and &ldquo;Social Security Programs Throughout the World&rdquo; 1969, published by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite so easy.  If the Deputy reads these publications he will have different thoughts about the whole system because in many of the European countries employer participation is part of the benefits, and for family allowances, for instance, in France, there must be at least two members of the family before any allowance is payable; in Germany and the Netherlands there must be at least three before any allowance is paid.  There are supplementary benefits in accordance with the conditions of the family, and to make an exact comparison, one would have to read the entire publications from one end to the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>Further to my previous question on which I spoke of comparative studies <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ireland and the Six, which is quite distinct from the comparative studies available in the Library on the social security systems within the Six and the analysis of the particular systems, would the Minister not agree that there is serious need for a comprehensive and detailed comparative study of the Irish social security system under the six headings outlined in Question No. 28 and the precise current availability of these services within the Six?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not suggesting this is not going on. Officials from the Department of Social Welfare have been in Brussels on a number of occasions dealing with administrative matters in relation to technical adaptation, the requirements as a result of changes in legislation and statutory regulations which will be necessary when we become members. We are very well aware of all the changes that are necessary.  I would like to say here that we have benefits that many of the other countries <Col N="671" /> have not got at all.  If there is any difference it would only be in respect of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give details of how the social services in the Twenty-Six Counties differ from those in the North; and the total extra cost of putting our social services on a par with those in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking the main difference between the social security services here and those in the Six Counties are that our social insurance scheme covers only employed persons, while the Six Counties scheme covers employed, self-employed and non-employed; the flat-rate benefits payable in the Six Counties are in certain cases supplemented by earnings-related payments paid for by contributions from employers and employees; there are no specific assistance schemes in the Six Counties corresponding to our non-contributory old age and widows' pensions, unemployment assistance, home assistance, <i>et cetera</i>, but supplementary benefit is payable, to bring income up to a specified weekly level; there is no provision in the Six Counties for free travel, free electricity and free radio and television licences as provided here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the specific services including rates of contributions and benefits, qualifying conditions, <i>et cetera</i>, may be obtained from the &ldquo;Summary of Social Insurance and Assistance Services&rdquo; published by my Department, and the corresponding publication &ldquo;Everybody's Guide to Social Security in Northern Ireland&rdquo; prepared by the Six County Ministry of Health and Social Services.  Because of the differences in coverage and qualifying conditions between the two systems, it would not be practicable to arrive at a reliable <Col N="672" /> figure of the cost of bringing them into line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister for Health was able to give it in respect of health.  He said it would cost £30 million to put our services on a par with those in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the wisdom of giving a figure because it can be quite far out.  Our social welfare costs are now moving into the range of £103 million which is quite a formidable sum.  I would estimate that approximately half that would be required to bring our services up to the level of those in the North.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>Would the Minister agree that, in contrast with that, the total sum payable in Northern Ireland in transfer payments for social welfare is significantly higher than the total sum payable here, as a direct comparison of the national accounts shows; that with half the population that means that the <i>per capita</i> payment is about 2.2 times what it is here; and how does he reconcile that with a figure of £50 million?</P>

      <P>The balance of payments deficit on current account in 1969 was £69.1 million and in 1970 was £65.3 million. From such limited information as is at present available it is likely that the deficit in 1971 will be of the order of £75 million.  If exceptional purchases of ships and aircraft are excluded, the balance of payments out-turn for 1971 is expected to be no greater than last year.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my statement to the Dáil on Wednesday, 27th October, 1971, that there has been an improvement in the external trading position in recent months.  I also stated that the deficit does not call for remedial action, although it must be watched carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree there is grave hardship imposed on a great many people in cases in which the older members of a family are working and the family is a big one?  The father may be in receipt of a low wage and cannot keep the family in even frugal comfort.  Would the Minister not consider that some concession might be made by way of income tax allowance to those members of the family who are working?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that what the Deputy wants is that where the parent's income is such that he is not paying full income tax or, perhaps, no income tax at all, his right to claim in respect of dependent children should be transferred to other members of the family?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does concede that there is, in fact, hardship imposed because of this situation?  I could quote a case of a State employee earning £12 a week with a family of 11 children; one child who is working is paying income tax and the rest of the family are starving.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if there are not cases in which lads of 17 and 18 years are earning £17 and £18 a week while the father is earning £10 a week?  Is it beyond the Minister's ability to allow them to do the kind of thing wealthy people can do in order, legally and illegally, to evade income tax liability, through property and other devices while the ordinary chap of 17 pays enormous sums in income tax and, because of that, is unable to help the family?

It is family income that is taken into consideration and not the individual income.  There should be some way of compensating for income tax.

    <P>Sa Pháipéar Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge a foilsíodh sa bhliain 1965 d'fhógair an Rialtas go raibh siad tar éis a chinneadh go gcaithfeadh Gaeltarra Éireann bheith ina phríomhghléas chun gníomhaíochtaí eacnamaíocha de chineál tionsclaíoch a fhorbairt i ngach limistéar Gaeltachta agus dúirt siad gurb é Gaeltarra a <Col N="684" /> chaithfeadh dlús a chur leis an tionsclaíocht sa Ghaeltacht.  Is mar sin atá an scéal go fóill.  Ó 1965 i leith tá méadú mór déanta ar na cumhachtaí agus ar an airgead do Ghaeltarra chun beartas an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht a chur i bhfeidhm agus ní beag an dul chun cinn atá déanta.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a need for enlargement and rearrangement of fragmented holdings in the general area referred to by the Deputy.  In fact, the Land Commission have been endeavouring for some time to accumulate a pool of land which would facilitate the formulation of a scheme for rearrangement in these townlands.</P>
      <P>Heretofore, priority has had to be given to that part of the area fronting the River Shannon where, due to periodic flooding, the need for the provision of sites for houses and dry stands for stock was pressing.  To this end, the Land Commission have, during some years past, allocated some 175 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> There are at present six properties, aggregating 250 acres, in the possession of the Land Commission in the locality, while proceedings for acquisition of a further two, aggregating 67 acres, are in train.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of further lands to facilitate rearrangement of these townlands continues to receive attention.</P>
    <P>I am informed that employment in the district is maintained at a reasonably good level by Bord na Móna's Blackwater Bog.</P>

    <Col N="697" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister and his officials must have felt pleased with themselves when they left here last Thursday having heard Deputy L'Estrange, as Fine Gael spokesman for Lands, compliment them on the work of the past year.  Deputy Tully also complimented the Minister and the officials.  I should like to be associated with that and also compliment the Minister on being courageous in dealing with this problem of land which is such an emotional one for Irish people. Down the years the debate on the Department of Lands, particularly as far as rural Deputies are concerned, has always been an occasion for attacking the Land Commission, the Minister and the Government.  No matter what the Land Commission, the Minister or the Government could do by legislation or otherwise they could not satisfy the land hunger of rural Ireland.  This is principally due to the fact that there is not sufficient land available for those requiring it, the smallholders and the people who, if they had land, would make excellent farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years there has been a big change in land acquisition largely because the big estates, or most of them, have been acquired and the Land Commission now have to go into the open market for smaller holdings of 60, 100 or 200 acres and compete with farmers who are possibly trying to build up big estates.  While land bonds as a means of payment for large estates may have been acceptable in years gone by I am sure the Minister, as a legal man, is aware of the complaints passed on to us by auctioneers and solicitors from people who are selling farms about the land bond problems they have.  I cannot understand why we cannot have a change in this.  I know that the Minister is now buying more land for cash but I cannot understand why we cannot use capital moneys&mdash;similar to those used for housing and schools&mdash;in buying land, rather than land bonds.  Every speaker in this debate and everybody who has spoken in past years has been critical of land bonds which are not an acceptable means of paying for land. This is one reason why even auctioneers&mdash;although under the latest Land Act they will get commission on sales <Col N="698" /> from the Land Commission&mdash;are not disposed to sell land to the Land Commission who so badly need it.</P>
    <P>In the past few days there was comment on the section of the Land Act under which the Land Commission buy land from old people paying them a certain amount in cash and giving them a pension.  As the Minister said, 33 applicants have availed of this scheme resulting in 1,672 acres being acquired by the Land Commission. When the scheme was first introduced in the 1965 Land Act it was acclaimed by farmers, farmers' organisations and by the public as one way not only of getting more land but also of making sure that land which was available and which was non-productive would be used for the relief of congestion. Some 33 people have sold their farms and accepted these pensions but there are many reasons, apart from those mentioned previously, why people did not avail of this scheme.  One is illustrated by the case of the old bachelor living on a farm who has a nephew or niece waiting for him to die to take over the farm.  Now, with the introduction of this provision, such a nephew or niece is more interested in the bachelor or spinster farmer.  Even though only 33 people have availed of the scheme, a great deal more land has become more productive because the relatives of the old people are interested in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the self migration scheme for congested areas. He said:</P>
    <P>I shall arrange that the scheme be examined with a view to improving its attractiveness.</P>
    <P>I am glad he said that.  Coming as I do from an area that is designated as non-congested but an area in which many people may be surprised to know we have congestion so far as smallholders are concerned, I welcome this. When reviewing this scheme I ask the Minister to consider allowing this section to apply to the whole of the State.  I am thinking of the small farmer with 25 or 35 acres who sees a viable farm of 70 or 80 acres adjacent to him being sold.  He has no capital and cannot obtain capital from the <Col N="699" /> ACC, the Land Commission or from a bank to buy the farm.  I should like the Minister to allow such farmers to avail of the scheme outlined in the 1965 Act under which they could go to the Land Commission saying they wanted to buy such a farm and offer their own farm for the relief of congestion in the area.  You could have three or four small farmers in the 25-30-acre class who might be interested in buying the 80-acre farm.</P>
    <P>Someone may suggest that, if the Land Commission make money available to a small farmer to buy an 80-acre farm close to him, the price of land will be increased.  I can see no reason, if there are three applicants, why the officials of the Land Commission could not go down, as they do now in the case of migration, and say: &ldquo;Right.  We select candidate B.  He is the man we recommend to the Land Commission to buy this farm.&rdquo;  They would then estimate the market value of the farm and give this small farmer the opportunity of having a viable holding.  In turn, of course, this would also create further viable holdings because the 35 acres he had handed over to the Land Commission could be used to bring up the size of the holdings of the other small farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will have a look at this section of the Act.  Will he consider extending it to other parts of the country?  We are on the threshold of entry to the EEC.  We hear Mansholt and many other people talking about the small farmer under EEC conditions.  I do not know what the Mansholt Plan is.  I am not saying anything against Mr. Mansholt who is a very able parliamentarian, who was a very able Minister for Agriculture and who is, I think, a very able Commissioner. So far he has produced about seven or eight plans but to my knowledge none of them has yet been adopted by the EEC Commissioners or by the Council of Ministers.  We still have to wait for a definite decision to be made in Europe as to what a viable holding is.</P>
    <P>A viable holding in modern terms must be larger than the one now defined in the Land Commission regulations, <Col N="700" /> that is, 40 to 45 acres of good land or more if the land is of varied quality.  I think it was Deputy L'Estrange who referred to regional areas.  We have divisional areas in the Land Commission.  We have one in the south-east with its headquarters in Carlow.  I presume there is one in Galway and others elsewhere.  I can never understand why regard was not had in the Land Act to the fact that in different parts of the country there are different types of farming.  In the Midlands there is mixed farming. People are in beef, in milk and in tillage.  This type of farmer cannot rotate his crops on a small holding. Take beet for example.  You cannot grow beet in the same field for a period of five years due to eelworm or some other disease which attacks beet from time to time.  Therefore a farmer who, according to the Land Commission, has a viable holding of 45 acres and who is growing eight acres of beet cannot have proper rotation without taking conacre, or hiring land as it is sometimes called.</P>
    <P>From my experience as a rural Deputy, I think that the Land Commission plan for a viable farm of 45 acres of good land, or more if the land is of varied quality, is outdated and outmoded.  While a certain standard of living was accepted by farmers 40 to 45 years ago, today a farmer would require 100 acres of land of varied qualities, or 80 to 90 acres of good land, to have the standard of living which the Land Commission, the Minister and every Member of this House would like him to have.  The most recent figures I have suggest that a viable holding in Sweden is considered to be somewhere in the region of 130 acres.  We should be thinking of that figure in any future creation of holdings by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of land division, more and more we hear people saying: &ldquo;So-and-So got land but So-and-So should have got it.&rdquo;  We all know, as I said earlier, that one of the problems is that we have too many eligible applicants for the amount of land we have.  No two cases of land division are the same because no two farms are the same size, and no two areas have the same set-up so far as <Col N="701" /> the size of farms and the number of suitable applicants are concerned.  The Land Commission's scheme is the best scheme.  If some people who criticise the scheme adversely were asked to do so they could not prepare a better one. The first category of people who must be compensated in some way are workers who become redundant on the farm.  People who are suitable, who have stock and capital, who are married and have a family and who would make suitable farmers, are provided with a viable holding.</P>
    <P>The second category is the uneconomic holder living within one mile of the estate.  There are many other categories of people who would probably make excellent farmers, such as people who hire land all the year round and people with four or five acres of land who make a living from the land. If they are to get land, the uneconomic holder and the man who has been declared redundant cannot get it.  This will cause more problems in the future because the estates which will be available for division in the future will not be anything like the estates which were available ten, 15 or 20 years ago. When Deputy L'Estrange was speaking last Thursday he mentioned something about a double annunity.  I do not know what he was referring to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The full annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that when the Land Commission acquire an estate they give to uneconomic holders within one mile of it sufficient land to bring them up to 40 to 45 acres of good land and they charge the economic price of that land.  In other words, they practically buy it from the Land Commission on hire purchase.  It is not a double annuity.  The mistake probably is that where a person is migrated from one area to another he pays half the annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely different from saying that a man is paying a double annuity.  The migrant gets it at half the price and the other half is paid for by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise in connection with the activities of the <Col N="702" /> Land Commission is the question of housing.  I accept that the housing of farmers is not the function of the Land Commission.  Their function is the redistribution of land, the creation of viable holdings, forestry work, <i>et cetera</i>.  I welcomed the Minister's decision to give £500 by way of loan to a farmer to reconstruct his premises.  I know many small farmers who were very glad to avail of the £500 to supplement the State grant and the local authority grant for reconstruction.  A small farmer can get £500 to supplement the grant and any loan he can obtain to build a new house.  To me this figure is ridiculous.  It should be increased to something like £1,000.  The small uneconomic farmer is the lowest paid person in this country today.  He finds it most difficult to provide his own house.  The lower paid worker such as the roadworker, the forestry worker or the farm labourer, will be provided with a house by the local authority but those of us who are members of local authorities know that if a small farmer applies to a local authority to be rehoused the first problem the local authority are faced with is to get sanction.  The second problem is to get a contractor to build an isolated house.  The Land Commission seem to be more fortunate in this respect than the local authorities.  They get contractors to build these farmsteads.  Some body like the Land Commission must provide the small farmer with a house. The £500 reconstruction loan is all right but a loan of £500 to a small farmer to build his own house is far too small and the figure should be somewhere in the region of £2,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record my appreciation of and congratulations to the Minister and the officials of the Land Commission for the excellent houses they are now providing for migrants, particularly those with the hayshed and lean-to, which they have been providing in the last few years. Up to two or three years ago they built some sort of house for two cows, a piggery and maybe a house for a cow and calf.  The three-span hayshed and the lean-to is a big advance.</P>
    <P>A qualified applicant for an addition to his holding is usually a married man <Col N="703" /> with a family.  He has been struggling on an uneconomic holding for a number of years, say on 25 acres.  The Land Commission give him a further 25 acres.  He is immediately stuck for capital to stock that land, to till it, fertilise it, sow it and even reap it.  I know the Land Commission now have closer liaison with the Agricultural Credit Corporation and with the advisory services but if the Agricultural Credit Corporation do not give a small farmer the capital to work the additional land he has got or unless he can get credit through some other source, even the Land Commission, he will find it very difficult to continue.</P>
    <P>There are a few things I have mentioned which I should like to see attended to.  I refer particularly to self-migration, to housing and to the problem of getting capital for the small farmer who gets an addition to his holding.  If the latter cannot be done through the Land Commission then it should be done through some other Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The big problem facing the Minister and the Land Commission is the 130,000 to 140,000 small farmers who live on between five and 30 acres of land.  The Minister represents a rural constituency similar to the one which I represent.  I am sure he is well aware of the problems of people who are trying to live on that amount of land.  These people have a great number of social and other problems.  This is the big problem the Land Commission must try to solve.</P>
      <P>The average price of land for agricultural purposes last year was around £220 per acre.  The average price of land for agricultural purposes in the EEC countries is over £600 an acre.  I would advise people who have land to hold on to it to the last for the simple reason that if and when we become members of the European Community the value of land will increase very much.  People should do what they can, even in tough circumstances, to hold on to their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much good work has been done by the Minister and by the Land Commission <Col N="704" /> but I should like to see a much more positive policy.  First of all, the Government should pass an Act prohibiting all persons who are not already farmers from buying land.  This will have to be done if we are to solve the problem of the small farmer.  This problem is being solved to a degree by emigration or by some of them, though not many, being absorbed into industry. The Government should pass an Act to prevent people like contractors and professional people who have the necessary capital, or who find it easy to get the necessary capital to buy farms, from doing so.  If the Government are really interested in solving the problem of the small farmer this is one way to start.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that I probably ask more questions regarding the purchase and division of land than any other Deputy.  When a farm comes up for sale the Land Commission usually tell the people they will buy it if they can compete.  Deputy Nolan spoke of farms of 80 to 100 acres.  I am talking of farms of from 20 to 40 acres, or maybe even less.  If a farm of, say, 20 acres comes up for sale it is usually the farmer with 100 or 150 acres who has the money to buy it and if he has not got the money he finds it easier to raise that money than would a small farmer.  If a man with 30 acres got that 20 acres he would be approaching a viable unit.  If we allow people, regardless of how much land they have, to go on purchasing land, then the more they have the more they will get.  If the Land Commission and the Minister are genuinely interested in solving the problem of the small landholders not alone should they introduce the legislation I have already mentioned to prohibit all people not already engaged in agriculture from purchasing land but those farmers who already have 100 acres of good land should also be prohibited from purchasing land, particularly in areas where there are a large number of uneconomic holdings.  In the eyes of the Land Commission at present an economic holding is one of between 40 to 45 acres of good land. If the Land Commission are serious about solving the problem this is what they should do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> When land is being divided all those people within a statute mile by road have their cases investigated.  The Land Commission try to give special consideration to the family man over the bachelor, but in many cases a bachelor with a considerable holding, even though he may be in his sixties, may qualify for land.  The Minister should forget about this mile limit because often there are people just outside the mile limit who are entitled to land.</P>
    <P>I put down a question about the division of land in a place called Aughagad in Roscommon.  The Land Commission have held the 600 or 700 acres for quite a while.  I was not altogether satisfied with the way the Minister answered my question and I was not allowed to ask very many supplementaries so I decided to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  I subsequently found that I was not entitled to do so because it was a matter for the Commission and not for the Minister. If Deputy Flanagan is Minister for Lands he should be the boss and answerable in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is common belief amongst the farmers in the area I represent that political influence plays a big part in the division of land.  Many people have come to me with the idea that I can get them land; I am sure they have gone to other people and asked them to do the same.  I would like the Minister to state clearly that there is no such thing as political influence and that the Land Commission are an independent body doing their job.  It is up to the Commission to divide the land fairly and they should do just that.</P>
    <P>On the 1st March of this year the Land Commission had in their possession 1,272 acres in the Dunmore parish area.  I have been pressing the Land Commission to divide this land for some time.  The department in the Custom House in Galway who deal with the division of land in the Dunmore parish area have indicated to me that the land would probably be divided more quickly if they had sufficient staff to do the job.  I believe the Land Commission in Dublin are over-staffed. It is a great pity that the Commission do not send some of the Dublin <Col N="706" /> staff to Galway in order to help divide the land in the Dunmore parish area and in other parts of my constituency.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission buy land there is usually a house standing on the land and in many cases the house is in good condition.  It is quite possible that some of the applicants for land in the area will qualify for this house.  I know of a man who had to wait ten years to get a house and by the time he was given the house it needed many repairs.  If it was the Commission's intention to give the man this house anyway what was the point of waiting until the house rotted before giving it to him?</P>
    <P>Another problem is where the Land Commission acquire land on which there is a house and then find that no one in the area wants the house.  What are the Land Commission to do?  I have a case at the moment in the Clonberne area of Ballinasloe, where a family are living in very bad housing conditions.  As far as I am aware the officers in Galway are looking very sympathetically at this case but the problem is in the Dublin office.  I should be much obliged if the Dublin office would give a decision on the matter.  There are many other similar instances in County Galway.  I would like the Minister to look into the whole problem of houses on estates which the Land Commission have acquired and which are not needed to house the applicants for the land.  I suggest the Commission should give such a house to a family who are living in the area and who badly need to be rehoused.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister said that extra land has been acquired for afforestation purposes.  The amount planted in Galway has been insufficient. I am sure the Minister is aware of the case between Dunmore and Cloonfad where the Land Commission planted a large area which was subsequently burned out, much to the annoyance of the local people.  No one really knows what happened except that it was burned out.  If there is to be any further planting in the area I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that the necessary precautions will be taken so that damage of the same magnitude will not occur again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> I was lucky enough recently to be a member of a delegation of Senators and TDs who went to Strasbourg.  We travelled by train from Paris to Strasbourg and were able to have a good look at the French countryside.  I was impressed by the use which was made of every available acre of ground.  I was also impressed at the amount of land planted in Germany.  The Land Commission could learn a great deal from the way in which the Germans utilise land which is not fit for agricultural uses.</P>
    <P>A statement was made some time ago that the Department of Lands were going to be moved to Castlebar. As the Minister is aware, I am very interested in the Land Commission and I would like him to give me an indication as to what the situation is now regarding the Land Commission. Will it remain in Merrion Square or will it be removed to Castlebar?  I appeal to the Minister to take note of what I have said.  All the points I have raised are worthy of consideration but there are a few suggestions which would be very beneficial to the Land Commission in regard to solving the problems of the people I represent in the constituency of north-east Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the Minister's comprehensive statement before the House and we have some observations to make on it. Perhaps through no fault of his, as the political head of the Department, and through no fault of the public servants in charge of the Department, we must once again refer to the administrative cloud, the reorganisational cloud, which hangs over the Department and their future in the general administration of the State.  It has to be pointed out that the Minister anticipated, had political life been normal in this country, that he would either be redundant or rationalised or he would be in charge of another Department by 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must put on record that there is no intimation that the recommendations of the Public Services Organisation Review Group in relation to the Department of Lands will, in fact, be <Col N="708" /> implemented.  I do not know what happens at Cabinet level but I gather that so transfixed are the Cabinet at the moment with their own internal gut politics and so general&mdash;I do not include the Minister in this reference&mdash;is the mediocrity of a great deal of their political approach and general incapacity to get to grips with a Cabinet agenda that the role of the Department of Lands does not seem to be the subject of a necessary discussion.  It is important to point out, therefore, that 2¼ years ago the review group specifically recommended in paragraph 26.7.1:</P>
    <P>There is a number of clear logical reasons why the Departments of Agriculture and Lands should be combined, the principal of which are:</P>
    <P>(a)  The opportunity of securing closer co-odination and planning for the agricultural functions of the Government.</P>
    <P>(b)  The possibility of co-ordinating more closely, and managing more effectively, the many field activities involved.</P>
    <P>It is administrative nonsense and political folly of the first magnitude that these recommendations should remain unco-ordinated in the context of policy formation, from the point of view of planning a time-table and of a general execution by single administrative governmental authority.  The case has been clearly made for the fusion of both Departments and also for the fusion of the arterial drainage function of the Office of Public Works into a broader Department, but nothing has been done.  I have had no discussion with the Minister on this but one senses his frustration, as one of the four senior Minister now in the Government, at having to work at half capacity.  The Devlin Review Group were set up in September, 1966, and presented this report in August, 1969, but literally nothing has been done to-date.  We must record our serious concern and regret regarding this.</P>
    <P>The Minister, during the course of his statement, referred to the provision of life annuities under section 6 of the Land Act, 1965.  He pointed out that <Col N="709" /> this section provides basic authority for the scheme of life annuities for elderly, incapacitated or blind persons who might voluntarily sell their interest in land to the Land Commission.  The Minister is, perhaps, talking with his tongue in his cheek when he says that this has had but a moderate success and also when he talks about the very attractive features of the scheme.  I fully appreciate the difficulties facing the Minister in this regard but the reality is that only 33 people are now on the life annuity pay roll following the sale of their lands to the Land Commission.  That is in relation to a scheme which commenced early in 1967, so that this scheme, which has commendable features, only attracted about seven people each year.  It could not, therefore, be asserted that this scheme has, in any way, made a significant contribution.  The objective of the life annuity scheme which was to facilitate land structure reform should now be the subject of immediate review by the Government and a very sharp review by the Minister, who would be in a position to present more attractive terms.  I suppose we have no option but to hold out greater inducement to those people to part with their land in order to make this scheme the success we would all wish it to be in the future of land reform, of which a great deal still remains to be done.</P>
    <P>This is a voluntary scheme but we urge that there should be a full scale review of it after over three years effective operation to ensure that its various provisions will be fully analysed and that more attractive terms will be brought forward so that we can have a better system of life annuities introduced.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for such an improved scheme.  In 1966 there were 23,000 women farmers, almost half of whom were more than 65 years of age. We now have 44,000 male farmers of more than 65 years of age, and another 45,000 younger than 65, on holdings of not more than 30 acres.  This comes to an alarming aggregate and it has been referred to in a paper by Dr. Atwood on the structure of Irish agriculture and its development.  He referred to the population census and stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> About 42,000 of them were in the 11 western counties and 46,000 were in the rest of the country.  This clearly indicates that there is a clear and viable future for a large number of farmers in the west, although the number of non-viable farmers in the west was twice as large in the 11 western counties as in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>That means there is the considerable total of 112,000 farmers, many of whom could not be in the viable category, normally speaking.  Most certainly there is a very large number of non-viable farmers and therefore there is need for the new annuity scheme and for the various other efforts being made by the Land Commission. There is still scope for a great deal more work in the seventies with a view to changing radically the land reform process.</P>
    <P>In his paper, Dr. Atwood also stated that more than one-third of the farmers in the west are in the viable category compared to 55 per cent in the rest of the State.  We believe a much more comprehensive approach is now necessary, including the payment of welfare assistance on a somewhat more flexible basis than hitherto and more closely linked to the structural reform policy.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should throw up our hands in horror, as we have been doing, at the prospect of major structural reform in the west.  Many in this House have tended to do that.  There is considerable need for a fresh look at Government policy which has been stagnant for so long, through no fault of the Minister, Deputy Seán Flanagan, let me add, who two or three years ago was able to rouse an Ard-Fheis when he spoke of the need for a completely fresh look at our present system.</P>
    <P>We have had available to us statistical data and policy alternatives but no consideration has been given to these reports and alternatives.  They have been completely underestimated by the House.  We have had, for instance, the report of the Committee on the Review of State Expenditure which also referred to the scheme at present in operation.  There we had the <Col N="711" /> pleadings of public servants in relation to State expenditure to the effect that we should try to get to grips with this problem.  However, no special policy has emerged from either the Department of Lands or the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wish to make in regard to that section of the Minister's statement.  I wish him well in any efforts he may make to bring about a rational land policy.  Any such rationalisation schemes will have to be based on the economic realities of viable land undertakings throughout the country and we should not be so preoccupied with the 45-acre farm unit which was almost written into the Statute Book as a concept of Cabinet thinking.</P>
    <P>Dealing with other sections of the Minister's statement I welcome the information about Grennanstown near Athboy where a group of four Kerry families have been selected for the first experiment in group farming.  There has been a peculiarly undesirable attitude towards county migrants taking up such occupancies and the only analogy I can readily think of is the attitude, the intellectual jealousy, to the Labour spokesman on Foreign Affairs.  This has been the attitude towards group farming and towards those who surrendered their original holdings and took over 230 acres at Athboy.  I wish them well and I hope that development on a study basis will be adopted in our agricultural system throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's reference in regard to the operation of section 45 of the 1965 Land Act.  There are those who politically &ldquo;do their thing&rdquo;, as we say, about the vesting of interest in land to non-qualified persons. The Land Commission, under section 45 of the Act, gave consent to the vesting of 3,000 acres.  In the public interest, the Minister should elaborate on that part of the statement, especially where he said that a substantial proportion of the acreage involved consisted of the types of property which could hold no attraction for the ordinary Irish purchaser. What were the criteria with regard to <Col N="712" /> sales to outsiders?  The Minister might give us some general indications of what was involved in sales to non-nationals.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increased acquisition of land for our general afforestation programme.  The Forestry Division have always lived up to their good reputation in the past.  In 1970-71 we acquired 34,000 acres, and in the current year we hope to achieve a gross intake of 40,000 acres.  We are reaping the benefit of the progress made following the restructuring of the Division.  The increased land acquisition shows a big improvement since 1969-70.  This augurs well for the future.  There is a lack of public appreciation for this programme which is unspectacular but involves a great deal of work.  There are now about 500,000 acres of forestry plantations in the country.  The cost of maintaining, protecting and developing these planations is growing.  Forestry is a tremendous national asset.  The forestry programme reflects great credit on the far-sighted individuals employed in the public service in the Forestry Division.  These people have never indulged in any song or dance about their activities but they have succeeded in transforming great tracts of the countryside and have created a national asset of some consequence.</P>
    <P>In the latter half of the year forestry development will employ 100 workers more than had been envisaged in the original Estimate laid before the House.  The Minister emphasised that the public at large have now a great appreciation of the nature trails which have been made available by the forestry and wild life service.  With my family I have visited some of the nature trails.  These trails, particularly on the eastern seaboard where there are very few environmental recreational facilities, have meant a great deal to a great number of families living in suburban, concrete wildernesses. The list of such trails which has been distributed through Bord Fáilte and the regional organisations, should be made available to secondary schools, vocational schools and to primary teachers.  Members of this House have received information <Col N="713" /> about these nature trails.  Such information should be widely distributed to the school-going population.  There is a vast potential in the trails which have been opened up recently in the forests.  Our people will appreciate the natural amenities.  These trails should be used extensively by the public.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on the good work he has done.  I wish to comment on the fact that forecasts of the timber production in the new forests are being undertaken.  When I was a trade union official we had long and confused discussions with industrial interests.  Invariably the data produced by the public was not very useful in terms of statistical forecasting. The data was regarded with suspicion. I never shared the denunciation, which was prelevant, of the difficult work done.  The forecasts have now proved to be effectively accurate.  The new forecast will give even greater information up to the year 2000.  Some people have been sending memoranda since the 1960s to the Government.  We will have to accept the veracity of the information now being made available. This information is extremely useful in planning the development of an industry and can act as a major incentive to the timber industry, enabling people to plan ahead effectively.</P>
    <P>These are my observations to the Minister.  I hope that if and when we come back the Minister, Deputy Seán Flanagan, will give us any information he has.  On our return I would hope to see the Devlin Report recommendations implemented even if that means a great internal upheaval within the Department.  It is unfortunate that a Minister who, contrary to what some people may think, has the capacity and talent for running a Department has not been given an opportunity to take action even in relation to his work on conservation.  I believe that kind of policy responsibility could have been devolved on him during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I would make one final plea to the Minister, that he would bring forward as quickly as possible the game legislation promised by him.  There are many genuine interests urgently awaiting this legislation.  It should be announced <Col N="714" /> next week by the Minister before we have this famous vote and before Deputies put political expediency before their principles.  This legislation, if introduced, will go down in Irish history as a significant contribution to conservation, and there should be no further delay in bringing it before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Lands interests every rural Deputy.  Everyone who is elected for a rural area will agree that at least 75 per cent of our time as Deputies is taken up dealing with Land Commission business.  Therefore, it is vital to all of us that this Estimate would be as satisfactory as we would like it, because this is something on which we will have to answer to our constituents at a later date.</P>
      <P>The Department of Lands, including the Land Commission, is one Government Department that comes in for a fair share of criticism from various people, people who are anxious to obtain additional land, people who are connected with land in one way or another.  However, by and large, I think the Land Commission down through the years have done a very good job.  There is a lot that we would still like to see done, but they are dealing with a very difficult problem. Land is something that is sacred to the Irish people, and they are very critical of any change that might take place.  If any new Act or new regulations are introduced they are very cagey about these and are not inclined to accept them as fast as some of us would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One instance of this was the Land Act, 1965.  There was great ballyhoo about this Act at that time.  It was then the subject matter of an election in Galway North-East and the Opposition parties declared from every platform that if this Land Act was accepted the Land Commission would have power to take over land from bachelors and elderly people against their will.  The intervening years have proved how false these statements were; in fact, if there is any criticism I would offer on that Land Act it is that it did not go half far enough.  It is time that the Minister and his officials had another look at it and <Col N="715" /> made it more attractive in view of their experience to date.</P>
    <P>There is one section of that Act which I thought would be attractive to the West of Ireland, that is section 6, which provided basic authority for a scheme of life annuities for elderly, incapacitated or blind persons who voluntarily sell their land or their interest in their land to the Land Commission. I had hoped that that section of the Land Act would be very acceptable and that it would go a long way towards helping to solve the problem of congestion in the West of Ireland. However, I am afraid it has been a complete failure, and the fact that only 33 people availed of it to date is proof of that.  I do not know what is wrong with that provision.  Apparently the terms offered are not acceptable to people.  Goodness knows there are plenty of elderly people and others in the West of Ireland who could and, I am sure, would sell their land to the Land Commission if the price was attractive.  There is a great problem in regard to fragmentation and congestion. No matter how much land the Land Commission acquire it will take a long time to solve all the problems that exist.</P>
    <P>We had great hopes two years ago when the Minister for Lands announced this scheme of part-time employment for small farmers.  This went down very well in the West of Ireland and I would be only too glad if the necessary employment could be provided.  It is impossible for the small farmer to provide a decent standard of living for himself and his family.  Unless these farmers have some other income from industry or some other kind of employment, I am afraid there will be more and more of them leaving their farms.  This is one section of the Land Act I would like to see the Minister delve into with a view to improving it, if possible.</P>
    <P>Then there is the scheme of migration from the West of Ireland.  This is one thing of which I, as a rural Deputy, am not too fond.  In most cases we are taking the best farmers from the West of Ireland and transplanting <Col N="716" /> them in the midlands.  To me this does not seem right.  There are enough people leaving the West of Ireland already without having a Government Department contributing towards migration.  I am told it costs a lot of money to migrate a family to the midlands now.  If that extra money was put into the acquisition of land in the West it would help to solve the congestion problem there on their own doorstep.</P>
    <P>We have had experience in the West of Ireland of long delays in the division of land.  In recent times this has been overcome to a greater or lesser degree. This is a situation we would all like to see improved still further because it is terrible to see farms left for five or six years, derelict, nobody caring about them; people's patience is worn out by the time they get them.  As I say, things are improving.  Perhaps if more staff were made available to the local offices, the work could be dealt with more expeditiously.  Nobody likes to see land lying idle for a long time. The question of the shortage of staff should be looked into to ensure that the acquisition and division of land can go ahead as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is also mentioned in the Minister's brief that the Land Commission, before they give out land now, are manuring, liming and draining it and removing all scrub, rushes and so on. This is a very good development.  It gives the allottees a very good start and is an encouragement to them to do the best they can with the land.</P>
    <P>People in rural areas are very critical of land bonds and there is, I think, a move away from such bonds at the moment.  People living in rural areas are not in the habit of dealing in stocks and shares and, even if the price offered in land bonds is a good one, they are not inclined to accept it.  It would be better for everybody if the Land Commission paid cash for all land bought.</P>
    <P>There is a loan of £500 paid by the Land Commission to enable farmers to build or improve their own houses. This should be increased since the price of materials and everything else has gone up.  This figure of £500 must be increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> With regard to afforestation, there are areas in my constituency I should love to see planted.  They are useless as they are.  If they were planted they could form the basis of some industry in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in thanking the Minister for his comprehensive statement on the activities of his Department.  Deputy L'Estrange seldom compliments anybody but, on this occasion, he complimented the Minister for Lands on the progress made in his Department.  I join with Deputy L'Estrange now in complimenting the Minister and the officials of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission is often criticised but it is true to say that in the Land Commission we have as good a body of civil servants both in the offices and in the field as one would find in any other Department.  I say that as a result of experience over many years. Very often when criticisms are voiced and one takes the trouble to make inquiries one finds that the criticisms are unwarranted.  The fact is that the officials are merely administering the law passed by this Parliament and carrying out the various rules, regulations and directives.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hussey said that 75 per cent of his work is taken up with matters relating to land.  That is not my experience. I suppose regions differ.  Land values are probably far higher in Deputy Hussey's constituency because of the proximity of Galway than they would be in my area.  I do not dispute the Deputy's figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past few years the numbers applying for additions to their holdings are decreasing.  The number today is substantially less than it was when I first entered this House.  Maybe, that is because I am on the Opposition side of the House and constituents think I would not have the same pull that I would have were I on the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  Like myself, the Minister is very blunt and outspoken, even at the risk of losing a couple of dozen votes.  When people come to me about land I advise them that it is quite possible their neighbours are up with the Minister for Lands or with <Col N="718" /> Deputy Finn bent on the same errand and I ask them how they think it possible for the Land Commission officials to divide land if TD's are dividing it across a table.  However, people are new becoming educated in that respect. We can make representations and inspectors look into the representations. If the representations are worthwhile they make some little changes in their programme.  They do not claim to be know-alls.  They do the best they can to find satisfactory solutions.</P>
    <P>We have, I believe, been drifting along in our Land Commission policy for the past few years, to say nothing at all about entering the EEC, the Common Market, activities in Brussels and London, and the repercussions here.  I cannot understand why we have had no major announcement from the Minister for Lands in connection with the overall policy of his Department. Perhaps, as on previous occasions, he will make some such statement when he is replying to the debate.  I hope he will do so because the Minister and his Department have a vital role to play in relation to our probable membership of the EEC.  I shall be very happy if we join the Community because I am aware that such a link would have many advantages for us.</P>
    <P>Since the Land Commission took over from the old CDB they have tried to acquire land wherever possible and, perhaps, at the lowest price possible.  In the old days small allocations of three to five acres were given to smallholders who, in the opinion of the Commission were most deserving of the land.  I suppose that at that particular time these small allocations were helpful because the way of life of the people was quite different then from what it is now and, of course, the cost of living was much lower than the present day rate.  However, that policy is long outdated.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it is ridiculous to continue travelling the road that we have been travelling for so many years particularly in the light of our accession to the EEC within a short time. Now that Britain has decided to join the Community, we have no alternative but to do likewise.  People should be made aware of the conditions that they <Col N="719" /> will encounter within the Community. A number of people have asked me already what will be the policy of the Department in these new circumstances. The present policy of the Land Commission bears no relation to the situation with which we will be confronted within the EEC.  Without intending any disrespect either to the Minister or to any of his predecessors, I would go so far as to say that because of what will be the position in the future, a lot of what has been done so far has been wasted effort.  Some years ago the Land Commission migrated people from the West of Ireland to the midlands where they gave them holdings of 20 or 25 acres each and expected them to eke out a living from these holdings.  Perhaps for those who might have had a little capital this might have been possible particularly if a man's family were old enough to obtain employment locally.  In many cases the older members of families went to work either in the city or in England and helped to subsidise their parents and the younger members of the families.  Down through the years Deputies here, particularly Deputies from the West, advocated increasing the area to 30 acres or more. Eventually, the area was increased to as much as 50 or 60 acres but in the circumstances of today even a holding of that size cannot be considered to be viable unless it is worked on a co-operative basis or unless a man specialises in a particular aspect of farming such as horticulture or intensive pig farming.</P>
    <P>I mentioned co-operative farming in passing and the Minister referred to it also in his brief.  I hope that the new venture will be a success.  It is a very humble start but, then, bíonn gach tosnú lag.  If small farmers throughout the country could group themselves together and determine a workable basis for co-operation it would be to the advantage of all and would, perhaps, solve some of the Minister's problems.  Persons such as Land Commission officials, local agricultural instructors, county agricultural officers and organisations such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation could be of <Col N="720" /> much help in advising farmers who wish to embark on a co-operative project.</P>
    <P>Up to now there has been what one might call a reluctance on the part of our people to engage themselves in co-operative effort with the result that progress in this sphere has been slow but this is no time for dragging our feet and our farmers must be ready for the Common Market.  Already too much valuable time has been lost.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, one of the greatest difficulties that we have had to contend with down through the years has been a shortage of money.  No Minister has ever been able to say that he had sufficient money to run his Department as he would like, whether it was the Minister for Education or the Minister for Transport and Power or any other Minister.  Similarly, the Department of Lands was starved of money down through the years and whenever there was a credit squeeze it was a great Department in which to curtail expenditure. The Minister knows that last year he had to come into the House and announce that because of financial difficulties and so on a certain cuttingback which he regretted had to be done.  He regretted it as much as I did. I admired him for his honesty and truthfulness.  So did the people outside who appreciate being told the truth.  That is why I say that the Minister's statement on his Department gives one hope and confidence that we are slowly returning to the stage of making progress.  Overall, this is a progress report and the Minister deserves his due credit and recognition in that regard.</P>
    <P>About two years ago a discussion arose here and elsewhere about the matter of off-farm employment to supplement the incomes of uneconomic holders.  I shall not say who said this first.  The Official Report will decide that and I do not very much mind who said it first.  The present Minister and I agreed wholeheartedly on the approach to the solution of the problems of the smallholders in the West of Ireland.  It was said in many quarters that this was the ideal solution and I still think so if we could have it implemented.  We have made no progress that I can see in <Col N="721" /> regard to finding off-farm employment or part-time employment so far.  If we have, it is very small.  The problem is growing and is aggravated by the in-increasing unemployment in England. Many who traditionally emigrated in the past find it difficult to get employment now when there are about 1,000,000 unemployed in England.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the high hopes held out at that time regarding that kind of industrial development which would provide off-farm employment have not been realised.  I fear it was another case where Fianna Fáil were generous in promises but do not always carry them out.  In fairness to the Minister I am sure he was quite honest in his statement and that if he had the money he would do everything possible to bring about the desired situation as gladly as I would myself.  It is no pleasure to him to see rural homes closing and the people leaving the land as they have been doing for many years with the disruption and closing of schools and the decline in rural life generally.  In the old days one would see the local church packed and it was the same in the dancehalls with crowds of people, young and old, attending. Now there are fewer and fewer people about.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister if it is possible even at this late hour when some people, including one of the Ministers, say we may have an election, to carry out the policy on which the Minister and I are agreed.  I do not want to badger him; I know he is sincere in his efforts to do his best for his constituency which is also mine.  If he does that and tries to solve the problems there by creating more employment the people will remember it for him in the future and we shall all be happy about it.  On the other hand, if the election comes I shall have to discuss the matter on the street corners with the Minister, perhaps, in Ballina or somewhere else.  No doubt the Dáil debates can be produced and we shall have it out then.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Minister to tell the House and the country what programme or policy he has in regard to our proposed entry into the EEC. I have no experts to advise me except, <Col N="722" /> perhaps, the neighbours who offer opinions as to how problems can be solved and the more one talks to those people the more opinions one gets, but I have my own opinion which I have expressed here and I want to repeat it clearly again.  It is time for the Minister to let us know what the Land Commission propose to do in the future and what is to be the future policy.  Let us not have the situation where the officials throughout the country are in doubt as to whether they will be working for the Land Commission or some other Department within a short time.  There is doubt, I think, in the minds of Land Commission officials in different parts of the country as to what will be the future policy of the Commission.</P>
    <P>When land is being acquired&mdash;this matter has been mentioned already&mdash; the Minister well knows&mdash;he has come up against the type of case that I have encountered&mdash;that land bonds are not acceptable to anybody.  I hate to repeat this because I know there is a general condemnation of the Land Commission for wanting to pay for land in land bonds.  People say to me: &ldquo;I could offer a bit of land to the Land Commission but I am afraid it is bonds they would offer me and I do not want bonds.&rdquo;  That is what one finds.  I believe the Land Commission could pay cash.  Again, it is a question of money.  Whether the Minister can get hold of sufficient money to pay cash is another matter.  Again, in the light of our entry into Europe it would be good business for the Land Commission to acquire land.  They would get plenty of land if they paid cash.  In many areas the price is not exorbitant either.</P>
    <P>From time to time the Land Commission acquired land with a nice bungalow on it.  You would think that this bungalow would be ideally suited to a young married couple.  The young man might be employed by the local county council, the Land Commission or the Forestry Division.  The people I have in mind who would be suitable for these houses have a rural background.  I know that many girls today seem reluctant to get married and live out in the country.  They want to live in a town or at least very near it.  In many <Col N="723" /> instances these little bungalows have been left empty for three or four years. This should not be allowed.  The Land Commission should ensure that the condition of these houses is maintained. Some of them may need reconstruction at a cost of £200, £300, £400 or £500, or perhaps less.  It might cost a bit more if the work is not done in time.  The policy seems to be to leave these houses vacant for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I know reasons can be given for this.  I have discussed this problem with some members of the staff of the Land Commission.  They were kind enough to give up their Saturdays, when they should have been off for the day, to discuss this problem, listen to criticism and give their answers politely and clearly.  This is not a wholesale scandal but some of these houses are left vacant for too long.  The Minister should find out the number of such houses and see if it is possible to let them or sell them.</P>
    <P>I have always taken an interest in the forestry side of the Department's work.  I am glad to see that there is a progress report there.  I am particularly pleased that progress has been made on the acquisition side.  Anyone who knows anything about forestry and about planting trees knows that you must have suitable land before you can plant trees.  It must be inspected, or vetted if you like.  The acreage must be sufficient and the location must be suitable.  The price has to be agreed on and the title has to be looked up. The titles to many of the lands which are offered to the Forestry Division are doubtful.  Naturally a State Department do not want to be caught on the wrong foot by writing a cheque to John Browne when it should have gone to Pat Murphy.  There would be some Parliamentary Questions here and Adjournment debates, no doubt, if it were discovered that the Forestry Division had paid the wrong man.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Blowick introduced a Bill in which provision was made for payment in a limited number of these cases of doubtful title.  An attempt was made to tidy up this problem so that land could be purchased <Col N="724" /> which could not otherwise be purchased.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in 1968-69 the gross area acquired was only 14,108 acres.</P>
    <P>That was a frightening figure and if that trend had continued the Forestry Division would really have been in queer street.  In fact, it must have been in queer street at that time.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In 1969-70 the figure rose to 25,128 acres&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that was an improvement but having regard to the previous low figure of 14,000 you could only say it was an improvement</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;in 1970-71 to 34,436 acres and in the current year we hope to achieve a gross intake of some 40,000 acres.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is right on that figure.  It is a much more satisfactory figure and it will make it possible for the Forestry Division to continue to make progress.  I am delighted to see that figure and to note that the acquisition side has improved so considerably.</P>
    <P>Hob lawyers and alleged experts ask: &ldquo;Why do you not plant this?  I am sure that if the Government were minding their business and if you people were doing the right thing all this area could be planted.&rdquo;  One would imagine that one could stand up in the Department and press a button and trees would grow on the mountain sides.  These people do not know what they are talking about and they have very little appreciation of what has been done by successive Ministers. The late P.J. Ruttledge did his share when he was Minister for Lands.  He had his difficulties.  Later we had the late Seán Moylan, the late Joseph Blowick and other Ministers down to the present day.  Progress was made and, if it was slow, that was understandable. We have not got the freedom we have for so very long.  There were many difficulties in the way.  During the war there was the difficulty of getting seedlings.  There were 1,001 difficulties which people did not always appreciate.  I appreciate what <Col N="725" /> has been done by successive Ministers. If we were critical in this House about the progress, and some of us were, it was with the intention of trying to prod the Minister and the Department into action.  Perhaps we should have been a little more generous with our praise and in giving credit where credit was due.</P>
    <P>Last night I watched a television programme entitled &ldquo;Feach&rdquo;, I think, which showed what was being done in Scariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Feach&rdquo; is another programme.  I know what &ldquo;Feach&rdquo; means but I was not sure of the title. I watched that and that was the thought that struck me.  The present Minister was not responsible nor the Minister before him, nor the Minister before that again.  It goes back a good while.  The truth is that an industry was established as a result of somebody's work or the work of a number of people in that region.  Trees are being brought from Donegal, I understand, and from other centres, perhaps from Mayo.  This industry, therefore, is giving employment in Donegal and in Clare and it is giving worthwhile indirect employment in many places throughout the country.  It is amazing the amount of employment created by one industry, particularly an industry such as this which engages in export business.  It is impossible to put a figure on the real value to the economy of such an industry.  While I had some disagreement with the fellow putting the questions, one important point came out.  The raw material used is timber, grown in our own country.  I am sure it would be far better for the industry if timber were available in sufficient quantities in the Scariff region or in some part of County Clare or the adjoining counties rather than having to transport it from Donegal.  However, it appears that the industry was able to carry all these additional overheads.  Its products included wood for coffins.  I suppose we must have wood for coffins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forestry is of great importance to our economy.  We have in this country a <Col N="726" /> climate which is suitable for the production of beef, which we are not discussing now, and also for the production of trees.  We have a mild climate and a heavy rainfall, which is ideal for producing timber rapidly.  I favour the idea of processing that timber within our own country on the lines of the project we saw on television last night. In the old days I often saw stacks of pit props and poles lying along docksides for weeks or months waiting to be loaded for Britain and other places. There was a very low labour content in that sort of thing.  The trees were cut down, thrown into a truck and off they went.  One got one's money and that was the end of it.  When the timber is processed and all the employment possible given in our own country we are travelling on the right road.  I sincerely hope the progress which has been made, which was referred to in the Minister's statement and about which I was very proud to hear, will continue. I hope that whoever deals with this Estimate in the future, whether it is the Minister or myself or somebody else, will be able to show further progress in this Department.</P>
    <P>I met the Minister on the corridor a few days ago and complimented him on another aspect, one which might be passed over by many people.  I was glad to hear Deputy Barry Desmond refer to it.  I am referring to nature trails.  I am delighted with that development.  It is a wonderful thing.  Parents should take their children to these places and people should invite their friends and neighbours to go along.  I think if small children were taken to these places and shown the beauty of trees it would be a wonderful education.  They should be told that these State forests are their own property and that any damage done to them is damage to their own property.  That could then be taken up in the schools and this would create a climate of opinion which would be favourable to preserving our forests and preventing fires.  The fire hazard should be stressed.  The forests are a wonderful tourist attraction.  Even this evening coming into Dublin by car I noticed the beauty of the countryside with the leaves falling.  It was a beautiful scene and it made one realise that trees are worth planting and preserving.  Our <Col N="727" /> young people should be taught an appreciation of trees and we would not then have wanton damage, the burning of forests which we all regret and which is done by people who have a rather strange slant and warped minds.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned game preservation, which is very important. I live in an area where there was a fair share of game in the past but unfortunately people can cause a lot of damage to grouse, partridge and other wildfowl by burning mountains and gorse at certain times of the year when the young are being brought out.  It is regrettable that this should happen.  It is amazing the number of people who are interested in carrying a gun and having a shot.  For many years I enjoyed it myself and was a fairly accurate shot but I suppose when one is a Member of this House for a number of years one gets fat and lazy and not too fond of climbing mountains.</P>
    <P>The tourists who visit this country bring money with them which helps to provide education, books, transport and all the other things which children use at school.  This fact should be got across to children either by their teachers or through the medium of a little propaganda leaflet.  I remember being down at a by-election in Kerry. It was sleeting at the time, in fact snow fell the following morning, yet the local hotel in Glenbeigh&mdash;and although I do not wish to advertise, I must say it is a very good hotel&mdash;was packed with French tourists.  We have tried a number of ways to encourage tourists to come here for their holidays but if we can get tourists to come when it is snowing we really must have something. We should value and utilise the worthwhile amenities that we have.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that overall the Minister for Lands is able to give us a progress report, even though it is only a mild one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most hopeful and fascinating things that has happened on the land in the past year has been the group farming experiment in Meath.  Four families have been brought from the West and given 230 acres on a Meath estate which, according <Col N="728" /> to the Minister, is equivalent to 170 acres of good land.  It is hoped that this experiment will show farmers that group farming is both possible and beneficial.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party, in its document in 1969, considered a group farming experiment of the utmost importance. We insisted at that time that this was possibly the most important way of achieving increased production from the land.  The benefits accruing from the pooling of resources and the sharing of buildings and machinery seem so obvious that I wonder why the experiment was not carried out sooner on a larger scale.  Group farming is common on the Continent, but the Meath experiment is the first attempt in this country to prove that group farming can be beneficial to the farming community.</P>
      <P>The improvements and benefits are obvious.  The reduction in hours makes it possible for a farmer to take a holiday without having the worry of leaving his valuable property and stock in the hands of someone who may not have the same interest in or knowledge of his problems.  The problems are known to all members of the group, therefore holidays can take place on a rota basis.  In the event of sickness occurring the group can do the work of the sick farmer.  I believe group farming improves both the standard of living and the quality of life of the farmers.  They have more time for social and educational activities and they can take part in local community activities and local politics as well.  It also improves the bargaining position of the farmer because he is dealing in much larger quantities and can reap the benefits of larger production.</P>
      <P>I would hope such group experiments would be carried out throughout the country so that farmers can see the benefits and advantages accruing from what I believe is the best way to farm. I would compliment the Minister on stealing this piece of the Labour Party policy document and putting it into use.  I would suggest he read a few more pages of the first chapter of the Labour Party policy document because he would find a few more good ideas to put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> The Minister did not mention the EEC during his speech.  At a time when there is so much activity and so many programmes on television and articles in the Press trying to establish the pros and cons of entry into the EEC the Minister should have dealt at length with the problem of land in the EEC.  I accompained a deputation of Deputies to the Parliament of the EEC within the last fortnight.  We were given an opportunity to debate with members of that Parliament who are also members of their own Parliaments and who have responsibility, just like ourselves, to represent the views of ordinary people both in their own Parliaments and in the EEC Parliament. One of the questions I put was about the purchase of land if we were to enter the EEC.  There seemed to be two schools of thought: the members from Luxembourg and Germany were of the opinion that entry into the EEC would mean that land within the group would be available for purchase by any of the nationals of the countries making up the Ten.  There seems to be some doubt in the minds of the people about this question.  I hope the Minister, when he is replying, will clear up this matter because I believe it will assume much greater importance with the farming community when the decision about whether or not to enter the Common Market has to be made.</P>
    <P>The opinion of two of the people I spoke to was that if we entered we must accept Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome which stipulates that land could be purchased by members of the ten Common Market countries in the enlarged Community.  One of the French members had a slightly different slant on it and I hope this will be the position.  He said that it was possible for regulations to be drawn up by the different countries which would minimise the effects of Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome.  A person would have to be an ordinary agricultural labourer and working for two years in another country before he could purchase land.  This had more or less stopped the purchase of land by any of the other five countries of the present EEC.  I hope we will be able to introduce legislation, if we enter the <Col N="730" /> Common Market, to regulate the purchase of land by non-nationals.  I suppose I would not be allowed to go into detail on that subject.  I have to be convinced of the advantages of entry. I hope the Minister will be able to clear up the point about the purchase of land by non-nationals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy could elaborate on this point.  I should like to hear what he has to say on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the purchase of land is very vital to any discussion on the Common Market and if the Minister can set our minds at rest regarding the purchase of land by non-nationals it would have a very important bearing on the attitude of mind of many of our farmers.  As I said, the French have found a way out of this problem and I hope this can be applied here.  If the French can do it I am sure we can also do it if we go into the Common Market.  I am not an expert on the Common Market but I have my own interest in fishing and, perhaps, land.  However, I imagine the Minister will have information on these points.</P>
      <P>We discussed the problems of the Department of Lands on a Private Member's motion tabled by Deputy Tully and myself some months ago. We had many interesting contributions from both sides of the House during the debate.  The demand for land is increasing but the volume of land remains constant.  Certainly, in Wicklow the demand for land is increasing. The Minister gave us a promise during the debate I referred to that his policy towards migrants to the eastern counties would change in the near future.  I pointed out that there were as many qualified persons in Wicklow requiring land as there were requiring transfer to Meath where migrants usually set up.  We have had many fine farmers who have received land in Wicklow and they were a credit to the West.  The pressure for land is mounting.  There is a demand for more land from people who have small holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a demand by people, who are not direct owners of land, to settle on the land.  We have conacre <Col N="731" /> farmers.  They are very common in Wicklow.  They take several forms.  A conacre farmer could be a man who has no land at all or he could be a very large farmer who has a lot of machinery and is interested in a group farm of his own.  He hires specialists to advise him and he rents his land on the conacre system.  He may not actually farm the land but because of his financial position and his knowledge of agriculture he can see the advantages of having those people do the farming for him.</P>
    <P>The Minister should investigate this matter because I believe there are people who are getting land who should not get it.  There are others who cannot afford land, who cannot afford to take chances with regard to the high prices asked for conacre land, particularly in Wicklow.  I have great sympathy with the person who takes conacre land, who has no land of his own, and who rears cattle on the conacre land but who does not know if at the end of the 11 months he will be in a position to take this land again or whether he will be outbid in the auction the following year.  He might then have to sell his stock at poorer prices than he would have to if he had a guarantee of land.</P>
    <P>Under the present system this man cannot be granted a portion of an estate if he is a conacre farmer, even if he is within a mile of the estate which is in the hands of the Land Commission for sharing out.  I should like to see this man included in the Department's priority for land.</P>
    <P>During the past year I referred to the position in regard to vacant houses. I mentioned a case where a house in Rathnew on the Farrell estate was wrecked purely and simply because it remained idle for a number of years.  I am glad to say I had correspondence from the Department on this.  They followed the case I put forward and while I do not agree completely with the reply I received I must accept that it was in part correct.  They blamed local vandals for the destruction of this property.  I think it would be hard to prove whether it was locals, or as always seems to be the case, the itinerants are blamed.  I believe both were responsible in this case.  This <Col N="732" /> house was in reasonably good repair and had water laid on but the interior was completely wrecked.  It should be possible for the Land Commission to set these houses, not necessarily to farmers but to others in the area who are in need of housing.  At least the structure would be preserved.</P>
    <P>I should like to make an inquiry about another estate in County Wicklow. I refer to the Kilmacurragh estate. I have asked questions about it in the House and on each occasion either the Department or the Land Commission have replied that the estate was acquired only recently.  I am aware that the house, which used to be an hotel with an adjoining hall, has been vacant for years.  Local rumour is that the premises are to be reconstructed as an extension to the Shelton Abbey forestry school.  These rumours will naturally fly around when people are not sure of the position, and I urge of the Minister and the Land Commission to clarify the situation one way or the other.  Is the land to be broken up and divided or is it to be retained with the house being used as an extension to Shelton Abbey and the land as a forest nursery?  A number of small farmers in the area are interested in the land and I hope the Minister will clarify the position in his reply.  If the house is left there vacant for much longer it will become derelict and useless for any purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara asked about the possibility of bringing schoolchildren into the country on nature walks.  That is a good idea and this building at Kilmacurragh could be converted for use as a hostel with the adjoining hall being used to provide educational facilities.</P>
    <P>In the debate on this Estimate a few years ago I aired most of the problems affecting my area.  I should like to ask the Minister briefly to deal with the position that will obtain in the context of EEC membership.  I should like to say at this point that the three Deputies representing the county have always been received with courtesy by the Land Commission.  For instance, we had problems relating to the Norton estate in the west of the county but these have been solved amicably and I wish to pay a tribute to the Land Commission personnel for their work <Col N="733" /> in that respect.  I shall go on now to the part of the Estimate dealing with forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good bit of it in Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the four largest industries in Wicklow employing between three hundred and four hundred men directly and several hundred indirectly.  As Deputies are aware, Wicklow is very mountainous. It comprises about 500,000 acres of which half is mountainous and, therefore, a haven of afforestation.  It is a tribute to the Forestry Division to say that I was speaking to a forestry worker recently who is a member of the union of which I am branch secretary, and when I asked him if he had any problems he said: &ldquo;No. Everything is going well in my area.  The only problem we have is the way income tax is being deducted.&rdquo; This is an unusual problem for forestry workers because until a few years ago they, with road workers and farm labourers, were regarded as being in one of the Cinderella services.  As a result of enlightened policy on the part of the Department and pressure from the trade union movement the forestry workers are at long last getting a fair deal.</P>
      <P>Everybody can use more money and the forestry worker is not different from anyone else, but his main complaint is the system used by the Department to deduct tax from his pay packet.  As far as I know, the system is worked on two six-monthly periods and the average wages for the first six-months are accepted as the average for the following six months. A man may fall sick and may be out of work for a week or so but the tax deduction is the same.  Why cannot the PAYE system be adopted in respect of forestry workers in the same way as county council workers?  The Minister has tackled other problems and if he looked into this, forestry workers throughout the country would hail him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is good to see in the Minister's speech that 100 extra jobs are being created as a result of extra money being made available to the Forestry Division.  In the past year there have <Col N="734" /> been redundancies, two or three jobs being lost in and around each forest in Wicklow.  I hope the extra 100 jobs will be given to those who have lost their jobs in the past year.  In one area in south Wicklow in which men were laid off two months ago I made representations and the assistant secretary looked the matter up and told me that four out of the seven would be retained. The person who brought the matter to my notice is a married man who has been 27 years with the Department.  He told me that single men with far shorter service were kept on in the same area.</P>
    <P>The haphazard method of laying-off people should be examined.  I am told that the size of a man's family and his circumstances are taken into account. No doubt this is true.  In the case brought to my attention I could not see that this had been applied.  The position regarding redundancies in the forests should be improved.  I hope that the 100 extra jobs are really jobs over and above those from which people have been let go.  I ask the Minister to give preference to people who have become redundant, before any extra staff is employed for these 100 jobs.  A person who has given service to the Forestry Division should be considered, irrespective of his circumstances, before a person who is new to the industry.  A person who has worked for the Forestry Division should take precedence over outsiders when he is looking for reemployment. The employment content in forestry is mostly in the nurseries. There are many fine nurseries in Wicklow.  I hope that the extra acreage being taken on presently by the Minister will mean that the nurseries will be free of the threat of redundancy.  All indications are that there will be a demand for young trees for many years to come.  If the Minister increases the acreage under forestry he will have my full support for that work.</P>
    <P>Extra acreage has been acquired for the future development of the industry. There are a number of advantages to forestry in this policy.  The forestry walks and the nature trails, as well as the wild life, the shooting and other facilities are very attractive.  These facilities have become available <Col N="735" /> because of the development of forestry in various areas.  Such facilities attract tourists.  Wicklow is fortunate in having a number of extensive forests.</P>

      <P>Are there many deer in Wicklow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a few.  If one drives at night across the Wicklow Gap one may see deer on the road. There are deer around Ashford and around Enniskerry.  Wild life makes an area attractive.  Deer may damage some species of trees.  Nevertheless they are a great attraction in Wicklow.  A nature trail provides a fine amenity in a new forest.  The booklets issued by the Minister about the trails should be available to city people particularly. Many city people like to walk through the forests.  Last Sunday there were at least 150 cars parked on the roadside at the Glen o' the Downs.  Families were walking through the forest on the east side of the road.  The car park for that trail is situated near a dangerous corner.  Perhaps a notice could be placed on the road warning users about the car park.  Cars entering and leaving this car park are creating a dangerous hazard to other traffic.  It would be a pity if this amenity and its use were the cause of a tragedy.</P>
      <P>I was through the Devil's Glen lately.  There is a car park there which is 1½ miles into the glen.  One does not have to walk far to see the beauties of the area.  Much work has been done there by the Forestry Division.  I congratulate the Division for the advances made and for the fact that the forests are not littered with fire warning notices.  The people using the forest trails are not reminded at every turn of the dangers of fire. People are aware of the dangers of striking matches and throwing away cigarettes in a forest.  People do not wish to destroy the beauties of a forest. They do not wish to damage the trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some instances planting has been carried out right up to the roadside. This is a hazard.  Fires could be started by people throwing away cigarettes.  As these trees grow up it will be hard to get a view of the surrounding area. People will be driving in dense forests <Col N="736" /> seeing nothing but the nearest trees. The Minister is to be complimented on many aspects of the work of his Department. I have mentioned the problems, as I see them, of the Department of Lands and the Forestry Division.  I wish to compliment the Minister and his Department on the good work they are doing for the country and particularly for Wicklow.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy L'Estrange for the way in which he set the tone of this debate and also to thank Deputy Tully of the Labour Party for following in the same vein. Each of them was critical but fair. Each contributed in a constructive way to this debate.  All the other speakers who took part were equally constructive and I take this opportunity of thanking each of them individually. There should be very little party politics in the attitude of Members of this House to the questions of land distribution and development of our forestry and wild life.</P>
      <P>I agree that I did not, in my opening statement, deal with what is certainly a matter of vital interest, particularly to the farming community in trying to make up their minds about entering the EEC.  This is a problem just now dealt with by Deputy Kavanagh and also dealt with by other speakers earlier on. One reason for this is that there will be a White Paper produced in the fairly near future in which the overall situation with regard to the EEC and the conclusion of the negotiations by this country will be set out.  Even so, since I have been specifically asked to do so, I think it right that I should say a few words on this most important matter which I also agree will determine the attitude of, perhaps, thousands of our people when the referendum on the EEC is finally held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is that two or three directives have already been adopted but do not cause any concern, or should I say any real concern, to us. One of them is that workers living and working in a particular member country for a period of two years should be entitled to purchase land.  Another is that nationals of the member countries would have the right to purchase <Col N="737" /> abandoned or uncultivated land.  We examined both the obvious and the possibly hidden connotations of the words in each of these directives and had discussions about them through our negotiating team with the representatives of the existing member countries and are quite satisfied that these directives pose no problems for us.</P>
    <P>There is, in fact, so far as we can ascertain, no land that could be described as abandoned or uncultivated within the meaning of the terms in the directive.  For instance, grass is a crop and if a person takes grass from his neighbour, then that is sufficient to take the land out of the category of land that might be subject to acquisition. However, I should pass on from these minor directives to the major directive providing for the full right of establishment in land to the nationals of every member country.  In this connection a draft directive, as I say, was submitted but has so far not been approved.  The draft directive sought to make absolute the right of nationals to purchase land in all member countries and provided only that any restrictive legislation in regard to the acquisition of land by members from one country in another should not be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>Could I quickly bring in here the allied problem of the internal acquisition of land by people considered not to be desirable purchasers?  I was extremely interested to hear all the representatives of Fine Gael in this debate, particularly Deputies L'Estrange and Donnellan, strongly urging that measures should be taken by the Government to restrict the acquisition of land by people not in farming already and specifically by those living in urban areas, speculators, contractors and so on, types of people specified by Deputy Donnellan.  I was particularly interested, as I say, to hear the very strong attitude taken by those Deputies in regard to this problem, because it is very much tied in with the wider question of the right of non-nationals to acquire land here. Obviously if we take legislative measures here under which there will be a general restriction on the right of people to enter farming at all, then <Col N="738" /> provided these are non-discriminatory they apply equally to all members of other countries as well as our own citizens in an enlarged EEC.  I want to make my point clear.  We would in those circumstances, were we to introduce such legislation, then be able to cope with even a situation in which the full directive on the right of establishment on land in this country was adopted in the Community as it is now or as it will be subsequently, assuming that the applicant countries are successful in getting in.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we assume that it would be the wish of this House that restrictive legislation of the kind that I have mentioned should be introduced, then we would at one stroke do something which would vastly change the situation as regards the availability of land to existing members of the farming community and also the national posture as regards nationals of other countries.</P>
    <P>All I would say at this stage, since I must now conclude for the moment, is that I personally favour the suggestion that some such restriction should be introduced.  I will deal with this matter later.  I should make it clear that no decision to introduce such legislation has yet been made by the Government, but it is obvious from what has already been said in this debate and to those of us who think about the entire situation here, that if the pool of land we desire farmers to have is to be available to them, some such restriction may very well have to be introduced in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has acquired a new relevance and importance in the last few days because of the Minister's decision to close the college until this body is established.  This has given a special urgency to the processing of the Bill, be it a good Bill or a bad Bill, and to the implementation of the Bill in accordance with the provisions of the section.  I should like to ask the Minister now whether he is in a position to assure us that when the Bill goes through&mdash;we will want to facilitate its passage, I think, while opposing its contents&mdash;he will be in a position to proceed with the establishment of this board and whether he will in the meantime make sure that he is giving thought to the composition of the board and to the arrangements for elections so that the new board can be functioning as soon as possible this month, or early in December or in time for the college to re-open in January in any event.  There is very great urgency about this.  I know the Minister shares my concern here.  I do not want to go into the merits or the reasons for the closure, but I should like him to tell us whether he will be in a position to take the fullest advantage of whatever co-operation we can give him here and in the other House in getting this Bill through and whether he can assure us he will be in a position to move swiftly so that the college will re-open in January at least under the new auspices if, in fact, nothing happens to enable it to re-open in the meantime.  I do not want to exclude that possibility though I do not see any immediate sign of it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be assured I will be concerning myself with the possibility of re-opening the college at the earliest possible moment and I will be concerning myself with the composition of An Bord.  I will have to consider every aspect of the matter very carefully so as to ensure that, when An Bord is appointed, it will be permitted to function and we will not have a situation similar to the one we have had since the college opened.  I am as concerned as the Deputy&mdash;I have no doubt the Deputy is concerned&mdash;with ensuring that art education is carried on in a proper fashion and that individuals who may feel that the board is not satisfactory so far as they are concerned will not be permitted to disrupt the working of the college as it has been disrupted in recent times.  I do not want to go into past history, but I will examine the whole situation very carefully and I will re-open the college at the earliest possible moment at which I am assured it will be possible for the board to function.</P>

      <P>The Minister worries me somewhat at this stage. The problems in the college derive in part from the fact that it is not an autonomous body and it has not, therefore, been possible for it to be run and administered like an ordinary educational institution.  The value of the Bill is that it will create some kind of autonomous body but the autonomy is eroded by many aspects of the Bill. We will do our best to delete these and make the college a genuinely autonomous institution.  I do not think there is any possibility of getting a final resolution of the difficulties until this is done.  If the Minister approaches it the other way round and says that, until the difficulties are resolved, he will not appoint the board we will be in very serious difficulties indeed.  I hope that is not his intention.  The Minister must make an act of faith, appoint the board and let them get on with the job, get the college re-opened and working smoothly, overcome the difficulties that have arisen, make appointments and re-appointments.  It would be very difficult for the Minister to make sure the board will work; it is <Col N="741" /> a matter for the board to do that. Perhaps I have misinterpreted the Minister's reservations.  I am glad to give him the opportunity of clarifying the position.</P>

      <P>Certainly it would be a matter for the board, but we have already had statements made by certain individuals that they do not accept the legislation at present before this House and they will not accept the board. This, of course, does not preclude me from appointing the board and from asking the board to get on with the job.  The Deputy has stated that the problems arise because there was not an autonomous body controlling the college.  I should like to believe that but, without going into details, I would say there were many other factors involved as well as the fact that it was not an autonomous body.</P>

What I am concerned with is, if that does not happen, if the Minister does not find it possible to re-open the college, that he will appoint the board as soon as the Bill goes through, leaving it to the board to decide when and how to re-open the college, with what staff and what students.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2) (b), line 14, to delete &ldquo;if so requested by the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we come up against the second instance in which the autonomy of the college is affected.  The Minister may make the case that it is for him and his Department to decide how persons are trained as teachers of art rather than for the institution.  If that is the Minister's argument I would be very unhappy because any body of this kind must have the power to carry out the various functions appropriate to it and cognate to its main functions.  I do not think any educational institution should be constricted.  I do not think the charter of a university should say that it should not do certain kinds of teaching or do them only with the permission of the Minister.  I do not think the charter of the NUI or the equivalent document relating to Dublin University contains <Col N="743" /> any such provisions.  It seems to me to be inappropriate that an educational institution of this kind should be precluded from carrying out this type of function.  If they believe that they can usefully provide a course in the training of persons as teachers of art which, in fact, the existing institution are doing, they should be enabled to do so and have the power to decide this for themselves.  The introduction of the Minister into this question is contrary to past practice in institutions of this kind.  It is undersirable in itself and, in this particular instance, is rather irrelevant because what we are talking about here in subsection (2) (b) is the training of persons as teachers of art, which is one of the functions of the college at this time.  I do not see any reason why the new board should be permitted to carry out this function only if requested by the Minister.  The Minister may have reasons for this that I have not grasped and, if so, I would be happy to give him the opportunity of telling us what these reasons are. However, it seems to me that the phrase &ldquo;if so requested by the Minister&rdquo; should be deleted in both these instances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>My view on this is different from the view expressed by the Deputy.  This is mainly because it is proposed to establish An Foras Oideachais which will deal in general with the training of teachers.  Because of this I would prefer not to make a decision on the training of art teachers until this body are established and have given me advice as they think fit in relation to the training of art teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course present thinking on the matter is that the College of Art is the proper place in which to train teachers of art but should I get advice from An Foras Oideachais that the training of teachers should take place elsewhere than in the College of Art I wish to leave myself free to make a decision. Were I not to insist on the phrase &ldquo;if so requested by the Minister,&rdquo; being retained in these two sections, it could mean that if I were advised by An Foras Oideachais that the training of art teachers should take place in a <Col N="744" /> place other than the College of Art, either I would not be able, if I so wished, to conform with the advice given to me or I would have a situation whereby art teachers would be being trained in two different areas.  For that reason I consider myself to be justified in retaining the words &ldquo;if so requested by the Minister,&rdquo; in these two sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In the unavoidable absence of Deputy Thornley I am putting the point of view of the Labour Party on these matters.  On the face of it, the argument put forward by the Minister for the retention of the subsections which these two amendments seek to delete is a plausible one.  However, the argument does not stand up to analysis because if we are to consider the possibility of advice being given to the effect that art teachers should be trained elsewhere, that would imply inevitably that there must be another school of art.  I do not think anybody has ever suggested that the training of artists could be separated from the training of art teachers.  Both roles are inseparable.  Either the Minister is anticipating that An Foras Oideachais will advise him to set up another art school, in which case there would be the question of the partitioning of the training of art teachers between the two schools or, else, he is suggesting that it is possible to train teachers of art in an institution other than the school of art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody could entertain the latter proposition for a moment and in view of the resources of the country and the possibilities of valid art training, I do not think that the former suggestion regarding the setting up of a second college of art is realistic either.  It seems to me that the Minister, under this argument of retaining freedom to respond to whatever advice An Foras Oideachais may give him, is cloaking his desire or determination to retain the power to direct what this school of art will do. There are many amendments to this Bill and we do not intend to delay unduly its passage through the House. It is our hope that the situation will be resolved as quickly as possible.  The centre of the matter is whether one can trust people who are given a good deal <Col N="745" /> of autonomy, and who are professionals, to dedicate themselves to carry out, in line with modern requirements, the teaching of art and also the training of art teachers, or whether power should be retained in the hands of a Minister which in reality often means in the hands of his senior civil servants. I hope we do not become too acrimonious on this but I would have thought that because of the history of this country during the past 40 years or so and because of the experience of every other country, civil servants are unsuited entirely to that task.  I would urge the Minister to clear the air at the beginning of what is now an extremely unpleasant situation in which there are groups of people who are divided deeply and who, unfortunately, are not even talking to each other.  He should clear the air by disclaiming the desire to retain that sort of control by acclaiming the willingness to trust the persons who are appointed to administer this art school.  In the universities it is not for a Minister to say what should be carried out in the different faculties because such is the responsibility of the professional bodies and of the university.  Such is their commitment to their own professions that they discharge those responsibilities adequately and no directions from Ministers could improve on this discharging of those duties.  I would urge the Minister to accept the amendments as a kind of declaration on his side of a real willingness to see the devolution of power, a real willingness to trust the members of the groups who are going to administer the art school and a real willingness to get away from control through a Government Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of Deputy Keating's misgivings would seem to have stemmed from his misunderstanding of this matter, or of his having developed grounds for apprehension that are non-existent. The Minister stated clearly that present thinking is that the College of Art is the proper place for the training of art teachers.  When Deputy Keating said that to have them trained elsewhere would be retaining power in the hands of the Minister he, obviously, cannot <Col N="746" /> be aware as no one can be aware at this stage, of the power which the Minister will have over anybody operating under An Foras Oideachais.</P>
      <P>Therefore it is not a question of the Minister, without having recommendation of some other body or acting through some other body, retaining power for himself or his Department. In saying that, the Deputy is reading a provision into the section that is not there.  It is quite clear to me that it is in the College of Art that the training of art teachers will be undertaken but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot anticipate what recommendations may be made but, broadly, I would agree with Deputy Keating.  However, his misgivings as expressed in such phrases as &ldquo;retaining power in the hands of the Minister&rdquo; are not justified.  This is clearly not the case.  Otherwise the purpose of the Bill and even the purpose of An Foras Oideachais would be, I think, defeated.  Apparently this is something that causes Deputy FitzGerald to be amused.  He appears to think, if I may interpret his amusement, that this whole Bill may be only some sort of exercise in whitewashing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is not there.  The wording of this Bill does not indicate that the Minister or his advisers, even presuming for a moment that An Foras Oideachais took this rather unusual step to advise him to set up elsewhere, would determine the nature and scope and extent of these courses: it is simply that they would provide a course at the request of the Minister.  If we just look at what the words say and do not read these misgivings into them at this time we would do better.  In view of the fact that An Foras Oideachais will be charged with the whole promotion of teacher-training, <Col N="747" /> one cannot anticipate at this stage or tie their hands but I think the likelihood is, as the Minister has indicated, that this will reside in the College of Art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given us a wonderful picture of what is involved here but the Bill does not say anything about it.  The Bill does not mention An Foras Oideachais, no doubt for the very good reason that the body is not yet in existence.  It does not even say &ldquo;If so requested by a body established for the purpose of supervising teacher training&rdquo; or words to that effect, similar to the amendment which the Minister is substituting, I think, under subsection (2) (i) in another context.  There is no mention of An Foras Oideachais and this is simply a figment of the Parliamentary Secretary's imagination from a legal point of view.  He may happen to know from talking to the Minister that the present Minister's intention is that he would only exercise this power if advised by a body not now in existence, which he also knows from talking to the Minister that the Minister intends to establish.  That is great stuff but it is not legislation which involves laying down in black and white and legally binding form what can and cannot be done.  So far as we are concerned the Bill, as drafted, simply gives the power to the Minister to decide whether or not courses for the training of teachers of art will be provided in this particular body.  He has the power. There is no question of his having to get advice or having to take it or who is to advice him.  That is not mentioned. It is very interesting to speculate as to what might happen but it is not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found Deputy Keating's argument most cogent throughout.  I could not have put it better; in fact, I would not have put it as well.  I shall not, therefore, attempt to embroider or add to it. But what I had intended to say before the Parliamentary Secretary rose was that, if the Minister is making the case which he is making in the matter of An Foras Oideachais and its function, then if he is going to give that body the <Col N="748" /> autonomy it should have, the wording here should be &ldquo;... if so requested by a body established to supervise the training of teachers...&rdquo; It is perfectly all right to describe in suitably general terms the functions of An Foras Oideachais.  In fact, the Minister's reply to that presumably would be no, that he must retain the power to do that but he will take their advice and, as Ministers of this Government have frequently done before, assure us that he will have regard to the advice given to him and would never dream of acting contrary to that advice.  But that is not legislation.  Our job in the Opposition is to ensure that the legislation gives genuine autonomy.  The only dimension the Minister added to what we knew already is that not alone is the College of Art not going to have autonomy in this matter but neither is An Foras Oideachais and that, in fact, all it will do is advise him and that he will now take the decisions rather than An Foras Oideachais or the National College of Art.  He has added a further dimension of non-autonomy to what is in the Bill already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that I have final responsibility in relation to educational matters. The whole question of teacher training is at present under consideration and examination.  As Deputy Keating mentioned, there is no question of my not trusting those who will be members of the board.  My point is that because the whole question of teacher-training in relation to various aspects of the educational field is under examination and we do not know what final decisions will be made, in my view it was wise to ensure that if advice were given to me by An Foras Oideachais in relation to art training I would be in a position where I could make a decision.  By removing the words &ldquo;if so requested by the Minister...&rdquo;  I think I should be leaving myself in the position where I would not be able to put into operation advice given to me by An Foras Oideachais with which I might agree. However, as a gesture of goodwill I shall consider before the next Stage whether I will delete these words.  I cannot say now that I am satisfied with <Col N="749" /> the arguments put forward by Deputies opposite but I shall consider the matter before the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for saying he will consider the amendment and I suggest to him, perhaps, as a further technical reason that, as drafted, I do not think the Bill does what he wants to do.  It says that they shall provide courses if requested by him.  When the board is established and goes into operation&mdash;we hope in the very near future&mdash;the Minister will have to decide if he is going to stop them from training teachers of art as from next January or whatever date this provision comes into effect.  If he is not going to stop them, then he must request them to do it.  But the Bill does not make any provision for him de-requesting them.  If he really wants it to achieve what he says he should word it the other way round and say &ldquo;...unless requested by the Minister not to do so, they will provide courses....&rdquo;  As it stands he will have to request them to do so, so that the courses will be allowed to continue.  I do not think as the Bill is drafted he would have any power to revoke that, if I understand the meaning of the words used.  I do not want to put bad thoughts into the Minister's mind about substituting anything else but I would like to suggest to him that it is another good reason for deleting what is there.</P>

      <P>I should also like to welcome the Minister's undertaking to consider the matter and to suggest to him that the only circumstances I could visualise in which he would need this power is where he received advice from An Foras Oideachais that the College of Art was not the right place for art teacher training and he had to have it done elsewhere.  The Minister does not need that power in this Bill because he possesses the power to say to the secondary schools that &ldquo;as from a certain date we shall not recognise the qualifications given by the College of Art&rdquo;.  He could switch it off in that way at any time he wished.  As Deputy FitzGerald said, it is the power to stop them that the Minister needs and I suggest he has that already and does not need to write it into a Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (e), lines 24 and 25, to delete &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here again the Minister's consent is required for schemes giving scholarships, bursaries, prizes and awards. The Minister, of course, will retain a budgetary function in regard to this body as he does in regard to other educational bodies which are wholly or partly dependent on State finance. It is quite proper that he should.  In fact, the one function the Minister for Education must have is that of allocating scarce resources between the different educational institutions.  Incidentally, I would differ from him in his interpretation of his functions.  In his last few words here he spoke of having &ldquo;final responsibility in relation to educational matters&rdquo;.  So far as educational matters are matters for a Government the Minister has the final responsibility but I think there is a difference in approach here because my approach would be that the Minister's job is to devolve as much as possible the function of providing education and the function of dealing with curriculum examinations to relevant expert bodies and not to involve himself in that area and that the more devolution the better in that area while retaining control of resources which, of course, is essential because of the allocatory function of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular instance it seems to me that the basic financial control which the Minister will have over this body, that is, deciding how much money to give it, will give him sufficient power to prevent the &ldquo;dissipation&rdquo;&mdash;and I use the word in inverted commas&mdash;of its resources in scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other awards which he might not approve <Col N="751" /> of.  Such a body must have the power to decide for itself, on its own expert knowledge of the needs of the students, the kind of incentives required to encourage them to high performance in particular fields, what bursaries and prizes it should give within the limits imposed by its budget.</P>
    <P>I do not think that its carrying out of this function, an essential function of any third level educational institution, should be limited by requiring the specific consent of the Minister to a particular scheme.  Again, this is not the case with other third level educational institutions.  Universities have their own scholarships, bursaries and prizes so that they can facilitate students where this is thought desirable. I do not think that can be done satisfactorily except by such an institution itself.  The Minister's understandable desire to ensure that the educational resources are well used can be adequately implemented and put into effect by his general budgetary control. It is inappropriate for him to have the power of intervention in detailed matters.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the universities would be very disconcerted if they thought he felt he should have the power to decide how many second year scholarships were given in modern languages.  The Minister has no thought of doing anything of the kind.  I suspect that he has no interest in interfering in the scholarship and bursary provisions of the universities and that no such thought has entered his mind.  I do not quite know why it should have entered his mind in relation to this college. I can only assume&mdash;and there is evidence of this throughout the Bill&mdash; that the fact that this institution has been under the close supervision and control of the Department of Education for so long has led him to view it in a rather different light from the light in which he views other third level educational institutions which have a longer autonomy.  I suggest that he should stand back from his unhappy experience of this college and try to look on it in the light in which we on this side of the House are looking on it, as a third level educational institution which <Col N="752" /> should be dealt with in a similar manner to other third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider between now and Report Stage if necessary, if he cannot make up his mind on the spot on this issue, having heard the arguments, the deletion of these words and exercising whatever control he thinks proper over the finances of the college through the general budgetary mechanism rather than through claiming a right here which he does not claim and does not seek and which he would be the first to admit he should not have in relation to other third level educational institutions such as universities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I should emphasise that the Minister's control is in reference to the scope and the extent of the schemes and not to their actual administration.  I am convinced that the board could not be allowed, for example, to run counter to other schemes of a similar nature and in relation to which the Minister has a responsibility&mdash;for instance, in relation to higher education grants and scholarships. It would not be possible to treat these scholarships in isolation from the general scheme of scholarships, and so on, in the higher education field.  In a sense I have extended the scope of these scholarships.  We should not refer all the time to the universities; there are other institutions to which the scope of these scholarships has been extended, not under the legislation.</P>

      <P>If we did not have &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; here, it would mean that there could be a very wide variation between the types of grants and scholarships and bursaries made available by this college which would immediately invite comparison with those available in other colleges.  For this reason, and again emphasising that the Minister's control simply refers to the scope and extent of the scheme, I feel that I should leave the words as they stand in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be overlooking the present pattern of scholarships and grants.  The position is that we have a scheme of grants for university education and also for other forms of higher level education which are of degree standard.  That system of grants has a special function of ensuring, within the limits operating at the moment which are too restrictive, a measure of social equality.  That is not what scholarships, prizes, bursaries and other awards are.  Despite what he said about the universities, I would suggest that the Minister should have a look at the calendar of any university at this moment to see the extraordinarily wide range of scholarships, bursaries and awards given by these universities, additional to but separate from and for totally different purposes from the grants.  The Minister's remarks suggest to me a certain confusion of thought.  He wants to ensure that this body does not have a grant scheme which would be different from the national grants scheme.  I quite see the force of that.  Of course the national grants scheme, designed to secure a measure of social equality, should apply to this college, if this college and its qualifications and standards and length of study are in line with those of the other institutions which may at the present time or in future benefit from these grants.  Of course this college should not be starting up its own grant scheme separate from and with different conditions from the national grants scheme for third level education.  On that I am at one with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not what the amendment says.  The amendment does not refer to these grants at all.  It refers to things <Col N="754" /> which are, of their nature, different and which are, by definition, different. Scholarships, prizes and other awards are given primarily as incentives to performance, in fact, in many cases exclusively so, which normally, although there are some exceptions to this, are not related to means tests&mdash;there are exceptions from that I admit&mdash;and which fall into a different category, in these respects generally and in their relatively small number, from the grants.  The grants are for everybody who reaches a certain level and to ensure equality.  Scholarships, prizes and awards are for the few who reach a standard of excellence and to give them an incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>In existing thrid level institutions these exist in very wide numbers.  In the college of which I have best knowledge, University College, Dublin, in each year quite a large number of scholarships are given&mdash;perhaps I should not say a large number but a significant number&mdash;over the various range of degrees in all the faculties.  In addition to that, there are prizes for excellence in particular subjects and there are a number of bursaries, some of which derive from donations or gifts from people outside.  All of these are designed to encourage excellence and are for people who get first or second or third, those who come at the top of the three in a particular subject, or a particular group.  These are inherently within the competence of, and concern directly, the particular educational institution.</P>
    <P>I can see no reason why the Minister, not asserting any right to interfere with these in the universities, which he does not do, and has never attempted to do, and does not intend to do, should try to control these here. It seems to me that if, in fact, what he said represents the full extent of his thought on this, and if he feels there is some danger which I cannot see at all of this institution setting up a grant scheme available to everybody who gets so many honours, and available to everybody within a certain means test, and if he fears they will set up such a scheme off their own bat with the funds he is providing them with which would be different from a national <Col N="755" /> scheme, let him put into this the wording here, &ldquo;establishing and carrying on a scheme of grants in relation to students art crafts and designs&rdquo;.  I do not think it is necessary.  I cannot conceive of the college with the resources it is likely to have launching this kind of grant scheme.  It could not do so.</P>
    <P>If the Minister fears that, fair enough, but he has got the wrong words here.  There is a complete misconception here.  The things he refers to here are, in fact, the very things which exist in other institutions which are not controlled or interfered with by the Minister, which are not related to grants at all, and which of their nature are idiosyncratic and each institution must provide for itself in relation to its own needs.  If the Minister accepts that what I am saying is basically correct&mdash;and I am speaking with some knowledge of this&mdash;I suggest that he should have another look at it and see whether, in fact, the wording really meets his needs, and whether there is a necessity for it, given that the meaning of scholarships, bursaries, prizes and awards is quite clear.  I do not think there can be any legal confusion about it.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anybody thinking that grants would come under that.  I do not think, in fact, that, as worded, the university grants system as given now would be held to come under it at all. That is a matter of interpretation and certainly it extends to all kinds of things which are not grants and which do not come under the grants scheme and which I do not think he would wish to control or interfere with because every educational institution must have the power to dispose of a small fraction of its resources to give special incentives to students of particular excellence.  Even schools&mdash;and their resources are limited enough&mdash; have a prize day and books are given to pupils and somehow the money is scraped together for this purpose.  The Minister does not presume to intervene and say that all prizes given in schools should be subject to his consent.  If this is not necessary in schools and it is not necessary in the universities&mdash;I do not know about vocational schools, <Col N="756" /> I doubt if they are inhibited from giving any award but perhaps they are and if they are they should not be&mdash;I see no reason for selecting this particular college for this type of control over scholarships, prizes and awards.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have another look at this in the light of what I have said and see whether it is necessary, given the clear meaning of &ldquo;scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other awards&rdquo; to have it at all, or if he does feel the need to control a grants scheme to re-word it so as to achieve the objective which he is seeking to achieve and not to extend his range of competence into an area which I do not think he really wants to control at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as anxious as everybody else that this Bill should pass quickly but again we are coming back to what seems to me to be central. I agree with everything Deputy FitzGerald said but I should like to add this: if you can make an argument as to which needs more freedom, an ordinary third level educational institution, a university, or a school of art, then the argument in favour of freedom has to go to the school of art.  If they have to be different at all then there must be greater freedom for an art school and not less because of the nature of the extraordinarily difficult thing that art teachers are now trying to do.  The ordinary boundaries even between the different disciplines in art are gone.  I am not going to make a general speech on the Bill now but I have to say this at this stage.  There is nothing one can do in an area that is proving to be educationally difficult all over the world except to trust the commitment to their profession of enlightened teachers.  Otherwise you simply lose connection with the growing point of the subject you are trying to teach and if you do that you lose the students and the commitment of the students completely.  You might possibly say what the requirements of a good medical school are from outside but you could not possibly say what the requirements of a good art school would be from the outside because it is evolving so rapidly and it is so difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> The points made by Deputy FitzGerald about the confusion are unanswerable.  There exists something called a Taylor Scholarship already, I understand, another scholarship in the school of art.  I do not want to introduce abusive words into this debate, certainly not at the moment, but I detect a strain of what I can only call paranoia in the drawing up of this Bill because it is not even general.  It is &ldquo;scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other awards&rdquo;.  The Minister is not saying that he does not want an auction between the art school and the university, that they are bidding higher to get students in.  He is not talking about that.  He is talking about the whole spectrum of the incentives that they give.  I appreciate the Minister's position in this, and I recognise the mechanism by which Bills are drafted, but surely this is asking for a power in regard to the methods by which a differentiation of quality of work is made inside the school.  It is asking for power in relation to that which is neither sought nor given in relation to any sort of teaching institution that I can think of from national school to university.  In fact, each university enshrines its own history and its past benefactors in the prizes, the bursaries and the scholarships that it presents.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that everybody who is hostile to this Bill approaches it with evil intent if one wishes to believe that its objective is to retain power and not let an evolution into a modern and effective art school take place.  He may accuse his opponents of this.  There may be some validity in this accusation but surely there is a need to remove the things which give strength to that accusation.  The claim to this sort of influence in areas like prizes and bursaries does seem to me to be paranoic and does seem to me to validate all of the worries, doubts and distrusts that have been expressed and, indeed, that I have expressed myself about the intention of this Bill. This is power that really is so far beneath what a Minister for Education ought to be concerning himself with as to be utterly irrelevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense Deputy Keating has made my case for me when <Col N="758" /> he refers to the fact that there is a very considerable difference between the situation in the College of Art and in other colleges because I think it must be obvious that most of the scholarships which would be envisaged here would undoubtedly be entrance scholarships and would have a direct relevance in that sense to the higher education grant.  The reason why I say that he has made my case for me is that it was obvious to me, particularly in discussions with the students, that it is more than possible that not very many of the students would get higher education grants because of the fact that they might not reach the four C's level.  In other words you could be a very good artist without necessarily having one C.  Therefore we would have to concern ourselves with a different situation in relation to scholarships to the College of Art.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, grants.  I do not know that there is much difference in it in this sense.  However, we will call them grants.  The point I am making is that in my view most of the grants or scholarships would be entrance scholarships and, therefore, would bear or would be made to bear a comparison with the grants made available to higher educational institutions. For that reason I feel that it would be necessary for me to be involved in some way in relation to that. That is the basic reason why I introduced the wording &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a basic misunderstanding here.  The Minister, I hope, is aware that the universities have entrance scholarships.  It is, in fact, a very important feature of the universities that they have a special scheme of entrance scholarships for people of particular excellence, scholarships entirely unrelated to means.  They are designed to encourage excellence.  These schemes exist in universities.  There has been a supplementation of them or a different scheme introduced as a result of some problems created by the removal of the county council scholarships.  We now have at the behest of the Department <Col N="759" /> and the universities two schemes of entrance scholarships quite separate from the grants for a few people of particular excellence.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not claiming that he must now take power to control entrance scholarships to universities because &ldquo;they have a direct relevance to grants&rdquo;.  The only direct relevance is that if someone gets an entrance scholarship because he is a person of great excellence it could have a bearing on whether or not he is going to be given a grant because grants are given to people who need assistance and if a person gets a scholarship he may not need assistance.  In relation to universities the two do not relate very well because in fact a scholarship is something which one gets for one year.  In those circumstances, because one gets an entrance scholarship I do not think one fails to get a grant.  The Minister is not claiming this right in regard to university entrance scholarships.  Why then must he claim it in this particular instance?</P>
      <P>From the way the Minister is phrasing his remarks I detect a clear confusion between grants and scholarships. I have never heard in education any confusion between the two. Scholarships are for the few of particular excellence, normally without a means test, although there is no essential reason why one cannot be built in. I remember once getting an award, bursary or prize of some kind at university which in fact I was not entitled to because of my parents' means, but that was relatively unusual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the pattern normally within these institutions but it can happen and even within universities internal scholarships, bursaries or <Col N="760" /> prizes may have a means test built in, although it is unusual.  The essential feature of scholarships is that they are few in number for the few who are particularly good in order to give encouragement to them.  Grants are of their very nature designed to be for a large number, in fact ideally for all who are entitled to enter, although for financial reasons the present scheme does not extend to all.  The Minister, I believe, shares our ambition that as soon as possible it should be financially possible to extend them to all students who go to university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic thing about the grant is that everybody who reaches a certain standard gets it; it is designed to secure a measure of social equality.  I have never heard anybody confuse the two before because they are of their nature opposite in their intent and opposite numerically.  The Minister's use of the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; when he is talking about &ldquo;grants&rdquo; does suggest there is a basic confusion of thought in this particular matter here.  For this reason I suggest the Minister should have another look at it to see how best to secure what he wants to secure so that he would have a voice in any system of grants available to a large number of people all of a certain standard. Obviously such a scheme would be akin to the general system of grants and while it does not necessarily mean the same, the Minister has given good reason why it might be a little different, and I quite see that the Minister should have a voice in that.  If it is necessary to say that here in some way, wording can be devised for the purpose, although I do not think it is because the grants scheme is one that the Minister runs, his Department decide on it, he has power to determine it himself. I do not see why he feels it necessary to have it in this legislation because it is inconceivable that the College of Art could be so well endowed as to operate a grants scheme available for a large portion of their students.  I hope the day will come when it might be financially feasible, although I doubt it. It is highly improbable, therefore, that at any stage they would operate a grants scheme akin to the Minister's grants scheme and I do not therefore think it is necessary to provide against <Col N="761" /> this.  If the Minister feels it is necessary let him provide a suitable form of words but let him not do what this purports to do and retain power to control scholarships, bursaries and prizes, which are matters entirely within the competence of each institution, which are small in number, designed to encourage excellence and which are not in any other case in schools, universities or anywhere else within the Minister's competence.</P>
    <P>What cases are there in the educational sphere at the moment where the Minister exercises control over the power of an educational institution to give scholarships, prizes and bursaries? There may be some institution, a training college over which he has control, I do not know, but certainly in primary schools, secondary schools and universities this has never been suggested. I do not know about vocational schools in this regard.  Will the Minister tell the House where this practice exists at the moment?</P>
    <P>We have made a case for the Minister to look at it again.  Our arguments are sufficiently cogent to warrant the Minister saying that between now and Report Stage he will examine it again and see whether the wording is really designed to achieve his objective or whether it cannot be modified to avoid creating a situation in which in this body alone he has the power of intervention in these matters and whether it can be modified to secure whatever powers he may legitimately want and require to ensure that he can exercise control over a grants system, if any more power is needed than his power to control the money for a grants scheme.</P>

      <P>If I may come back to what I said originally about this matter, the number likely to get the ordinary type of grant will be very, very small.  I assume, therefore, that the bulk of money available to the college for this purpose would be utilised for entrance scholarships of some form or other.  I cannot see why I should not have some say in this particular matter when, as I mentioned earlier, I feel there should be a relationship between grants and this type of entrance <Col N="762" /> scholarship because the grants will not apply in very many instances.  At the moment there are only one or two grants.</P>

      <P>It is a different examination but it covers generally the same range of subjects for those coming out of post-primary schools.  The paper may be of a higher or lower standard but it will cover the same range of subjects.  Scholarships in a university relate to the same range of subjects generally, and derive from achievement in the same range of subjects, as to the entitlement to grants but here the situation is very different. The Deputy is confining himself too much by saying that university scholarships are for a limited number.  In this case scholarships may be applied by the board, after consultation with the Minister, because of a performance in different subjects from those which entitle one to grants in the higher education grants scheme.  Much of what the Deputy says has reason and concern in it but he is obviously overlooking the fact that there are boys and girls who will show a real aptitude for artistic, creative work but do not have the range of academic achievement which would entitle them to grants. They would not in fact qualify for grants but for scholarships which would be applied by the board.  As the Minister has indicated, if he is providing money he must have some balance between the amount made available by way of higher education grants and the amount being made available by way of scholarship.  The Deputy is stating a definition of scholarship which I have found nowhere to be a definition and he has suggested that we start from that base. I do not accept that.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter a semantic argument about the difference <Col N="764" /> between &ldquo;grants&rdquo; and &ldquo;scholarships&rdquo; but there is this depressing sense of failure to communicate as though we were using words in a widely different sense.  When the Minister asked he was told that only one or two students in the College of Art currently benefit from the current grants scheme.  The decision which is implicit in that is that the work done by a person who can gain a certain number of distinctions in a certain number of academic subjects and who is training, let us say, to be a lawyer, is inherently more valuable than the work of a person who does not have the ability to gain those distinctions in academic subjects but is training to be some sort of creative artist.  If you had to evaluate the work of a lawyer against the work of a creative artist you would have to give the judgment in favour of the creative artist.  If you could evaluate them at all you would have to say that the art student was inherently more socially valuable than the person who had a certain academic facility at arithmetic and languages.  If there is a defect here it is clearly in what the net of the grants scheme currently catches.  If grants are not being given to people going into the School of Art because they are not good enough at mathematics, good enough at history or something like that, that is a defect in our grants scheme, which it is easy to remedy.</P>
      <P>It is already implying a pejorative judgement about the work that art students do and I do not think you need to have this mechanism of saying we cannot do it through the grants scheme because these students are not good enough academically to get the grant so we have to do it another way through scholarships.  The way out of that dilemma is to alter the grants scheme and then you could leave alone the internal affairs of a School of Art in relation to scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other awards, which is what requires to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Keating has said at all because he is asserting that the simple method would be to alter the grants scheme. If we were to alter the grants scheme we could find ourselves in very considerable <Col N="765" /> difficulty in relation to other educational institutions.  We are here recognising, as I said earlier, that the artist can be of exceptional ability without being good at mathematics or possibly good at languages and we are trying to ensure that the board will be in a position to help that particular student.  The fact that we call it a scholarship rather than a grant does not seem to me to matter very much; but what matters to me is that there should be some relationship between the type of entrance scholarship which the board will award to a student going into the College of Art, irrespective of the basis on which this scholarship is awarded, and the grant which is available to those who are able to get the higher education grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still in some confusion here about this.  I see what the Minister's concern is and I sympathise with his desire to be able to have what I would call a grants scheme to assist students who may not reach a certain academic standard in academic subjects but who in the context of the College of Art deserve to be assisted from a social point of view in studying there.  Unfortunately the phraseology he has used is extraordinarily broad.  He does not define the power he wants in the Bill as relating to this particular type of financial provision which, if he wants to use the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo;, which I think is inappropriate here and does not correspond to the usage in this country anyway, could be described as an entrance scholarship, valid for the period of duration of the student's studies.  That, when provided to everybody who passes a certain standard, is what I call a grant and what everybody else calls a grant and, to be fair, is what the Minister in his scheme calls a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you want to re-define a grant it is a financial provision designed to assist anybody who reaches a certain standard to attend through the full duration of a course of studies, an educational institution and to be provided for him at the point of entry.  If you want to call that an entrance scholarship for the full duration of studies you can change the words around if <Col N="766" /> you want to.  It does not matter very much what meaning you give to words although it is easier to use them in their normal sense.  What the Minister has done in fact goes far beyond that. He claims the right to control those types of internal awards which are inherently a function of an educational institution, even if they are not what I call grants and what he defines as entrance scholarships available for the duration of the course of studies.  He intends to control, for example, the entrance scholarship for the first year, which is normal in third level institutions, in certain universities in this country.  He does not claim that right for that type of scholarship in relation to universities.  He has not ever claimed it.  I hope he is not going to start claiming it now.  Yet some of his phraseology seems to suggest that, because certain entrance scholarships given in small numbers on grounds of excellence to people for one year, the first year of their studies, assist people to go to a university who might otherwise not be able to go there if they happen to be people whose parents' means are low, therefore in the context of the College of Art he must have some control over it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that a scholarship by definition is limited to one year?  He seems to be implying that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am suggesting in fact that the only entrance scholarship which exists in the university is a scheme introduced to replace the county council scholarships, but the scheme which has always existed in universities infact can only exist for one year.  I am saying that in a country where we have entrance scholarships&mdash;the only entrance scholarships which were known in third level institutions until recently were for one year only&mdash;we have to have regard to the fact that such a system might be introduced here and that the Minister should not claim to interfere with them nor should he claim to interfere with scholarships given for the second year or the third year nor should he claim a right to decide on prizes for people who get first, second and third in a <Col N="767" /> subject, nor in respect of bursaries given to people to go on to higher studies.</P>
      <P>These are all matters which are completely internal to the institutions concerned and in respect of which I do not think it is appropriate for him to make any claim.  If he feels there is a problem and that for good reasons he wants to ensure that, if these bodies provide sums of money specified to be for the period of years for the duration of the course, to people who reach a certain standard and if he wants to control such a system to ensure that, while not necessarily having the same entrance standard as universities, nevertheless it can be in line with it perhaps in terms of sums of money given, I see no particular difficulty about that. If the Minister will re-word it to achieve that, fair enough.  The wording, as it stands, involves making a claim which I do not think he can justify.</P>
      <P>I am trying to look up, as I speak, the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; in a dictionary, whose size of type does not meet the situation of my eyesight at the moment.  I can find the word &ldquo;scholar&rdquo; but I am having difficulty in tracing down the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo;. Obviously I should have got a larger dictionary so that I could deal with it more fully.</P>

That is a &ldquo;scholar&rdquo; in the sense of a scholar of Trinity College.  Unfortunately it seems extraordinary that the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; is not here.  I <Col N="768" /> am afraid the more I look at it the less I see of the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo;. Frankly, it seems a very poor dictionary in that respect.  I thought it was a word in common use in the English language. This is only the concise dictionary. Deputy Cruise-O'Brien very properly had the full Oxford Dictionary with him.

      <P>We have shown willingness to consider legitimate claims and we have pointed out that the phraseology used here would extend to every kind of internal award.  The Minister has not suggested why he should have this power in regard to internal awards.  He does not seem to want it and I suggest that between now and Report Stage he would consider the introduction of whichever amendment would be necessary to achieve his original objective of not impinging on the autonomy of this body in regard to the provision of internal scholarships of the kind the Minister accepts in regard to the universities and other educational institutions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7 :</P>
      <P>To delete subsections (1) and (2) and substitute the following :&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  There shall be a College Council of An Bord with nine members of whom one shall be the Director and none of whom shall be a civil servant.</P>
      <P>(2)  The College Council shall annually elect a chairman from amongst its members.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept that this body would be called a board but we wish to provide that this board would be run by a college council.  I trust the Minister will recognise the diligence I have shown in tracking down the places in <Col N="771" /> the Bill where this amendment is needed.  What bothered me here was the approach to an educational institution. In only calling them a board in the first instance the Bill implies that they are not in the same sense as any other State-sponsored body.  That is what a corporate body are called but the supervising body of this institution is also called the board and in this way we are identifying a corporate body with a ruling body.  We are equating this educational institution with any other State-sponsored body and this seems to me to be unfortunate.</P>
    <P>My remedy is that the board should be called a college council.  I am not concerned chiefly with the phraseology here but calling them a college council seems to identify them with academic and administrative functions.  It seems to me we should delete the relevant subsection here because otherwise we identify and recognise that this educational body are akin to other State institutions such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and so on.  If the Minister wants to use another term, using academic phraseology, I will be satisfied but I do not like the idea of linking this body with other statutory bodies set up to supply electricity or turf.</P>
    <P>This is not a vital amendment from the point of view of affecting the running of the body but in any educational institution there is special importance in the words we use and their symbolism. I do not think it will help this body to get the support or to command the allegiance of staff and students if the body in legislation look like the semi-State bodies supplying goods or services.  The suggestion in my amendment will make it easier to get acceptance among staff and students.  Although it is not of great practical importance, it is of enormous psychological and academic importance.  I hope the Minister will meet us in this amendment.  It cannot be very essential to him, in the sense that the particular phraseology he has used is of particular importance to him, but it could be of great importance to the people in the body.</P>

      <P>To be frank I do not see much point in the amendments here.  I am quite happy with the word &ldquo;Bord&rdquo;.  I do not see any reason why it should be changed.  I am not going to go into any detail in relation to the drafting aspect of it.  From a study I have made, some of the amendments seem contradictory.  The amendment <Col N="773" /> with regard to the college council relates to section 6 which deals with membership.  But &ldquo;an Bord&rdquo; has been established under section 4 and given functions under section 5.  In my view, the effect of the amendments in section 6 is to establish a council with no functions and &ldquo;an Bord&rdquo; which cannot be given members.  I am not placing any particular blame on the Deputy for this.  The Deputy appears to be attempting to appoint a college council of a board which has no membership. I do not see any particular reason why we should accept these amendments.  &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; is in my view quite satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Deputy, as he said that this matter is not something that goes to the root of the Bill, that he may be unduly influenced by the word &ldquo;Bord&rdquo; itself and the normal meaning of it in commercial affairs.  If the Deputy's amendments were to be accepted or a similar attempt was made to have two such bodies there would be difficulties.  In the definition section alone, one would have to have the &ldquo;college council&rdquo; defined.  The Deputy has not amended that.  Secondly, one would have to establish clearly the relationship between An Bord and the college council. The legal relationship as such would have to be established, or the relationship between the two other institutions or bodies the Deputy is talking about. That would pose a big problem.  If the Deputy looks at his amendment in relation to the use of the seal of the board, he will see that when there is no legal connection between these two bodies, one cannot have a seal used as freely as the Deputy's amendment would allow it to be used.  It might be no harm to illustrate it from the amendment to section 12.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), in lines 29 and 30 and where it secondly occurs in line 31 to delete &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the College Council&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would leave it reading &ldquo;the seal of An Bord shall be authenticated by the signature of the chairman of the college council or some other member thereof authorised by the college <Col N="774" /> council to act in that behalf and the signature of an officer of An Bord authorised by the college council to act in that behalf.&rdquo;  The Deputy will see that when he has not established the relationship between the college council and An Bord it is going beyond the limits of legal authority or, indeed, any kind of authority to imply that the college council and the chairman of the college council could, in fact, direct the use of the seal of An Bord.  There are other matters in relation to section 17 (8).  The fact is that the gaps will be there and they will be there no matter what anyone does.  This should clearly indicate the difficulties.  Section 17 (8) reads:</P>
    <P>The procedure for the selection of persons for appointment as whole-time officers of An Bord shall be determined by An Bord with the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's amendment would cause great difficulty there because we do not know how the college council could determine the procedure, having no clear relationship to An Bord.  I admit that the Deputy is not insisting on these particular words but if he could agree that the analogy which he seems to be concerned about with regard to semi-State bodies does not necessarily apply, this is not a matter of concern. Effectively, one body should be capable of doing this rather than be harassed in any way by the presence of another body for the sake of words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has shown up defects in drafting.  Fundamentally, I made a mistake in approaching this by trying to retain both the college, which is defined in section 2, and the college council. I should have made a clean sweep of An Bord and stuck to the concept of a college with a college council.  I found the concept of &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; extremely confusing.  Quite clearly, the reason is that there is a college which exists and is defined in section 2.  We all know what it is physically and we know what its property is.  Then there is the concept of &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo;.  At some points An Bord is a reference to the institution as a whole, and is really the college under another name.  That <Col N="775" /> is all right in the Electricity Supply Board, because we are used to the concept of the board being called the Electricity Supply Board, meaning the whole institution.  I have complicated things because unlike the ESB case we have now got a three-fold distinction. If the amendment were re-drafted so as to retain the concept of the college and if section 4 (1) were re-drafted it would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1)  There shall, by virtue of this section, be established on the establishment day a body to be known as the College Council of the National College of Art...</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>...College Council of an Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha to perform the functions given to it by this Act...</P>
      <P>If from the very beginning we had brought in the college council and then throughout the Bill referred to the college or the college council and got rid of &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; altogether, which is a very confusing concept&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, not quite.  Take some of these sections to which we have referred.  &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; is used in a very ambiguous sense.  This is about the seal. You could not say &ldquo;the seal of the college council&rdquo;&mdash;you could, I suppose, but it would be legally incorrect&mdash;&ldquo;shall be authenticated by the signature of the chairman of the college council&rdquo;.  I am sure words to that effect exist in the charter of the university. You do not say, I think, &ldquo;the seal of the governing body&rdquo;; you say &ldquo;the seal of University College, Dublin, shall be authenticated by the president of the college, the chairman of the governing body&rdquo; or whatever it may be.  The truth is that &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; in some cases means the college and in some cases it means the college council.  It would be much clearer if we decided to stick to that and avoid the confusion of the college which once it is mentioned in section 2 disappears altogether and then re-emerges as &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; which is at <Col N="776" /> the same time an executive body running An Bord which is, in fact, the college.  There has been a bit of confusion in drafting which I failed in my attempt to clarify, and I wonder whether it would be worth looking at this to tidy it up.  To call this &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; to begin with and to call the body running it &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; does not help in a situation where the institution has not a very happy record, where we are trying to get it established as a normal academic institution which would look and sound as academic as possible.  I would prefer, if I get any encouragement from the other side of the House, to go away and redraft the amendment along those lines for the Report Stage so that at every point you would have either &ldquo;college&rdquo; or &ldquo;college council&rdquo; and remove &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I would feel that if we were to go away and try to do anything with this we would make confusion more confounded.  The Deputy mentioned that the board is the institution. Of course, the board is not the institution; the institution is the college, Coláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha.  I would be inclined, perhaps, to compare it with the board of Trinity College.  I do not think the fact that Trinity College is governed by a board detracts in any way from its academic standing.  Therefore, I think it would be better to leave well enough alone in this case.</P>

      <P>I have not matched Deputy FitzGerald's industry in putting down a large number of amendments, but I do find that there is a real difficulty here.  Whatever the solution to it is, there is certainly confusion here.  The word &ldquo;college&rdquo; has a fairly clearly understood meaning that has evolved.  If there is a seal or something like that, it is the seal of the college.  If we leave names entirely out, there are the whole group of people involved in the work, the teachers, students, administrators and the lot; you might also add in the buildings, the site and the whole thing, and that is the college.  Then within that there are a group of people in whom authority is vested.  This does not have to be a school of art; this is <Col N="777" /> pretty well any institution.  Separate from that group in whom authority is invested there is an executive.  Those are the three stages: first, the collective word for all of the persons, students, teachers, administrators; secondly, the fountainhead of power and of decision inside the organisation; and, thirdly, the actual executive. Reading the Bill in this particular case without any overtones but merely with a desire to understand, it does seem to me there is some confusion there and I would wish the Minister to clarify this, to indicate if my scheme of a college, then a source of authority and then an executive is a valid description of the way he intends to structure the whole art college; and if it is, what are the appropriate names for each of these levels and more specifically, what is the extent of the definition of the word &ldquo;board&rdquo; as it is used in this Bill?</P>

      <P>It may be that there is a basic confusion in my mind, but I felt that when you talked of the seal of &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; that this must be the seal of the college.  It is not the seal of the college council or the governing body or whatever it may be.  Therefore, where I saw a reference to the seal of &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; that conveyed to me that, perhaps, &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; was not simply the executive body within the college but was, in fact, the college constituted <Col N="778" /> as a statutory body.  Similarly, where I read in subsection (8) of section 17 the procedure for the selection of persons for appointment as whole-time officers of An Bord, they are surely officers of the college, not officers of the college council.  I am calling it the college council to distinguish it; we know it is the executive body we are talking about.  Surely it could have a secretary to look after its meetings, but the officers of the college, the staff, professors, lecturers and so on, are not officers of the college council.  We do not talk in the university of the lecturers as being officers of the governing body&mdash;if they are officers at all, if that is the right legal phrase&mdash;but officers of the college.  If I am confused about this, the confusion is not entirely confined to me.  &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; is being used in section 17 (8)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, section 4 starts the thing off.  I am wasting my time.  The argument is made in section 4(2).  Section4 (2) defines &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; as being a body corporate.  If it is a body corporate it cannot simultaneously be the college council running the place. Perhaps it can; maybe this is a legal way of handling State-sponsored bodies; I suspect this is, in fact, the way it is done but it is quite inappropriate to treat an educational body like that.  As I say, in section 4 (2) &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo; is described as a body corporate.  Section 17 (8) and certain other sections refer to the seal or officers of &ldquo;An Bord&rdquo;; and we are talking about the seal or officers of a body corporate.  But in the rest we are talking about the college council, which is quite a different thing.  I do not think any educational institution has identified the two. Certainly, if I tried to insist that the members of the governing body of UCD are the college, the body corporate, and the rest are officers of the governing body, I should get short shrift from my collegues on the staff right down through the whole range of staff, and not just the academic staff, but the other staff as well at such a suggestion, So, if I am confused, I think the Bill is confused.  It seems to me we should clarify this.</P>

      <P>It does not follow. I am sorry.  I am saying that, if I have been confused in my amendments, this reflects the basic confusion in the Bill, which I freely admit I have failed to clarify.  But I do not see how you can define a board as a body corporate in section 2 and then turn around and have it as a body corporate with a &ldquo;C&rdquo;, as a body corporate with officers and servants, and then turning up all over the place as the executive body rather than a body corporate, as an executive council, if you like, or a board of directors.  They are two quite different things in any educational institution I have ever heard of.  I think it is a mistake to confuse them and I think, in the light of the discussion now, we ought between this and Report Stage see if we can sort this out and get away from this triple usage of the college, of the board as a body and the board as a group of eight or ten people carrying out the functions and running the thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> This amendment seems to be related back to amendment No. 7, but we got so involved in discussing on amendment No. 7 the question of the college council versus the board that the two other features of the amendment were, unfortunately, not discussed and they are, in fact, necessary for an understanding of amendment No. 9; at least one of them is necessary for an understanding of this amendment.  I refer to the provision that the director should be a member of the board, that there should be nine members, none of whom should be a civil servant.  We did not discuss that because we became too involved in the semantic aspects of the amendment.  Perhaps I can come back to that again when I re-formulate the amendment for Report Stage.  It is in relation to that part of amendment No. 7 that amendment No. 9 becomes a logical sequence.</P>
    <P>What is in mind in amendment No. 9 and what was in mind in amendment No. 7 is that we should move away from the concept of a body in which the chairman is appointed by the Minister, which is proper to a state-sponsored body, and move over to the normal educational practice in which the election of the chairman or president is a function of the body itself, of all the members of the staff, of the college council.  It is an internal matter for them to choose their own head.  The logical sequence to the Minister appointing the chairman is that the chairman, when resigning, shall address that resignation to the Minister.  That follows from this suggestion and that is, I think, basically a mistake.  The basic concept is wrong.  We should, in fact, have a chairman who comes up from the ranks of the college council and is chosen by it.</P>
    <P>As it stands at the moment, the Minister is playing too large a part here.  It is proper that he should appoint a certain number of members of the board, or council, or whatever you like to call it.  We may quarrel with the qualifications, <i>et cetera,</i> but it is right that the Minister should appoint certain members.  In other institutions the members appointed by the Minister or the Government, as the case may be, play a very useful role in bringing to <Col N="782" /> bear considerations of public interest within an institution which may become too inward-looking.  I have no difficulty about that.  It is when the Minister appoints the chairman and the running of the institution is centred around the chairman that we begin to wonder and to worry.  It is not, in fact, the way in which third level institutions, such as universities, operate and it seems to me we should be seeking to create an institution analogous to those that already exist rather than analogous to Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus and other bodies operating in quite a different field.  As a necessary consequence of what is proposed in subsection (2) of amendment No. 7, it follows that, if the college council are to elect their own chairman, as is proper in educational institutions of this level, then the chairman, when resigning, should address his letter of resignation to the registrar rather than to the Minister.  There is an inter-relationship here between these amendments and we may find ourselves going over the same ground.  I do not want to waste time.  I will leave it at that for the moment to get the Minister's reaction.  It will come up again when we come later on to other aspects of the Bill.  It is fairly fundamental.  I should like to hear the Minister now before I take up any more time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>Whether it was withdrawn or otherwise, it has gone.  I do not know, therefore, how I can possibly relate an argument to the particular matter.  However, this amendment to replace the Minister by the registrar cannot be sustained when one looks at subsection (2) of section 6 and finds that the chairman of the board shall be appointed by the Minister and may be removed from office by the Minister.  A logical follow up to that would be that a chairman of a board having been appointed by the Minister would hardly resign that office by way of letter addressed to the registrar.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it could be argued that this is consequential on an amendment that is not there.  However, the Deputy's main argument was in relation to the appointment by the Minister of a chairman and he said that we should get away from the situation whereby a chairman is appointed by a Minister such as in the case of semi-State bodies. I would refer to the appointment of a chairman by the Minister to the Higher Educational Authority which I think would be analogous to this particular situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It has a reference to higher education generally.  The point I want to make here is that we had a long argument on this particular matter in relation to the Higher Education Authority.  There is no getting away from the fact that the appointing of a chairman of an autonomous body such as this is normally the function of the sponsoring Minister.  It is my opinion that a chairman should not be beholden to his colleagues on a board for election to this particular office.  He should be in an independent position so that he should be able to deal in an objective manner with the various matters and problems that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Higher Education Authority appointment, I consider it to be necessary that we should be in a position to select the person whom we believe is best suited to this particular office.  It will not be all that easy to get a person who will be completely <Col N="784" /> satisfactory and it should be the function of the Minister to make this appointment in the same way as it is the function of the Minister in relation to various other bodies which are very similar to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the introduction of the Higher Education Authority as a relevant comparison to be not only surprising but so removed from the matter we are discussing as to be irrelevant. We have been trying to exchange serious argument and to listen to each other's point of view&mdash;to use a <i>cliché</i>, we have been trying to communicate. There is no comparison whatever between the person with executive power in an actual educational institution which teaches people, a very difficult and sensitive area, and the chairman of a body responsible for policy and finance in education as a whole.  If the Minister wishes to make relevant comparisons he should look to persons who have that sort of authority in universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it would be very difficult to find somebody who would be completely satisfactory and he is retaining for himself and for the members of his Department the right to judge who is completely satisfactory. My opinion is that anyone who would be completely satisfactory to the Minister would be disastrous as the head of an art school or would be the exact opposite of what is needed because we are now at the heart of the question of authority and of how an art school should be run.  As I see it, the Minister for Education has responsibility in regard to general policy and in regard to the use of public moneys in education where his judgement can extend. All our experience and all the experience of other countries indicates that the effort to extend that judgement into the control of a school of art ends in the sort of disaster that we have and there is no way out of that sort of confrontation.  The profound alienation of student bodies and some teachers is comparable with the North of Ireland where one does not know which are Unionists, which are Catholics or which are Protestants because the people have lost the ability to talk to each other and do not trust each <Col N="785" /> other.  The alienation in the sphere of art education was brought about because no remedy was taken over a long period during which the situation was screaming for remedy.  That somebody who is completely satisfactory to the Minister should be chosen as chairman and that the Minister should believe he has in his ability or that his advisors have it in their ability to chose such a person is an indication of a total failure to understand the nature of the problem of art education both here and in other countries.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced I greeted it without any hope of its success in the question of solving the problem of art education.  I am prepared to discuss amendments as they arise on the basis that later the whole matter will have to be dealt with properly in any case and that one might conceivably succeed in making it a little less awful.  But does the Minister think he will succeed by retaining this power, this power which is a blueprint either for the continuation of the sort of inadequacies that have passed for art education during the past half century or, else, for the sort of breakdown that we are witnessing now?  If the attitudes the Minister has expressed are put into practice, there will be no solution to the problems of creative work.  The Minister said that there is no getting away from the fact that the selection of the chairman of such a body is normally the prerogative of the Minister.  A school of art is not a place where boots or peat briquettes are produced or where electricity is generated; and if there is no getting away from the fact that the Minister must choose the chairman of such a body, then, there is no solving of the problem of art education in this country.</P>

      <P>Most of Deputy Keating's comments are based on the fact that art is a sphere apart.  Nobody will deny that.  Art as a criterion that applies either to art education or to the promotion of art differs from the criteria applied to other levels of education or to cultural activity, but it does not follow that when one approaches a board that are concerned with the management of a college of <Col N="786" /> art, one must disregard all other similarities and say that each one of them is inappropriate by definition.</P>

      <P>On that point which the Deputy has made himself, one of the first&mdash;I suppose one could call it third level institutions or higher institutes of study&mdash;established here was established in the forties.  Deputy FitzGerald may smile at this.  When the Institute for Advanced Studies Act, 1940 was being put through the House, section 7 of that Act&mdash;and there were some distinguished predecessors from both the Deputy's party and Deputy Keating's party here at that time&mdash;provided that the constitution of such a governing body as a board should consist of a chairman appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.  That did not appear to cause any reaction against the effective functioning of the Institute for Advanced Studies or cause an implication such as Deputy Keating reads into this, that by definition any person who would be suitable or appropriate from the Minister's point of view would be disastrous as head of an Arts school.

      <P>Nonetheless, and even enlightened Deputies might concede this, if a Minister is providing funds for various things we have already discussed, and will discuss again, it is essential and urgent that there be at least some level of relationship between one and the other.  If the example of the Institute for Advanced Studies is not enough I think it must be accepted that here probably, apart from that Act, we are moving into a new area.  It is not every day in this <Col N="787" /> Parliament legislation of this kind is introduced providing for the management and structure of a third level institution or institution of Art or any other third level institute.  There are not many precedents; I think hardly any, with that possible exception.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has said more than he meant there and I do not think it is a justified implication.  I was interested to hear the Minister's justification of this and the Parliamentary Secretary's. They are rather different.  The Minister's justification was that the HEA were organised in this way.  When that Bill was going through we pointed out that they were being structured very closely on the Institute for Advanced <Col N="788" /> Studies which we said was an extremely bad precedent.  We went on to point out that among State bodies generally it was interesting to find that the one which had the tightest control through every possible mechanism was the Institute for Advanced Studies.  It was of interest that the same Department of Education, when establishing a State body of this kind of research 31 years ago, felt it necessary to introduce such tight control over the autonomy of this body and that in all the years since no other Department dealing with commercial affairs or administration of State funds through An Bord Fáilte or Córas Tráchtála, for example, ever found it necessary to adopt practices involving such tight rein.  Only again when we come back after 31 years to the Department of Education, when for the first time in 31 years we have a Bill setting up an educational body, the HEA Bill, we are back again with the same attempt to get control over every detail of administration of the body.  On the HEA Bill we fought these constant references to the power of the Minister.  We did not get very far.  I am glad to admit that we got further today on this issue when dealing with the previous section.</P>

It is interesting that now for the third time in 31 years we have a Bill before us and of all the Bills that came before us setting up bodies, it is only the three from the Department of Education that have involved such an attempt to secure such a tight measure of control in an area where it could not be less appropriate and of its nature inappropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not relying on the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned it now but on the fact that in the HEA debate there were aspects, which I would have difficulty in naming now in detail, of that Bill to which the only analogy we could find, and it was put to us in the discussion on that Bill, was the previous educational Bill and where we were able to point to the fact that in other State bodies there was no such analogy. I think I am right in saying that in certain aspects&mdash;I am not prepared to go particularly into the question of the chairmanship of the board&mdash;the tight control of bodies exists only in these three cases from the Department of Education.  We know where the original inspiration came from when the first Bill was introduced.  The respect of the Fianna Fáil Party for their founder is something we can understand but that it should be carried to such an extent that every educational institution established thereafter must be modelled on the same system of tight departmental control is a little unfortunate.  I can think of better monuments to raise to the President of the country who was at one stage President of the Executive Council and then Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We really have an important issue here.  In any third level educational institutions the right of choice of the institution itself of its head is fundamental, by a curious accident of history dating back to a period when the idea of any body having any autonomy in this country or Britain was not readily accepted.  Theoretically in Trinity College, Dublin, the Government do appoint the head, the Provost. The theoretical system does reflect on the whole approach in Elizabethan times to education.  I should have thought that even if we are in the British sense in neo-Elizabethan times now we do not have to insist on adopting the same methods that Queen Elizabeth adopted to ensure adequate control over an educational institution for the Anglicisation of Ireland.  We should have got further than that at this stage.  In fact, although in theory in Trinity College, the choice is made by the Government, in practice I understand names are put forward by <Col N="790" /> the college, three names, and in practice as far back as this State goes&mdash; I do not know how long before that&mdash; the first name on that list is selected by the Government.  In fact, our Government have very properly conceded in practice, without bothering to change the charter of Trinity College, a rather complicated business, the right of Trinity College to select its own head just as that right was conceded by the British Liberal Government in consultation with the Irish Hierarchy and the Irish Parliamentary Party in 1908 to the Colleges of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The changes in approach from the time of Queen Elizabeth I to the practice of the British Liberal Government in 1908 and the Irish Government since this State was founded were changes for the better and a recognition of the importance of autonomy in third level institutions.  It is curious that the Minister should insist on going back now to this earlier practice, quoting as his one analogy the Institute for Advanced Studies, and the Parliamentary Secretary quoting his one educational analogy.  I do not allow the HEA at all as being relevant because it is a body disbursing funds and in that respect it is nearer to Córas Tráchtála or Bord Fáilte.  It is not an analogy with this and we did resist this in that debate also.  I cannot accept this as a valid analogy.  I cannot accept that we should now go back to the system which Queen Elizabeth introduced in 1591.</P>
    <P>This is an educational institution at third level.  The Minister must have the right to appoint some members of the board.  I think he will be concerned to appoint people of a high calibre.  I hope so and I hope he will have regard to the widely differing attitudes of people in the art world, in the different forms of art, and that he will not confine his appointments when the time comes to people with a particular viewpoint and that, so far as possible, they will be people likely to be in sympathy with the aspirations and ideals of the students in the college. I am sure he will have regard to that as an element in the choice of members of the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> Having appointed these members, and the students and staff having selected their members and, if an amendment of mine is accepted and thought worthwhile by the Minister, the Art Teachers' Association having appointed their member, it is for them, as it is for the governing body of UCD, or the board or council, whichever it is, of Trinity College, to decide who they want amongst their own numbers or from other ranks, to head that institution. That is the dignified way in which an academic institution at third level should be run.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for departing from that and for reverting to the precedents of Queen Elizabeth, and her successor in this country, the administrator of this country being our present President, in the Institute of Advanced Studies Bill, 1940, when the much better precedents of the British Liberal Government in 1908 and the practice of our Governments in relation to Trinity College since 1922 could have been followed.  I would press this on the Minister.  I fear that he may not agree with me.  I fear that his mind is set on this.  I fear that he sees an analogy, which I think is totally invalid, with the HEA and an analogy which, though valid, with the Institute of Advanced Studies, is undesirable.  I would hope, nonetheless, that he would reconsider it.  This is pretty important. We are coming now to one of the important areas of the Bill, an area where if we make a mistake, it may have unfortunate results.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies on the other side will not accuse me in saying that of trying to provoke trouble.  We have all had enough trouble on this front.  We have all had our time absorbed&mdash;and by &ldquo;all&rdquo; I mean all of us who are discussing this matter here this evening &mdash;by having to listen to the different problems and viewpoints of two groups of students and two groups of staff.  It is our earnest wish that this new board will be a success and that it will succeed in getting the confidence of all the students and all the staff, and that we in this House will be able in future, as long as the College of Art remains beside us there, to pass in and out, glancing <Col N="792" /> across to see a group of people walking in and out of their college in a friendly manner rather than congregating in an occupation of glaring at each other with hostility.  That is what we aim to achieve.</P>
    <P>In saying that the Minister's approach to the chairmanship may not help to achieve that, I do not intend to be provocative or unhelpful&mdash;quite the contrary. I am seriously and genuinly concerned that we should not in this, or in any other respect, make mistakes that may make it difficult for the college to get off the ground as a third level educational institution, run in the same kind of way that other academic institutions are run, in a manner that will command the confidence and respect of its students and its staff.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the imposition of a chairman however notable or eminent he may be.  I do not think Deputy Keating meant what he may have seemed to have meant in saying that the Minister could not choose the right person.  I would share his fear that the Minister may not choose the best person because it is a difficult decision for him to make.  I would be a little in doubt as to whether I myself, if I were Minister for Education, would necessarily choose the best person.  Having appointed a number of people selected from a fairly wide range, and having put them together with the representatives of the staff and students, I would prefer to leave it to them to choose their head.  Having appointed, I would hope, some good people, if I were in the Minister's position, and having left it to the staff and the students to choose their representatives, I would have confidence that they together would choose the right person to head their institution, just as I hope each of our universities when the time comes for them to choose their head &mdash;and in my college we will be doing that before long&mdash;will choose the best person.</P>
    <P>I cannot really believe or say in this House that, for example, University College, Dublin, would be better off if the Minister chose the President than if he were chosen by the Senate of the NUI on the recommendation of the governing body.  If the Minister would see this institution as a third level institution <Col N="793" /> akin to, though necessarily different from, the universities rather than in the form of a State body he could approach our viewpoint and bring himself to see that we are talking sense on this issue.  I recognise that this body will be somewhat different from a university in a number of important respects.  As Deputy Keating has said, those differences so far as running it are concerned, are differences that will require more flexible running than universities.</P>
    <P>The whole business of art and the teaching of art requires, above all, a light and very intelligent hand and the minimum of Establishment intervention from any source.  As much as possible the organisation to run it should come well up from within the institution itself.  The failure to achieve that to date, for historical reasons for which none of us in this House is to blame, has created the problems which are facing us now.  Do not let us recreate them. Let us take the opportunity to give this body every chance to get off the ground.  Let us do that by ensuring that the council, or board, whatever you may call it, when appointed can choose their own man, the man they have confidence in, the man who, in their judgment, is most likely to command the confidence of all concerned. There may be other ways of achieving this.  The Minister may feel that he should have the right of formally appointing the person on the nomination of the board.  I do not mind what the formality is so long as the actual choice lies with the board or college council. That I feel may well prove essential to the success of the institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Deputy's historical lecture has not convinced me on this.  Before dealing with what he has said, I should like to refer back for a moment to what Deputy Keating said.  He claimed it to be a fact that the appointment of the chairman by me would prove to be a disaster. Of course, he is quite entitled to his own opinion but I object to any suggestion by him&mdash;and it appears to have been his suggestion&mdash;that the recent trouble in the college was the complete responsibility of my Department. I have said on many occasions <Col N="794" /> here that I did not feel that a Department of State was the most suitable body to run a college of art.  This is not, however, to say&mdash;and I want to emphasise this&mdash;that the officials of my Department were not very dedicated people who did a very worthwhile job over the years just as the vast majority of the teachers in the college did excellent work over the years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And even some of the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>And the students, yes.  Most certainly some of the students.  The results underline that.  I should also like to point out in relation to the recent troubles in the college that I have had a number of letters sent to me and signed by a considerable number of students dissociating themselves from what happened.  I do not want to go into any detail on this matter but I want to underline very clearly the fact that very much of the propaganda in relation to the college was untrue to say the least of it.  I was rather amused at times to see letters from people who had been students in the college and who had got on very well in the world since then, condemning for its inadequacies a college which quite obviously enabled them to reach a reasonable level in the field of art.  As I say, I do not want to go into that except to defend the dedication of the officials of my Department who worked over the years in that college.</P>
      <P>If I might come back to the point mentioned by Deputy FitzGerald in relation to my desire to have a tight measure of control over the college, this is very, very far from being true. In actual fact, if you look at the Bill you will find that for the first time ever students are being included on the board of the college as well as teachers. This in itself is proof that I am not trying to keep any sort of tight control on the board of the college.</P>

      <P>The Deputy accepted that I was entitled to appoint some members to the board.  He hoped that <Col N="795" /> I would ensure that the people appointed to the board would be of a high reputation in the world of art. I assure him that I will endeavour to ensure that this will be done.  Then, must he not also accept that, if I am to appoint a number of members to the board, equally if I decide that I should appoint a chairman of the board, I would also endeavour in exactly the same way to ensure that a person I would appoint would be the best possible person for that particular position?</P>

      <P>I cannot see any reason, if it is accepted that I should appoint members to the board and that I am capable of appointing the best possible types to the board, why I should be denied the right to appoint a chairman for the reasons I have already given.  I do not want to go back over them again.  I feel that in this particular situation the proper thing to do is to leave the appointment of the chairman, as well as some of the members, to the Minister and to, as I have already done, give the students and the teachers a reasonable and fair representation on the board also which, as I said, is an unprecedented step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard no justification. I heard an analogy with the Higher Education Authority, which teaches nobody, and the Institute for Advanced Studies, set up thirty odd years ago, which teaches a tiny number of PhD students, I think, or possibly nobody. If they teach anybody it is a handful of specialists at a high level and no undergraduates, no first degree people. That these two institutions should be dragged in as validation when both of them are utterly and palpably and indeed ridiculously irrelevant is a <Col N="796" /> measure of just how few arguments the Minister possesses.  Surely he could scrape up something a bit more relevant. Those were not arguments.  I did not hear any arguments.</P>
      <P>As to whether the Minister could or could not appoint somebody suitable, I think he could, by acident&mdash;I might even approve of the person he appointed. The point I want to make is that any Minister who wishes to take to himself the right to appoint thereby in my view, excludes himself from the possibility of making the right appointment. The fact that the Minister claims this right should be given to him, as far as I am concerned, makes it certain that he does not possess the qualities needed.  I can think of many people who ought to be on that board who would decline to serve in the circumstances not alone that the Minister appointed members, which he had the right to do, but that he was determined to appoint a chairman.  He will diminish his pool and some of the people he ought to have will not serve in those conditions, and very properly.</P>

      <P>The last point I want to make is in reply to the Parliamentary Secretary who said that by my questioning the validity of the person whom the Minister might choose to nominate as chairman I was contributing to the difficulty in solving the question of art education.  That was the first dissent in this debate from the time we were trying to communicate with each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary holds that point of view, if he feels there is a crisis which has to be solved, as I do, perhaps, he might find it in his mind, if not in his heart, to condemn the actions of his Minister in dismissing two members of the teaching staff on the very eve of a solution to the problem because that was the greatest contribution to compounding the difficulty that anybody could imagine.  To sit there as Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister who did that and hurl an accusation of causing a deterioration in the situation at somebody else is to indicate just how bankrupt it is possible to become in the retention of office.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, again words take on different meanings.  I did not suggest, accuse or imply that the Deputy had been responsible for causing anything that has happened up to this time but I did say that the Deputy, in making two statements here very shortly before I made my statement, and he is the one who now implies that I introduced the first note of dissention, said that a person appointed by the Minister would, by definition, be disastrous because of the incapacity of the Minister.  If that is not a note of dissention, I do not understand English words any more. Secondly, the Deputy said that this Bill <Col N="799" /> was a blueprint for either inadequacy or breakdown.  I said that by using those words the Deputy was implying that these were the only consequences that could arise and that this was irresponsible of him.  I did not charge him with having been in any way responsible for what has happened in the college up to this time.  When it comes to ascertaining who has been responsible for what the Deputy should at least admit&mdash;the record I trust will show this&mdash;that he, this evening, was the first person who introduced these notes of personal inadequacy and otherwise. Maybe if we wait here long enough we may all be informed as to what the central characteristics of art are.  Some, I would suggest, relate to the essential characteristics of humanity. The greatest artists have been people who, I should imagine, had a tolerance and an understanding of human nature that possibly the rest of us are not big enough to have.  Maybe the Deputy and I will both learn a little and thereby become a bit more artistic in our time.</P>

      <P>When we start allocating responsibility we get into a difficult arena because the more one sees a particular situation as it has now developed the more akin it is, in miniature, to what has happened in Northern Ireland.  How do you allocate responsibility? You allocate it in a sense in time.  Who was first responsible for something which led to other events? You allocate it also in terms of who actually held the responsibility to take decisions.  In Northern Ireland we properly claim that the British and Northern Ireland Governments, having been in charge, have responsibility and they are to blame rather than the suffering people.  In so far as they took certain actions or failed to take certain actions which alienated people we blame the alienation on them because of those failures over time.  The failures came first and there was a failure of people with responsibility.  Similarly if we are going to start dividing responsibility here of course people are to blame all round; of course the students, the staff, the civil servants and the Minister should have behaved better.  What is important, however, is that the responsibility <Col N="800" /> has rested with successive Ministers for Education for 44 years since the first report suggesting that radical changes should be made.  There has been a succession of reports since and successive Governments, more particularly in recent times the present Government, did not take any action to deal with the matter, and this led to an alienation of people, just as in Northern Ireland, which has led those people to act in a manner we find difficult to accept just as I find it difficult to accept small children being trained to throw petrol bombs at British troops and other people being encouraged to shoot policemen or put bombs in public buildings.  Of course we find it difficult to accept these things.  They are things which should not happen but we are right in placing the ultimate responsibility and blame on those who by their actions or inactions failed to introduce reforms at an earlier time.  I do not want to dwell on this point in the debate but I do not think we should try to divide responsibility one-third here, two-thirds there.  The responsibility lies fundamentally on whoever was in charge for a long time and let the condition fester.  That has been done by this Government in particular over the last ten years.  While many of the consequential actions are indefensible, as in Northern Ireland, nonetheless the blame and the responsibility go back ultimately to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To clear the air and not wishing to introduce any note of undue controversy at this stage I want to establish where I stand.  I want to get back to the particular point the Minister is making.  He made a statement in which I was very interested indeed.  I do not know if he thought about the implications of it.  He said, and I am quoting him not verbatim but almost verbatim, &ldquo;If the Deputy opposite me accepts that I should appoint members to the board why then should I not appoint the chairman?&rdquo; Does this mean that because the Minister appoints four members to the governing body of UCD, UCC or UCG, therefore he ought to appoint their presidents?  He either means that, in which case it would be nice to know where we stand as regards university autonomy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister, or if <Col N="801" /> he does not mean it why once again is he rejecting the analogy with other third-level institutions and drawing his analogy from elsewhere?  I see no reason why a Minister who does not seek for any additional power other than the power to appoint some members to governing bodies, should in this instance, claim not only to appoint 50 to 60 per cent of the members instead of the usual 12 per cent in the case of universities but also claim to appoint the chairman, who is the equivalent to the president.</P>
    <P>What is there about art, other than its unhappy history of close association with the Minister and his Department&mdash;I do not mean this Minister personally but successive Ministers over time&mdash;which makes the Minister want to appoint at least half the members and the chairman when he is content to appoint something like 12 per cent of the governing body in other fields of higher education and leave that governing body to choose the head of the institution or, in the case of the NUI, the Senate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that universities were established by legislation brought in by this House?  The Deputy keeps mentioning the universities or the governing body of the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the legislation, the not very enlightened legislation, which founded our universities&mdash;I am certainly not one who would stand up and say that out university legislation is adequate, its defects I have spoken of before and I hope to speak of them again when reforms are brought into this House&mdash; but with all the weaknesses, defects and deficiencies of the structure established in 1908 at least the British Liberal Government at the time did not claim the right to appoint more than a tiny fraction of the members of the governing body.  It never occured to them to claim to appoint the president of the college.  Yet 63 years later we have a Minister claiming not alone that he must appoint the majority of the board running a college of art but also that he must appoint the chairman <Col N="802" /> of that board.  Why?  Let us forget about analogies with the HEA and with the Institute for Advanced Studies; let us just take the College of Art as a third level insitution which we are establishing in 1971 to take its place beside, although not in precisely the same position as, universities here.  Why does the Minister claim the right in this instance to appoint the chairman as well as over half the members of the board when he does not claim that right with regard to the universities?  What is there about art which brings out this demand for control at ministerial level?</P>

      <P>Either the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have in mind a policy to take over the universities by appointing over half their governing bodies and their president or they have not.  I have heard nothing to suggest that they have.  I do not wish to cast any doubts on this.  I should be glad if they would tell the House that <Col N="803" /> they have no such ambition, I presume they will tell us that.  If they do tell us that, will they tell us at the same time why they have to have this control over the College of Art?  I can think of only one answer to that which is that they have always controlled it and now as they are relinquishing and relaxing that control they cannot conceive of giving up that control.  This is something beyond their imagination. Why?  Surely to goodness the lesson of history with regard to the College of Art is that the more directly involved the Government are the worse for the College of Art and the Government. I do not think the Government have gained very much over the past three years in the College of Art. What reason is there for wanting this measure of control in this institution when it does not exist in universities and when the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary do not appear to be seeking it?  Could either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary answer that question straight?</P>

The Deputy spoke on my references to the appointment of the various members of the board and to the appointment of the chairman.

If that is the principle why are there any other members?  If it is only a question of the Minister's competence, if that is the only basis for deciding whom he appoints, let him appoint the lot; let him appoint everybody.  But it is not a question of the Minister's competence.  The Minister may well be competent to appoint particular people but it may be most undesirable that he should have the power to appoint them or to want to exercise that power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important thing.  This is far more significant than the appointment of the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting that the Minister should think that the minority representation on the board is more significant than the majority representation on the board, a principle which I do not think he would apply either in the context of Northern Ireland or the Republic in political terms. We can all agree about how the minority are appointed as long as we have control over the majority.  It would not matter a damn how the minority are appointed as long as we keep majority control and I do not think that is a particularly convincing argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> The facts are that the Minister is insisting he should appoint from 50 to 60 per cent of the members of the board and the chairman.  He has given no reason for seeking this power for this third level institution.  He has not told us what there is about art that makes it necessary for him to have that measure of control, which he does not have and does not seek in relation to universities.  He has not attempted to answer that question.  I put it to him straight and he changed the subject.  That is highly significant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out in a previous debate that, far from that being the case, my own experience in relation to the institution with which I am familiar is that the appointments made by successive Ministers have not been of people subserviant to him, people reporting to him or people doing anything other than exercising independent judgment.  I am not accusing the Minister of wanting the power to appoint people who will do what he tells them.  On the contrary, I have stood over the record even indeed of this Government in this matter and that the record in my own institution has been excellent.  I am not suggesting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know why does the Minister insist on having the power to appoint these people.  I am not saying he is not competent to appoint them.  I am not saying he is going to appoint people who will be subservient to him.  I am simply asking the question why does he think it important that he should appoint the majority of <Col N="807" /> the board and the chairman.  He does not think that important in regard to universities.  If the Minister would please not change the subject on the question of his competence or on the question of whether I think he will appoint bad people who will be subservient to him but just stick to the point of why must he make these appointments, majority control and the chairman in this college when he does not claim the right elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There must be some reason.  There must be something about art that brings out in the Minister the desire to appoint the majority of those people concerned and the chairman.  I know nothing about art that explains to me why the Minister should react in this way.  I would have thought, from what little I know of the teaching of art in this city, if there is any case anywhere for the Minister not appointing people, or appointing the minimum number of people, to avoid any situation where it can be suggested that he is running the college, that it is under Government control, this is the case <i>par excellence.</i> I know of no case where it is important to minimise, after the history we have had of this place, the intervention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister will appoint the best people he can find.  It may be that he will be over influenced by some advice given him into appointing established figures.  They may not be the people most acceptable, but I think he will make a genuine effort to appoint good people.  That is not the issue at stake here.  The Minister should not keep changing the issue but should just stick to explaining one thing.  Why does he want this power?  He should not tell us of its existence in some other Acts.  He does not need it to show he is competent.  We are not arguing about that.  Why does he want the power?  He does not need it in the universities, so why does he need it in the College of Art?  Is there any reason, other than the traditional involvement of the Minister for Education and his feeling that in some way this must be perpetuated?  If we could get a straight answer to that question we would make rapid progress.</P>

The Deputy has spent a very considerable amount of his time talking about majorities and minorities and the majority that would be appointed by the Minister.  The obvious implication from this was that, because the Minister appoints the majority, the Minister would be controlling the board.  I want to say this is absolutely incorrect.  When the appointments are made by me the board will be an autonomous body and will not be in any way subject to me in the sense that the Deputy appears to feel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Just to give the Minister a couple of other points to come back on.  First of all, he is not being fair to me, frankly, in suggesting <Col N="809" /> that I put forward the view that he wanted to appoint people in order to control the board.  The Minister should recall that I was replying to a point he made.  He said: &ldquo;Why not discuss my innovation of having students on the board?&rdquo; I was saying that the innovation of students and staff representatives on the board was an interesting innovation but it was not the relevant innovation because they would not in fact have a majority.  We are not in fact setting up a body in which the staff and students between them would have a majority, for which there are very strong reasons.  Therefore, to bring that in when they will not have a majority is not really relevant.</P>
      <P>I was not suggesting that the people the Minister appointed would be under his thumb in any way but I was answering the emphasis he was putting on the minority and pointing out it was only a minority and therefore was not relevant in the discussion we were having.  The Minister disclosed something of his basic thinking when he asked: &ldquo;Why should the chairman be more competent if appointed by the board?&rdquo;.  It seems to me that the Minister is narrowing this down to competence. First of all, I think it is quite likely that, having appointed a board of this kind which would include two staff representatives, two student representatives and the distinguished people the Minister will appoint, that board is more likely to come to a valid consensus on the competence, likely standing and authority within the college of the chairman than the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the Minister could try to take the advice of the student body, that he could try to take the advice of the staff, that he could take the advice either of the people he would be appointing or similar people; but I doubt that that would be as effective, even if he did it.  I am not sure he has this in mind.  He would find it very difficult to consult the students and the staff as a group or individually.  I am not sure that that would be as effective as them all sitting down together jointly to discuss this.  The Minister might talk to the students and they would give him some ideas of who the <Col N="810" /> chairman should be.  That is if he intends to do this and I am not convinced that he intends to consult them about it.  He might then consult the staff and they would give him different ideas.  He would then consult people in the are world, the kind of people he might be appointing to the board, and then he will make his decision. Really, it is stretching imagination a bit to think that that will be anything like as effective as the members of this board sitting around a table, the students putting forward their view of the kind of person that is wanted, the staff putting forward their view, the independent representatives, as I shall call the people appointed by the Minister, putting forward their view and then in the dialogue and discussion here a common view emerging as to the kind of person required and then steps taken to secure such a person and to interview him.</P>
    <P>It is asking too much to expect us to believe that the Minister on his own, with of course all his other duties to perform, will necessarily as a single person do a better job than such a group of people working together, wholeheartedly concerned and interested in the future of the college which is the whole of their life.  There is bound to be a better system.  Quite apart from the fact that that system is of its nature more likely to yield somebody competent, not because the Minister would be incompetent to find such a person but because the process of consultation, of its nature, is more likely to be productive of the right kind of person, there is the further point that the Minister notably fails&mdash;I was about to say to grasp, but that might be unfair &mdash;to advert to, and that is that this man will have a difficult job to do and that therefore he will need to command authority in this institution.</P>
    <P>The Minister chooses to think that somebody appointed by a Minister of this or any other Government would command authority in the College of Art.  He is being unrealistic.  No matter who is Minister, if the Government were changed and if Deputy Keating or I were Minister and appointed somebody, I have no great confidence that no matter how well we selected that person that he would, by virtue of our <Col N="811" /> appointing him, command much authority. On the contrary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I see.  I had not understood that from anything he said nor does my knowledge of Deputy Keating's character and disposition lead me to believe that the Deputy's diagnosis is correct.  I cannot accept that such a person appointed by this Minister or that Minister will command authority as readily in this institution, with its very difficult history, as the kind of man chosen by the college council where the students, staff and the outside representatives would have come together for this purpose. Authority is a word very much misused and I think that on the other side of the House there is still a disposition to confuse power with authority. I am afraid that in the modern world the two are different things.</P>
      <P>Of course the Minister could appoint a man who would have power. The Minister can get power from the Bill to appoint a chairman who would have power to do various things, but that power is useless in the context of the College of Art unless the person has authority, and authority means that you are accepted as somebody who is capable of making valid decisions which will be accepted when they have been made after due consultation in a democratic way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically our concern is that this body we appoint, and their chairman, shall have authority, that they are appointed in such a way that they are most likely to command the respect of students and staff&mdash;all the students and all the staff.  That will not be easy. The future of this college is in doubt at the moment, not merely because there are many defects in the Bill but because the events of the last few years and the neglect that has led to such events have created deep divisions.  This is a tragedy, and those of us who have had contact with both sides and have seen, as Deputy Keating has said, how the truth is different to the two sides&mdash;<Col N="812" /> how they see the same events in a different light&mdash;realise how difficult it will be and how, it is up to us in this House to make every effort to give them the best chance possible and to ensure that whatever body of people are to run this, and whoever the chairman may be, will command authority and stand the best possible chance of acceptance by the staff and the students, despite the deep divisions among them at the moment.  That is our job and I think the Minister must accept that in pressing this issue that is what is foremost in our minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because until recently only one side got a hearing from any source except myself.  For a considerable time statements issued by specific individuals appeared to get full publicity while what I might call the silent majority went unheard.  Therefore, I am glad to know now that it is accepted a large body of the teachers and students did not accept the type of incident which took place in the college.</P>

      <P>It was never in doubt in my mind, but from the publicity point of view only one side appeared to be heard, the Department and many of the academics being blamed at all times.  As I have said, I am glad to note this is no longer the accepted position. Deputy FitzGerald said it is essential that the chairman of the board should be a person who would command authority.  I fully agree, but I do not agree he would have to be a person selected in the manner the Deputy mentioned.  He spoke of the students and the teachers and other independent people putting forward their views until finally, through some concensus, they would decide who would be a suitable person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What that would arrive at is stalemate. As I have said on a number of <Col N="813" /> occasions, the Minister, having consulted with various people of reputation in the artistic world, would be in a better position to decide on a chairman who would command authority, who would be appointed as chairman not only because of his artistic ability but also&mdash;this is something very necessary for a chairman&mdash;because of his administrative ability.  Reference was made to neglect in the college during the past few years.</P>

      <P>It seemed to have been given as the cause of the recent trouble.  I emphatically reject that.  In my view, the Minister having all the advice possible tendered to him by people competent in this field would be best able to make a choice of a chairman who would, because of his ability, command authority.  When I say authority I also do not mean power.  This man would be accepted because of his known ability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain that, in the rather difficult and peculiar circumstances of the present situation, were you to leave the appointement of chairman to the students, teachers, and independent members, it would end in stalemate with some of the people concerned refusing to accept this person as being suitable.  I again wish to stress the fact, I have no doubt about it, that a Minister getting the proper advice&mdash; and it would be up to him to get this advice&mdash;would be in a position to appoint a person who would command authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to pursue this any longer but I should like to say I still do not understand the Minister's thinking.  He seems to be suggesting that people on this body would refuse to accept a person in whose choice they would have a say. I cannot imagine in what circumstances <Col N="814" /> people would react in that way. If the Minister really thinks that the college is in such a condition that if the college council or board are given the power of choosing a chairman and that there is disagreement on that and that some of the members who do not agree with the apointment will reject it, if they are going to reject the chairman where they had a voice and an opportunity to be heard and he was chosen democratically while they had such a voice, then how can the Minister hope that someone whom he imposes on the college will be accepted?  This is not realistic. Could the Minister clarify the position before ending the debate and getting the decision?  Am I to take it that the Minister would not accept an amendment which would say that the chairman of the board should be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the other members of the board?  If the Minister wishes to have a function in the appointment so long as the selection of the person is by the board, I suppose this could not do any harm. The Minister would be the person formally making the appointment.  Would the Minister be prepared to accept such an amendment on Report Stage, or are we wasting our time trying to do anything to ensure that the chairman appointed will be somebody who will have genuine authority derived from having been chosen by the board comprised of representatives of the students and representatives of the staff?  If the Minister would be prepared to accept something like that on Report Stage I would withdraw the amendment, otherwise I would have to press it.  It is important to get this Bill through.  If we are not going to persuade the Minister we must know this now and get on with the division.</P>

      <P>The most important single decision that this board would be called upon to make would be the selection of a chairman, if they are given that power.  If they are not given that power, representation on the board will be given to the students and to the staff as a charade.  The Minister is willing to appoint a board but not to trust them with the most important single decision.  All the arguments that the Minister has put forward against the inability of the democratically constituted or even semi-democratically constituted board&mdash; because the Minister will have nominated half the people, those whom he euphemistically called &ldquo;independent members&rdquo;&mdash;but having nominated half of them and having the other half, or less than half, democratically chosen, he then produces the most compelling arguments why this group of people cannot be trusted to make the most important single decision about the chairman.  This takes away any authority the chairman might have and any confidence in the board which the elected representatives might have.  It reveals the situation as the charade that I am coming to be convinced it is.</P>

I also admit the possibility of improvement while I affirm that the basic document is pretty nearly useless and that if the problem is not solved now it will have to be solved later.</P>

      <P>In this instance, if we can go back over what was said, the Minister has not answered the only relevant question which is: &ldquo;why does he want to appoint this chairman and so many members of the board?&rdquo; We have not got an answer to that.  I would suggest to the Minister that it is dangerous when he talks about Deputy Keating saying things that are dangerous because nothing could be more dangerous than this suggestion that the democratic process of people selecting their head is divisive.  We have Presidential elections here.  People vote for different candidates.  In the process of working together in divisions to choose somebody, unity is reached and we have a democratic system with a President who is accepted as the head of the State and who is respected, while some may have more enthusiasm for him than others.  The whole democratic system works on that basis.  The approach which the Minister is adopting that one must appoint people from above because to have any process of choosing from below is divisive is immaterial to the debate.  In this debate <Col N="817" /> the Minister can say that in a particular instance there is reason for a method of appointment, but when he establishes it as a principle that choice is from below divisive&mdash;that is something we must challenge.  Perhaps the Minister did not mean it that way but it was certainly expressed in a very unfortunate way.  Let us not waste time on that.  I put something to the Minister. I think he is rejecting it.  I was not terribly clear on what was said. Even if we put down an amendment on Report Stage that the chairman should be appointed by the Minister on the advice of the board, am I right in thinking that this would not be accepted?</P>

      <P>There is nothing to prevent the Deputy putting down an amendment.  I am not going to say that I will accept it either now or then, but if the Deputy puts down an amendment I must consider it.  What the Deputy is asking me to do is to give a pre-judgment on this.</P>

      <P>Amendments may be well or badly drafted or well or badly conceived.  The Minister may have good or bad grounds for not accepting or varying them.  Sometimes it becomes clear that the Minister will not accept anything and sometimes he is willing to say under pressure that he will consider the matter &ldquo;between now and Report Stage&rdquo;.  The Minister has said this several times when dealing with amendments.  I want to know are we up against a stone-wall attitude?  Is it the case that he will not consider giving the choice of the person to the board, while retaining himself the actual formal appointment, or is he going to reject that?  Are we wasting time talking about it?  If the Minister says he will consider the matter between now and Report Stage the appropriate thing for me to do is to withdraw the amendment.  If the Minister is not prepared to consult and to accept the view of the board, then I press for a division.  I am only asking for the normal guidance which we get on every amendment.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) provides that the chairman of An Bord shall hold office on such terms as the Minister determines when appointing him and the ordinary members shall so hold office.  This again brings the Minister into the whole affair to much too great an extent and, again by analogy with other institutions of higher education, the normal procedure is that the governing body or authority are appointed for a certain term and when the term ends they are re-appointed by whatever method is laid down in the appropriate legislation.  There does not seem to be any reason why this should be varied here and why the Minister should be given a particular control over the term of office of those concerned. If the Minister has any reason for treating the College of Art differently from a university I shall be glad to hear it.  I find it hard to understand why this provision should be included.</P>

It is not necessary.</P>

I am quite prepared to accept that the Minister may want to lay down certain conditions, that the chairman of the board shall not engage in activities which would be prejudicial to the college or which could involve financial advantage to him&mdash;we can draft an amendment to that effect&mdash;but I absolutely resist the suggestion that there should be unlimited power of dismissal of the members of the board or the chairman of an academic institution. That principle goes to the root of academic freedom.  It is intolerable in any academic institution. The Minister is not seeking the right to get rid of, at a moment's notice the people he appoints to the governing body of UCD, UCC and UCG.  He does not even have legislation that requires them specifically not to have an interest in contracts with the college, because that I think is implicit in the whole way the college is run. Why should this be so in the College of Art?  If the Minister wants to legislate for what he says he wants to legislate for let him draft an amendment to that effect, but do not let him introduce a provision like this which is inimicable to academic freedom.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be interpreting the terms the Minister would lay down as being restrictive terms.  May be that is an indication of the way the Opposition may sometimes look on legislation of this sort. Is it not just conceivable in the mind of Deputy FitzGerald that the terms <Col N="821" /> might be to the advantage of the chairman or the members of the board? For instance, I think it is fairly clear that this is not a position to which remuneration will attach, but terms too could relate to such things as honoraria or expenses in certain areas. The Deputy might consider that aspect of it also as distinct from regarding them as restrictive terms.  As I say, this could be to the advantage of the members of the board rather than be restrictive.  There are many other examples that could be given.</P>

      <P>To which we had an amendment down to remove and which has been withdrawn for redrafting.  I wish the Minister would not be coming back to that.  We are never going to withdraw any amendment if he keeps saying because we withdraw it for re-drafting it is no longer capable of being considered.  What is proposed here is that the terms of office of these people should be determined by the Minister. That includes the power to get rid of them if necessary or to vary their terms of appointment to their disadvantage if they do not do what the Minister wants.  That is a power which cannot be given in respect of an academic institution.  I hope the Minister will withdraw this now and not press it any further.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in a position to vary that and to remove people before their term of office is up. That is precisely my point, that this is unnecessary.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting anything of the kind.  This is drafted in such broad terms that it would give the Minister control over the people concerned, power to determine their office, power to vary their remuneration when in office if they do not behave as he wants them to behave.  I do not see why there should be remuneration involved particularly.  It is not normal in the case of an educational institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary is saying is that it could possibly happen that it might be desirable to make honoraria to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister means expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to write in something in regard to honoraria, that is fair enough, but it is not what this says.  This gives him power to vary the appointment to the disadvantage of the people concerned and to get rid of them, if I understand the English language, and that is something <Col N="824" /> I cannot accept in an educational institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To be a member of the board acting under the authority given to him under this Bill when enacted.  The Minister has no function. He acts under the Bill when enacted. How does the Parliamentary Secretary think the governing body acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is laid down in the Act itself.  You are appointing people to a board which has power laid down in the Act.  But are there terms of appointment required?  Terms of appointment come in only if you want in some way to be able to control these people, to terminate their office, in some way to put them at an advantage or disadvantage.  We do not want the Minister to appoint them in that way.  There is no reason to vary it in the College of Art.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the number of non-commissioned officers or privates who completed more than 31 years service within the last five years; if he will take steps to amend the pensions schemes so as to have their pensions and gratuities calculated in accordance with their actual service instead of limiting them to only 31 years; the cost of making such an amendment; and, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin) Gerry Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes are a distinct superannuation code related to the special needs and conditions of the service.  The pension is not directly based on the rate of pay. The maximum pension payable after 31 years service, represents between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of pay, <Col N="696" /> depending on rank and marital status. Payment of maximum pension after 31 years service assists towards the maintenance of a balanced age structure, which is an important consideration from a military point of view.  It is not proposed to amend the schemes on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>During the past five years 168 noncommissioned officers and privates discharged on pension had more than 31 years service.  The cost of paying an increment for each year of service over 31 to these men would be approximately £12,500 per year.</P>
