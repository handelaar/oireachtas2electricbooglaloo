    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of severely handicapped children awaiting admission for institutional treatment in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 31st March, 1970, the latest date in respect of which information is available, there were 370 severely handicapped children under 16 years of age awaiting admission to residential centres.  I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions the steps which are being taken to provide additional places for the mentally handicapped who need residential care.  When these additional places are available the waiting period for admission to residential care should no longer be a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state whether the figure for those awaiting admission has increased or decreased since last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to ask me the question as to exactly how many places were provided in this passing year.  Between 200 and 300 were provided in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not quite taken my point.  What I am asking him is whether he is able to contain the figure or whether it is rising all the time.  There is very little movement out of institutions for <Col N="1304" /> severely handicapped children and the number must increase unless they die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only reply indirectly by saying that from the information available to us, it would appear that the provision of 1,500 additional places for severely handicapped, moderately handicapped and mildly handicapped children and adults is sufficient.  It is difficult to calculate the number of those who are mentally handicapped because very often such children do not come to the notice of local authorities.  In the case of severely handicapped children, the figure is a stable one.  The pattern does not change very much and represents a certain number of children who emerge each year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that the absence of local social welfare officers in rural districts leads to delays in payment of social welfare benefit and pensions; and if he will consider the replacement of these officials at convenient centres throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no reduction in the number of social welfare officers employed by the Department for a considerable number of years. There was, in fact, an increase in the number of such officers in 1969.  It is assumed, therefore, that the Deputy in his question is referring to local agents.  I am not aware that the absence of local agents in some rural districts leads to delays in the payment of social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the Minister agree that where there is no local social welfare agent, many difficulties are imposed on the persons concerned?  It is necessary for them to write a letter to the Department of Social Welfare to which, I might add, they have very little chance of receiving a reply unless they make application through a Deputy.  Therefore, extra work is imposed on officials and on Deputies and there is an extra <Col N="1306" /> charge to the State.  The simple answer would be for the Minister to accept this and to replace these local social welfare agents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about agents who are a carry-over from the old national health days. They were retained but, as they died or retired, they were not replaced. These are not social welfare officers. The function they perform is, perhaps, useful but there are always offices in the area and payments are made direct from the head office to the recipients, which is a more important thing.  The availability of forms is something about which I do not think they have any difficulty.  Of the many complaints I have received I do not think this is one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the reappraisal of employment targets over the next decade to which the Taoiseach referred on 9th February, 1971, is at present taking place; if so, by whom it is being conducted; and when its findings will be published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass) Noel T. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Deputy's question assumes that employment targets for the next decade exist, it is based on a misunderstanding. Specific targets for the growth of employment up to the end of 1972 were put forward by the Government in the Third Programme but not for any period beyond that.  These targets and the policies related to them are a step towards the ultimate goal of full employment, but as stated in the <Col N="1308" /> programme, much more will have to be done before full employment can be reached.  It is too soon at this stage to try to settle the precise form of the action required or to quantify its likely results; these are matters to be considered in drawing together policies for the period after the Third Programme.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reference on 9th February was to the review of the Third Programme which is at present taking place and which was also the subject of a reply by me to Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Dr. O'Connell on the same day.  This review is being conducted by the Departments concerned and will be published before the Budget as stated in my reply.</P>

I might add that I am satisfied that the standard of performance by the recipients of land from the Land Commission in County Kerry is as good as will be found in any other county.</P>

As a result 25 additional pupils were enrolled in Rathdrum boys' national school.</P>
      <P>The school was built to accommodate 120 pupils in three classrooms. The average attendance of pupils for the quarter ended 31st December, 1970, was 125.  One of the teachers and the pupils under her charge are at present accommodated in a nearby hall which is regarded as suitable for school use pending the provision of additional accommodation.

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say, first, that a pupil cannot be guaranteed a place in a free secondary school of his choice.  However, every eligible pupil is entitled to a place in a free post-primary school.  To date, any pupil who has sought post-primary education under the scheme has not been denied it.  The holding of examinations is confined mainly to Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  A change has been made in relation to this examination, particularly in regard to the Christian Brothers' schools where they hold all the examinations on the same day, so that there could be no question of pupils trying to get into more than one particular school.</P>

In order to pay the grants to all eligible pupils in the schools at the standards set out by the Department the amount required would be £5,988 &mdash;in other words, it is nearly £3,000 <Col N="1329" /> short.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first case, the fact that the enrolment has increased does not necessarily mean that the number of necessitous pupils has increased.  Therefore, the figures mentioned by the Deputy may be based on a false premise.  I think the Deputy is well aware what are the terms of genuine hardship.  I wish to confirm what I have said; nothing the Deputy has said contradicts it, and so far as we can ascertain the scheme is operating satisfactorily.</P>

However, if any circumstance of that sort is brought to our attention, as the Deputy is now doing, this matter will be considered.  However, I should like to point out that apparently the scheme generally is being operated on a limited enough basis to the extent that headmasters appear to be confining themselves to grants for new books.  They have&mdash;and they are aware of this&mdash;a discretion in the purchase of appropriate secondhand books as well or in the implementation of a loan scheme, and I wonder if these avenues have been explored.  Generally our experience has been that it seems to be accepted that the only way in which the book scheme can be implemented is by buying new books.  Of course, there is much more to it than that.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, relating to the movement and transit of animals are adequate.  Some of the older statutory orders which are continued in force under the 1966 Act require, however, to be revised in line with modern transport developments. This is receiving attention.</P>

      <P>I presume that, in reference to my Department, what the Deputy has in mind are the implications for manufacturing industries of the contingency he mentions.  I have, of course, no reason to assume that our application for membership of the European Communities will not be successful. In relation to the contingency mentioned by the Deputy, I would point out that the adaptation of industries to free trade conditions, and the expansion and broadening of our industrial base, will continue to be the principal objectives of our industrial policy, irrespective of whether or not we become a member of the European Communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister seen the vast disparity which exists between the British proposals for their financial contribution to the Community and what is asked of them?  Has he seen attacks on the British application by such different politicians as Mr. Harold Wilson and Mr. Enoch Powell?  Does he not, therefore, admit that the contingency to which he refers is, in fact, one which could possibly happen and should not somebody be specifically studying it in isolation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal today with the matter of farmers' incomes and the policies of the farmers' organisations at the moment.  When one is discussing levels of incomes the point has to be made that farmers differ from people in industrial employment because farmers function in a market where every price or practically every price is a controlled price, determined by the Government.  There is, for example, very little fluctuation in many of their products.  There is, of course, continuing fluctuation in the matter of beef, but the prices are to a very great extent, within the control of the central authority.  There is also no built-in periodic adjustment for inflation. If we develop the habit, as is now being urged, of all sorts of balance sheets and industrial reporting, reporting all incomes, not in terms of the going price at the moment but with an adjustment for inflation, then it will be perfectly clearly seen that farmers' incomes are, in fact, going down.  The rises granted from time to time are not sufficient to compensate them, firstly, because of inflation, and secondly, because of the fact that while the prices of most of what they sell are fixed the prices of what they purchase, the industrial products, the fuels, <Col N="1347" /> fertilisers, the feeding stuffs, the animal and plant chemicals and so on are not, in fact, fixed but are rising.</P>
      <P>There is a persistent impression among urban people that, somehow or other, no matter what happens to costs, farmers can take up the slack and go on living well.  This is not the case.  If there is increasing well-being it is surely equitable that it should be spread over all sections of the community. In those circumstances any examination of the relative incomes of different sectors of the community made by any unbiased person will indicate an absolutely clear-cut deterioration of the position of farmers relative to other sectors of the community.</P>
      <P>This is an undeniable fact on which a great deal of farmer activity for better incomes is based.  I do not want to talk about the omissions of the past on this occasion, though they are glaring and we are paying dearly for them and I do not propose now to analyse the activities and some of the policies of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and indicate where I think they are inadequate or, indeed, harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn now to the campaign for higher incomes for farmers.  We have the tragic situation in which farmers do not speak with a unified voice. I know the historical reasons for this but it has to be said over and over that whether a government or the Department of Agriculture intentionally exploit the division or not&mdash;if we were feeling charitable we would say that they do not always do so although maybe under pressure on occasions they do&mdash;it is asking too much of them to think that they should totally ignore those divisions and that they should never play one section off against another.  The reproach is not so much directed at the Department and the responsible Minister for manoeuvring as between two pressure groups, because that is a very predictable and not surprising response, but that those two pressure groups ought to realise that until they speak with a single voice they will never be able to pull the full weight of the farming community <Col N="1348" /> which they represent in the tug-of-war as to who gets the proper share of the available income.</P>
    <P>Farmers' organisations will never, as long as they are divided, as long as the possibility of playing off one against the other exists, be able to get the share of the national income for their members which in my view they deserve.  I do not think there is any particular wickedness in the present Government in this regard but I feel that governments in general will always take advantage of a situation such as that.  They have a job to do and they do it to the best of their ability.  If organisations are foolish enough to go in divided into such negotiating situations, to an extent they deserve to get less than they are entitled to.  It is their own fault.</P>
    <P>I know the animosities, I know the history, I know the sources of continuing confusion but I would urge on both the main farming organisations the vastly greater need of their members, particularly in the current situation, which ought to transcend past divisions and present animosities.  I understand also the sense of fury which exists among farmers everywhere and in both the main farming organisations at the continued relative deterioration of their position and their incomes <i>vis-à-vis</i> other sections of the community. I also understand why the current campaigns have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>I want, before going on to discuss those current campaigns, to declare my own interest in this context.  I am a member of the NFA and in the current campaign to withhold investment I have abided, on the farm in which I am a partner, by the policy of the NFA not to go on with development plans which were in hand both for the housing of livestock and the purchase of machinery.  That is not to say that I think the NFA policy is correct in this matter.  I will give the reasons in a moment why I think it is mistaken, although I understand the reasons for it.  I want, before going on to discuss that, to make it clear that although I do not agree with this as a loyal member of the NFA I have operated it. While there is certainly a need for people to exercise their own judgment <Col N="1349" /> in answer to their own conscience there is also obviously need in any organisation, if it is to be effective, for discipline. I accept the discipline of the NFA in this regard.</P>
    <P>The NFA policy is that one should abstain from investment in buildings, and machinery, and, although one is not asked to abstain from the use of artificial fertilisers, there is a campaign against the use of lime.  While I have indicated that I understand the fury which has given rise to this campaign, I understand the reasons for the NFA doing it and I am abiding by this myself&mdash;I am bound to say I do not think it is well judged at the present time.</P>
    <P>Let us tease this out a bit under the three headings.  We have throughout the country many people who, either as the proprietors of companies selling farm machinery or as employees in these companies depend for their income on continuing sales.  We also have a thing which not, perhaps, in terms of scale or income but in terms of possible outlook for the future is extremely important.  We have a nascent industry for the production of farm machinery which may be started by a vigorous, ingenious man here and there.  We have it on a larger scale with Pierce's of Wexford.  We have other places.  We have the excellent example of the Irish Sugar Company with a very fine piece of harvesting machinery which I think is world class: it is a great credit to them.</P>
    <P>The big companies who manufacture a lot of machines&mdash;whether it be tractors, Ford, Massey-Ferguson, Ransome, ploughs or whatever&mdash;will not suffer significantly&mdash;one or two per cent&mdash;as a result of the ban by Irish farmers but we could murder the little indigenous companies who are trying to get off the ground, who have not big reserves, and who have to face a very difficult economic situation.  There are difficulties from the point of view of credit, of how much one has to pay for credit, and there are difficulties for all small, home-grown industries.  These difficulties are partly of the Government's <Col N="1350" /> making in my view but if we want to be accurate about it, these difficulties are not entirely of the Goverment's making.  Since they declined to set up a separate currency for Ireland, they do not determine the cost of credit and are not able to protect us against international inflation. Therefore, the problem is not entirely of the Government's making.</P>
    <P>The campaign about machinery jeopardises jobs in the countryside but not those of farmers.  It jeopardises a small, often physically small, Irish industry which is something we ought to protect.  It does not jeopardise the big international companies that produce so much of the machinery we use.  If we have to put the finger on anybody surely we ought to get at the big international combines and not the little indigenous industries that are dependent on the vigour and energy and the entrepreneurial talent of some small man who has got into the agricultural machinery business.</P>
    <P>Very much the same arguments operate in the matter of farm buildings, in regard to the sorts of people who put up such buildings.  They are home-grown Irish industrialists.  They are employing labour.  We have rather advanced and good ideas in this country about modern, simple, cheap, farm buildings: this is a credit to our research workers and others.  We erect simple, functional buildings.  In Britain and places where the climate is as good as ours, we see how much money they waste on these enormous palaces for stock.  We know more about putting up good, cheap, farm buildings in this country.  However, we are damaging the employment and we are damaging the people who have the Irish-owned small companies and who, by and large, give this fairly good service to agriculture.</P>
    <P>On the question of lime, anybody who farms, such as myself, feels a bit irrational about it.  The country has a lime shortage, a fact which was recognised many years ago.  It seems to me, almost in a moral sense, awful that, when we have limestone and are able to process it ourselves, when there is a good scheme and a rising level of use, when there is Government help for it <Col N="1351" /> and when it is such an obviously useful thing, that farmers reject it and say they will not use it.  I am a bit sad to see that that is so.  At Question Time, a few minutes ago, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said he did not know of any evidence which would suggest that our application to join the EEC would not be successful.  It occurred to me to ask him where he had been in the past 18 months because I suppose everybody else knows that our application may not be successful. If one were opening a book on it, the chances would be, I think, about fifty-fifty of our getting in&mdash;something like that.</P>
    <P>The EEC has certainly a lot of small farmers who are inefficient and against whom we would stand up very well in competition.  It also has big farmers who are magnificently efficient and against whom we would stand up very badly.  Therefore, at this moment, we should be getting ready as fast as we can.  I suggest, therefore, that, while the NFA policy is understandable in its genesis, it is not well-considered either in its effect on the farmers themselves who are losing the opportunity of getting ready for the competition of the Community, if we get in or, indeed, for the hardships of fighting our way into a bigger sector of the British market if we do not get into the EEC. Either way, we must increase our productivity, our efficiency and our competitive edge.  Increased investment of an intelligent sort in agriculture is continuously necessary&mdash;in machinery, buildings, lime and in anything that makes us better able to compete.  We have very sensible ideas about how to get protection for stock as cheaply as possible.  We are not wasting money on farm buildings.</P>
    <P>With regard to the NFA campaign &mdash;I do not know if Deputies in different parts of the country find it the same&mdash;I think that clearly, the weapon &mdash;at a time like this when we have fairly straitened economic circumstances&mdash;of withholding purchases, is turning out to be a pretty serious and one might almost use the word a &ldquo;desperate&rdquo; weapon.  Anybody who talks to people must know that the banks <Col N="1352" /> are being very tough, awkward and ruthless at the moment.  There is a liquidity squeeze everywhere.  Small business people who got into financial difficulties, through no fault of their own, when the bank strike was over, are starved of cash.  In any community, we all know that unemployment or bankruptcy has a sort of multiplying effect.  It hits not only the people to whom it happens but it runs through the community.  Our inflationary situation was made worse by the Government's messing last year by the sort of Budget we got which was not the one we needed.  Inflation is coming through our borders, regardless of what we do at home.  We will not be able to stop, for example, the rise in petrol and fuel oil prices that will come from the settlement over the weekend with the Gulf States oil producers.  There is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>We have a rather precarious international situation.  We have a continuing inflation.  We have a shortage of liquidity at home.  Clearly, the NFA has a very powerful weapon in its hands.  It has made the point now&mdash; extraordinarily powerfully everywhere &mdash;of what a weapon it is.  Of course, a farm can continue.  You do not see the effects of a cut-back in investment straight away with a farm.  The lack of buildings, fertilisers, machinery, and so on, will show up in maybe 18 months or two years time: it will show up in circumstances where we could expand our production and sales rapidly if we had the inputs to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>I understand the anger of farmers but I think they have made their point.  I think everybody throughout the country recognises&mdash;I hope the Minister, in his reply to this debate, will recognise it also&mdash;that the farmers have made their point.  This is a powerful weapon.  Farmers are angry. Farmers feel excluded.  Farmers feel their relative position continuously deteriorating.  They have now found a weapon which is powerful and dangerous. They have shown their militancy and discipline.  They have shown that a request from a leadership does produce a very marked drop in expenditure <Col N="1353" /> for machinery, buildings, land, and things like that.</P>
    <P>It takes strong and courageous men then to show statesmanship and one might even say to show mercy, if that word is acceptable in the current context. It takes a good man to be generous at a moment like this.  I simply continue my intervention in this debate to use this rostrum to talk, of course, to my colleagues in the House but, through the House, to the farmers of the country, to say that their anger is justified, their case is a just one, to say indeed to the Minister that I hope he will see fit to recognise their deteriorating position, see fit to recognise the effects of inflation, see fit to recognise that the cost of all their inputs is soaring away in inflation and that the farmers are feeling the pinch very sharply.  This is the thing that does not show up as quickly with farmers as it would with wage earners; it is a thing that comes through more slowly but it is there beyond a shadow of doubt.  I hope the Minister will be able to find the funds to restore their position.</P>
    <P>I should also like to use the occasion for the reasons I have given&mdash;I say this as a member of the NFA, maybe I am popular with my colleagues in the NFA, maybe I am popular with farmers&mdash;to say what I think has to be said, to ask them on this occasion, having made their point very powerfully, to think again before their argument becomes any more powerful, before the weapon in their hands, which has shown itself to be such an effective one, does in fact do damage to themselves and to others in the community and in my view most importantly of all to the relationship between themselves, or as a farmer I should say between ourselves, and the rest of the community.  I want to beg them not to abandon this but simply to pause in this campaign which can be reintroduced at any moment, to see if the professions of good intentions, of goodwill, from the official side have, in fact, any substance at all.  Such a pause will be an indication of strength, discipline, responsibility and indeed mercy.  It will give the Minister an opportunity to act if he wishes to act <Col N="1354" /> and if he is bluffing it will call his bluff.</P>
    <P>All my experience leads me to the conviction that at this time and in this place it was necessary for me to say what I have just said about the NFA campaign.  If this seems like weakness, if this seems like a climb-down, I can only say that it is my conviction that it is not.  It is my conviction that it is an argument from discipline, from strength.  It is an argument by people who have been neglected but who, I hope, will reciprocate by saying: &ldquo;You have been unmindful of us; you have permitted our position to deteriorate but even in these circumstances we will not behave in a way that forgets national interest and forgets the interests of people who are dependent on the agricultural industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I realise that I have been accused on other occasions of going on too long.  I hope I will not inconvenience people who expected that there would be a rather long interval before they got a chance to get into this debate.  I simply took this occasion to make that plea and I hope it is a plea that will not be made, from any side of the House, into any sort of political football because it is not offered in the political sense, it is offered, without trying to apportion blame, at a time when difficult circumstances obtain both in industry and agriculture, when there is not a great deal of spare gravy in the country to be distributed to anyone.  I will hand the Minister that observation also for what he may choose to make of it. There is not a lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine my remarks purely to the academic side of the dairying industry.  As the Minister is well aware we have in University College, Cork, the only dairy and <Col N="1355" /> food science department in the country. Over ten years ago the question of the expansion of the staff and facilities in the dairy science faculty at UCC came in for critical appraisal.  At about the same time the need for training of personnel and for the expanding of the food industry of this country began to emerge.  The logical and indeed least expensive method of dealing with both matters was to incorporate food science and technology into an expanded UCC dairy science faculty.  It was obvious that dairy science and food science had so much in common in basic and applied courses and in requirements and general teaching facilities that such a grafting would, as in other countries where dairy science faculties exist, prove a natural and completely successful arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the siting of the proposed dairy science extension proved a difficult and complex matter and caused many delays before it was finally solved.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the faculty rightly demanded that it remain a part of UCC.  Various sites were then proposed before the site for the experimental creamery building was finally decided in 1965.  Then about five years ago a very important development took place, a unique development as far as the dairy industry in Ireland was concerned.  The Kellogg Foundation became interested in the proposal to develop the food science course in UCC.  It was recognised that the moderate amount of additional space needed for a general food technology laboratory could be provided by levelling the site proposed for the new building.  This laboratory would then complement the facilities already being planned for the dairy science department and would make the whole thing complete and indeed would make it a second to none dairy and food science training centre at university level.  It is known that these proposals were discussed with representatives of the Kellogg Foundation and the faculty. They were also asked to submit a detailed request for support.  Work had already begun on the sketch plans and a consultant had been employed about the building extension.  Indeed the Department <Col N="1356" /> of Agriculture and Fisheries were also involved in these negotiations. Equipment requirements were also discussed and eventually agreement was reached.  Detailed plans were then drawn up about the type of development and the type of format that was necessary in order to comply with the requests of the Kellogg Foundation. In 1968 these were submitted to the Department for approval.  At that stage everything appeared to be in order.  The experimental creamery was demolished in 1968 and the site was cleared.  Some difficulties were encountered in the piling operations.  This work was finally completed last June. Tenders for the construction of the building, the electrical and mechanical installations and plumbing had been accepted by the Governing Body of UCC last spring, subject to the approval of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  When piling was completed all work suddenly ceased because, unexpectedly, funds were not made available for further operations. I have been told that the reason for this was that the whole project was being questioned by the Department of Finance.  There has been much disquiet about this in UCC and throughout the dairying industry in general.  We all know that the longer we delay in completing and implementing the proposals the more the costs of such work will escalate.</P>
    <P>While these developments were taking place discussions were continuing with the Kellogg Foundation.  The discussions were conducted mainly through the dairy science faculty.  It is no secret that the discussions proceeded very smoothly.  In 1969 a grant was received to enable a world expert on dairy and food science courses to visit UCC as a consultant.  This man made three visits.  My information is that he recommended to the Kellogg Foundation that they should give financial assistance to enable dairy and food science curricula at undergraduate and postgraduate levels to be established at UCC and also for retraining existing staff where necessary and for the training of other necessary staff; that financial assistance was also required to provide laboratory and food processing equipment for student-training.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> At that time it was felt that these proposals had every prospect of being favourably received, so long as the absolutely essential building project was proceeding in a satisfactory manner. However, somebody&mdash;we do not know who&mdash;shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister knows who that was. This order to discontinue the project was given six months ago and unless a date for resumption is made known very soon it is virtually certain that the Kellogg Foundation will withdraw an offer of a grant of 500,000 dollars approximately.  If that money is lost to this country, to the university and to the food and dairy industry, someone has much to answer for.  It seems impossible to locate the person responsible for the complete hold-up in the implementation of this very desirable development in UCC.  We all know that the ultimate losers will be the farmers themselves who benefit greatly from such research in the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>About a year ago a sub-committee of the faculty of dairy science, consisting of representatives of the dairying industry, the Department of Agriculture and the faculty itself, unanimously concluded that people with training at diploma level would be required by the Irish dairy industry for the foreseeable future.  A number of recommendations were made, including one which would offer a student a university training second to none in the world.  There will be serious consequences for us all if we are not prepared to make sure that there is no further hold up in the erection of the buildings at UCC.  The sum of 500,000 dollars is a large one.  It is hard to obtain money these days but that sum is available to us, to the faculty in UCC and to the industry in general if the proposals which were initiated by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are completed.  In my opinion there is no reasonable excuse for delaying the completion of the proposals.</P>
    <P>We all know that the Department have been most generous to the dairy science faculty at all times since its establishment.  It would now appear that some hidden hand is trying to <Col N="1358" /> interfere.  This is not desirable.  The Minister should give this matter his immediate attention and investigate exactly what has happened, and find out who is at fault.  Having ascertained that, the Minister should go ahead and give permission to UCC to continue with their development.  Someone said in Cork that unless this is done this will represent the tombstone of a progressive faculty and of an industry mortally concussed by a hidden bureaucratic hand.  We do not want anyone to say that the Irish Government or their officials are at fault because of some lapse or delay in implementing the proposals in UCC.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry occupies a very strong position in Irish food processing. The total value of manufactured dairy products is approximately £60,000,000.  Roughly one half of that is exported.  Some 6,000 workers are employed in dairy plants throughout the country.  The dairy industry has its own regulations from the Dairy Products Section in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The industry has its own university education and a research centre at Moore Park, Fermoy.  The export marketing of dairy products is organised by An Bord Bainne.  Due to the close interdependence of dairying and cattle production dairying assumes even greater significance. Currently there are 152 dairy processing plants and approximately 450 associated milk intake points in the country.  Personally, I believe there are too many intake points.  We should speed up rationalisation.  There will be objections to the closing down of creameries.  Many of these units are too small and result in processing inefficiency and inability to tap adequately potentials of product diversification and development.  This is quite apart from the most important problem of all, namely, that of quality control.</P>
    <P>Some industry rationalisation has occurred but not in relation to most of the dairying countries.  For example, in the ten-year period between 1955 and 1965, the number of dairy plants declined by 45 per cent in Germany, 51 per cent in Denmark, 22 per cent in Holland, and 38 per cent in New Zealand.  I cannot too strongly urge <Col N="1359" /> the Minister to go ahead with the rationalisation of our creamery structure. The sooner that takes place, the better for all those involved in the dairy industry in Ireland.  Of course, the seasonal nature of Irish milk production, with its ratio of 12 to one between maximum and minimum, causes inefficient use of processing plants by necessitating the installation of equipment of sufficient capacity to handle peak supplies and variations in raw materials.  This creates a lot of difficulty in the controlling of quality, especially where the more specialised products are concerned.</P>
    <P>Because of these constraints it is likely that a certain level of specialised winter milk production will become necessary, and may have to be financed by incentive bonuses of some description. Unfortunately there is a very definite lack of product diversification as exemplified by the excessive industry dependence on milk fat and the relatively little utilisation of other milk constituents and by-products.  The manufacture of acid casein and caseinates should provide suitable product outlets for protein utilisation.  It is very unfortunate that this country does not produce any such products.  The historic dependence of the industry on fat at the expense of solids, non-fats and especially protein content would be most readily overcome by pricing manufacturing milk on a fat cum protein basis.  This approach has already been adopted in other countries &mdash;the Netherlands is one country that comes to mind&mdash;and I would strongly advocate it for this country.  As we all know, automated methods of fat and protein testing are now available, and effective and routine quality control of processing operations and resultant products is essential.</P>
    <P>Adequate quality control will be expedited by the amalgamation of the smaller creameries and factories into larger units, the putting forward of realistic standards and associated analytical procedures and proper training of laboratory personnel in these techniques, which gets me back again to UCC.  With the modern emphasis there is now on hygiene and sanitation, <Col N="1360" /> and the implementation of routine quality control procedures, current standards in relation to dairy products need to be reviewed and new rigorous though realistic standards should be introduced.  Such standards should embrace the composition and quality of the milk.  In order to do this job properly and to make a proper assessment of the composition and quality of the milk, we need to train quality control personnel for the implementation of these standards.</P>
    <P>These standards should be rationalised between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Health.  I would also advocate a greater involvement by the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards.  Any proposed new standards should take into account the standards that have been introduced in other countries, thereby facilitating international trading.  It is essential that the Irish dairy industry should have adequate and continuing technical representation at international forums engaged on the discussion of these standards which are binding on this country as we all know.</P>
    <P>Another inhibiting factor is the Dairy Produce Act, 1924.  Our dairy legislation is unnecessarily restrictive compared with our general food legislation. It will be necessary to liberalise our dairy legislation to enable the dairy industry to compete on equal terms with other sectors of the food industry, especially as it integrates with them. The dairy industry should be able to add additives, which the food industry is allowed to do, if a particular application warrants it.</P>
    <P>There are also anomalies in dairy legislation between different countries and the Irish dairy industry should not be at a disadvantage in competition with our international competitors because of our restrictive legislation. Of course, as amalgamations occur our factories and our units will become much larger and this will bring about the danger of pollution.  At this stage we must take adequate anti-pollution controls.  This problem will become critical unless we locate our plants in the proper places.  There will be more complete utilisation of dairy by-products, <Col N="1361" /> for example, skim milk, buttermilk and whey.  This is an indirect advantage of product diversification, quite apart from the utilisation potential, <i>per se,</i> of such products.  Because of the export orientation of the Irish dairying manufacturing industry, future industrial development should be directed towards processes like dehydration which would give flexibility in incorporating milk ingredients into other foods.  We all know that dehydration is accepted as a link in the inevitable merger between the food and dairy industries.</P>
    <P>Fermentation is also important in that a very wide range of cheese varieties can be manufactured with fermented milk.  It is about time that the industry moved away from manufacturing a few cheese products and went into a much wider cheese market.  We are necessarily restricted in the type of sales operation we can conduct abroad if our range is too small.  We can also use sterilisation by the conventional method and the ultra high temperature method.  This would give us products which would be suitable for export.</P>
    <P>Future developments in processing technology will entail the greater introduction of mechanisation and ultimately of automation, especially in the more traditional dairy processes such as cheese-making.  If we mechanise and automate our units properly we will be able to sell to a very much more diversified market.  We will not be depending on the few products we are producing in the cheese industry at the moment to bring up our sales of cheese, but we will be meeting what is, in my opinion, a need in international markets.</P>
    <P>Of course, this all goes back to the question of marketing and test marketing and to what type of produce one should put on the market.  It is about time we became more sophisticated in that respect also.  The lack of test marketing is one of the real stumbling blocks to successful product development. There is no use developing a product unless its market place reception can be guaged.  Having gone through the process of developing a product one must know that it will be <Col N="1362" /> saleable.  A manufacturer will be more interested in a new product if he has information on what is likely to be its market performance.  In this context, I would ask the Minister if he would consider it is time we used the home market as a testing market area.  In my opinion, this would be ideal.  The home market has tremendous potential in that respect.  Currently, there are no organised test marketing facilities available on the home market to the Irish dairy industry.  Bord Bainne, as we all know, are confined by statute to export marketing.  Serious consideration should be given to the organisation and funding of such an essential facility on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>We should have much greater co-operation and co-ordination between the various bodies concerned in the dairy industry, between the Department, Bord Bainne, the creameries, An Foras Talúntais, University College, Cork and other such bodies.  I would suggest that a certain percentage, less than 1 per cent, should be screened from the sale of all dairy products and directed towards the funding of further research.  A tremendous job is being done at Moore Park, Fermoy, despite the meagre allowance that they receive. They are providing answers that could solve our dairy problems in the years ahead&mdash;problems relating to dehydration, fermentation and sterilisation to mention just a few.  The allocation of more funds to that type of research development would be a very positive investment.</P>
    <P>The whole kernel of the future success of the dairy industry lies in proper rationalisation of the entire creamery industry.  This can be an emotive situation since there would be somewhat of a break with tradition.  We are becoming a bit more sophisticated in our approach but, of course, we have a lot of opposition to that.  As a Deputy who represents a constituency which is made up mainly of small creameries and with very few large creameries, this is probably not the most politically-advantageous point to make, but in the long term interest of the industry we shall all benefit ultimately from the proper rationalisation of the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> I should like to conclude by saying that the Irish dairy industry must be increasingly conscious of the growing potential for the utilisation of milk constituents as ingredients of other foods.  If the Minister sees fit to change what I would call the restrictive legislation of the dairy industry, such a trend should be aided and there should be an acceptance of the concept that milk is food and that should result in the integration of the dairy industry with the general food industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that, in his opening remarks, the Minister covered practically nothing.  Perhaps that is understandable since, as he has reminded us, he made a comprehensive statement before Christmas.  However, I note the tendency of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries when introducing an Estimate or speaking on agriculture to devote most of their remarks to what they are giving to the farmers.  They always announce this in a benevolent fashion as much as to say that the Government, as representative of a political party, are being very kind to the farmers.  I would think that the up-to-date function of a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should be the rationalisation of our agricultural policies.  Undoubtedly, there will be very big changes in the outlook here on agriculture if we are to become a member of the EEC but the only real change that has taken place in agricultural policy took place during the term of office of one of the Minister's predecessors, Deputy Blaney, when he introduced the beef incentive scheme.  Deputy Blaney introduced this scheme at a time when it was becoming apparent that dairy stocks and the by-products of dairy stocks were not only building up in this country but were also in excess in practically every up-to-date agricultural community in the world.  That was a move in the right direction but, at the same time, it created a lot of chaos among the farming community generally because of the fact that the farmers have been encouraged during the years to invest money in the dairy industry.  They were given the go-ahead to invest without <Col N="1364" /> restriction in this industry.  The result was that many of them found themselves with a very heavy investment in this line of agriculture and were then forced to restrict by virtue of the lack of viable markets.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows as well as I that agricultural surpluses vary very much from year to year and from country to country.  Eight or nine years ago there were enormous grain surpluses building up in the western world, in Canada and the United States.  Then, there was a drought in the southern hemisphere which lasted for about seven years. Crop production fell as a result.  There was also the total failure of the agricultural policy of the Comecon which resulted in the total decline there in grain production.  Almost overnight the Russians, who could not get the stocks which they used to get from East Germany because the common agricultural policy was failing there too, bought these surplus stocks and disappeared. Shortly afterwards, Communist China came on the scene and bought up the Canadian and American stocks so that the surplus disappeared almost like magic.</P>
      <P>That brings me back to the dairy industry.  The former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries considered it necessary, and I think he was right, to encourage the farmer to change largely from dairy produce to beef.  It is an inescapable fact that the cattle population has been practically static throughout the century.  It has fluctuated upwards and downwards but by and large it has remained virtually the same.  No figures which anybody can produce will convince me to the contrary. At present there is an increase, due largely to the beef incentive scheme, but it is totally inadequate to our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to be serious about entering the Common Market and if we are to derive the full benefits which may accrue we will have to concentrate with all the force at our command on building up our cattle stock.  For that purpose, a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is faced with a very difficult problem.  He has to keep the ratio right between the milk trade, which is vital, apart from the products, and the <Col N="1365" /> breeding of livestock.  He has to put into production every available acre for the purpose of rearing livestock for export.  It is a truism that over the years the basis of our whole economy has been the sale of livestock produce. Despite all that has been said in the past about doing away with grass it was a New Zealand agricultural expert who some 20 years ago said that one thing the Irish can produce is grass.  We can grow grass and with it we produce the best livestock, livestock that comes rapidly to maturity, and we also produce horseflesh which is probably the best in the world.  We produce the best bone for horses for chasers.  We should concentrate on trying to get a rational balance between beef production, which must go ahead at an increased rate, and dairy produce.</P>
    <P>If we become a member of the EEC we stand to gain, as the Minister said, immeasurably.  He mentioned a figure in the neighbourhood of £50 millions to £70 millions in live exports.  Of course, you can prove anything with figures and you can argue with figures but I prefer to avoid them as far as possible and to talk in generalities. Certainly we can sell, and we will be able to sell, anything we produce.  Of course, that poses the question of whether the United Kingdom will become a member of the Common Market.  The old argument which is used when this question is raised is: &ldquo;If they go in, we go in&rdquo;.  Our problem is quite different from Britain's. Our economy has been maintained by what we were able to sell on the British market and our exports of cattle and livestock over the years have been taken up by the British.  For the best part of this century they have taken anything we have been able to sell but since the war they have developed a different agricultural policy and they have been paying huge sums to try to cut their bill for imported foodstuffs and we have been the sufferers.  That did not happen overnight but developed gradually and we found that we had a dwindling British market for our exports.  The actual volume may not have declined very much but what we had to face was continual fluctuation in price.  Consequently successive <Col N="1366" /> Fianna Fáil Governments looked to other forms of production.  They encouraged farmers to grow wheat.  A lot of good land was utilised in growing wheat, a crop which has now been seen to be unsuccessful and unsuited to our climatic conditions.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who has a rural constituency as I have, and other Deputies will have had the same experience as I have had that those who were largely going in for tillage, and for wheat in particular, in 1962, 1963 and 1964, when there were bad harvests, got into debt and have not been able to get out of it yet. This was for the simple reason that they were following the policy advocated by the then Minister that the farmers should grow wheat and grow it as a subsidised product.</P>
    <P>At that time anybody who spoke against wheat-growing was supposed to be disloyal to the national interest. Good land was being utilised with negative results.  The crop was heavily subsidised.  Of all the things we may export we have nothing to gain from wheat if we sell it in the Common Market because the price here for wheat is not an economic price and I speak as a practical farmer.  I grow wheat for the simple reason that it does not lie down and destroy my hay-seed underneath.  That is why I grow it and for no other reason.  It is not an economic product and wheat-growing was a mistaken policy.  The Minister must rationalise our agricultural policy.  He must give the lead through his instructors, and by public statements, and he must indicate to the farmer what he is to produce and what he stands to gain by entry to the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Some people think that we should not go into the Common Market.  Some people feel we will not get into the Common Market.  It is quite obvious that the British market at present is insufficient to give us the standard of living we require.  It did in the past because people were prepared to accept lower standards of living and our exports were able to keep our industries going.  Now, however, people are demanding a higher standard of living; the British economy has diminished, <Col N="1367" /> their purchasing power is not as strong as it was and they themselves are in the market as agricultural producers. For that reason we must look further afield.</P>
    <P>The inevitable conclusion is that Ireland is a strong applicant and a likely candidate for entry into the Common Market.  Therefore, one must ask, what is the position in the livestock trade?  As I said, the livestock population has been more or less static. I am sure the Minister will refute this and produce figures which his devoted officials will give him, showing that we are a couple of hundred thousand up in the last year.  That is no good.  They require to go up a vast amount in order to secure a return to cover the losses we may have in other directions as a member of the EEC.</P>
    <P>If we join the EEC we will not continue exporting on the hoof.  There may still be a limited export of store cattle to the British market.  Trade will be maintained because the nation will have awakened to the fact that we can process our own meat, in other words, use the finished product here and get a more secure market in Europe, and also provide the necessary employment at home.  Therefore, if the British want our store cattle they will have to pay an equitable price.  The store trade will be maintained but not to the same extent and Britain will not be our major export market.  This House is entitled to hear from the Minister what plans the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have for the export of the major portion of our cattle to the EEC, assuming we become a member.  Are we going to export it live, are we going to export it on the hoof, or will we do as other sensible people do, namely, kill and cure and process at home and thereby give employment?</P>
    <P>This House and the country would be interested to hear from the Minister on this point.  The general knowledge and information that has been given relative to the EEC is practically nil.  As far as I know, the only people who have tried to inform themselves about the EEC are members of religious orders, who are interested in <Col N="1368" /> all educational matters.  Agriculture is of primary importance and the Minister should do all he can to ensure that the farming community are well informed. The implications for this country regarding agriculture are wide &mdash; much wider than with regard to the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I referred to the disappearance of grain surpluses. I am subject to correction on the following point as I have not at my disposal the up-to-date information the Minister has, but my understanding is that there has recently been a considerable decline in butter stocks.  There was so much butter in Europe a short time ago that they nearly had to throw it away but this situation is altering rapidly.  Other countries have realised that there will be a considerable demand for beef; in fact, throughout the world there is not a surplus in beef nor, I think, in mutton.  Other countries have recognised this fact and have rationalised, just as did the Minister's predecessor when he introduced the beef incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>It might well be asked what should the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries do.  I have been in this House for nearly 20 years and I have tried to give Fianna Fáil sound advice&mdash;very little of which they have heeded.  At the moment there is much discontent among the farming community.  There is no point in my arguing the rights and wrongs of the situation; that would be for those who are actually members of national farmers' organisations.  The Irish farmer has to bear a heavy burden by way of rates&mdash;the larger the farm the higher the rates.  Despite all the talk about the annuities and the freedom and the rights of the Irish farmer, today he has an ever-increasing annuity to bear.  Before he makes one penny, the Irish farmer has to pay rates&mdash;which we would probably call a land tax in the Common Market&mdash; and, in addition, he must pay ever-rising costs.  Whenever there is an industrial dispute, the people concerned get an increase in salary but the farmers get nothing.  He must be content with statements made by successive Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries that so many millions of pounds are <Col N="1369" /> being given to the farmers.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a special plea for the small farmer.  He is the person who is in difficulties.  Perhaps he is not hit so hard in the charges I have mentioned such as annuities and rates, but it is difficult for him to get off the ground.  He has been encouraged to grow wheat and he has tried it.  A bad season affects him adversely and he cannot rise up again.  It is practically impossible for him to get credit.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation is supposed to be for the purpose of financing farmers who need help but it is purely a commercial concern and has as its motto &ldquo;no advance without security&rdquo;.  There are many small farmers throughout the country and they have gone down due to a slump in cattle, to bad harvests or perhaps disease in their stocks.  The only way in which they can get on their feet again is to secure credit and for this reason they go to the ACC.  The credit position in this country is very difficult because the banks will not lend any money unless the farmer pledges his farm as security.  Irish farmers are conservative and they do not like to pledge something for which they and their forefathers fought so long.</P>
    <P>Our country is likely to enter into the EEC.  We are likely to get agricultural benefits but the people who constitute the majority of Irish farmers&mdash; the small farmers&mdash;must be in a position to obtain credit to build up their farms.  Beef is an expensive item to produce and unless our farmers have the necessary credit to do this they will be unable to avail of the market that is available for this commodity.  This lack of credit is one of the basic causes of discontent among the farming community. The Minister should introduce a scheme of credit for farmers.  At the moment they have to pay annuities and rates and, in addition, if they borrow money they are obliged to pay a high rate of interest.  The ACC should be given funds which could be used for hardship cases.  If these funds could be utilised for farmers below a certain acreage to enable them to build up their farms this would be a most worthwhile exercise.  If the Minister approaches the problem from this angle he will remove much of the discontent <Col N="1370" /> that exists.  When assistance is granted to farmers it often transpires that the greater part goes to the large farmers.  The beef incentive scheme is a worthwhile project and encourages people to increase their stock.</P>
    <P>However, most of the benefit of that scheme goes to the big farmer.  The big farmers, of which possibly I am one and the Minister is another, can look after themselves.  Our real grouse is that we pay absolutely prohibitive rates.  My own rates have increased tenfold in the last few years, and they are going up all the time.  Small farmers want to be made solvent and to be able to produce.  Big farmers and medium-sized farmers want to be in a position to buy from the small farmers at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>The husbandry of a small farmer is to rear so many cattle each year, not necessarily to bring them to maturity. Unless he has 60, 70 or nearly up to 100 acres he has not sufficient land on which to feed his stock.  He is the producer of the foundation stock which he then sends on to the bigger farmers who should be in a position to pay an equitable price.  Therefore, a balance will have to be kept between the small farmer and the big farmer, and that balance can only be kept by ensuring that the money that is made available by the State is really of assistance to the small farmer.  The best way for the Minister to do that is to have a reasonable sum made available for small farmers only to enable them to build up.</P>
    <P>In this document produced by the Government in relation to the EEC it is indicated that horticulture in this country will face great difficulties.  I do not agree with that.  I hold that horticulture has had no proper investment to date and it has had very little encouragement, in spite of the noble efforts of An Foras Talúntais, to expand.  The horticultural industry is very beneficial to small farmers.  We have here a fairly equitable climate, but many people think that we could not compete with warmer countries like Spain and the Channel Islands.  That is a fallacy and a fallacy that is indicated in the Government's White Paper on our agricultural prospects in the <Col N="1371" /> EEC.  In these warmer countries fruits such as tomatoes ripen at the one time. We have the advantage of being able to spread our production over a longer period.  These are points that ought to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The amount of money invested in horticulture is negligible.  There has been a considerable improvement in the funds that have been made available to An Foras Talúntais but not enough to enable them to foster the industry properly.  This industry, as I say, can be extraordinarily beneficial to the small farmers.</P>
    <P>The small farmer is the foundation of everything in this country.  I sincerely hope that when the Minister comes to formulate his policy&mdash;if he is still Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries when it comes to entering the EEC, as we seem likely to do&mdash;he will put all sections of the agricultural community into a position to produce whatever they are able to produce to the limit of their financial resources assisted in every way possible by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The most surprising aspect of this debate is the sparsity of contributions from Deputies of the Government party which claims to obtain such a great proportion of its electoral support from rural Ireland. To judge by the contributions from that side of the House one would hardly imagine that one-half of the population lived in rural Ireland or that, indeed, one-third of the national work force seeks its livelihood from agriculture.  There is need for the social and economic life of rural Ireland to be built up and for balanced development between the urban and rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I wish to thank the Minister for the very comprehensive 50-page document which he circulated to Deputies outlining the main activities of his Department, and for the December bulletin of his Department giving a review of 1970 and the prospects for 1971.  These are extraordinarily interesting and give a very clear indication of the current thinking not so much within the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1372" /> as among the senior officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>As long as I have had any interest in politics I have never known of the framing of any particular policy by the Fianna Fáil Party, apart from whatever may emerge from discussions between the officials and the Minister, which is enshrined as party policy.  That has been a particular neglect which has left agriculture in Ireland in a rather weak position and certainly not in the position it should occupy, relatively, among the highly developed agricultural markets of Europe.</P>
    <P>As evidence of what I have said, we see in Ireland that as industrial incomes in the urban areas grow and grow quite rapidly, agricultural incomes have dropped further and further behind, notwithstanding the fact that in 1970 an extra £10 million of what we politely call &ldquo;transfer payments&rdquo; were transferred from the more wealthy sections of the community to those urgently in need in the agricultural sector.  The fabric of community life has continued to be distorted and it is about time an effort was made to create a proper balance.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries have had differing political views and varying personal interests. They have been men of very strong character who have tried to stamp forever more the dominance of their own personalities on the Department rather than their own political ideals and as a result the Department has suffered.  At present we do not even have a progressive land policy.  We have a set of problems in terms of land and produce which are as much sociological and psychological as economic.  The only hope is for radical change in our agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that the problems relating to agriculture tend to be treated and discussed in isolation by both the Department and the Cabinet.  When one looks at the clár for the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis next weekend one sees agriculture treated quite separately.  In due course, no doubt, Deputy J. Gibbons, provided he is allowed to speak by those who have strong views about his other political involvements in 1970, <Col N="1373" /> will treat rural Ireland as a kind of reservation in which Fianna Fáil has a particular interest.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the problems relating to agriculture will only be solved within the framework of a national plan involving social and economic development and at the same time intertwined with policies for industrial development, industrial growth centres and education in particular. It should be pointed out here that the educational system of this country has never recognised the existence of agriculture.  We have to get to grips with the problem of the Department itself because if we enter the Common Market a whole new set of marketing problems will arise.  I am concerned about the lack of thinking within the Cabinet on this particular aspect.</P>
    <P>There is need for a fundamental restructuring of Government Departments in relation to agriculture and a redefinition of the roles of the various departments.  Until such time as that occurs I do not see very much hope for implementing national policies. There is also need to separate the policy-making aspects of the Department from the administration of the Department and this, of course, was dealt with in the Devlin Report. Although the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries has always played a very special role and had a very special status in public administration it has not been developed as an effective Department.  Because of this and the special status accorded to Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries an exclusiveness has developed in relation to the work of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries with other Government Departments.  As a trade unions officer, I found this very much in evidence when dealing with the Department and other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries was reluctant to involve agricultural interests in the National Industrial Economic Council but at long last, as a result of a great deal of pressure being put on the Government, agricultural organisations are being brought in to a newly-developed economic <Col N="1374" /> council.  This means the Department will be directly involved.  When the Second Programme for Economic Expansion was published we were given a separate document on agriculture from the political head of that Department.  When the Committee on Industrial Organisation was set up I can remember many reports being produced but there were always separate reports and parallel reports coming from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Such attitudes and actions have tended to aggravate the divisions between rural Ireland and the rest of the country.  For these reasons I think a Department of Rural Development &mdash;I am not too worried about what it is called&mdash;should be established as a matter of urgency.  Responsibility for fisheries, agriculture, lands, community development in rural Ireland and the co-ordinating of various physical, social and economic aspects of rural Ireland should all come under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  On that basis I would abolish the present Department of Lands. Deputy Seán Flanagan goes around this House as Minister for Lands in a euphoria of almost permanent, personal redundancy.  I have never seen a Minister believe less in the Department for which he allegedly has Cabinet responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not responsible for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but one of the difficulties in talking about agriculture is that all of us have our own little brown paper parcels and tend to open them up from time to time.  I suggest that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries take over the functions of the Department of Lands. The Department should have a senior Minister at its head, and he may even have, as well as his Parliamentary Secretary, one or two junior Ministers under him.  The policy-making and administrative roles of the Department should be clearly separated.  Policy formation should primarily be the responsibility of the Minister within the <Col N="1375" /> framework of the Cabinet.  Too many Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries have spent too much of their time comforting local Fianna Fáil Deputies in the country with personal letters about agricultural plans commencing &ldquo;Dear Paddy this&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dear Joe that&rdquo;, rather than getting on with the work for which they are there, that is, policy formation and consulting with the farming organisations and the various rural organisations in order to ensure that their views are fully considered and fully recognised by the Department. There is also a necessity to establish within a re-organised Department of Agriculture and Fisheries a formal quasi-statutory system of consultation guaranteed by setting up permanent, official consultative machinery within the Department in relation to the various agricultural representative bodies.  I do not think the cursory annual review meetings or emergency meetings between the Minister and the various agricultural representative organisations and bodies is good enough.  There should be in operation within the Department, within the Cabinet, in the policy making of the Government, a formalised system of permanent, consultative machinery of a fully representative nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would overcome some of the personality conflicts which have developed from time to time in relation to the Government and the various farming organisations and would also overcome at least the uncertainty which seems to surround all discussions between the Department and the various farming representative organisations. Therefore, I submit that, as a matter of deliberate policy on the part of the Labour Party.  If we are ever given the opportunity of putting it into effect&mdash;I can assure the Minister that we will&mdash;we would probably find as much difficulty convincing some of the senior officers of the Department as we would to convince some other politicians involved.  Nevertheless, given the opportunity, the Labour Party will most certainly advance this policy.  I do not think our opportunity is that very far away because I certainly do not believe the present Government <Col N="1376" /> will be in office for much longer.  A welcome change is more than due in that regard.  I hope to see a complete restructuring and re-orientation of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am quite sure that, if we do this, at least one of the dynamic elements could be harnessed to give leadership to rural Ireland in the solution of their own problems.</P>
    <P>There are two or three other aspects I should like to dwell on in relation to the Minister's Estimate.  There is a considerable need, particularly facing imminent Common Market entry, to strengthen very radically and very emphatically, the marketing structure for Irish products in this country.  I do not hold with any airy fairy bureaucratic setting up of marketing boards just for the sake of setting them up. However, they must be set up in this country, because there is a fond illusion going around the Fianna Fáil Party at the moment that because there will be enhanced prices for a limited range of products within the EEC&mdash; undoubtedly enhanced prices will be obtained in relation to a number of products&mdash;there is no great need for an increased sophistication and an increased development on the marketing front in relation to Irish export products. All the price advantages which we could enjoy on the European market for Irish farmers will not be obtained unless those products are marketed in a greatly improved and higher quality setting.  Unless far greater vigour is displayed in relation to quality, grading and general presentation on the European market then the so-called bonanza which the Minister and many agricultural pundits tell us will inevitably occur will simply be wiped out, irrespective of the price advantage we may currently enjoy.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, strongly urge that in a number of areas&mdash;particularly in the areas of meat, livestock, bacon, pig meat under a revitalised Pigs and Bacon Commission, milk and dairy products under a reorganised Bord Bainne and also in relation to horticulture and food processing&mdash;consideration be given to the setting up of marketing boards.  These boards should operate on a co-operative basis, having representatives of the Government, the <Col N="1377" /> farmers and other relevant interests, co-opted and nominated to them.  The constitution and the setting up of those boards should be enshrined in legislation in order to protect the various interests of farmers.  At the moment, when new boards are set up to deal with current policy and production problems within the industry, the emphasis on marketing certainly does not seem to exist in relation to many of their activities.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne could be given a greater shot in the arm.  Tremendous work has been done by them with great difficulty, mainly the difficulty of finance.  However, Bord Bainne could be given greater co-ordination and responsibility in relation not only to the home market and intervention in the home market but also in relation to the export industry.  There is a good case to be made, in relation to the Meat and Livestock Board, for co-ordinating the work of the marts throughout the country, the various co-operatives, the established meat processors and the distributive trade with the various specialist expert advisers available to the meat and livestock export trade.  A marketing board for that area could be set up by the Government on a much broader basis to supervise the home and the export trade in fat and store cattle.  I am quite certain it could make a very effective contribution to the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>I do not believe a case has to be made in relation to the expansion and the development of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I would prefer to see a general Bacon and Pig Meat Marketing Board set up with similar responsibilities to those I have mentioned in relation to the other marketing boards. There is still a great need for the rationalisation of the bacon processing industry.  Not half enough work has been done on the productivity end and a great deal of work still remains to be done on the marketing end for Irish bacon, especially on the selling front in the UK.  Co-operative interests could be much more greatly involved in that industry.  Many advantages could accrue from a shot in the arm being given by the Minister to that board.</P>
    <P>There are other factors and other <Col N="1378" /> boards which one could usefully advance as being worthy of study by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, such as the Cereals Board, but, quite frankly, as I intend to conclude at six o'clock I do not have the time nor do I wish to delay the House in going into much detail in regard to those aspects.  They are self-evident to the Minister and to the House generally. An aspect I should like to deal with, however, is in relation to co-operation in this country.  Part of the great weakness of Irish agriculture stems from the relatively underdeveloped state of the co-operative movement here.  I know all Members of this House give a great deal of general lip service to the movement. One might say the Department is in a state of frozen neutrality in relation to the co-operative movement in this country.</P>
    <P>We could do a great deal more to encourage co-operation in Irish agriculture. In 1969, we had some 340 societies with 130,000 members, a capital investment in this country of £20 million and a combined trade turnover of some £210 million.  There should be a greater development of the IAOS because some 95 per cent of agricultural societies in Ireland are affiliated to that body.  It could bring about greater service to the agricultural community, particularly in the educational and advisory spheres.  The IAOS could be of major assistance in rationalising the co-operative structure in this country because many societies are too small and, in terms of size, too inefficient.  The work of the IAOS has not, I fear, received sufficient recognition from the Government.</P>
    <P>We have only to examine the work being done in the general marketing and distribution of meat and meat products to appreciate the tremendous impact the co-operative movement could have on our export trade.  I have often wondered why greater statutory recognition has not been given to the IAOS by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  An annual formal grant-in-aid of a direct or subvention nature should be made to the IAOS without entailing Departmental control.</P>
    <P>I welcome the growth in the number <Col N="1379" /> of our cattle marts which has aided considerably the rationalisation of the trade.  I have no doubt the co-operative movement in the years ahead will have a spectacular impact in the cattle mart sphere which, in turn, will bring many more benefits to the farming community. Our farmers will then, to a greater degree, participate directly in that industry and exert greater control in relation to sales, distribution and exports.  Cattle marts have encouraged a greater consistency in the quality of the animals offered for sale and have eliminated a number of middle-men who derived substantial pickings from the industry until the establishment of the cattle marts.  Whether by way of a mini White Paper or a murky document, or whatever it may please the Minister to call it, I urge him to initiate a general review of the work of our cattle marts and particularly how new marts might be developed in appropriate growth centres.  There is a need to extend some marts and to establish new ones.  Some of the work entailed could be done by the IAOS in conjunction with the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister should keep a sharp eye on foreign control of Irish food processing and manufacture.  Strong action must be taken to prevent excessive foreign control of Irish food-processing and food-manufacturing undertakings. Otherwise, when and if we enter the EEC, I am afraid our farmers will find themselves in an extremely vulnerable position.  A situation could arise where, due to excessive foreign control over the export undertakings from this country the Irish farmer would be caught at both ends of the candle, extreme distortions could occur and the price increases which would accrue for certain products would automatically go overnight. This is an aspect on which a working paper from the Department in relation to the Common Market would be very welcome and would be reassuring for Irish farmers and it would give the policy formulators in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries some work to do on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>The fertiliser industry, playing such a crucial and vital role in agriculture, <Col N="1380" /> should be brought progressively under either total State-sponsored co-operative control or under general public control, because I am afraid that, unless that is done and done quite deliberately as a matter of policy by the Government in the national interest, the question of pricing and policy standards and the general import policy in relation to fertilisers will pass out of the realm and influence of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. The State-owned Nítrigin Éireann should be encouraged quite definitely to expand its activities in the interests of the community.  In relation to the private sector in operation at the moment either the State should acquire an interest in it or should acquire some controlling involvement in it and should certainly, if necessary, transfer it into co-operative hands so that foreign ownership of this vital industry &mdash;it is a national industry&mdash;should be ended and that any external links should be subjected to the closest scrutiny.  I do not make this proposition from any inverted preoccupation about Irish industry for the Irish people.  I simply make it in the belief that, if the farm inputs of fertiliser, lime, agro-chemicals generally, animal feedstuffs, agricultural machinery and fuel oil are to be made available to the Irish farmer at the cheapest possible rates and with the least profit accruing to the private entrepreneurs in these sectors of agriculture, then the role of the Department in regard to these inputs most certainly will have to be quite strong and quite definite to ensure that these sectors are not dominated by private interests.  I submit this is of prime importance, particularly when one is considering the entry of Irish agriculture to European markets. Deputy Esmonde spoke of the tremendous Irish natural advantage of grass production.  It is a waste of time having a natural advantage if one is also the subject of external exploitation in relation to fertilisers, lime and agro-chemicals. I therefore submit that this is a key aspect in relation to the Government's policy on agriculture.  I would strongly recommend that the Minister should keep a very sharp eye on that, particularly as we see, even from <Col N="1381" /> recent newspaper reports that the whole technology of fertilisers has undergone very rapid changes in the recent past and the future relies very much on concentrated and complete fertilisers being available at ever more reasonable prices to Irish farmers for the work they are expected to do on behalf of the nation in future.</P>
    <P>May I suggest to the Minister that he should examine&mdash;I know we have had reports from the Department before on this aspect&mdash;the quite extraordinary degree of dependence of Irish agriculture at the moment on imported agricultural machinery.  I am quite certain the House recognises that economics seem to dictate this development, but when one remembers that the Irish Sugar Company were able to develop with very considerable success a home trade and an export trade for highly specialised machinery for the sugar beet industry and for the vegetable industry one feels that the Government should consider developing some specialised lines in the agricultural machinery sector.  Not having any great personal knowledge of it, I merely advance it to the Minister as being worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The House is at a disadvantage&mdash; and I have always found it to be completely preposterous&mdash;in that if one wants to talk about land policy one has to wait for the Minister for Lands and one can talk about agricultural policy only in the presence of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, as though they were not completely integrated and involved in rural problems and rural development.  It is not at all appreciated that the ownership of land by Irish farmers entails a very serious social responsibility to ensure that land is used to the best possible national advantage and that the optimum possible return from that land is given to the whole of the community in terms of marketable produce and employment on the land.  It is a matter of very serious concern to this House that there does not seem to be, within the Government at any rate, any real determination to come to grips with the serious land problem within the context of agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>I would strongly suggest, having <Col N="1382" /> already pointed out the need to reintegrate the Department of Lands with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, that the present Land Commission should be abolished, should be radically transformed.  There is nothing more self-destructive to the future development of a rational land policy than the continued existence of the Irish Land Commission.  It has destroyed more than one political party in this country in terms of thinking logically and rationally about the allocation of economic holdings to Irish farmers.  If this is done, we can then get down to talking about land transfer problems and land succession problems because these reflect the accumulated results of generations of neglect in this country and a very bad policy in relation to the very structure of the land policy we hope to develop.</P>

      <P>This motion is in four parts.  The first part is:</P>
      <P>to examine the causes giving rise to the increase by building societies in mortgage interest rates for existing borrowers;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people who have bought a house from a building society in the last ten years thought that the rate of interest would be on a fixed basis and that if it was 8 per cent it would remain at 8 per cent.  Up to three or four years ago this was the practice, regardless of whether interest rates went up in the banks, merchant banks or in any commercial business.  The interest rates remained the same.  This feeling was strengthened by the fact that the SDA loans were on a fixed rate of interest. In the case of a city like Dublin, up to three or four years ago 80 per cent of those who purchased a house under 1,200 square feet nearly always got SDA loans.  The Government ran out of money and they forced a tremendous number of people to look for money from building societies.  Prior to this, where they could not get SDA loans the people borrowed from a building society.  In any given area in Dublin where there were houses of under 1,200 square feet, over 1,400 square feet and up to 2,000 square feet the majority of people were on SDA loans so that the average person thought that once he bought a house he had it on a fixed rate of interest and had a fixed rate of repayments.  Deputy Clinton pointed out that when the interest rates went from 8 per cent to 8½ per cent this meant an extra £35 per annum in repayments.  This extra £35 repayments was on top of the original rate at which the man thought he would repay for the rest of his life.  In recent years people could not get SDA loans.  They were turned down by the former Minister for Local Government.  They were <Col N="1384" /> put to the pin of their collars to get loans.  They had to have a certain salary in order to get a loan and that salary also included overtime.  If they got a loan they were paying £6, £7, £8 or £9 per week repayments.  On top of that, they are asked to pay an extra £35 per annum.  To many of these people this is &ldquo;the straw that breaks the camel's back&rdquo;.  Many of these people run into trouble.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton pointed out that in some cases people who had borrowed 15 years ago, and who would now be coming near the end of their repayments, got their money at 5 per cent, but the rate of interest has now jumped by 3½ per cent.  This is a tremendous jump.  A person could argue that they got their money cheaply but they got it at the going rate of interest.  The bank rate at that time must have been 4 per cent or 4½ per cent.  Suddenly they are asked for 3½ per cent extra.  This kind of jump quickly upsets one's calculations.  I am worried about a person who came in blindly thinking he would have certain repayments for the rest of his life and that the only thing that could go up would be rates.  The ground rent, if any, would remain the same.  We all know that the building societies must look for their money in the open market.  They must be competitive against the merchant banks who offer 6 per cent, 7 per cent or 8 per cent, or whatever the rate is at the time. They must be able to collect this money.  They take money on a short-term basis.</P>
    <P>Scarcity of money is the reason for the jump in interest rates.  Inflation has also caused an increase.  Government spending in this country has been the greatest factor in inflation.  They have spent <i>ad lib.</i> and have taken money out of the private sector.  Their share of the national cake is now reaching unprecedented proportions and the private sector is getting less and less. The private sector is paying any rate of interest asked in order to get money for development.  This in itself puts up the cost of building because the builders must repay the interest before making profit.  Where the Government, because of the inflation which they have caused, are looking for loans they <Col N="1385" /> can go on the public market.  Their loans can be greater because they are long-term.  They do not have to pay out on a short-term basis.  They offer 9 per cent or 9½ per cent and the person who is willing to wait five or ten years can put money into such a loan and get 9 per cent where he would get only 8 per cent from a building society.  This is making money more scarce and the building societies can, and do, pay less because they are on a short-term basis of three months or perhaps six months.</P>
    <P>Clause (1) calls on the Government to examine the causes giving rise to the increase by building societies in mortgage rates for existing borrowers. The Government could copy those who rent property in this city.  That would get over the initial period in the life of a young married person with one child who is buying a house.  I am sure the Minister knows about the renting of property.  Property is rented on a 35- or 36-year lease.  In the case of a loan it would be over 35 years.  There should be a seven-year break somewhere in it.  I am saying that the building society when it gives a loan at 8 per cent keeps it at that 8 per cent, regardless of what money is lent at, for a certain number of years.  Perhaps there should be a break at the 12- or 13-year stage in order to have a look at the cost of money at that time.  The problem arises in the first five, six or seven years of marriage.  A man probably buys a house to keep up with the Joneses.  That is all right if he can afford it, but if someone in the family gets sick he cannot afford it, so it is in the initial period that he should get help from the Government.</P>
    <P>The building societies should be controlled so that they cannot increase the interest charge for a certain number of years.  In property there is a seven-year break.  If you can get a 35-year loan&mdash; they are not inclined to give that&mdash;there should be a break every 14 years or every ten years.  If there is a level period in the economy&mdash;which I have not seen for the past ten years&mdash;the interest rate can go up but this man is on the same salary and he has nothing with which to pay for that increase. The building societies should not be <Col N="1386" /> allowed to increase the interest rate until the person has occupied the house for X number of years, let it be nine or ten years.</P>
    <P>Clause (2) of the motion reads:</P>
    <P>to report on the claimed need for increases and whether and when such increases can be reduced.</P>
    <P>We could go into various arguments as to why the rates should go up and down but the simple practical thing would be to tie them to the bank rate. Undoubtedly this would solve much of the problem.  Deputy Clinton said that one never sees a building society bringing down their charges&mdash;perhaps they did once.  The interest charge should be tied to the bank rate and allowed to go only a certain percentage above it, and if the bank rate came down the interest rate should automatically come down.</P>
    <P>I do not know much about insurance but surely some alternative building societies could be introduced?  If you go to an insurance company to buy a house you are quoted a rate of interest for a period, which rate never changes. Admittedly another person who goes in a fortnight or three weeks later may be quoted ½ per cent more or less.  At least a rate of interest is quoted to you and you can work out whether it is worthwhile.  That rate applies until the policy runs out.</P>
    <P>Clause (3) of the motion reads:</P>
    <P>to recommend the measures necessary to be taken to reduce interest rates or otherwise to ease the burden for borrowers if the increased rates are necessary.</P>
    <P>Every time we have a debate on local government this comes up.  A grant of £275 was introduced by the inter-Party Government in 1948 or 1949.  There was a supplementary grant for certain people of something like £300.  I do not know the exact figure.  In the meantime the price of houses has gone up from £1,500 to £5,000.  In the meantime turnover tax of 5 per cent has been introduced. On certain items the wholesale tax applies.  This very nearly wipes out the grant.  The Minister may say that the greater portion of a house is not liable to turnover tax.  He may be talking about quantity but I am talking about quality and by &ldquo;quality&rdquo; I mean <Col N="1387" /> the expensive articles.  I think turnover tax is not charged on cement and gravel.  The cost of putting up four walls is negligible compared with the cost of timber and the various fittings. All these things are liable to turnover tax and some of the more expensive of them are liable to wholesale tax, I think.  I am not sure of that, but certain items are.  Wholesale tax is paid on a carpet.  It may not be on the price of the house but eventually it is on the cost to the purchaser.  Some items involve turnover tax of 10 to 15 per cent. I do not know exactly what the charge is on each of the items.</P>
    <P>We should try to help these purchasers and the people who are really hurt. There is a case which I have mentioned before and which I will continue to mention until something is done about it.  You can have three people on the same salary buying a house.  One person pays £6, £7 or £8 per week.  Another person pays £1 if he has the repayments I mentioned.  Another person may be paying £1 or £1 10s a week because he bought the house sometime ago.  The salary of the first person is very low when he has paid his expenses and automatically he will create inflation because when he goes to his trade union meeting he says he needs money to live and that he cannot live unless he gets an increase in his wages.  This puts up the cost of all the items in the building line.</P>
    <P>When you consider the cost of housing at the moment you go straight back to the price of land.  We are now thinking of providing new sewers in certain parts of Dublin.  Some years ago a main sewer was put through Griffith Avenue to service the houses for the next 20 or 30 years.  It did not last five years.  Nothing was done about sewerage in 1961 and 1962 because there was no housebuilding.  The result was that there were sites in the city of Dublin with all the services laid on for £400, plus the ground rent, plus the cost of putting in a path.  Today the price of that site is £2,000 and upwards with a higher ground rent and a footpath to be put in.  If you control the price of land you do not get land. Nobody will sell it.  If another company is formed some loophole is found <Col N="1388" /> so it is difficult to control it.  Dublin Corporation have a very simple way of doing this.  They provide sewerage schemes and I know they have a right to charge for them.  They should charge a proper price and the money they get could be used by the corporation for development or for providing loans and grans.  A person who has farming land worth, say, £500 per acre may find suddenly that the land can be sold for building in which case its value may be as high as £3,000 or even £10,000 per acre depending on the area. He has already made capital out of it which is not taxable.  Therefore, a certain amount of this money could be taken from him by way of a surcharge on sewerage or, in other words, a greater charge on it.</P>
    <P>No 4 is:</P>
    <P>to examine and report on the adequacy of the present methods of financing house purchase by building societies, insurance companies and other sources, and recommend what steps should be taken to increase the flow of private funds for housing purposes; and that the inquiry be concluded on items (1) to (3) in six months and on item (4) within twelve months from its inception;</P>
    <P>This, probably, covers the other three. No body or society will encourage investment from private individuals unless they are competitive in regard to the amount of interest they can give. If, as I suggested, there were a sewerage tapping charge or a charge for development, the price of land could be reduced greatly provided, of course, that there would be available sufficient serviced land.  There are many other aspects of this but all I can say is that there should be some government rule under which the building societies would operate.  This would help to alleviate the trouble and distress that is experienced by so many young couples in the years immediately following the purchase of their house.  Some help should be given to them during that period.  Afterwards, when they may have been promoted in their jobs or when their families have grown up, they may find it easier to manage but until this time is reached their repayments of up to £9 per week can impose <Col N="1389" /> a great strain.  Added to the repayments, they also have the expenses of furniture and so on.  To obtain this they usually have to resort to hire purchase, having spent all their savings of, perhaps, £1,200 or £1,400 on the deposit for their house.</P>
    <P>Many people furnish only one room after they marry and, rather than live on the local authorities, they continue to manage living in that one furnished room until such time as they can furnish the remainder of the house.  It is up to us to help these people in some way during those early difficult years, at least in so far as they can be assured that the interest rate cannot be increased. If one is lucky enough to be able to avail of a loan on the basis of an insurance policy, he will find, in most cases, that the interest rate is lower than what would be charged by a building society.  Also, once a loan has been obtained from an insurance company at a given rate, that rate will not be changed.  A person availing of such a loan will also have the advantage of a life policy on the repayment.</P>

      <P>I intend to be brief in my contribution this evening.  I regard the motion as being a good one, one I hope the Minister will accept.  This motion calls for a public inquiry into various aspects of the operations of building societies and others in the financing of housebuilding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this debate at least two or three speakers have said that people buy houses mainly for prestige purposes.  I disagree entirely with that statement.  The reason most people purchase their own house, particularly in the city of Dublin, is that there has been a complete failure on the part of the Government to provide adequate housing at local authority level for people who qualify for local authority housing.  Every week I attend at the Dublin Corporation housing allocation department and I see there a stream of people seeking corporation houses.  Most of these are people who have one or two children and, by any civilised standard, they should be housed.  Because of the failure on the part of the Government to provide adequate housing for such <Col N="1390" /> people they are forced into the position of having no alternative but to enter into very high financial commitments at tremendous personal sacrifice in order to provide shelter for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>If one considers that the approved&mdash; I underline the word &ldquo;approved&rdquo;&mdash; waiting list in Dublin at the moment is in excess of 4,500, one will realise the pressure on most of these people.  A man working in an average job, be it manual or clerical, and who may have one or two children will not have much cash to spend.  Because he cannot be housed by the local authority, he will find himself either living with in-laws or in a flat where the rent may be exorbitant.  Very often to save a marriage people skimp and save and deprive themselves of the necessities of life in order to purchase a house.  They enter into a commitment to repay so much over a period of 20 or 35 years. Their entire savings go on the deposit, so that in order to provide themselves with furniture they must enter into hire purchase commitments also.  When they have done all this they suddenly receive notice from the building society to the effect that from such a date the rate of interest on the borrowed money is being increased.  Of course, they have no redress whatever. This, if the Minister considers it, deserves to be justified and justified in public.</P>
    <P>This motion goes a little further than that.  Not only does it call for justification, but it calls for a public inquiry to examine the whole system by which money is made available by building societies, insurance companies and others for private dwellings, to examine the whole system in order to try to find if there is any better way in which it can be done and if there is any less expensive way, to the borrower, by which it can be done.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister found the same problem in Galway city but I am sure that since he took up office he became aware of the situation in Dublin and, being aware of it, he will realise that I have not exaggerated the circumstances in which very many of our young people starting out in married life find themselves.  If he reflects <Col N="1391" /> on that for a short time he will see not only the wisdom of but the necessity for having such an inquiry.  I would ask the Minister to ignore pressures which may be exerted on him from various supporters of his party and to accept the very obvious fact that such an inquiry is desirable and necessary and that he owes no less to the thousands of young people in this city who have made this personal sacrifice, who have been forced to make it because of the failure of the Minister's Government to provide sufficient local authority housing.  I recommend the motion to the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is a serious reflection on the Government that an important motion of this kind should have been on the Order Paper for nearly 18 months before time was provided to discuss it.  If we had had this debate when the interest rates were raised fairly steeply, for some people at least, by the building societies, and if people had heard the discussion that has taken place here and the explanations that were given, at least it would have led to a greater degree of understanding on their part and they would perhaps be partly satisfied that some of these increases were justified.  The Minister in his intervention in the debate provided a considerable amount of information about how the societies operate at present.  However, it is fair to say that the Minister made no attempt to suggest ways and means which the societies could consider in order to bring their terms into line with the terms for borrowers from the Local Loans Fund.  The Minister did explain how they borrowed on short term and loaned on long term, <i>et cetera</i>, but I want to ask the Minister if there is any reason or any justification that he can give why money should not be available to people of similar incomes at the same terms?  If you are lucky enough to come in in the first few months before the money from the Local Loans Funds is exhausted you <Col N="1392" /> are likely to get a Local Loans Fund loan but, if not, you have to seek elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In addition to that the Minister was at pains to praise the building societies. I will give them everything he has given them and perhaps more, but one of his purposes in doing this was to hide the deficiences and the defects in his Local Loans Fund scheme which used to be very good and could still be very good if certain adjustments were made.  However, it is now quite impossible for most people to use that fund because of such matters as income limits, which are ridiculous, valuations by the local authorities, also quite ridiculous, and the maximum loan, which is also quite ridiculous because these people cannot find the necessary deposit.  They have to look for £1,500 or £2,000.  When I was proposing the motion I explained that the number of applicants in the Dublin County Council area has dropped by half.  The Minister referred to the increasing percentage of house purchase finance that is now provided by the building societies; the main reason is that the local authority loan is outside their grasp for the reasons I have given.  As well as that the delays are intolerable.  No builder wants to deal with the local authority because of the length of time it takes to get a loan through.</P>
      <P>I have had this experience as a local representative; nobody wants to touch the county council, but the terms of the council loan, with the adjustments I have mentioned, would make it much more attractive than money borrowed from the building societies.  It is at a fixed rate of interest; it is normally at a slightly lower rate of interest, or the same rate, but then it is spread over a longer number of years.  A lot of the building societies operate on a 20-year loan whereas the Local Loans Fund is 35 years and the weekly outgoings are very much less on that account and bring it very much more within the capacity of a greater number of people to meet this weekly outlay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt with this motion as if the only purpose we had in mind was to be critical of the societies.  It is <Col N="1393" /> nothing of the sort.  Certainly that was not in my mind.  The one particular matter for which I criticise the building societies is that small borrowers had their interest rates increased by 3 per cent at one go.  I discussed this with some of the societies and they agreed that this was not a good thing to do. They went on working on the very low rates of interest until they found themselves suffering fairly heavy losses. They let this situation go on too long, and then they had to have this sudden adjustment for all, otherwise current borrowers would have had to go up quite considerably.  It was bad judgment on their part because nobody gets 3 per cent more if he is lending money and nobody pays 3 per cent more if he is borrowing money, just like that.  It goes up 1 per cent or ½ per cent, or it goes down ½ per cent, but that is rare.  This is the one instance in which I would say the societies were wrong. Apart from that they are doing an excellent job and in fact they could do a better job.</P>
    <P>At present they have to pay 70 per cent of the normal income tax rate. There are proposals before them at present to increase that to 72 per cent, but where is the justification for that?  This is on money with which unfortunate people are trying to get something which is absolutely essential if they are to bring up their families in reasonable comfort.  But it is taxed by the Government and the Minister has the hardihood to describe this as an &ldquo;aid&rdquo; to a house purchaser.  Simply because he does not tax him more heavily, it is aid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">

      <P>A concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is described as one of the Minister's aids.  The Minister was completely off beam when he described this income tax relief.  The people who need it most, those in the lower income group with family commitments, would not normally be taxable in any case and, therefore, there is no aid in this direction.  This is one of the reasons I suggested to the Minister that he should consider the provision of some kind of graded subsidised interest rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> I hoped the Minister would come in with some kind of concession, some additional help over and above what is at present available.  He tells us that a body has been considering this matter since 1969.  I would ask the Minister what this body have been doing and what are they examining.  He did not give us the terms of reference of this body.  All I can say is that they must be very wide if they have been in session for 18 months and have not yet reported.  The Minister did not tell us at what stage they were other than that he hoped to get a report in two months. I know that the building societies have not yet been called in by this review body.  Will the Minister state if this is so?  We heard from Deputy Foley and the former Minister for Local Government that this review body was sitting and that they were really going to investigate the whole business of the building societies.  Of course, before the election everything was going to happen and the people were not going to suffer in this way.  However, the people are still suffering and, in fact, they did not even know this review body was sitting.  I have some doubts as to what this body are doing or whether, in fact, they exist only in name.</P>
    <P>It should have been a fairly simple operation to consider the question of house purchase finance in all its aspects. The Minister did not state if this review body would make a searching analysis of all sources of house purchase finance, how it could be made less expensive and how the flow of money should be increased.  The maximum investment that a man and wife can make with one of the societies is £5,000.  Having regard to the present value of money and the cost of housing, there is no justification for retention of this figure.  Why should it not be doubled if we want to increase the flow of money available for house building?  The Minister should consider urgently the question of increasing this maximum.  This is one of the ways in which the building societies could get much more money and have it available for house purchase loans.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a valid point in justification of the operations of the building societies, that they only make <Col N="1395" /> a net surplus of 5s 8d per £100.  I am informed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a net surplus, it should not be called profit.  Many people believe it is a profit that somebody gets and puts into his pocket.  Nobody gets a profit from the building societies.  The amount will be reduced to 4s 3d with the increased tax the Minister proposes to impose.  That sum of 4s 3d goes into reserves.  It is a very modest surplus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is modest enough when you consider the possibility of bad debts and the fact that it is used for more loans.  It is not used to enrich any person.  The directors are paid modest directors' fees, if my information is correct, and I think the people should know this.  I was one of those who felt strongly about building societies and I had quite a wrong idea about them.  I considered a number of people were getting quite a good thing out of the whole business but this is not true.  If this notice of motion has done nothing else than to put this on record and inform the people it has been worthwhile.  People have said to me, &ldquo;We are in trouble with the building societies and I am glad <Col N="1396" /> to see that this matter has been taken up&rdquo;.  When I gave them the information I received as a result of putting down this motion, they were happy enough to accept it.  Previously they considered they were being exploited to a very large degree but they now accept that they are not.</P>
      <P>However, this motion is more comprehensive. It does not deal only with building societies and at least we have cleared them.  It is disgraceful that money that is needed for an essential item such as housing should carry a Government tax to the extent of 70 per cent, and, with the proposed increase, of 72 per cent.  It is also wrong that the maximum of £5,000 has not been increased in order to give the people concerned an opportunity to get money.  The Minister is not providing enough money through his Department. There is an enormous backlog of housing needs as a result and an immense amount of hardship is being created.</P>
      <P>I should like to see fair play in this matter and there is not at the moment. By accident, one person can get house purchase finance on more favourable terms than another on the same income level or even on a lower level. This should be a matter for concern; the Minister should give it speedy and careful consideration.  I recommend the Motion to the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Bord na Móna (Superannuation) Bill, 1970: First Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed:</P>
    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to enable Bord na Móna to pay more than half the contributions to the fund of any superannuation scheme established under section 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Tully.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is described in the Long Title as &ldquo;an Act to enable Bord na Móna to pay more than half the contributions to the fund of any superannuation scheme established under section 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953.&rdquo;  An examination of the pensions payable under the Bord na Móna Superannuation Scheme of 1963, which was debated at length in Dáil Éireann on 28th March, 1963, clearly reveals that it is not possible for manual workers in Bord na Móna, especially non-craftsmen, to obtain a reasonable pension so long as they are obliged to pay 50 per cent of the cost of benefits.  This is so because many of the workers concerned were employed by Bord na Móna before the 1963 superannuation scheme came into operation.  In effect, contributions have to be paid in respect of years of service before the commencement of the schemes of 1963 and 1970.  In all fairness, the cost of &ldquo;prior service&rdquo; should be borne by Bord na Móna but this is not possible under the 50-50 rule in the Turf Development Act of 1953.  Moreover, provision was made in the 1963 superannuation scheme to enable Bord na Móna workers on promotion to be admitted to the &ldquo;staff&rdquo; scheme of 1956.  This required a transfer contribution to be made to the staff scheme with a consequential drain on the superannuation fund.  This situation cannot be remedied unless Bord na Móna are entitled to pay the difference between the appropriate transfer contributions.  By and large, there is one-way traffic on transfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the superannuation scheme of 1963 was debated in Dáil Éireann on 28th March, 1963, it was emphasised that the scheme did not make provision for reasonable or adequate benefits and when the scheme was reviewed by the trade unions in 1968, it became abundantly <Col N="1399" /> clear that a reasonable scale of benefits could not be provided unless Bord na Móna paid, and was permitted to pay, more than half the cost of the scheme.  Details of pension payments in Bord na Móna were given in a reply to a Parliamentary Question on 18th December, 1969.</P>
    <P>On 22nd September, 1969, Bord na Móna offered proposals for increased pensions to the trade unions and a cross section of the pensions in payment and payable were furnished in a parliamentary reply on 18th December of that year.  While it is quite clear that the new pensions are somewhat higher than the former pensions, which the Minister's predecessor assured the Dáil were adequate, nevertheless, the gratuity pension scale, after 40 years service, is very low.</P>
    <P>There are grounds for believing that outline pension proposals&mdash;with provision for the new gratuity&mdash;were sent to Bord na Móna by the Department of Transport and Power in 1969.  One wonders if it is a coincidence that the benefits in the new Bord na Móna scheme&mdash;with one exception&mdash;are almost identical to the proposals for a non-contributory pension scheme for forestry workers and other State employees, offered to the trade unions by the Department of Finance on the 25th November, 1969.  Details of the State non-contributory scheme were given in reply to a Dáil Question on 28th April, 1970.</P>
    <P>The latest Bord na Móna contributory scheme and the State employees non-contributory scheme have an almost identical range of benefits and it is unfair that Bord na Móna workers should be obliged to pay £1 a week and more for superannuation benefits which have been agreed for State employees free.  The maximum gratuity under the Bord na Móna scheme is a year's pay after 30 years as compared with a year's pay at 30 years rising to one and half year's pay in the State scheme.</P>
    <P>Just in case anyone suggests that Bord na Móna workers are not paying very much may I point out that a man earning under £13 10s will pay 56p per week, a man earning £22 15s will <Col N="1400" /> pay 96p, which is almost £1 a week, and a man earning £43 a week will pay £1 17s 6d or £1.80.  I cannot see why Bord na Móna workers should be singled out and dealt with in this way just because the State scheme, which is not a good one by any means, allows a pension or a gratuity which is much higher than that being offered by Bord na Móna and as far as the workers are concerned there is no question of their paying for it.  We are asking here that Bord na Móna be allowed to increase their share of what has to be paid so that the pension and the gratuity can be increased without having to increase the amount to be paid by the workers out of their wages.  It is as simple as that.  I recommend that the Bill be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to second this proposal.  One of the major difficulties about pensions for people working in semi-State bodies has been the maligning influence of the pensions section of the Department of Finance. The greatest difficulty has arisen time and again in connection with some of the oldest semi-State bodies.  The Minister and I last year improved matters for the workers in the ESB.  That was not very much out of turn because it was the oldest of those bodies.  One of the difficulties now, as I see it, is that the terms of the schemes for certain of the new bodies, like Telefís Éireann, are much better than the terms of the scheme in Bord na Móna.  It is quite unfair where men are working for a long time in a body, which is now as old as Bord na Móna is, and is in existence for 34 years although the pension scheme is not anything like that period in existence, to ask them to make those high contributions. Accordingly, if we want to improve the pensions for those people the only way it can be done is by enabling the body itself to pay more than it is paying at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that pension schemes in most organisations are in fact non-contributory and it is quite unfair, where people have long service in a body like Bord na Móna, that they should be expected to start late in life to make contributions sufficient to bring their contributions up to what <Col N="1401" /> they would have been if they had started to contribute when they began working with the organisation.  Indeed until the recent improvement in the ESB this resulted in people not joining at all until the scheme came into full operation.  The existing contribution of 4 per cent is as much as could reasonably be expected.  It is roughly £1 a week where a person is earning about £20 a week.  This, on top of the other deductions which are made, including deductions for income tax, is a very substantial contribution.</P>
    <P>Most institutions, perhaps with the exception of the secondary teachers, have non-contributory pension schemes.  It is strange that bodies like secondary teachers and the workers in Bord na Móna, who are in a relatively weak position, instead of being treated fairly are treated quite unfairly.  All workers should be treated alike.  I agree with what my colleague, Deputy Tully, said that there is an extraordinary resentment in regard to the proposals which have come forward for certain workers associated directly with the State.  This is quite inequitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, very briefly, to support the motion that leave be granted to introduce this Bill.  I want also to say that the explanation for this Bill, which has been given by Deputy Tully, is one which every Deputy who has a knowledge of or has any intimate connection with Bord na Móna and its employees, will very generously contribute to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party support this measure knowing and realising that the proposal therein will, as suggested by Deputy Tully, undoubtedly remove what appears to be a genuine grievance in so far as the employees of Bord na Móna are concerned.  I recall with great pride the very early days of Bord na Móna and indeed prior to the establishment of Bord na Móna during the years of the old and well remembered Turf Development Board.  The Minister for Transport and Power, and indeed every other Minister down the years, has paid tribute to the progress that has been made and the developments that have been undertaken in <Col N="1402" /> relation to the activities of both the old Turf Development Board and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that whilst tributes have been paid to the outstanding successes which have taken place in relation to the development of boglands and the activities of Bord na Móna, this is mainly due to the fact that the employees of Bord na Móna can be described as specialised workers, specialised in their sphere of activities, specialised in the early stages in the footing of turf, specialised in later years in the modern machinery which is used in all major bogs.  In addition to that they are specialised in the execution of the various types of drainage work which are necessary.</P>
    <P>We must, however, take into consideration that while Bord na Móna were given credit for outstanding developments, very rarely did we hear any expression of tribute to the ordinary workers who participated in the various development schemes of Bord na Móna.  It is a very poor tribute to those workers who have been part of the body and soul of the board from the early days to be treated in this way.  All this Bill of Deputy Tully's requires is that Bord na Móna be permitted to pay more, to give greater recognition, to be more honourable, to express in a very practical way their appreciation of long and loyal service of devoted men who are keenly interested and who are specialists in the work which they perform for Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that those workers, specialists as they are, are living and working convenient to the various schemes of development of the board.  I know, however, of cases in my own constituency and I am sure the same is true in regard to Kildare and elsewhere, where some workers have to travel considerable distances to work. Out of an average wage of £20 per week it is most unreasonable that those workers should be obliged to pay £1 a week towards the superannuation fund. Other employees in semi-State concerns are not penalised to the extent to which Bord na Móna workers are.  It would be appropriate to ask the Minister <Col N="1403" /> for Finance, who in the long run will have the responsibility for implementing favourable or unfavourable schemes, why those workers should be penalised.</P>
    <P>The Bord na Móna worker is being penalised by being asked to pay more into his pension fund than employees of other semi-State bodies have to pay. This is absolutely unjust and reflects very poor appreciation of the industry and keen interest shown by Bord na Móna workers down through the years. I am sure very few of the old Turf Development Board workers are still in the service of the board but nevertheless we are very conscious of the loyal service and hard work of the people for whom we speak.  It is very doubtful if the employees of any other semi-State concern have to work as hard and as determinedly as have Bord na Móna workers.  Why, therefore, should the Bord na Móna worker be the victim of unreasonable and unjust treatment?</P>
    <P>On any occasion that money was sought in this House for Bord na Móna &mdash;while Deputies may have been critical as to the expenditure of the money&mdash;never once did a Deputy say that money should not be voted to Bord na Móna.  If the Minister for Transport and Power has any doubts as to the anxiety of this House to provide money for this laudable purpose, all he has to do is to permit Bord na Móna to act in a Christian manner in so far as catering for workers who have given good and loyal service is concerned.  Many workers who receive approximately £20 per week in wages have large families for whom they must provide and, in addition, they must pay rent on the graded rent system.  Most of them have to run a car or a motor cycle to get them to and from their work.  With the increase in the motor tax and with the increase in the price of petrol, the Bord na Móna worker has to face ever-increasing expenditure. Now he is singled out to make a greater contribution towards his pension fund than other semi-State employees.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister for Transport and Power pay tribute in various <Col N="1404" /> parts of the country to Bord na Móna and its workers.  Here is an opportunity for him to prove that he meant those tributes.  This is his opportunity to do something practical, something which will assist the Bord na Móna worker to obtain a reasonable pension without being penalised for it during his working years from the point of view of an unreasonably high contribution towards that pension.</P>
    <P>All this Bill seeks is that Bord na Móna will pay more.  I venture to say that, if the members of Bord na Móna had the opportunity, they would view this measure with sympathy and understanding. Every intelligent citizen would associate himself with that sympathy and understanding in the knowledge of the duties which must be undertaken, by day or by night, by Bord na Móna workers.  I venture to say that Bord na Móna would like to be generous to their workers&mdash;with the permission of the Minister for Transport and Power and the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It can be said&mdash;not with pride or credit&mdash;that for many years Bord na Móna workers have had to work under adverse conditions, conditions which the trade unions have gradually improved. Deputy Tully is commonly known as the friend of those associated with Bord na Móna.  I should like to be associated, too, with this Bill which seeks justice and fair play for those workers.  No matter what may have been decided by the top brass of Bord na Móna or by the Department of Finance, I urge the Minister for Transport and Power to be courageous and to demonstrate his recognition of the loyal service of Bord na Móna workers by accepting this Bill.</P>
    <P>The standard of living and income of some hundreds of Bord na Móna workers depend on the reception this Bill is given by the Minister for Transport and Power.  I view with alarm and amazement the fact that the Bord na Móna worker is singled out for unreasonable treatment.  This is the Minister's opportunity to translate his lipservice to those workers into positive action on their behalf.  This will be appreciated not alone by the workers concerned but also by their wives and families.</P>

I personally set in train the negotiations in September, 1969 before the Bill was introduced to secure the substantially increased benefits that now are open to Bord na Móna pensioners and are operative from 4th June, 1970.  This was done after very detailed consultation with the trade unions concerned and since the introduction of the substantially revised scheme last June I have had no further representations from the trade unions concerned or from the workers concerned.  I would say to the House in all common sense to let this very improved scheme work and see how it eventuates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This happens to be correct and I shall spell it out.  I agree that prior to the revision of the scheme there were anomalies particularly in regard to the pre-1963 pensioners, pensioners who were undoubtedly getting low superannuation.  We have remedied that now by the revision of the scheme to operate from 4th June, 1970.  I shall spell out the details of this scheme.  The amendments have involved scrapping the old unit scheme which was the cause of the anomalies that existed prior to this.  The new scheme will enable a single employee with full service of 40 years to earn a pension of about half his retiring pay, which is in line with superannuation generally throughout the service.  The Deputy should be aware of this because his own particular union participated in these negotiations.  A retired Bord na Móna manual worker will also get a retirement gratuity in addition to the 50 per cent superannuation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan was talking about a man earning £20 a week and speculating as to what his pension would be and speculating about the injustice that would accrue to such a person.  Deputy Flanagan it appears is not aware of this specific revision of the code that has taken place.  A married man retiring after 40 years service on a wage of £20 a week will now get a lump sum of £1,040.  His total weekly pension will be £12.62½ a week to age 70 years and £13.50 a week thereafter.</P>

This is way ahead of 50 per cent which is <Col N="1408" /> the average superannuation obtaining throughout the various State services and private industry and generally in regard to superannuation.  This is the case because acknowledging the fact of Bord na Móna's employees up and down type of income by reason of the nature of this particular type of work there is 30 per cent over the basic wage included for superannuation purposes. This is the reason why Bord na Móna workers, in fact, have a better superannuation deal in terms of money into pocket as far as superannuation is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 11, to delete &ldquo;or pigs&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;pigs, milk, soft fruits, vegetables, hay, silage or beet&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> I am moving this amendment because I believe there should be special treatment in relation to the liberalisation of transport in regard to agricultural products. I will not make the case that there should be complete liberalisation of road haulage.  I would not be in a position to do so.  I believe special consideration should be given in regard to agriculture for these reasons.</P>
    <P>Licensed haulage in the normal way whereby you are restricted to a number of hauliers is all very well where people are carrying in bulk and can make an arrangement with a haulier and it is worth his while to carry their products.  There would be a sufficiently large number of the products available at a specific place for the haulier to pick up.  This is not the case in relation to farmers.  Many farmers, particularly small farmers, as we all know, produce in small amounts.  They are dispersed widely throughout the country, whereas manufacturers are concentrated in one place and a haulage contractor can pick up the lot at that place.  It is more difficult for farmers to arrange transport from their place of production than it is for the man whose product in concentrated in one place.</P>
    <P>Farmers live in remote areas.  They are far away from large centres of population.  Therefore, they have to rely on transport for their goods. Farmers also frequently produce products which are highly perishable and require immediate transport.  If they have to wait until they can get a licensed haulier it may be too late. Therefore, there is a case to be made for their having a more liberal type of transport and not having to rely solely on licensed hauliers.</P>
    <P>The production of agricultural goods is uncertain as to time.  It is related to the seasons and the weather.  The farmer cannot predict from one week to the next when he will need transport for his goods.  He cannot predict when his product will be ready to be transported off the farm, so he cannot make arrangements in advance with a licensed haulier to pick up his goods, whereas a man in industry, generally speaking, knows that his product is being produced in consistent quantities <Col N="1413" /> and consistently over a period of time. Therefore, he can make an arrangement in advance for transport by a licensed haulier.</P>
    <P>Because they live in remote areas farmers find it more difficult to get transport and they have to rely more on transport.  They have to rely on transport of smaller amounts.  They might be transporting a very small quantity of goods and this would not be worthwhile to a licensed haulier. Industry generally produces in sufficiently large quantities to make it worthwhile to hire a licensed haulier. This can be illustrated fairly well by reference to the commodities I have included in my amendment.  I mention milk.  As many people know, generrally speaking, in the creamery areas it is the practice for every farmer to go to the creamery with his milk.  He spends a large part of the day transporting it in and out.  I do not speak from any great knowledge of the creamery industry.  I do not come from a creamery area.  To my mind it would appear sensible for farmers to get together and agree that one of their number would carry the milk for a large group in an area and that he would do this for hire.  Under the present legislation, as milk is not one of the exempted products, he would be breaking the law.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that as reported at column 73 of the Official Report of 27th January, 1971 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is our intention that once this Bill becomes law unlicensed haulage is out.</P>
    <P>That is a pretty general statement. This man would be carrying milk for hire as a co-operative venture with his fellow farmers but, under our present legislation, he would be breaking the law, technically at least.  I am not suggesting that these people will be hounded, or anything like that, by the Garda.  It is quite possible that in this context the law would not be enforced in a vigorous way but, if we are introducing legislation to tidy up the law and ensure that people will not continue to break the law technically, as was the case with regard to cattle haulage until this legislation was introduced, <Col N="1414" /> we should include all the products that will be carried normally in an informal way by farmers for one another.</P>
    <P>I also mention soft fruits in my amendments.  Vegetables can be taken together with soft fruits.  Soft fruits are produced in irregular quantities.  The farmers do not know when the fruit will be ripe.  Therefore, they cannot make advance arrangements with a licensed haulier to carry the fruit for them.  Again, I do not claim to have any particular knowledge of either of these two lines of agricultural production but, if the transport is not available immediately, the goods will rot. Surely it would be practicable and sensible for farmers to get together and get one of their number&mdash;on an informal basis, just once a year when the fruit harvest comes in&mdash;to carry it for hire to wherever the depot is. Surely it would be much more sensible to have someone doing this who was in the business, who was ready to do it on request by the people in the area as their fruit became ripe, rather than having to rely on a licensed haulier.</P>
    <P>If these people have their soft fruit or vegetables carried for a small compensation by one of their number, they will be, if the law is to be enforced rigorously, technically breaking the law.  Two other commodities which can be grouped together also are hay and silage.  Many farmers&mdash;and these include big farmers&mdash;find frequently that it is not worth their while having their own machinery to harvest hay and silage and, consequently, they hire a contractor to do the job for them. However, a farmer may have two farms within a distance of two or three miles of each other.  It will be more than likely that the hay or silage will be harvested on one farm and taken to a barn or to a silage pit, as the case may be, on the other farm, so that the contractor would have to carry it along the road.  Since all of his work would be done on hire, he would be breaking the law.  I know that the Garda have more to do than to look after matters like these, but if we are to tidy up the legislation in regard to road haulage we must do it <Col N="1415" /> properly.  That is my purpose in putting down this amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to beet, the situation is slightly more complex.  It is also a slightly bigger business than the other commodities I have mentioned.  The restriction which has been in operation has had a serious effect in regard to beet.  The position is that the pattern of production in the beet-growing areas has been distorted by the legislation as it exists at the moment.  Under present circumstances there are two types of haulage.  There are regular licensed hauliers who carry beet in the beet-growing areas during the beet season, which of course is a very short season. However, there usually are not sufficient of these hauliers available because it would not be worth their while to maintain lorries especially for this short season.  Generally speaking, one finds that the licensed hauliers are not able to meet the demand and what CIE are doing is giving temporary plating to private unlicensed hauliers.  They license them temporarily. This would work quite well were it not for the fact that they put a 10 per cent surcharge on every person whom they license in this way.</P>
    <P>This 10 per cent which goes to CIE comes directly from the farmers' pockets because it is the farmer who is paying the haulier, and since the haulier must pay the 10 per cent he will pass it on to the farmer.  Therefore, the position is that this 10 per cent is compensating CIE for their inability to provide an adequate service themselves.  In other words, they are profiting from their own inadequacies. This is a very poor situation and it has resulted in a distortion in the pattern of beet production because of the excessively high transport cost for beet.</P>
    <P>It has become disproportionately profitable to produce beet in the immediate areas surrounding the factories whereas farmers who live some distance from the factories but whose land may be very suited to beet growing find that it is not possible for them to produce beet because of the heavy transport costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister or somebody else may say that there may be some important <Col N="1416" /> difficulties in relation to the amendment I have put down and that, if a further area of transport is liberalised, the result will be that more people, particularly those within the existing business and CIE in particular, will be vulnerable.  I could not accept that argument in relation to this amendment. I certainly could not accept it in relation to the transport of milk, soft fruits and vegetables.  All I am endeavouring to do is to have the legislation tidied up.  Nobody contemplates that CIE intend going into the haulage of milk or soft fruits or of hay or silage.  Some problem may arise in relation to beet, but this is something we must face.  Present transport regulations are inadequate.  I would go along with one statement made by the Minister when he said that he would have no worries at all in regard to the employment situation.</P>
    <P>This whole area of road haulage is an expanding one.  As time goes on and as the economy expands there will be more and more opportunities and, consequently, there will be adequate employment for everybody.  This amendment is intended merely to tidy up the law and to ensure that people will not be put in the position where, technically, they are acting illegally. Therefore, it is a commonsense amendment and one that should be accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I notice that Deputy Bruton speaks on this amendment as would any Leinsterman but let me, for a moment, speak like a Munsterman.  The Minister is half-way between Leinster and Connaught.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are parts of the Deputy's amendment which are not objectionable but there are other parts for which I can see no great reason.  What the Minister put before us in the Bill originally seemed to be quite logical.  Down through the years we heard a great deal about prosecutions in cases where livestock was carried by unlicensed hauliers.  The Minister, very properly, retains horses entirely <Col N="1417" /> for transportation by CIE because that company are properly equipped for the purpose.  Fundamentally, of course, one of the difficulties in relation to CIE, as was pointed out by Deputy Bruton, is that they have constantly had to plate gentlemen who, to the road transport workers in CIE, are known as &ldquo;hackers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties I see in relation to the group of products mentioned by Deputy Bruton is, first of all, in relation to milk.  The Deputy did not mention the liquid milk market in so far as Dublin is concerned.  The reason for this is that nowadays the milk is collected by huge lorries which are owned by the people who sell the milk&mdash;there are only two companies now, I think, Hughes Bros. and Dublin Dairies.  God be with the days when the milk was delivered in a can and when one filled a tilly at the door.  Deputy Bruton was interested in milk being delivered to the creameries.  I cannot see any particular reason for including milk delivered to the creameries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, we will accept that.  If I know the farmers in Munster, where about 90 per cent of the creamery industry is located, these things were always done on a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis.  There would never be any question of a farmer paying his neighbour for carrying the milk.  This is my reference for speaking like a Munsterman where Deputy Bruton was speaking like a Leinsterman.  There would be no question in Munster of charging your neighbour no matter how frequently you carried his milk, if you had the transport and he had not.  It would be paid for in a different way&mdash; a day's work every now and again and so on, but, generally speaking, on a fairly equitable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other commodities, soft fruits and vegetables, more or less go together. The main and almost the only vegetable market as such, exists in Dublin&mdash;I am talking now about any sizeable vegetable market&mdash;and Cork city would be the next largest.  In Dublin the vegetables are delivered by the owners, people from the Rush and <Col N="1418" /> Skerries areas who bring in the vegetables in their own lorries.  I appreciate that Deputy Bruton, as a man interested in the law, has a slightly different point of view from mine.  Vegetables as such are unimportant, relatively speaking, in this context.  Soft fruits come on the market only for a month or two in the year and the whole soft fruit season lasts only for about six weeks.  If a person is in the soft fruit business in a big way he will either have his own transport, he will hire somebody who is licensed, or he will get CIE to transport the fruit for him. If there is this disparity between CIE and other licensed hauliers, then he will obviously get some other licensed haulier.</P>
    <P>In regard to hay and silage, the days when vast quantities of hay were sold in Dublin in the Hay Market&mdash;there is actually a place called the Hay Market on the north side of the Liffey and I used to see carts there with vast quantities of hay&mdash;but I would nearly make a bet that you would hardly see a load of hay at the place now if&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not talk about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I am talking about the problem generally. I am interested in the problem in a general way and I am talking on the amendment.  The Deputy spoke about a slightly different problem, where you employed a man in connection with either hay or silage and he had to bring the stuff along the road to the farm, or perhaps two farmers jointly employed him and he might have to bring it to both farms.  Technically he was breaking the law.  I doubt very much, however, if any member of the Garda Síochána would in a local area, where hay was being transported a short distance, prosecute an unlicensed haulier, that is to say, in effect, a farming contractor, for taking hay along the public road for a few miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Silage has come into existence since I was a farmer but on the whole it is almost entirely taken from one part of the man's farm to another part.  The number of cases in the whole country in which there would be any question <Col N="1419" /> of employing somebody else, or even asking somebody else to take silage for you from one place to another would be negligible.  We come then to what is in much the same category as milk and that is beet.  As Deputy Bruton said, the position in regard to beet is very complicated but on the whole beet is arranged by CIE plating hackers as they are called in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some unlicensed ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are bound to be.  I will accept the Deputy's assurance on that.  The shifting of beet every autumn is now much more concentrated than it was.  At one time it used run from the middle of October to the beginning of February but now the beet campaign is over by Christmas and, therefore, there is an immense concentration of effort.  This is done by lorries in part owned by the Sugar Company, in part owned by CIE and in part plated by CIE, and of course there are the farmers who own their own lorries and are able to do the transport for themselves. I get the legal point involved in the amendment but when all this is added up it may amount to a good deal legally but it does not amount to very much economically.  I am more interested in the economic side of the law than the legal side.  You know the gentleman who said that he could drive a coach and four through any Act of Parliament.  Of course what the Minister is doing here in this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was interested in the case made by Deputy Bruton but I should like to hear what the Minister has to say before coming to any conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to emphasise that the principal purpose of this legislation, which has been lost sight of in the type of amendment put <Col N="1420" /> down, is to reduce the extent of own account haulage which is going on. We have the highest percentage of own haulage in Europe.  We want to reduce that and encourage professional hauliers.  With a view to that we are extending, as the main principle of the Bill&mdash;and indeed I want to say in the reportage of the Bill this fact has not been highlighted to the extent it deserves&mdash;the various types of licence that exist with regard to commodity, area and weight.  We are extending the various types and forms of licences that exist up to the tune of 850, to one single form of licence.  Now, instead of 850 licences ranging from 100 Twenty-Six County licences to 850 of various kinds, there will be 850 Twenty-Six County licences with no restriction as to area, commodity or to weight in regard to what can be hauled.  Straight away this will mean a fleet of professional hauliers will be in existence and professional haulage companies will develop.</P>
      <P>We want to do this in order to avoid the wastage of own account investment in truckage which has taken place over the years both in the industrial and agricultural communities.  There has been wasted investment in this area and over 80 per cent of the haulage on our roads has been own account haulage, whereas in Britain the figure is around 50 per cent.  This is what we want to eradicate and we want to see CIE on the public enterprise side, and the 850-odd licences on the private enterprise side, competing vigorously with each other to secure the maximum amount of haulage business and to reduce the number of trucks and vehicles owned by business and industrial firms and owned by farmers as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view the amendment in that context. I must oppose it because the particular aspects that apply in respect of cattle, sheep and pigs do not apply here to the same extent.  Cattle, sheep and pigs are the livestock type of haulage that has been traditionally carried at all hours of the day and night.  This type of operation is ideally suited to the private operators and has been conducted by them to such an extent that the law has been flagrantly <Col N="1421" /> breached.  In fact, we are legalising the position in relation to these aspects of livestock haulage.</P>
    <P>It is this aspect of the Bill, and the matter on which Deputy Bruton has put down an amendment, that has commanded most attention in the media.  However, the main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that we can develop a system of professional road haulage that will equip us for entry into the Common Market and enable us to have a properly financed professional road haulage industry.  In my view, the exemption of cattle, sheep and pigs is a side issue although it has commanded most attention.  It is, in fact, making a legality of a reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was because at one time there were so many prosecutions in connection with the carriage of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the more important long-term aspect is the matter I referred to earlier&mdash;the establishment of a professional road haulage industry, properly financed and equipped to cater for the exports to Britain and Europe in which we shall be engaged in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of Deputy Bruton's amendment is this: where do you start and end in relation to the input and output of a farm?  The Deputy mentioned certain commodities&mdash;milk, soft fruits, vegetables, hay, silage or beet; I could add oats, barley, poultry, fish, greyhounds, fertilisers and building materials used by the farmer in regard to production.  If one starts on this there is no end to it.  I should prefer to have sufficient professional hauliers available to make full use of whatever the farmer wants done in this respect.  There is a certain unreality about the amendment in that milk being brought to a creamery is exempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, only wheat <Col N="1422" /> and milk being brought to a creamery. Regarding soft fruits, vegetables, hay and silage, I would agree with Deputy O'Donovan that here we are dealing with matters that are dealt with within a farm or between neighbours and it is not reality to include them.  The danger of including them is that straight away you can include oats, barley, poultry, fish, greyhounds, fertilisers and building materials, to name but a number of commodities that are equally as important to farm production as soft fruits, vegetables, hay and silage.</P>
      <P>Beet is a high pressure business for certain periods of the year.  In my view, this should be left to the professional haulage business, be it the State, CIE or private enterprise.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal of business carried out by rail and quite an amount by what the Deputy refers to as &ldquo;the hackers&rdquo;&mdash; the non-plated people employed by CIE for that purpose.  In my view this business is already catered for.  While I see the point in Deputy Bruton's amendment, I do not consider that any of these categories are in the same category as livestock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it is over wide areas and at all times of the day and night.  The nature of the business ensures that it is so, more than any of the other agricultural commodities mentioned.  It is the type of business where there are haphazard calls: there is much rushing to fairs and marts and deliveries take place at uncertain times.  During the years it has developed&mdash;and having regard to the nature of the business one can see the reason&mdash;as an operation suited to a particular kind of entrepreneur, <Col N="1423" /> an operation not suited to public transport. For that reason the law has been breached left, right and centre and we are now making a legality of a reality.</P>
      <P>I must oppose the amendment for the various reasons I have mentioned, in particular that it goes against the fundamental purpose of the Bill, which is to create a professional haulage industry. In view of the fact that milk is not tied to road transport restrictions, there is not much purpose in the amendment relating to soft fruits, vegetables, hay and silage.  One could add quite a number of other commodities to this list if one started to compile a list, but this is dangerous ground on which to tread.  In my view, beet is already well catered for by the haulage industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The case the Minister made in favour of cattle, sheep and pigs could be used in favour of the commodities mentioned in the amendment. The Minister has referred to the haphazard calls and the uncertainty. These factors could all apply to soft fruits and vegetables.  These two items ripen very quickly and need a speedy mode of transport.  Frequently they are produced in small quantities, and this might not appeal to the professional haulier whom the Minister and I envisage as a business man, a man who perhaps would not go out of his way to transport a small quantity of goods. However, the fact that only small quantities were available might not deter the small man who might be able to do the job for hire, but under present legislation he might be in the position of breaking the law.  Perhaps I may be misinterpreting the Minister, but I think he implied that the Garda might not go after this person.  If that is the case, why not make it the law? If the present law is not to be enforced in relation to some of those commodities, why not incorporate those commodities in the Bill and get it over with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's remarks and to learn of the increase in the number of licences granted to private hauliers.  Some years ago some unfortunate people were in <Col N="1424" /> trouble because they could not keep their vehicles on the road and pay the taxes.  I compliment the Minister on ensuring that the scheme has been widened, thereby making it easier for people who frequently have difficulty in getting transport.  In view of the many schemes being carried out at the moment CIE transport is availed of to a large extent by the local authorities. No local authority could possibly put on its own transport.  The result has been that while CIE have always provided an excellent service, they have been employing workers on the various schemes whom other people might be anxious to employ if they were available.</P>
      <P>This provision covers cattle, sheep and pigs, and they get priority over farm produce.  Naturally enough, cattle, sheep and pigs have to be transported at any hour of the day or night, due to the fact that livestock may be ready for sale and there might not be a mart locally.  It might be necessary to drive 50 miles or even go into the Dublin cattle market.  This legislation will provide facilities for many people who would otherwise be handicapped.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Bruton, I wish to point out that there are other commodities which must be transported at any hour of the day or night.  Poultry is a very big industry today.  In some towns it is equal to a small factory and there may be 20 or 30 people employed in such an industry established by an enterprising business man.  The people engaged in this industry, instead of having to put on their own vans can now avail of bigger trucks to do the job for them, which will save costs in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of potatoes and other farm produce much of which is being transported from Dublin.  Due to the climate it is becoming harder every year to produce some of these crops in certain parts of the country. Help is becoming scarcer and the cost of production is increasing.  Therefore, truck loads of this farm produce are transported from Dublin to the west. Donegal was famous for the production of first-class potatoes which were delivered throughout the length and breadth of this country.  I am told <Col N="1425" /> today by Donegal people that potatoes are now being transported from Dublin instead of from Donegal to Cork as heretofore.  The fact that private hauliers can provide transport will help to keep down costs.  For instance, on a CIE truck a driver and a helper are required.  As well as that, the private haulier will be living among his own people and will be well known.  He will have a telephone and people will have no problem in getting one of his trucks to do their business.</P>
    <P>It seems foolish that fish should be transported from Killybegs to Dublin city and then across to the west of Ireland and elsewhere, but that is happening. Many of those people who are in the fishing industry will be only too glad to know they can provide their own truck and that if they are not employed at one type of job they can easily take on another job.  The law was so restrictive in the past that many people did not bother to put transport on the road, because they might only run into trouble and be tempted to do the wrong thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat baffled that the Minister cannot accept at least some of the commodities.  If they are not going to be of great consequence, why not accept them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you started this, there would be no end to it.  I would agree with much of what Deputy McLaughlin has said.  It is important to encourage professional hauliers based in certain centres throughout Ireland.  There will be 900 of them in the Twenty-Six Counties.  What we want to discourage is investment by farmers or by anybody else in trucks that are under-utilised.  I want to encourage them to hire people in a competitive arena.  Within that ambit of 900 hauliers&mdash;there might be amalgamations among that 900&mdash;plus public transport, there will be ample competition and ample scope for people to hire competitively rather than purchase vehicle stock themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not, of course, interfering with the provision of the 1958 Act which allows for the haulage of livestock by way of tractor within a radius <Col N="1426" /> of 20 miles of a farm.  All in all, I do not see the point in adding the items mentioned by the Deputy for the very reason that it opens the floodgates to all sorts of items.  As I say, milk is excluded; beet is also excluded because it is well catered for at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has mentioned comparatively small items such as soft fruits, vegetables, hay and silage.  Most of these will be hauled by a farmer within a small radius of a farm, so that this legislation does not concern that type of activity.  If we started to do that sort of thing why not do oats, barley, poultry, greyhounds, fertilisers, building materials, fencing posts, drainage equipment and anything else that one can think of which is used by a farmer in the course of his production and distribution? I am opposing this amendment because by adding a few minor matters one can with justice say, &ldquo;Why not include all the other matters as well?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want to do anything to stop the development of a competitive haulage industry with a sound private enterprise base, as Deputy McLaughlin suggests.  This Bill goes a long way towards doing that and we should let that development take place with the minimum of impingement. The only impingement I am suggesting is that cattle, sheep and pigs should be included by reason of the fact that their breach of the law at the moment should be made a legality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain aspect of the greyhound industry is under pressure at the moment, but it is not appropriate for discussion here.  Deputy McLaughlin mentioned poultry. <Col N="1427" /> Would the Minister consider before the Committee Stage, making it cattle, sheep, pigs or poultry?  Poultry are not as important now as they were formerly but, as Deputy McLaughlin pointed out, in parts of the country they are still of considerable importance.  I cannot see any reason why that should not be considered.  I agree with the Minister that milk is either covered already or out, and meat is in the same position.  One is left then with the group Deputy Bruton has mentioned, which are really of no great significance.  Vegetables always were and will remain very largely own transport.  Men started off at 2 o'clock in the morning to bring vegetables to Dublin on their horse and cart from Rush and Lusk and this will continue. Will the Minister consider including poultry because they apply in the same way as cattle, sheep and pigs?  I do not think the amendment is of great significance otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy pointed out the illogicality of the Minister's attitude in making that point.  Subsection (1) of section 9 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, which we now propose to amend reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On or after the appointed day it shall not be lawful for any person <Col N="1430" /> in the course of a merchandise road transport business carried on by him to carry merchandise in any area in Saorstát Éireann unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such person is the holder of a licence (in this Act referred to as a merchandise licence) granted under this Part of this Act authorising him to carry on merchandise road transport business in that area and such business is carried on under and in accordance with such licence or</P>
    <P>(b)  such area is an exempted area and merchandise is carried by such persons in the course of such merchandise road transport business only in such area or such area and other exempted areas.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to understand the point I am making.  You have &ldquo;such area or such area and other exempted areas&rdquo;.  In the amendment in section 2 you have:</P>
    <P>(i)  by the substitution for subsection (1) of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>(1)  (a)  subject to paragraph (1) of this subsection and to subsection (5) of this section, it shall not be lawful on or after the appointed day for any person in the course of a merchandise road transport business carried on by him to carry merchandise in any area in the State unless&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is the first place that occurs but it occurs also later on.  The Minister told us that he is going to widen the existing limited licences to the whole State.  Paragraph (1) (a) (i) of this section states:</P>
    <P>Such person is the holder of a licence (in this Act referred to as a merchandise licence) granted under this Part of this Act authorising him to carry on a merchandise road transport business in that area and such business is carried on under and in accordance with such licence, or</P>
    <P>(ii) such area is an exempted area</P>
    <P>What do all those words mean now? It further states:</P>
    <P>and merchandise is carried by such person in the course of such merchandise road transport business <Col N="1431" /> only in such area or such area and other exempted areas.</P>
    <P>I looked at the extent of the repeals.  I want to ask the Minister, quite apart from the extreme difficulty of following this, why did he not repeal section 8 of the Road Transport Act, 1933? That is one aspect of the matter. Another is that all this reference to areas should no longer be extant once this Bill becomes law in view of what the Minister told us.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask, in relation to section 2, the reason for the delay in introducing legislation liberalising the transport of cattle, sheep and pigs.  As the Minister well knows, this was recommended by the store cattle study group in 1968 and it had been talked about long before that.  Instead of responding immediately to the report of the store cattle study group the Minister set up a further inter-departmental committee to go into the subject again and produce the same recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 41 to 56, and in page 4, to delete lines 1 to 7, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The number of vehicles with which a licensee under a merchandise licence shall be entitled to carry on a merchandise road transport business shall be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the licence is a merchandise (existing carrier's) licence&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  in a case in which, immediately before the commencement of the Road Transport Act, 1971, the licensee was authorised by the licence to carry on a <Col N="1436" /> merchandise road transport business throughout the State&mdash;a number of vehicles equal to the number provided under sub-paragraph (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph (as may be appropriate), increased by one,</P>
    <P>(ii)  in a case in which one or more than one vehicle plate was lawfully on issue to the licensee on the 1st day of January, 1969, in respect of vehicles being operated by him under and in accordance with that licence&mdash;a number of vehicles equal to the number of such vehicle plates,</P>
    <P>(iii)  in a case in which a vehicle plate was not on issue to the licensee on the 1st day of January, 1969, but was lawfully on issue to him on any day in the period of three years ending on the 31st day of December, 1968&mdash;a number of vehicles equal to the number of vehicle plates on issue to him under that licence on the latest day in that period on which a vehicle plate was on issue to him,</P>
    <P>(iv)  in any other case&mdash;one vehicle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment arises out of various representations made to me and also out of suggestions made here in the Second Stage debate by both Deputy T. O'Donnell and Deputy Foley.  The amendment seeks to ensure that no inequity is caused to the holders of 26-county licences.  Deputy O'Donovan expressed a certain view on this in the Second Stage debate.  I felt, on merit&mdash; although I have rather an open mind on it&mdash;that there was something in the case made for the 26-county licensees. All of the people who have 26-county licences made a substantial investment in their trucks and equipment in an era when there was a very scarce financial value on these licences.  As the Bill stood without this amendment, they were being left, as it were&mdash;full stop. On the other hand, 750 other licensees, with a far less valuable commodity&mdash; ranging from the licensee with a right of carriage for maybe a county, ten miles or 15 miles, a right of carriage <Col N="1437" /> possibly for one commodity within one county&mdash;were being lifted into a 26-county licence category.  The 750-odd licensees were being given this extra value of being able to operate without limitation of area, commodity or weight throughout the country whereas there was nothing extra in it at all for the 26-county licensee who was already there and was getting no bonus under the Bill, as it were, but was being subjected to this substantial additional competition.  To some extent, an inequity was being caused in that respect.</P>
    <P>I think the most reasonable way to deal with this is governed by my amendment which, as the House can see and as I have just stated, is really a measure of compensation to the existing 26-county licensees and is designed to ensure, as it were, a levelling-up of treatment between them and other carriers.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the two transport associations and heard their representations on this matter.  It is in furtherance of their representations to me and other representations made to me here by Deputies from both sides of the House that I decided that the most reasonable way to do this&mdash;I have not gone anywhere as far as the representations made to me sought&mdash;would be that, as and from 1st January, 1969, the governing date, each 26-county licence would have attached to it one extra vehicle.  We are not giving an extra licence in that sense.  We have decided on the datum day of 1st January, 1969.  We are pinning all existing licenced hauliers to their number of vehicles on that date.  We are doing this to eliminate any type of abuse that may have arisen subsequent to then &mdash;when it became known that this Bill was being prepared.  It was important &mdash;so as not to allow people to &ldquo;jump the gun&rdquo; in the intervening period when this matter became public knowledge.</P>
    <P>We have pinned all licensees back to 1st January, 1969, in regard to the vehicles they may have.  Therefore, if a licensee on 1st January, 1969, had, say, three vehicles, that is all he may have under this legislation.  If he had one vehicle on 1st January, 1969, that is all he may have.  As regards the 26-county licensees, we decided we would <Col N="1438" /> give them an extra vehicle as far as their licence of that date was concerned. If a 26-county licensee had one vehicle on 1st January, 1969, we would deem him to be entitled to two vehicles.  If he had three vehicles on 1st January, 1969, we would deem him entitled to four.  Representations to me involved doubling the number of vehicles in their possession on 1st January, 1969.  I resisted that.  Therefore, a substantial 26-county holder with six vehicles on 1st January, 1969, is entitled only to one more vehicle: I want to emphasise that.  It is a very minimal concession in this direction.</P>
    <P>In the main, these hauliers are the most professional hauliers in the country. Without any attempt to diminish the value of other licensed hauliers, the 26-county hauliers are, by and large, the people with the largest investment in the business.  They are the people who, if you like, have no compensation out of the Bill as it stands.  This is a sort of minimal concession in their direction.  I am glad to assure the House that the associations representative of all licensed hauliers&mdash;and within whose organisation the 26-county hauliers are in a minority by reason of their limited number&mdash;have all agreed that this is a reasonable concession to their fellow-hauliers who have invested in the equipment, plant and vehicles associated with this sort of nation-wide business that these particular hauliers have been engaged in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our spokesman, Deputy O'Donnell, and I feel that it would be rather inequitable if the people who had in many cases spent a considerable amount of money acquiring the 26-county licences when they were very scarce should now find themselves without any advantage at all for the money they had spent.  This would be rather unfair and we, therefore, support the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>There has been an amount of tears shed over these people.  Do not forget the bulk of these men are the people who were in the road haulage business in 1933. They have had 37 years monopoly to <Col N="1439" /> cover the whole country and now because some gravy is being dished out to another group of people they say: &ldquo;What about us?&rdquo;  I agree with one thing the Minister said.  They are the most professional group among the road transport men.  Not alone that but on the whole&mdash;I do not know if this is absolutely true&mdash;their workers are treated well, they have trade union conditions and all that kind of thing.  I accept all that.  The Minister is masking his batteries here.  He even masked his batteries in the way he put in this amendment because there was no need for all this verbiage we have been given.  As far as I can see subsection (4) (ii) (iii) and (iv) is the same as it was in the Bill already. There is not a word changed and yet in order to bring in the earlier part of the amendment, lines 41 to about 50, in page 3, the Minister puts in this long amendment.  Is this not correct?</P>

I am inclined to think, and I think the Minister will agree with me, that the people who have been covering a small area will now cover the whole country.  The development will not be of people who have one or two vehicles.  A limited number of people who show expertise&mdash;to use that modern word which I do not like&mdash;in their operation will gradually accumulate <Col N="1440" /> more business and will develop their businesses.

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Notwithstanding anything in section 14 (as amended by this Act) of the Principal Act, whenever it appears to the Minister that, in relation to a particular merchandise (existing carrier's) licence, the number of vehicles therein specified pursuant to the said section 14 (as so amended) does not fairly represent the normal complement of vehicles <Col N="1444" /> lawfully operated by the licensee under and in accordance with the terms of the licence in the period of three years ending on the 31st day of December, 1968 (being the number of vehicles so used by him with reasonable continuity or regularity), the Minister may amend the licence by increasing to such number as he may consider fair and reasonable the number of vehicles with which the licensee is authorised by that licence to carry on a merchandise road transport business, and the licence shall have effect accordingly on and after the date of the amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to a particular merchandise, I take it that this is partly on the same problem.  In section 4 (1)&mdash;in the early part of the section&mdash;there is reference to &ldquo;a particular merchandise (existing carrier's) licence&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It may have been the case that on 31st December, 1968&mdash; I was using 1st January, 1969, but it is all the same&mdash;that on that date a licensee might not have had the full complement of vehicles to which he was entitled.  I can keep him right under that subsection.</P>

I would look at his licence as it operated in the three years prior to 31st December, 1968, and if he was under-utilising his licence I could, then, if I thought it right and proper, amend the licence by increasing the number of vehicles to which he was entitled.  Earlier on, we were confining each such licensee to the number of vehicles he had on this date.  If he was under-utilising his licence on that date and if he was, in fact, entitled to more vehicles than he was using, I would have a discretion in this matter.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) is a transitional provision to allow for changing in the annual renewal date of merchandise licences which is being provided for in subsection (2).  That is merely transitional.  As licences under subsection (2) of section 3 will only be granted in substitution for licences in force immediately before the commencement of the Act, section 5, subsection (1) will include that licensees will not lose their licences if through circumstances outside their control the licence has not been renewed when the Bill comes into force.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Every year we have a look at them.  If the Deputy has subsection (2) before him, he will see that it is on the same point.  Most of these merchandise licences fall for renewal at mid-summer.  The remainder fall to be renewed at varying dates throughout the year.  For administrative convenience we feel it desirable to have a single renewal date in the autumn.  Section 5 (2) provides for that.  The renewal date would be 30th September.  That is the date of expiry and the date of renewal.  This is very desirable.  At the moment there are 850 licences expiring and being renewed in my Department at varying dates in the year.  This causes administrative confusion, as the Deputy will appreciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 5 is a technical amendment consequential on the last subsection.  It simply adapts to the requirements of the last subsection originally in the existing section 22 of the 1933 Act, that each renewal of a licence lasts for 12 months at which <Col N="1447" /> time the licence must again be renewed. Section 22 of the 1933 Act is being repealed under section 8 of this Bill. It tidies up the administrative procedures under which renewal of the licences is granted to applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I said on Second Stage that I would explain this matter in some detail during Committee Stage.  It was found during the preparatory work on this measure that, on a strict interpretation of the law, the merchandise licence to which section 7 relates was no longer valid. The matter is a bit complicated but the facts are that in 1934 the licensees concerned applied for an existing carrier merchandise licence.  They had been in the road freight transport business for a number of years and, if they had followed the correct procedure, the licence would have been granted without question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The upshot was that a correct application had not been lodged before the <Col N="1449" /> closing date and, to get over this difficulty, the application was treated as one for a shipping company merchandise licence for which the applicant was fully qualified.  A shipping licence was then issued in 1935, although the firm concerned were entitled to a full carrier merchandise licence.  The firm continued to operate under this licence, the shipping licence that was granted but, due to an error, the form of licence issued was for an existing carrier licence.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, provides that a shipping company licence shall cease to be in force if the licensee ceases to operate as a shipping company.  We had a very recent case indeed of that.  In this case the licensee ceased to be a shipping company in 1945 so that the licence which was, in fact, a shipping company licence, ceased to be valid from 1945.</P>
    <P>However, the firm continued on the basis of operating a general merchandise business and, with the passage of time, the original erroneous description did not come to light until recent years. The company believed that the licence was subject to the normal renewal provisions for existing carrier licences. This, in fact, was done on that basis. The question of remedying this situation without injustice to the company concerned was a difficult one and we sought advice on it.  The advice was that, notwithstanding the description of the licensee on the face of the licence as an existing carrier, the licence was not an existing carrier licence and due to the termination of the shipping service was, in fact, invalid since 1945, although the company had been operating on the basis of carrying on a general merchandise business.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, was that one of the largest hauliers in the country had been operating under an invalid licence since 1945.  This was the reality of the matter.  Unless the situation could be remedied the business would have to be discontinued with consequent unemployment.  I am satisfied that there were complete <i>bona fides</i> on the part of the company and, indeed, that there was an equity prescriptive right involved in that they operated all the time under an invalid <Col N="1450" /> licence situation that was, to put it frankly, caused in an office in my Department away back in the 1930s. The situation started then.  The firm give substantial employment.  They have 25 vehicles that have been operating all over Ireland but particularly in the south east.  The question was how to remedy that situation and, in my view, the only way to remedy it was by the incorporation of this section. The company are being penalised to this extent: as a compromise and to give them the section, they have reduced their number of vehicles from 25 to 18.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2) (b), page 6, line 19, after &ldquo;section&rdquo; to add &ldquo;, subject to appeal by the licensee to the courts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not claim to understand the full implications of this section but it appears to me that it allows the Minister to grant a restricted road freight licence to people who are bringing in vehicles and bringing them out again in the course of importing and exporting particular types of merchandise. Under subsection (2) (a) apparently these licences are given by order where <Col N="1451" /> it provides that a licence shall be deemed to be a restricted road freight licence.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not claim to understand the whole section but, apparently, power is vested in the Minister to give a man a licence by order&mdash;and presumably he will invest a certain amount in taking advantage of that licence&mdash; but then we have a provision in subsection (2) (b) that the Minister may by order again amend or revoke that order.  He has complete discretion at any time to take a man's livelihood away possibly, by order.  There is no appeal at all for the person concerned to any authority other than the Minister. The point I am making may be slightly qualified by the fact that the licences we are concerned with here are international licences and so forth, but there is a general point to be made. The Minister should not be in a position to revoke an order just like that, thereby possibly depriving a man of his livelihood.  That is the reason I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>I think it is reasonable. Their own countries can look after their own hauliers, as it were. It is important that we have this power here to deal with any breaches of conventions or agreements that may exist between countries or, in an EEC situation, any breach of Common Market transport regulations.  It is only right that the Minister should be able to deal with such foreign hauliers and let the other countries look after their own hauliers.  I could see something in the Deputy's case if it applied to our own hauliers here.</P>

      <P>I take it that the House agreed to Deputy Bruton withdrawing his amendment. There is a further amendment and we shall deal with that before we discuss the section as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection 5, page 6, line 29, to delete &ldquo;at his discretion&rdquo; and to add at the end of the subsection &ldquo;and the fee charged shall be on the same basis for licensees in similar lines of business and shall be related to the administration costs generally incurred in the issue of such licences.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, my point is qualified by the fact that we are dealing with an international situation where there is an international haulage system.  However, it is my opinion that subsection (5) gives the Minister far too wide discretion in relation to the fee.  This subsection reads:</P>
      <P>(5)  The Minister may at his discretion charge a fee of such amount as he may determine in respect of a restricted road freight licence or a licence deemed by order under this section to be a restricted road freight licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this subsection the Minister would be completely free to charge any fee he wishes without any reference to any objective criteria laid down in the Act.  He would find himself in the position of being under considerable personal pressure because these matters would be carried out in a private way&mdash;I shall not say what sort of pressure but he might be under pressure to give a licence at a particularly favourable fee to a particular licensee.  At the same time, he might be giving to others, who might not be in a position to exert the same pressure, a licence at a much higher fee. I am not suggesting that this is happening but subsections like this give to the Minister far too wide a discretion and leave the whole system of <Col N="1453" /> government open to the charges that we so frequently hear of Ministers being subject to influence in favour of their friends.  This is not a policy matter but merely a matter of fixing a fee and discretion in such matters should be circumscribed as much as possible so as to ensure, as much as anything else, that the Minister will not be embarrassed.</P>
    <P>In this context, I consider my amendment to be a very sensible one. Although it relates to international hauliers, it still stands because they are in as much a position to exert undue influence on the Minister in particular cases.  My amendment is so phrased that hauliers who do the same sort of works should be charged the same amount, roughly speaking.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the fee be related to administration costs.  On reflection, there may be a difficulty here in that we might not want to have it related to administration costs in general.  Possibly, in order to exercise some form of protection in discouraging people from applying for these licences we might want to charge them more.  On the other hand, of course, the Minister would have power initially to refuse a licence so, in that context, the fee would not make much difference.  Also, any fees which are charged for licences should be related to administration costs and there should be no possibility of fees increasing suddenly if there was no corresponding increase in administration costs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the effect of this amendment in part is, first of all, to prevent discrimination as between one haulier and another and, in so far as possible, to ensure that increases in fees are not too much in excess of the rate of inflation by tying them to the administration costs involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without necessarily agreeing with the exact wording of Deputy Bruton's amendment, I am in full agreement with the idea behind the amendment.  Any phrase such as &ldquo;the Executive being allowed at its discretion&rdquo; is extremely objectionable. In the world of today everything is in <Col N="1454" /> favour of the big fellow and there are continuous complaints, and rightly so, that the rights of individuals are being wiped out.  I am not saying for a moment that the Minister or anyone in his Department intends operating this legislation inequitably but the point is that the wording is objectionable.</P>
      <P>If one looks back on history in relation to matters of this kind, he will find it is comparatively recently that statutory instruments, rules and orders came into existence under Acts.  The Act was a complete entity and to this day in the United States, each Act tends to be a complete entity.  They reprint the entire Act.  The result is that it is much easier for anyone to ascertain what is the law.  It is not possible for anyone to ascertain this if the legislation includes such a phrase as &ldquo;at the Minister's discretion&rdquo;.  I have not all that much sympathy with international road freight hauliers and neither have the men in the road freight industry very much sympathy with them.  At the same time, I agree very strongly with Deputy Bruton that the fee should not be at the discretion of the Executive.  The specific fee should be laid down in the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make the same point as I made in regard to Deputy Bruton's previous amendment. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that in any case where there might be discrimination against any Irish haulier while he was working on the Continent, the Minister here would be able to act properly and charge an equal fee in respect of hauliers coming in here from the country concerned.  I wish to reiterate again that there is no question of this operating against Irish nationals.  It is a question of enabling the Minister to charge a fee of such amount as he would determine.</P>

      <P>It is commonsense to allow whoever is the Minister the flexibility to deal in this fee charging manner as befits and benefits Ireland and Irish hauliers in the economy and if we are in any way being discriminated against by some other country in regard to fees charged to Irish hauliers we should have the discretion to deal with foreign hauliers from that country as the Minister may think fit having regard to the particular way in which we are treated in that country. That is the purpose of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister and this possibly would act as a compelling argument against the second part of my amendment which tries to relate the cost of the fee to administration costs.  It is right in the light of what the Minister says that we should be in a position to discriminate against foreign hauliers if Irish hauliers are being discriminated against in a particular country but there should be some way of ensuring that in respect of two hauliers from the same country, in the same line of business, the Minister should not be in a position to charge one fee to one of them and a different fee to the other one.  He should not have this discretion which is going a bit far.  You could have two British hauliers here and one could be given a very high fee and the other a very low fee.  Under this section the Minister is quite free to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I protested about this form of drafting in regard to another Bill.  There is this question of a definition within a section.  We have &ldquo;a licence (which shall be known, and is in this Act referred to, as a restricted road freight licence)&rdquo;.  With all due respect this restricted road freight licence is mentioned only in this section. Of course there is a long tradition of putting in a definition section at the beginning of the Bill.  You have two definitions.  In section 1 you have &ldquo;In this Act &lsquo;the Minister&rsquo; means the Minister for Transport and Power&rdquo; and &lsquo;The Principal Act&rsquo; means the Road Transport Act, 1933&rdquo; and &lsquo;a restricted road freight licence&rsquo; shall be a licence to a person authorising him to import the vehicle...&rdquo; and so on.  This development gives rise to a problem which is that where you have a definition in a section of an Act it could quite easily be the case that in some other section of the Act some cross-reference would occur.  That has happened in this House.</P>

      <P>I can see the Deputy's point and if this particular section was germane to the whole purpose of the Bill then what the Deputy is talking about, a cross-reference, would arise and I would agree with him, but it is very much a section that was brought into the Bill at the last moment. It was not in the original draft prepared by my Department and it was brought in on the basis of our Common Market negotiations and the necessity to incorporate our transport policy with the Common Market transport policy. In that context the section arises and there is no reference in any other section, or indeed in any other Act within the road transport code, to what the <Col N="1457" /> Deputy talks about here, a restricted road freight licence.  It is germane to this section and nothing else.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill have been set out in some detail in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with it.  I propose, therefore, to confine my remarks now to comments designed to set the measure in the context of the evolution of the Central Bank and our experience in the development of commercial banking, and to make clear the main objects in view.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the first major change proposed in banking legislation since the passing of the Central Bank Act, 1942, under which the Central Bank of Ireland was established.  The Central Bank superseded the Currency Commission which was set up under the 1927 Currency Act, the Currency Commission being the first native institution given power to regulate the issue of Irish currency following the establishment of the State.  This power and some other powers of a minor nature possessed by the Commission passed to the Central Bank under the 1942 Act.</P>
      <P>The 1942 Act also gave the Central Bank the general function and duty of taking such steps as it deems advisable from time to time to safeguard the integrity of our currency and ensure that in the regulation of credit the aim shall be the welfare of the whole community. Since 1942 the bank has widened the scope of its activities in various ways, bringing them into line with the activities of central banks in other developed countries.  It has done this in harmony with the commercial banks and with the support of the public as well as of the banking system. An efficient monetary system in which the public have confidence is indispensable for successful economic and social development.</P>

    <P>Some examples will illustrate the progress <Col N="1461" /> made by the Central Bank since it was founded.  The bank's legal tender note fund&mdash;the backing for the currency &mdash;which originally consisted almost entirely of sterling, has been substantially diversified.  In addition to sterling, it now holds gold, US dollars and US Federal Government securities, as well as assets representing this country's subscription to the International Monetary Fund and a balance in the General Fund of the Bank.  Over the years our external reserves have come increasingly under the bank's control.  The foreign exchange assets of Departmental Funds have been transferred to the bank.  In 1968 and in 1969, following the Basle Agreement for the support of sterling, most of the sterling assets of the Associated Banks were similarly transferred.  Thus, virtually all the country's external reserves are now controlled by the bank.</P>
    <P>In 1955, the bank, for the first time, helped to improve the liquidity of the Associated Banks by rediscounting Exchequer Bills and Bills of Exchange. It has since, as and when appropriate, continued to exercise this function.  In 1958, regulations were made requiring the Associated Banks to settle their domestic clearings through the Central Bank and to maintain deposits with the bank for that purpose.  In 1965, the bank commenced the issue of guidelines to the Associated Banks on domestic credit creation.  This is now an important function.  In 1965, also, responsibility for the day to day administration of foreign exchange control was transferred from the Department of Finance to the Bank.</P>
    <P>In 1969, the functions of the Minister for Finance relating to payments to and receipts from the International Monetary Fund were transferred to the bank as provided for by the Bretton Woods Agreement (Amendment) Act. The bank also has responsibility for the operation, as far as this country is concerned, of the new special drawing rights scheme which has been put into operation by the IMF.  It was arranged some time ago that future issues of Exchequer Bills will be made through the Central Bank.  In addition, the issue and registration of various National Loans is now the <Col N="1462" /> responsibility of the bank.  The House was informed in November, 1969 that action was in train towards the creation of a money market.  This is another new activity of the bank.  The centralisation of the external reserves, which I have already mentioned, is relevant in this context.  For the same purpose, arrangements have been made for the acceptance by the Central Bank of a wide range of short-term deposits from the banks and finance houses, for active dealings by the bank in short-dated Government securities and for the issue of Exchequer Bills to the banks at more frequent intervals. Money which was formerly placed in London is now being placed at home and a native money market has been initiated with the Central Bank playing a role of increasing importance.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank's history has been one of continuing evolution, particularly so in recent years.  Under the present Bill many new powers and duties will be conferred on it.  It is a major objective to give greater protection to persons depositing money in banks and finance houses, all of which will have to hold licences issued by the bank before they can accept deposits.</P>
    <P>Nowadays the potential saver is faced with the bewildering range of deposit-taking institutions, domestic and foreign, many offering high interest rates and easy withdrawal terms.  The business of dealing in money is no longer the preserve of the banks as that term is commonly understood by the general public.  In this situation, the existing supervision of the opening and operation of banks is clearly inadequate.  At present, anybody can open a business to take deposits from the public on obtaining a licence from the Revenue Commissioners which must be issued on application and payment of a fee of £1.</P>
    <P>A licence is required only if the business accepts deposits payable on demand or on not more than seven days notice.  If the business uses in its name or in advertising the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo;, &ldquo;banker&rdquo; or &ldquo;banking&rdquo; or any analogous word, it must make a deposit of £20,000 with the High Court in cash or securities, but otherwise it is <Col N="1463" /> free to conduct its business without making any deposit.  Apart from powers to collect information, the Central Bank has scarcely any formal supervisory or controlling function in relation to banking and similar businesses.</P>
    <P>We have virtually an &ldquo;open door&rdquo; policy.  There are about 70 bankers' licences currently in force.  This number includes the eight Associated Banks and their subsidiary companies and 20 other Irish concerns without known external affiliations.  The remainder are subsidiaries, branches or affiliates of external institutions; most of these commenced business within the past decade.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a regulatory licensing system with the Central Bank as the licensing authority.  The bank will have discretion in granting licences but will not be able to refuse a licence without the consent of the Minister for Finance.  A licence may be refused only if refusal is in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of banking.  Conditions may be attached to licences.  With the Minister's consent, a licence may be revoked on certain stated grounds, namely if the holder so requests, if the business has ceased, if the licence holder is unable to meet his obligations, fails to maintain the required deposit with the Central Bank, is convicted on indictment of any offence under the legislation, is convicted summarily of an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust, or if the circumstances have so changed that the licence holder would not be granted a licence under current practice.  The licence holder may make representations to the Minister for Finance regarding the proposed revocation and the Minister is obliged to consider any representations.</P>
    <P>Every licence holder will have to keep a deposit in the Central Bank equal to 5 per cent of his customers' deposits, subject to a maximum of £500,000 and a minimum of £20,000. The bank will have power to prescribe books and records to be kept by licence holders, to inspect the books and records and to obtain returns from the licence holders.  If it appears that a licence holder has become or <Col N="1464" /> is likely to become unable to meet his obligations, the bank may direct the licence holder to suspend the taking of deposits and the making of payments unless with the bank's permission. The licence holder will have a right of appeal to the court against any direction.  Directions may also be given by the bank as to the information to be published in any advertisement or requiring the cessation of advertising. There are special provisions to facilitate depositors in recovering their money through court action where a licence holder fails to pay amounts due.</P>
    <P>The powers which I have outlined are extensive but I consider them necessary to ensure adequate protection for depositors.  The controlling authority must be in a position to act quickly if there is good reason to believe a default is likely to occur.  Action after a business has defaulted could be too late.</P>
    <P>The Bill also confers additional power on the Central Bank designed to give more effective control of credit. Under this power the bank will be able to require holders of banking licences to maintain specified ratios between assets and liabilities.  By means of such ratios and by varying them from time to time, the bank will have a flexible instrument for use in regulating the amount of bank lending.  This will help towards better administration of monetary policy.  Similar power is available in other countries.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the Associated Banks have a special organisation for the clearance of customers' cheques.  In view of the increasing number of banks in Ireland, it is in the interest of the public generally that facilities of this kind should be widely available on reasonable terms.  It is, therefore, provided in the Bill that licensed banks will be required to accept from customers, for collection and crediting of the proceeds to the customers' accounts, cheques drawn on other licensed banks.  It is also provided that the Central Bank will have power to supervise the conditions under which these facilities are made available, including arrangements whereby one licence-holder acts as banker for another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> I referred earlier to the rapid increase in the number of banking and financial institutions which have opened business here in recent years, many of them of external origin.  The foreign banks have helped to introduce new skills and techniques and to promote the inflow of investment capital.  When the Associated Banks were closed last year, they provided much-needed banking services.  They have been welcome for these reasons.  Nevertheless, the Government consider that widespread penetration of Irish banking by external interests would be undesirable.  We have a long-established and well-developed banking system with branch banks widely spread throughout the country. It might, indeed, be said that we are already overbanked.  Our attitude towards the opening of new banks and of new branches of existing banks must, therefore, be one of caution.  Should we become a member of the European Economic Community, our policy would, of course, have to have regard to any obligations we might incur regarding participation by non-nationals.</P>
    <P>Provisions are included in the Bill to facilitate the transfer and merger of banking businesses.  I hope these provisions, which are basically similar to those of the National Bank Transfer Act, 1966, will be availed of to rationalise our banking system in a way that will make for greater efficiency and more economic use of banking resources. The two major banking groups have rationalisation schemes in progress and I trust that these will contribute to a general improvement of the banking structure.  At the same time, I should add that the Government are fully alive to the dangers that might arise from too great a concentration of banking.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the standard unit of value.  It expresses the par value of the Irish pound in terms of gold and provides that the Government may, by order, change the par value after consultation with the Central Bank.  There has been some misunderstanding of this provision. What is intended is solely a technical change, which has been mentioned to the House on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The existing position is that the 1927 <Col N="1466" /> Currency Act established a fixed parity between the Irish pound and the pound sterling.  Under this provision the exchange value of the Irish pound, while remaining the same as against sterling, automatically follows changes in the value of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> other currencies. This position is inconsistent with the obligations arising from our membership of the International Monetary Fund.  These obligations are set out in the following three quotations from Article IV of the Fund's Articles of Agreement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  &ldquo;The par value of the currency of each member shall be expressed in terms of gold...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(2)  &ldquo;A member shall not propose a change in the par value of its currency except to correct a fundamental disequilibrium&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(3)  &ldquo;A change in the par value of a member's currency may be made only on the proposal of the member and only after consultation with the Fund&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the obligations was approved by the Bretton Woods Agreement Act of 1957.  The present Bill will remove the contradiction between that Act and the 1927 Currency Act.</P>
    <P>As I have already made clear to the House, the question of devaluation of our currency in relation to sterling does not arise.  The Government have no intention whatsoever of changing the existing parity with sterling and the policies we are committed to following will ensure that no such eventuality will arise.  Indeed, we are looking forward to the prospect of membership of the European Economic Community in which, if present proposals materialise, there will be a progressive movement towards fixed parities between the currencies of all the member countries. I hope that no more need be said to dispel misapprehension on this score, particularly as financial confidence is so important a foundation for economic development.  Given this importance, I am sure that Deputies will act with a sense of responsibility in any comments they may make.</P>
    <P>The last part of the Bill&mdash;Part V&mdash;<Col N="1467" /> contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  The former Currency Commission had power to carry on normal banking activities but although the functions of the commission generally were transferred to the Central Bank, the 1942 Act has been construed as limiting the bank to the specific powers listed in the Act.  It is proposed to restore the express power to engage in banking activities, particularly in view of the further provision, to which I will refer in a moment, namely the proposed transfer of the Exchequer Account to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding reserve bonds is related to the transfers&mdash; which I mentioned earlier&mdash;of sterling by the Associated Banks to the Central Bank for inclusion in the official reserves.  In the first instance, it is proposed that the bonds be issued mainly in substitution for deposit certificates which the bank has issued against some of the sterling transfers.  It is considered desirable that power should be available to the bank to issue these bonds so that they may be available to licence holders as a form of transferable domestic liquidity reserve for use within the banking system.  It is expected that they will facilitate the development of the domestic money and bond market.</P>
    <P>The proposal to transfer the Exchequer Account from the Bank of Ireland to the Central Bank will bring our practice into line with that of other countries.  Almost from its establishment under the pre-Union Irish Parliament, the Bank of Ireland has acted as Government banker.  It is only fitting that I should say that the bank and its officers have over the years carried out this function in an efficient and helpful manner and that I should express the Government's thanks to them.  The transfer is being arranged by mutual agreement and will be phased over a period to facilitate both sides.</P>
    <P>At present the Bank of Ireland, by reason of the charter and the special legislation under which it operates, suffers from some disabilities as compared with the other banks to which <Col N="1468" /> the Companies Act applies.  Provision is made in the Bill to remedy this so that, in future, shareholders of the Bank of Ireland may be in the same position as shareholders of the other banks in regard to the management of the business.</P>
    <P>There is doubt as to whether the Moneylenders Acts apply to some forms of banking.  Under the Bill, holders of licences are, as such, being exempted from any obligation they might have to register as moneylenders under these Acts, leaving the control and regulation of banking to be dealt with under the provisions of the Currency and Central Bank Acts.</P>
    <P>The maximum number of members of the Board of the Central Bank is eight, in addition to the Governor.  Of the eight, three, known as banking directors, are drawn from a panel elected by the Associated Banks, that is the eight commercial banks which were the shareholding banks in the former Currency Commission and which were associated with the Central Bank by the 1942 Act.  Changes in the banking scene since then, including the emergence of two predominant groups among the Associated Banks, make it necessary to review the arrangements. The existing procedure of selection of banking directors by means of a panel system is over-elaborate in the new circumstances and, following the various mergers, it is not considered necessary to have three directors representing the Associated Banks.  The Bill provides, therefore, that in future the Minister for Finance will appoint two banking directors from amongst persons who are directors of Associated Banks.  As the total number of directors will remain unchanged, the Minister will be able, if he so wishes, to appoint a further non-banking director and thus broaden the representation on the board.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will add considerably to the responsibilities of the Central Bank.  It is important that the bank should have the freedom and discretion, as well as the administrative competence, to enable it to discharge these responsibilities fairly and efficiently and with full regard for the public interest.  I have every confidence <Col N="1469" /> in this respect in the bank's board and staff.</P>
    <P>When the Central Bank was being established, the relationship between the Government and the new institution was considered, and the then Minister for Finance said in the Dáil that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is intended that there should be the fullest co-operation between the Government and the Central Bank.  The Government does not, however, propose to interfere with the administration of the bank which will be independent in the carrying out of its functions.  This independence is possessed by almost every Central Bank throughout the world and is a very desirable provision&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the general function and duty ascribed to the Central Bank by the 1942 Act which are to take &ldquo;such steps as the board may from time to time deem appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and ensuring that, in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole&rdquo;.  This statutory function of the bank in relation to monetary policy does not, of course, diminish the ultimate responsibility of the Government in that sphere.</P>
    <P>There can be no question about the responsibility of the duly-elected Government for national economic policy of which monetary policy is an important and integral part.  The need for integrating monetary policy with general economic policy and the ultimate authority of the Government in regard to both are evident.  They are fully recognised here and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>At the same time, because of basic public interest considerations and historical experience, it has been recognised universally to be desirable to have a special institution, differing in constitution from, and enjoying more independence than, a Government Department, charged with the immediate responsibility for monetatry policy.  I can think of no independent country in which there is not a Central Bank.  In some countries the ultimate <Col N="1470" /> authority of the Government for national economic policy is expressly indicated by a statutory provision for the issue of a policy directive by the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank.  Elsewhere, the ultimate authority of the Government, even though it may not be expressly defined, is nonetheless undisputed.  Everywhere, subject to this ultimate need for reconciliation of monetary with general economic policy, the maximum independence and discretion is assured to central banks.</P>
    <P>In our case the relationship between Government and Central Bank rests as much on mutual confidence as on statute.  It is sustained by frequent consultations between the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank on all aspects of economic policy, by a frank interchange of information and comment in the policy field and by the fact that the Government have an official representative on the board of the bank.  It has worked well since the establishment of the bank in 1943.  The bank has always had regard to national economic policy in considering monetary policy and I have no doubt that it will continue to do so.  I do not regard the provisions of the present Bill as calling for any change in the basis of the present relationship.</P>
    <P>Before I finish, I wish to refer to the bank closure which suspended the country's main banking services for many months and caused widespread trouble and inconvenience to the business community and private persons alike.  It must be the aim of all concerned to avoid any recurrence.  As the House is aware, the Minister for Labour has arranged for Professor M. P. Fogarty to investigate the causes of the dispute and to make recommendations as to what action might be taken to avoid any further similar experience. The Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute are conducting inquiries to ascertain how firms and individuals managed their finances during the bank closure.  The information provided by all these inquiries will be of assistance in deciding on future action.</P>
    <P>Meantime, the powers proposed in <Col N="1471" /> the Bill will put the Central Bank in a strong position in various ways to deal with banking problems, whether arising from a bank closure or otherwise. The bank will, for example, be able to engage in any necessary banking activity, including clearing activities.  It will also, as I have already indicated, hold the Exchequer Account.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to inform the House that I propose to introduce a number of amendments to the Bill at the Committee Stage.  These amendments are considered necessary, partly to clarify the bank's powers in regard to clearing activities, partly to deal with points arising from the Supreme Court judgment in the Marts Act case and partly for technical reasons.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for approval by the House.</P>

      <P>By accident I was in the House as an official when the Central Bank Bill, 1942 was introduced. Tonight reminded me of what happened on the Second Reading of <Col N="1472" /> that Bill when it went through in one day.  The then Taoiseach was not satisfied and he proceeded to make a Second Reading speech on the Committee Stage, and the Committee Stage went on for ten consecutive days, with the result that I was in the House from 10 a.m. to 10.30 p.m., Saturdays included. I do not think that is going to happen this time.  Despite the paucity of the attendance tonight I hope we shall have a worthwhile debate on the Second Reading.  I am not saying it was not a worthwhile debate last time but the then Taoiseach thought it was too important a Bill to have gone through in one day and accordingly he created a situation where it was argued with the then Ceann Comhairle for two days as to whether other people had the right to make Second Reading speeches on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 17th February, 1971.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to furnish answers to these questions in the precise form sought by the Deputy.  From an examination of decisions of the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal, a total of 55 appeals were heard by the tribunal to which section 24 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, applied.  Of these 55 appeals, the tribunal in seven cases expressed no opinion on the question of whether or not, but for section 24, the appeals would have succeeded.  In 36 cases the tribunal held that, irrespective of section 24, the appellants were not entitled to lump sums or weekly redundancy payments.  In 11 cases the tribunal decided that the appellants satisfied the general conditions for redundancy payments, except for the provisions of section 24, and were entitled to weekly redundancy payments. In the remaining case, the tribunal held that the appellant was not eligible for redundancy payments because of the 1969 High Court decision in the Limerick Health Authority v. Mrs. Anna Ryan case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the above particulars, it will be seen that in only 11 of the 55 cases were the entitlements of the appellants concerned to redundancy payments, but for the application of section 24 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, established by the tribunal.  Weekly redundancy payments have been or will be paid to the 11 employees concerned. The employers concerned in these 11 cases, three employers in all, failed to give notices to the employees concerned under sections 17 or 18 of the Act.  The decisions of the tribunal in ten of the 11 cases have been published only at the end of January, 1971.  In the <Col N="1342" /> remaining case, my Department secured the payment by the employers to the employee concerned of the lump sum to which he would have been entitled but for the failure of his appeal under section 24 and for lump sum payments to be made by the employer to eight other employees of the same company who were dismissed in the same circumstances. I decided, in view of the employer's agreement to pay lump sums to the nine employees, that proceedings should not be instituted against the company.</P>
