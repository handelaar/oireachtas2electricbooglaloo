    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Oliver J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that great confusion exists amongst Irish workers, who are employed in Britain, in connection with the payment of benefit by his Department on their return to this country; if all British contributions are taken into consideration in the assessment of Irish benefit; and what Irish benefits are available to insured persons, formerly employed in Great Britain, who return to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware and I do not accept that the position is as stated by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reciprocal arrangements between this country and Great Britain provide <Col N="1148" /> in the case of the short-term benefits that contributions in one country may be treated as contributions in the other for the purpose of entitlement to benefit. In the case of the long-term benefits, that is, widow's pension and contributory old age pension, contributions paid under the British scheme may be reckoned for the purpose of these benefits in this country.  The arrangements also provide that certain British benefits are paid in this country and that increases in benefit are payable in respect of dependants who are resident here.  There are different conditions applying to the transfer of contributions in relation to each benefit or pension.  In the case of disability benefit a person claiming this benefit on his return from Great Britain is entitled to have his British insurance treated as if it were Irish insurance if this will entitle him to benefit, or to benefit at a higher rate than his Irish insurance would give him.</P>
    <P>These reciprocal arrangements are in continuous review and as recently as April last officers of my Department met with officers of the British Ministry of Health and Social Security with a view to extending the application of the arrangements to the new benefits which were introduced under our legislation last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will initiate discussions between the Revenue Commissioners and the Northern Ireland authorities to examine the feasibility of creating free trade conditions between Donegal and Northern Ireland, whereby customs control between those two areas would be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The creation of free trade and the related removal of customs control as between part of our territory and Northern Ireland would not be a practical proposition.  The initiation, therefore, of discussions on this particular proposal would be unlikely to be productive of useful results.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the Taoiseach has suggested consideration of trans-Border regional economic development and the matter is under examination by senior officials of North and South.  There is already progress in the creation of free trade conditions within the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and this whole subject will receive a considerable impetus if both Ireland and Britain become members of the European Communities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect is that if goods were transferable without any hindrance across the Border into Donegal they could similarly go from there to Leitrim and the rest of the country unless we were to set up a customs border between Donegal and Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is sheer nonsense. There are similar arrangements in the United States of America between the different States and they do not have to set up borders between the States. They have patrols and if there is any abuse of the regulations patrol cars are sent to pick up the offenders.  I do <Col N="1150" /> not suggest that there should be a border between Donegal and Leitrim but if there is any imagination in the Department it should be possible to arrive at a position in which some arrangement could be made.  If the reason given is the only one why the Minister is rejecting this proposal, I feel that he should have another look at the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if his attention has been drawn to the results of the survey carried out by An Foras Talúntais on farm incomes; if he accepts the income figure shown for small farmers as realistic; and, if so, what he proposes to do to increase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report on the farm management survey, 1968-69, recently published by An Foras Talúntais.  The primary object of that survey was to provide information concerning levels of farm outputs, costs and incomes and the variation in these as between different regions, farm sizes and farming systems. Thus there is a wide range of figures in the report for family farm income on small farms which vary with those factors.  The figures are also affected by the fact that a substantial number of the farms surveyed were part-time and they do not give a complete picture of the income position of small farms because they do not take into account income from non-farm sources.  Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that as the survey relates to 1968-69 the figures are now two years out of date and in the intervening period farm incomes generally have improved considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is a wide range of agricultural measures in operation which are of special help in improving the income position of smaller farmers.  These include the small farm incentive bonus scheme, the beef cattle incentive scheme, relief <Col N="1154" /> of rates on land, the tiered system of creamery milk price support and differentiation in favour of smaller farmers in the grants payable under the land project and the farm buildings scheme.  Such measures are kept under review and are adapted from time to time to meet changing circumstances as, for example, in the recent Budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the farmers are not getting a fair share of the national income?  In answer to a question I asked about a fortnight ago the Taoiseach informed me that while the farmers represent roughly 28 per cent of the population, last year they got only 14.8 per cent of the national income.  Surely the Minister is also aware that the gap between industrial earnings and agricultural earnings has now widened to between £8.50 and £9 per week.  Would he not agree that the Government measures, as far as the farmers are concerned, have been a failure so far?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is inescapable that there has been, since the survey was carried out, a general increase in farm incomes from the year 1969-70 to the current year on the all-farms figure, from £714 to about £800. As my earlier reply said, there is a general, continuous rise in farm incomes. I would prefer to see a rise at a faster rate, but a great many measures are in operation to see that a faster rate is achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that even the Minister for Finance had to admit that farm incomes were dropping?  Surely he must agree that even three years ago farmers were getting almost 20 per cent of the national income and that, therefore, if it is now down to 14.8 per cent, farm income is dropping?  Everyone knows it and yet the Government stand idly by and do nothing about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never hesitated to express concern about the gap that exists between industrial incomes and non-farm incomes generally, on the one hand, and farm incomes, on the other hand.  However, on the point raised by Deputy L'Estrange the survey that is the subject of the question did highlight the fact that the increase between the year 1967-68 and the following year was 30 per cent on an all-farms basis, and in the year following that there was a further 80 per cent increase.  These are not my figures; these are the figures of the survey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

Applications for such scholarships received from persons whose parents are resident in the urban areas but are not holders of land in the rural areas are considered on their merits, due regard being had to the number of scholarships available and the number of applicants qualifying for such scholarships from the rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court, in a recent decision, held that sales at a cattle mart&mdash; or, at all events, ordinary periodic sales&mdash;were not special events for the purposes of section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, and, consequently, it would appear that the courts are now precluded from granting occasional licences under that section for the purpose of authorising the sale of intoxicating liquor at marts during such ordinary sales.  Following <Col N="1157" /> the decision of the Supreme Court I received representations on behalf of mart owners, which I am at present considering.  While I have not yet had an opportunity of fully assessing the pros and cons of the matter, it may be taken that there might be very substantial objections to changing the law as now laid down by the Supreme Court&mdash;as is evidenced by the fact that the Supreme Court decision arose out of objections by licensed traders to the grant of occasional licences in respect of these sales.  Even if the Government were to decide in due course that legislation in the matter was desirable, the position is that, because of the pressure of more urgent business, there would be no prospect whatever that the legislation could be introduced in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor (for the Minister for Local Government)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The amending regulations which were brought into operation in the latter part of last year were designed with the object of seeking an improvement in the standards of the business and in the livelihood of persons engaged in it.  There are important concessions in the amending regulations in so far as they apply to hackney and taxi operators who held licences at any time during the two year period prior to 1st September, 1970.  For example, the higher rate of fees mentioned by the Deputy does not apply to such people when seeking renewal of their licences, nor does the provision governing the age of a car apply where they are replacing an existing car.  At the time of making the amending regulations I announced that I proposed to review their effects within two years and I intend to do that.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that tourist centres are without hackney services because of the regulations, nor that there is general dissatisfaction with the new provisions.  If the Deputy would wish to bring particular cases to my attention, I will be pleased to examine them in the course of the review which I have undertaken to conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that if the Minister contacts the Garda authorities in Letterkenny he will get all the information that I could give him.  I have had nothing but complaints from people in County Donegal who find it impossible to get cars older than two years passed by the PSV officers.  Does the Minister not consider that this is not in the interests of people who want to get into the hackney business, and does he not consider that the present regulations <Col N="1159" /> lend themselves to being used by illegal operators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual fact the whole object of the ministerial regulations was to get over this problem, to try to protect the hackney man who has been in business for quite a while, and to prevent incursions being made into his business by temporary, part-time, newly-created, overnight operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>This might be so in taxi meter areas but I would ask the Minister to re-examine the position in rural Ireland where a person who wishes to take out a hackney licence must produce a motor car which is not older than two years and may pay a licence fee of £30 and £11 for his badge.  This is criminal in view of the fact that most of these operators use them at the weekend only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Deputy is not looking at it from the point of view of existing hackney men.  As I have stated in the reply on behalf of the Minister, the Minister proposes to review the effects of those regulations and those matters can be brought to his attention.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in deciding the Exchequer contribution towards the expenditure of each local authority, any system of weighting is in operation as between one local authority and another; and, if so, if he will give details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer contribution towards the expenditure of local authorities&mdash;estimated at £77 million in respect of 1970-71&mdash;is made up of a multiplicity of separate grants given for specific purposes and accordingly no formal weighting system applies to the distribution of the total sum as between one local authority and another.  Although there is no formal weighting system the cumulative effect of the various grants which go to make up the total is such that State grants tend to meet a greater share of the expenditure of county councils in the less developed areas.  Some grants are at a higher rate in respect of certain areas.  For example, the subsidy on loan charges in respect of capital expenditure on water and sewerage schemes administered by my Department is at the rate of 60 per cent in respect of Gaeltacht areas and smaller urbans as compared to 40 per cent in Dublin and 50 per cent for the country generally, while the agricultural grant gives proportionately greater assistance to those areas with a greater proportion of small holdings.</P>

      <P>The Government are deeply concerned at the tragic plight of the victims of the cholera outbreak in Pakistan and in India and the extent of the suffering and the refugee problem created as a result of the situation in East Pakistan. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has issued an appeal for humanitarian assistance for large numbers of refugees from East Pakistan now in neighbouring Indian States and has decided that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should act as the focal point for the co-ordination of assistance from all organisations of the United Nations system.  As a first step, the High Commissioner has sent a three-man team to assist the refugees' needs and to discuss means of assistance with the Indian Government.  The Government of Pakistan for their part have requested assistance from the United Nations family of organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> As Deputies will be aware, Ireland contributes annually to international aid organisations such as the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food Programme, as well as to our own Red Cross Society, all of which will, no doubt, contribute to the relief of the present tragic situation.  The Government are giving urgent consideration to the present appeal of the Secretary-General and will announce the extent of any further assistance proposals within the next few days&mdash;apart of course from the generous aid already given by the Churches in Ireland and by the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>The Irish Red Cross Society have given out of funds made available to them by the Government and the public an initial contribution of £3,000 to the League of Red Cross Societies and propose to issue a public appeal for further subscriptions today.  I would urge the public to respond generously to the appeal of the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that aid channelled through the Red Cross reaches the persons who are suffering, or is the aid in this case channelled through the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Aid channelled through the Red Cross certainly would reach the people concerned.  I am not quite certain at the moment if all aid including Red Cross aid, will go through the United Nations High Commissioner for <Col N="1168" /> Refugees.  I am not quite sure if it will work that way but the intention, as indicated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, is that the High Commissioner would act as the focal point for the co-ordination of all assistance from all organisations of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>I think it may be taken that aid which is given, either through the United Nations organisation or through the Red Cross, will reach the refugees.  I know there have been some complaints about certain supplies not reaching the people concerned. These complaints are being investigated urgently at the moment but I should like to stress that any contributions given to the Irish Red Cross Society in this connection will reach the victims of the disaster with the co-operation of the International Red Cross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in March, 1965, purchased from Coast Lines Limited that company's wholly-owned subsidiary, the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited.  The purchase price of £3,600,000 was based on valuation of the assets without any allowance for goodwill.  The assets included three passenger/cargo/cattle vessels, six cargo/cattle vessels, properties at Dublin, Cork, Drogheda and Dundalk and liquid reserves amounting to £720,000.  It was a condition of the purchase that the B &amp; I should enter into an agreement <Col N="1169" /> appointing Coast Lines their agents in Britain for a period of 20 years at an agreed commission.  The Government also had to give Coast Lines a written undertaking that the B &amp; I would operate their business on strictly commercial lines as a self-supporting commercial entity without special measures which would place the B &amp; I in an advantageous position as compared with Coast Lines.</P>
    <P>When moving the Second Stage of the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) Bill, 1965, my predecessor outlined the reasons why the Government had acquired the B &amp; I.  These were, mainly, to ensure effective Irish participation in the cross-Channel trade which was so important both from the point of view of tourism and our foreign trade.  The B &amp; I profits were diminishing rapidly and it was essential to acquire the company to ensure the continuation of their services as well as to ensure that in the rapidly changing situation in the cross-Channel services the national interest would receive proper consideration.  He pointed out that the shipping trade was then facing a period of rapid evolutionary change which posed great difficulties for shipping lines operating conventional services.</P>
    <P>The 1965 Bill provided for the operation of the company on a strictly commercial basis.  There was no provision for Government assistance nor any provision for increasing the capital of the company.  It was hoped that necessary new investment to meet the technological changes in the industry could be financed from loan capital which would be serviced from profits.</P>
    <P>Following their appointment, the new board of the B &amp; I decided, after full investigation, that the existing management structure in the B &amp; I, which was geared to the overall management structure of Coast Lines, was not suitable to operation of the company as an independent Irish entity.  The board recruited new management personnel with knowledge and experience in the marketing and financial fields and introduced a new management structure based in Dublin and including a modern sales and marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> In order to compete effectively with the new passenger/car ferry services between Ireland and Britain introduced by their competitors and to stimulate the demand for this type of transport which is particularly significant for the promotion and expansion of tourism, the B &amp; I decided to replace their three conventional passenger/cargo/livestock vessels with car ferries.  Two of these vessels have been brought into operation on the Dublin-Liverpool route and one on the Cork-Swansea route.  The acquisition of these car ferries and the provision of the necessary terminals at Dublin, Cork, Liverpool and Swansea involved the company in capital investment and commitments of over £9 million. This sum was raised almost entirely by borrowing and the servicing of this borrowing has constituted a very heavy financial burden.</P>
    <P>These services however, have been operated on a profitable basis and the record shows their spectacular success. In 1966, 378,000 passengers were carried by the company.  The serious out-break of foot-and-mouth disease in Britain in 1967 contributed to a reduction in this figure to 306,000 in that year.  In 1968, when the first car-ferry was introduced, the number of passengers carried increased to 360,000.  This figure improved further to 480,000 in 1969 and 547,000 in 1970. The number of cars carried in 1968 was 43,000 rising to 78,000 in 1969 and 82,000 in 1970.  Although they only commenced car-ferry operations in 1968 the company now control 37½ per cent of this market.  I should add, perhaps, that these up-to-date vessels enabled the B &amp; I to pioneer the roll-on/roll-off type of freight facility in this country.  Now they are the only Irish operator of this type of service which is increasing in popularity.  In 1968 they carried 5,157 wheeled-transport units, increasing to 14,300 units and 24,120 units in 1969 and 1970 respectively.  These figures represent an estimated 30,000 tons, 90,000 tons and 140,000 tons of freight in each of the three years 1968, 1969 and 1970 respectively.</P>
    <P>In earlier years livestock traffic had been one of the main and most profitable activities of the B &amp; I.  Over <Col N="1171" /> recent years, however, this position has altered substantially.  British Rail decided in 1968 to concentrate their declining stock of cattle wagons at Holyhead and were no longer able to guarantee an adequate supply of rail wagons at Birkenhead.  This, and the preference of shippers for onward transport by rail in Britain, resulted in a fall-off in the numbers of cattle shipped by the B &amp; I.  Where, in 1966, the company had carried 176,000 head of cattle to Birkenhead, in 1969 they carried only 49,000 and none at all in 1970.  In the years 1968 and 1969 they lost £376,000 on this traffic.  A further factor was the announcement by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, which controls Birkenhead, that livestock facilities at that port would be closed down if the port were not guaranteed an annual throughput of 200,000 head of cattle and an annual income of £103,000.</P>
    <P>The likelihood that Birkenhead would no longer be available for Irish cattle obliged the B &amp; I Company and British Rail to re-examine their entire position, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the livestock services. There was a serious danger that the B &amp; I would be forced out of this trade entirely, leaving British Rail with a virtual monopoly of a sector of shipping of vital national interest. After prolonged negotiation between the B &amp; I and British Rail, agreement was reached last year on a proposal, which had the approval of the livestock trade, to operate joint livestock services through a consortium. The agreement provided that the two companies would provide ships to a common pool and for the operation of regular scheduled services to Holyhead, for cattle requiring onward transport by rail, and to Heysham, for cattle destined for onward transport by road.  The consortium is under the control of a management board, consisting of representatives of the two shipping companies and of the livestock trade.  The new management board will determine rates and negotiate on any proposed increases with the Irish Livestock Exporters' and Traders' Association.  Any such increases will be related strictly to new <Col N="1172" /> factors, such as increasing costs, and machinery will be established to relate rates to actual costs of operation.</P>
    <P>This agreement secures considerable benefits for shippers as well as for the B &amp; I.  For shippers, regular scheduled services are guaranteed for an initial period of five years with the possibility of extension for a further five-year period.  Shippers are also assured of reasonable stability in freight rates. Furthermore, for the first time, they have secured a voice in the cattle shipment business through their representatives on the management board.  For the B &amp; I, the agreement means elimination of their losses on livestock carryings and a continuing guarantee of participation in the cattle trade.  The agreement also recognised that the future of Birkenhead as an entry port for Irish cattle was in doubt.  This development was a cause, and not a result, of the inter-company agreement.</P>
    <P>The livestock trade recently made representations to me and to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries about the desirability of ensuring that Birkenhead should remain open to receive Irish cattle.  I arranged for officers of both Departments to discuss the matter with the trade whose views I conveyed to the consortium.  It must, however, be kept in mind that the question of the future of the livestock facilities at Birkenhead is one solely for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board.  What is essential, in the interests of the trade, is that there should be a guarantee of regular service between this country and Britain.</P>
    <P>The most difficult problem, financially and otherwise, which faced the company following the take-over was the declining profitability of their conventional cargo services and it was found essential to convert to containers and unit loads as rapidly as possible. By early 1969 all the company's cargo was being carried in specialised unit load ships.  B &amp; I are now market leaders in this field and account for 35 per cent of total freight movements in the cross-Channel trade.  To achieve the full economic benefits of containerisation, however, required the construction of automated terminals and the provision of cellular container <Col N="1173" /> vessels designed for automated handling of containers in conjunction with the terminals.  Because of the high level of dock labour which had been employed in the loading and unloading of the conventional vessels, the change-over to container vessels and the progressive approach to complete automation of loading and discharge involved heavy redundancy.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I have long recognised the need to deal with this problem and, in July, 1967, with British Rail and Bristol Seaway Ltd., initiated a survey of operations at the Dublin cross-Channel terminal with a view to formulating a charter for cross-Channel dock workers.  This survey culminated in the Murphy Report of May, 1968. However, even before this important report was made, the three companies had introduced an interim scheme of redundancy compensation payments, jointly operated and financed by themselves.</P>
    <P>Following completion of the survey, negotiations on the recommendations contained in the Murphy Report commenced, under the auspices of the Department of Labour, between the companies and the trade unions concerned. Arising from those negotiations, the first stage of implementation of the Murphy recommendations on redundancy was the introduction, in January, 1969, of the voluntary options scheme.  This replaced the interim scheme which had operated since 1967. Basically, both schemes provided for payment of a lump sum to a docker on his retirement, together with a weekly pension in the case of those dockers with the necessary qualifying years of service.  Depending on age and service, dockers can now qualify for lump sum payments up to a maximum of £1,500 and for pensions up to a maximum of £7 per week; 223 dockers who opted for retirement have benefited from the schemes to date.  This has resulted in a reduction in the number of dockers on the register from 446 in September, 1967, to the present day level of 223.  Negotiations with the unions are continuing on the full implementation of the Murphy Report proposals and it is hoped that agreement will be reached in the near future.  This <Col N="1174" /> will involve the B &amp; I Company in further heavy redundancy payments to their dockers.</P>
    <P>The company's full freight plan was estimated to cost £9 million and it had been hoped to find the necessary finance mainly by commercial borrowing and partly from internal resources including the disposal of redundant assets.  The company were also exploring, in the context of their freight plan, the possibility of reaching an understanding with British Rail, their principal competitor, on the rational long-term development of cargo services between Ireland and Britain which would exclude unnecessary duplication and, by being open to all container operators at standard rates, would avoid the dangers of monopoly.</P>
    <P>The company's development and the implementation of their plans have thus made excellent physical progress, but financial problems have arisen. Apart from the heavy losses sustained in livestock carryings, the company were involved in very heavy losses due to strikes at Liverpool in three successive years and to the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in 1967-68.  These, together with the maintenance strike in 1969 and the British dock strike in 1970, involved the company in losses estimated at nearly £700,000.  The disposal of their older vessels, particularly the passenger/cargo/cattle vessels, yielded nearly £1 million less than the figure at which they had been taken over.  This was due to premature obsolesence of their passenger/cargo/ cattle vessels because of the rapid development of specialised cargo, ferry and container vessels and also because newly adopted international fire safety regulations require costly modifications in their vessels which reduced their attractiveness to potential purchasers overseas.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1969 the B &amp; I found themselves at a crucial stage of their development.  Apart from the financial difficulties caused by unforeseen losses and the heavy drain on liquidity imposed by the servicing of substantial loan capital, the company found that British Rail had also committed themselves to a major programme of containerisation with new cellular container <Col N="1175" /> ships and automated terminals on the same lines as their own freight plan.  It was known that, in order to secure the volume of traffic necessary for economic operation of their new ships and terminals, British Rail aimed at securing a substantial increase in their share of the market.  The developing situation threatened to bring about a freight war in the cross-Channel trade which would wipe out small independent operators and involve the two major companies in over-investment and heavy losses which would eventually fall on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I reported this situation to me at the beginning of 1970.  They pointed out that in the absence of some agreement with British Rail they would have to face a period of very substantial losses until the growth in traffic would permit both companies to secure adequate traffic for economic operation.  The B &amp; I were also concerned that in a situation of unrestricted and uneconomic competition they should be supported by CIE who had developed container operations of their own on the Irish Sea in association with one of the other British nationalised transport companies.  CIE operated containers only and not ships and with their British partner aimed to ship containers through the cheapest services available.  In this very complex and rapidly changing situation I decided to engage specialised consultants to examine and clarify the issues arising.  I invited McKinsey &amp; Co., Inc., to undertake this task because of their special knowledge and experience in this field.  They had already carried out major studies for British Rail on which, <i>inter alia</i>, were based British Rail freight plans for the Irish Sea.  They were engaged in similar studies for the European Railways consortium.</P>
    <P>British Rail were kind enough to agree that McKinseys could use the same consultancy team that worked for them and could also use the data already supplied by British Rail.  As I announced at the time, the study aimed in the first instance at analysing operational methods, routes and scales of service and identifying and contrasting <Col N="1176" /> possible alternative policies for the Irish State-owned operators.  In the light of this part of the study, adoption and implementation of definitive commercial policies would be considered.  I made it clear that any measures recommended would have to be in accord with overall Government policy in relation to cross-Channel shipping which aims at ensuring efficient services at competitive rates for shippers, maintaining an equitable level of Irish participation in the trade, encouraging participation by private operators and excluding restrictive practices which are contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>In their first report to me McKinsey &amp; Co. found that both the B &amp; I and British Rail had each separately planned the most economic services for their own routes but that the total market for some years to come was not large enough for both the B &amp; I and British Rail to obtain the traffic levels on which their plans were based. There would thus be considerable over-capacity throughout the early 1970s.  Two separate Dublin terminals and too much ship capacity were being provided.  British Rail were preparing to improve their market share by cutting rates which could mainly be at the expense of the B &amp; I and B &amp; I would have to match these rates to stay in business.  Both companies would lose money which would ultimately have to be met by the taxpayers in Britain and Ireland.  McKinseys estimated that if the shipping operations of both companies were rationalised on lines recommended by them the two companies would be able to reduce their total shipping costs by over 12 per cent and achieve higher load factors. On the basis of the information available at the time of their report McKinseys estimated that there would also be a saving from operating to a joint terminal on a one-berth system at Dublin.  However, escalating costs have in the meantime eliminated any prospect of such saving; as separate berth operation is now cheaper, the companies intend to proceed on that basis but to set up a joint terminal operating company to control and manage the two berths as a unit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> At my request, McKinsey &amp; Co. communicated their report to British Rail also.  At subsequent meetings between British Rail and the B &amp; I, agreement in principle on rationalisation of shipping operations was reached, and settlement of the various operational and financial details leading to formal agreement is proceeding.  This will lead to substantial savings in both operational costs and capital costs in the purchase of equipment and ships as far as the two companies are concerned. These agreements should not only protect the companies against losses caused by the operation of excess capacity but ensure the provision of adequate services at the lowest real cost with consequent benefit to both exporters and importers.  On the other hand, the agreements do not constitute any kind of monopoly and will not provide unfair competition for independent operators of economic services on other routes.</P>
    <P>McKinsey &amp; Co., subsequently reported to me on the steps which might be taken towards the integration of the marketing operations of B &amp; I and CIE.  They envisaged the possible hiving-off of marketing by both concerns to a separate jointly managed undertaking which should enter into a partnership with a similarly representative British nationalised undertaking with safeguards against monopoly operation.  These recommendations have been under examination by the B &amp; I and CIE in consultation with the different British nationalised undertakings which would be concerned.</P>
    <P>Because of the distribution of functions among the British nationalised transport bodies concerned and their commercial relations with B &amp; I and CIE respectively, the proposal to establish a joint CIE/B &amp; I marketing organisation was not found to be practicable and its adoption could threaten the proposed agreement between B &amp; I and British Rail for rationalisation of ships and terminals and resurrect the threat of a rate war.  B &amp; I and CIE have now agreed, however, on marketing policies which will safeguard the efficient and economic operation of ships and terminals and provide for standard rates of charge for all users, <Col N="1178" /> public and private sector alike.  These objectives provide for separation of the operation of ships and terminals from the marketing and through-forwarding of containers.  B &amp; I (Freightway) will operate as a separate marketing and through-forwarding operator on both sides of the Irish sea.  CIE will continue in partnership with the companies of the National Freight Corporation in Britain as a second marketing and through-forwarding organisation using the ships and terminals of British Rail and B &amp; I or other nationalised shipping companies as appropriate.  The ships will be open to other through-forwarding operators and marketers of containers at the same standard rates. This arrangement, which is expected to be acceptable to the British partners, will ensure the most economic utilisation of the heavy investment in ships and terminals by British Rail and B &amp; I while avoiding monopoly and keeping rates at the lowest economic levels.  The proposed agreements and arrangements I have outlined should ensure the provision of satisfactory services at low cost for years to come while safeguarding the heavy public investment in the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>I took advantage of the availability of McKinseys to ask them to examine and report also on the financial structure and capital requirements of the B &amp; I.  They reported to me that the company are in need of extra capital; that too high a proportion of their existing capital is in the form of loans, the servicing of which causes an undue burden and that additional equity capital to meet the company's immediate financial needs should be provided by the State.  McKinseys consider that if this capital were made available and provided rationalisation was agreed with British Rail and was speedily implemented, the company would be in a more favourable position to operate successfully on a commercial and competitive basis.  They assessed the need for new equity capital at £3 million.  This would be required principally to meet the B &amp; I share of the cost of the new container terminal at Dublin, the cost of containers and other equipment and the buying out of the <Col N="1179" /> Coast Lines agreement.  McKinseys confirmed the B &amp; I viewpoint that the existing agency agreement with Coast Lines is now an anomaly.  The agency concept had become outmoded because of the company's vigorous marketing by their own personnel in Britain of a door-to-door service and because of the change-over from conventional vessels to car ferries and unit-load ships.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I in co-operation with the Holland/America Line inaugurated a twice-weekly container service at the end of April, 1971 linking the ports of Cork and Dublin with Rotterdam and Le Havre.  This co-operation between the two companies offers a comprehensive door-to-door container service to and from the mainland of Europe.  The service should prove a valuable asset to this country's continental trade especially now that we may be on the threshold of entry to EEC.</P>
    <P>While this Bill provides for the contribution of up to £3 million by the Minister for Finance for shares in the B &amp; I it is not contemplated that this new investment should be made all at once.  In present financial circumstances, it is not foreseen that more than a part of the equity required can be made available in the coming financial year.  The B &amp; I may, therefore, have to increase their borrowing for the time being and for this reason the Bill also provides that the Minister for Finance should be authorised to guarantee borrowings by the company. I should emphasise that the company have received no subsidies and no subsidy is provided for in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Since 1965 the whole structure of the company has been transformed.  The company now provide a fully integrated shipping and marketing service. Their passenger services have been remodelled by the introduction of three modern car-ferries signifying the company's new role in passenger transport and their full commitment to the development of tourism.  These vessels also enable the company to cater for the growing roll-on/roll-off freight traffic.  From the carriage of conventional loose-stow freight in obsolete <Col N="1180" /> vessels, the B &amp; I have developed to the position of offering through their marketing organisation a door-to-door unit-load service using cellular ships, automated terminals and freightliner trains.  Through their agency agreements with foreign container operators they can offer service not alone to Britain and the Continent but to North America and Australia.</P>
    <P>Mass-movement sea operations, coupled with an efficient inland network have produced improved services and operational economies for the company, the benefits of which continue to be passed on to shippers.</P>
    <P>It may be said that these achievements during the company's early development stage have not so far provided commercial profits.  However, the company's investments have now begun to pay off; the company made a profit in 1970.  It must also be realised in retrospect that the company were faced with an impossible task when they attempted to undertake so vast a programme of capital investment on borrowing alone in the face of rising costs, rapid changes in the commercial environment and a number of unforeseen difficulties which involved them in heavy losses.  I think it is enough to point out that when the company commenced operations in 1965 their fixed assets were valued at £1.2 million.  At the end of 1970 they were valued at £8 million.  Moreover, as I have explained, these changes brought about great benefit to the community and to shippers.  Whereas the average sea freight realisation per ton of cargo through the port of Dublin to the B &amp; I in 1966 amounted to 102s 7d in 1970 it amounted to 85s despite the inflationary increase in cost since then.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill to the House and I hope Dáil Éireann will join with me in congratulating the board, management and staff of the B &amp; I on the progress they have made since the newly-purchased company was entrusted to their care by the Oireachtas in 1965.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the Bill there are a few general observations very relevant to the Bill which <Col N="1181" /> I should like to make.  First, this Bill which asks Dáil Éireann to make certain financial provision for one of our State bodies, focuses attention once again on something to which I have referred on every occasion in the past year or two when State-sponsored bodies were discussed.  I refer to the present totally unsatisfactory situation which exists in regard to the public and Parliamentary accountability of State-sponsored bodies.  This Bill, like many others introduced here making financial provision for State-sponsored companies, involves the taxpayers in fairly heavy financial commitments. The Members of this House are asked to exercise judgment on and particularly the spokesmen for the different parties are expected to assess the performance of these companies and judge their worthiness or otherwise of additional State finances.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion&mdash;I think it was December&mdash;when the Minister introduced a somewhat similar Bill seeking £3 million for CIE, I made a point which is very relevant at present, that it is not good enough for the Minister or any other Minister concerned with State-sponsored bodies to come here and expect Members to assess the performance of these companies on the outline information in the Minister's brief and decide whether we should support additional financing for them. I have referred on many occasions, and I make no apology for doing so again, to the growing public dissatisfaction with the failure of the Government to implement some form of acceptable public accountability in regard to these State-sponsored bodies. I and my Party believe that the establishment of Parliamentary committees, as has been done in Britain, is the only logical way of ensuring a satisfactory relationship between Parliament and the State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the absence of these committees I feel the Minister for Transport and Power could be a good deal more helpful in present circumstances particularly in relation to a Bill of this nature which has highly technical implications.  It deals with a very complex, highly sophisticated organisation which demands expertise and <Col N="1182" /> knowledge well beyond the experience of most Members of Dáil Éireann.  The Minister could be more helpful in supplying some advance notes.  I want to say that when I did approach the Minister through his private secretary last Thursday when I realised this Bill was coming, he very kindly provided me with certain outline information for which I am very grateful.  I also want to acknowledge the fact that when I approached the B &amp; I Company on Thursday the doors were opened to me, the general manager in particular placed himself entirely at my disposal and they were prepared to facilitate me in every way.  The co-operation I have received from the B &amp; I Company in this respect is an entirely new experience as far as I am concerned in the case of State-sponsored bodies because many of them, in my experience, if they do not hold elected members of the Dáil in contempt, at least they resent any interference by them.  I believe that we have a duty to the people who sent us here and to the taxpayers to see to it as far as we can that the money voted by the Oireachtas for State-sponsored bodies is spent in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the second point I want to make is this: I believe this Bill is another instalment of the patch-work unco-ordinated transport legislation that we have been getting here over the past year or two. We have had Transport Bills of various kinds, the most recent of which liberalised road haulage; we have had Bills for CIE and Bills for air companies, but we have not got any indication from the Government of their intention to implement a national transport policy which many people have advocated strongly during the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>The need for an overall national transport plan is now a matter of urgency particularly in view of our present negotiations for membership of the EEC and the likelihood of our becoming members in the foreseeable future.  It is vitally important that the Government lose no time in producing a blueprint which would integrate and co-ordinate the various internal and external transport systems which <Col N="1183" /> operate in both the private and public sector.  In view of our total dependence on external trade we need a coherent pattern of transport development where order will prevail and stability can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to implement a plan which would ensure that all our transport resources are utilised in an optimum fashion.  The Minister admitted today that there has been unco-ordinated and overlapping development.  The classical example is the case of the B &amp; I and CIE. The Minister has had to call in McKinsey &amp; Co., in an endeavour to rationalise the situation which has developed between these two State bodies where the B &amp; I and CIE are in competition with one another.  If there had been some concept of national planning in relation to transport the present situation, which the consultants have been called in to unravel, need never have arisen.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the EEC debate last summer I dealt with the Common Market transport policy and its implications for this country and I said it was essential for the Government to formulate a national transport plan as a matter of urgency but the Minister apparently has not done anything about it.  Under the Common Market transport policy we will be compelled to formulate such a plan.  I do not know why this type of haphazard development has been allowed to take place particularly in the case of the B &amp; I and CIE.  Three cases where the Minister has had to call in McKinsey &amp; Co., have been mentioned today. They were brought in to rationalise the transportation of livestock in order to prevent a price war between the B &amp; I and British Rail.</P>
    <P>People involved in the transport industry have been calling for a national plan in recent months.  I have in front of me the statements made by the chairman of the B &amp; I and by Dr. Noel Whelan of CIE who both advocate the formulation of a national transport policy.  The Minister did not refer to it in his opening remarks but he should give us some indication of what Government thinking is in relation <Col N="1184" /> to the future development of our internal and external transport systems, particularly the steps which might be taken to ensure that there will be co-ordinated development of all our transport systems.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to correct the present imbalance between the equity and loan capital within the B &amp; I.  A rather unusual and, for the company, difficult situation has arisen in that loans now represent about two-thirds of the capital employed in the B &amp; I. This is a peculiar situation which has caused concern to the B &amp; I and has been referred to by the chairman of the B &amp; I in several annual reports. This Bill authorises the Minister to purchase an additional three million ordinary shares of the company of £1 each.  It empowers the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power, to guarantee borrowings by the company.</P>
    <P>This particular arrangement is a logical one and I see no objection to it, but I must refer to the fact that certain organisations and certain people have alleged that the financial arrangements envisaged in this Bill constitute a subsidy to the B &amp; I.  Representations were made to the Minister on this matter by some of the smaller operators, I am sure other Deputies received representations and memoranda in relation to this, but from the information I could gather I am satisfied that this particular provision is not in fact a subsidy.  The chairman of the B &amp; I, at paragraph 19 of his address to the annual general meeting on 15th April, 1971, said:</P>
    <P>This enabling Bill has been misrepresented as a subsidy of £3,000,000 to the company to off-set operating losses.  The audited account refutes the basis for this allegation.  We have never sought or received grants which were not in the normal course available to the private sector, nor have we applied for any form of subsidy. There is not, in any event, any legislation which permits the payment of a subsidy to the company.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the B &amp; I the purpose for which this Bill is designed could not be taken as constituting a subsidy <Col N="1185" /> to the company.  I understand McKinsey &amp; Co., have been called in again by the Minister to examine the financial structure of the B &amp; I.  They have recommended additional equity capital, which they assess at £3 million. I understand the new capital is required to meet the cost of the company's new container terminal at Dublin, the cost of containers and the cost of buying out the agency agreement between the company and Coast Lines Limited.</P>
    <P>In his speech&mdash;may I say his introductory speech was much more detailed and informative than usual?&mdash; the Minister dealt in detail with this question and referred to the McKinsey Report.  I am personally satisfied that this effort to restore a better balance in the finances of B &amp; I is necessary at this stage.  I do not think the company could carry on with projected capital development if they were entirely dependent on loan capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the many developments that have taken place since the company was acquired by the State.  There is no doubt at all, studying the annual reports of the company and looking at the whole picture in the last five or six years, that the performance of the B &amp; I Board has been a pretty impressive one.  In taking over this company, the new board took over what was a relatively antiquated shipping company with obsolete equipment and so forth.  They were confronted with the gigantic task of streamlining and modernising the company to bring it into line with developments by competitors and by shipping lines in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>The capital employed has risen from £2¼ million in 1966 to £8¾ million in 1970.  The turnover has almost doubled&mdash;from £4,328,066 to £7,900,000 in 1970.  The company took over a shipping organisation which, as I have said, were tied or shackled to traditional handling methods and obsolete practices.  In the last five or six years a virtual transformation has taken place.  There has been a drastic reorganisation and strengthening of the management structure.  The company have introduced car ferry services; <Col N="1186" /> they have phased out conventional continer services and have stabilised employment. They have developed new terminals and have taken some steps towards rationalisation of their livestock services to meet requirements.</P>
    <P>When taken over by the State the company received a mandate from the Minister to operate as a fully commercial concern.  I think a perusal of the annual reports of the company during the past five or six years must convince anybody that the B &amp; I board have fulfilled this mandate with reasonable satisfaction.  Perhaps the most important development yet by B &amp; I has been the introduction of the car ferry service.  This development has been a colossal contribution to the development and growth of tourism in this country in recent years.  The growth rate from the introduction of the car ferry traffic in the first two or three years was dramatic.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there was a falling off in 1970 and there are indications that there will be a falling off again in the current year.  Car ferries are very much tied up with the growth and development of the Irish tourist industry and therefore any falling off in this traffic must be viewed with alarm and every effort must be made to ascertain the causes for the decline.  No time should be lost in trying to introduce the necessary corrective measures.</P>
    <P>In 1968 the car ferry traffic showed a growth of 40 per cent, in 1969 there was a further growth of 24.4 per cent but in 1970 this had dropped to a growth of 3.2 per cent.  The prospects for 1970 have been subject to a good deal of controversy but there are indications that the drop will be to the tune of 15 per cent.  The Minister shakes his head.  Perhaps this is not the picture now.  I do not know but, rather than quibble about figures, I will say that there has been since 1969 a dramatic reduction of car ferry traffic to this country.  It is important not merely for the B &amp; I company but for everybody concerned with Irish tourism that an attempt should be made to analyse the factors that have contributed to this decline.  The usual reasons for the decline in tourism, particularly from <Col N="1187" /> Britain, will be trotted out to explain the falling off.  The position in Northern Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the <i>Sunday Press</i> of November, 1970. Unfortunately, I have not got the day. The article was written by the general manager of the B &amp; I Company.  If I may be permitted to speak further about this matter, I would point out that in that article the following observations are made:</P>
      <P>The growth of 40 per cent in 1968 and 24.4 per cent in 1969 augured well for the ferry operators, especially the B &amp; I Line who had just completed its £10 million capital investment programme.</P>
      <P>The sudden levelling off of this growth rate to a mere 3.2 per cent in 1970 is one of the major factors for the drop in tourism earnings.  While the B &amp; I can take some pleasure from the fact that they captured more than three-quarters of this 3.2 per cent growth, the generally depressed state of the market creates problems for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Minister say that the situation is not serious or does not merit special attention?  Various factors <Col N="1189" /> have been responsible for this levelling-off in the rate of growth of car ferry traffic.  I was going on to say, before the Minister interrupted me, that the usual obvious reasons have been trotted out, such as the troubles in the North of Ireland and so forth, but there is one very significant factor which, in my opinion, will be detrimental to the growth of car ferry traffic from Britain to this country and that is the difference in fares on the Irish Sea routes compared with the fares on the British-Continental routes. The Minister is aware of this difference. The cost to the British holiday-maker taking his car and his family on the ferry from Dover to Calais is much less than from Liverpool to Dublin.</P>
    <P>One of the factors enabling Continental car ferry operators to keep fares stabilised is the duty-free concessions on these trips.  Cross-Channel carriers are very conscious of this factor and representations have been or are being made to the Minister or, probably, to the Minister for Finance, in regard to the introduction of duty-free facilities on these routes.  Another factor that has affected the development of car ferry traffic from Britain has been the increase in the overseas spending allowance from £50 to £150 which means that the British holiday-maker has now a wide choice of Continental resorts. Whereas the spending allowance of £50 enabled him to have a holiday in Ireland, it would not take him very far on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when he is replying to the debate to give some indication of his views as to the reason for the colossal difference in the fares structure of the Irish car ferries operating on the Irish Sea as compared with those services operating between Britain and the Continent.  I should like him also to indicate his intention in relation to the introduction of duty-free facilities for those operating across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Despite the setbacks that have been encountered by the B &amp; I Company in car ferry operations, the overall picture has been highly satisfactory.  If the Minister had not anticipated what I was going to say, I would have referred <Col N="1190" /> earlier to the graphs which show an increase in the total number of passengers carried and the total number of cars.  However, whereas between 1967 and 1970 there was a dramatic increase, the indications for 1971 are that there is a definite levelling-off.  I believe there is tremendous scope for generating substantially greater car ferry traffic between Britain and this country.  It is noteworthy that, whereas the troubles in the North of Ireland have had an adverse effect on the Cork-Swansea route, they do not appear, from surveys that have been carried out, to have had the same effect on the Dublin-Liverpool and Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire routes operated by British Rail.  There appears to be a good explanation for this.  On analysis of the situation one finds that Liverpool and Holyhead have been serving the industrial midlands of Britain which have a high ethnic market, a high concentration of Irish people, and the greater part of this traffic is probably represented by Irish people returning home on holidays. Despite the apparent levelling-off in the growth rate of car ferry traffic and despite the difficulties that have been encounered, I believe there is tremendous hope of developing car ferry traffic.</P>
    <P>I want to make brief reference to a matter that I have been strongly advocating for a good while and about which I have castigated the shipping companies as well as the air companies. I refer to the failure of the shipping companies and the air companies, even Bord Fáilte and the Government, to introduce an attractive family package holiday for the vast Irish population in Great Britain.  I have been advocating this publicly for a long time both here and in Britain and I am pleased to acknowledge the fact that the B &amp; I company some months ago in the off season introduced a very attractive concession to Irish people to encourage them to travel home at weekends.  The fare was rockbottom, the larger the group travelling the greater the concession. This type of business should be encouraged.  As I have often pointed out, only 30 per cent of Irish born people in Great Britain come home once a year, many come home once every two years and a large number <Col N="1191" /> can only come home once every three or four years.  Therefore, there is scope here for the development of the car ferry traffic.  I hope the Minister will look into the question of the provision of duty-free facilities on the car ferries similar to those available on the Continental and British car ferries.</P>
    <P>One of the most dramatic developments in cross-Channel shipping has been the growth of the roll-on/roll-off traffic.  There has been a colossal growth in this particular type of traffic where trucks are driven on and deliveries effected at the other side.  This type of traffic will continue to grow.  More and more exporters are engaging in this particular type of traffic now, utilising the car ferries, and this makes the car ferry operation much more economic. I do not think the Minister gave any figures for this type of traffic.  Perhaps he might give figures for this in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give them in the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the recent link up between the B &amp; I and the Holland-America Line which opens up an entirely new service into the Continent of Europe.  This service has not been very long in operation but I understand the indications are that progress has been good and that there is considerable scope for developing it.  I think the service is called Iropa.  As far as I know it is confined to certain countries; it is limited to five or six continental countries, Holland, Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg or anywhere else by arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The B &amp; I line have made good progress on the car ferry development, the roll-on/roll-off service, containerisation and so forth but one thing has remained rather unsatisfactory, that is, the question of livestock transport. This has been a source of considerable worry to the people in the livestock trade, to farmers' organisations, to cattle exporters.  I am glad to note the recent establishment of a consortium and the efforts which have been made to provide a proper service on a long-term <Col N="1192" /> basis.  I understand difficulties are still being encountered and I sincerely hope that every effort will be made by the Minister to ensure that the farmers and the livestock exporters will have adequate shipping services to Britain.  I understand the big problem is that livestock export is a one-way traffic and this does not provide very great incentives for the provision of special ships to carry livestock because the ships return empty.  I do not know if the envisaged service will be adequate to cope with the growing needs of Irish cattle exporters but from what I have read and from what I can see I believe the provision of adequate shipping facilities for livestock is very important.  It is probably the most difficult task the Minister has to contend with at the present time.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the performance of the B &amp; I company.  A tribute should be paid to the board, to the management and to the staff of the company for the dramatic breakthrough they have made and particularly for the manner in which an old company with obsolete, outdated vessels and equipment has been transformed into a modern, forward-looking, well-equipped company.  I was greatly impressed by the way the company were prepared to facilitate a member of the Dáil and the fact that they were prepared to place all their cards on the table and to answer any question which was asked.  I wish the company well in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that there are two points which I think are a matter of pleasure and approval for everybody regardless of party.  The first is the fact that since the legislation of 1965 a publicly-owned company has now turned into a company in which the Irish people are participants in an ownership sense in the cross-Channel trade with Britain. The second thing which I think deserves to be said&mdash;it was said by the Minister and the Fine Gael speaker and I want to add my voice&mdash;is that the amount of organisational effort, initiative and great vigour which has been brought to the management of the B &amp; I is a source of pleasure to us all. <Col N="1193" /> It augurs well for the future and for the executive talent which exists in Ireland and is growing in quantity.</P>
      <P>Our party are particularly interested in the area of overlap between what was previously done by private enterprise&mdash;although it was not wholly private, nor at all enterprising&mdash;prior to the takeover and the position now. We are particularly interested in that area when something which was a matter of private profit giving a bad service is turned over to the public through the State.  The State must see that a proper service is provided for everybody.  There was a great shadow across our shipping arrangements with the UK.  A similar shadow lay across much of our relations with the UK. Until recent times the UK were the great maritime power of the world.  It was understandable that our cross-Channel services should have remained almost completely under the control of the UK.  They were significantly dominated by the UK.  The move to public Irish ownership was a very welcome one.</P>
      <P>Some facts revealed by the Minister are worrying.  For example, the coal industry in some countries has declined and is no longer profit-bearing for the owners.  The industry has become obsolete and unable to re-equip itself. In such circumstances the State is persuaded to buy out the owners for a generous sum.  It sometimes happens that the assets do not prove to be as valuable as expected.  This situation has occurred in the coal industry in many countries.  A similar situation occurred in the transport industry in many countries.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether this was another example of where the public had to bale out inefficient, incompetent private ownership and where through the money given and the nature of the service agreement with the Coast Lines Company we were more generous than we needed to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis in the shipping industry could have been forecast.  The growing difficulties of the companies which were unable to re-equip and modernise were quite obvious.  It is arguable, if the Irish people had not stepped in <Col N="1194" /> through the 1965 legislation, whether the Coast Lines would now possess anything whatever of the £3 million plus the service agreement which they got from the Irish people.  Perhaps I am being a little sharp about this matter. It is depressing that when we knew six years ago what the position was that a service agreement was given which has now to be bought out.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what extra money is needed for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The valuation of the ships is another point of great interest.  The Minister told us they were worth £1 million less.  The Minister commented on this point in his brief.  He said:</P>
    <P>The disposal of their older vessels, particularly the passenger/cargo/ cattle vessels, yielded nearly £1 million less than the figure at which they had been taken over.</P>
    <P>Two reasons are given for this.  The first reason was the rapid swing to containerisation, a mode of shipping which has been rapidly established by the B &amp; I.  This move could have been forecast.  The other point was the new international fire regulations, which were not drawn up suddenly.  The question of the obsolescence of the B &amp; I fleet and the new international fire regulations were both material considerations when a valuation was being made.</P>
    <P>It is depressing that this overestimation of the value of the ships could have been made.  The people bought three passenger/cargo/cattle vessels, six cargo/cattle vessels, some property and almost £¾ million of liquid assets.  They paid £3.5 million for these assets.  If the value of the liquid assets and of the properties is taken from the purchase price something over £2 million is left as the value of the ships.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with this point.  That £2 million turned out to be £1 million too much.  That is 100 per cent too much.  I can understand an expert being 10 per cent or 20 per cent wrong, plus or minus, but an over-valuation of 100 per cent, if that is the correct figure, is worrying when one is dealing with public money.  It is worrying when the 100 per cent error is against the interests of the people and in favour of the interests of the private owners.  This <Col N="1195" /> is a repetition of the classic pattern which we saw with railways, coalmines, waterworks or any utilities.  The public must have these utilities and maintain them.  The public buy them from the private owners when they cease to be profitable.  The high price paid to the private ownership is used as an argument against nationalisation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative in acquiring the shipping line.  I welcome also the vigour of the management.  I would like to add my voice to that of Deputy O'Donnell who dealt with the lack of planning in transport.  Transport is important everywhere as industrialisation grows and exports increase.  Our country is an island and our economy is a very open one.  We are dependent to a large extent on our exports and a coherent transport policy is very important to us.  If we are to enter the EEC this matter will strike us very acutely.  We would appear to be the weakest, smallest, slowest-growing of all the economies.  We will need careful protection in regard to freight rates and efficiency in order to keep our industries competitive and to make our tourist industry competitive.  It is no use saying that the State does not approve of doing such a thing.</P>
    <P>The odd thing is that, while the Fianna Fáil Party, during the whole of their life, have made slightly frightened noises about socialism&mdash;at least they pretended to be slightly frightened when elections were pending&mdash;have been willing to implement policies in regard to transport and other State sectors which are very largely socialist. We in the Labour Party welcome some aspects of this, not all aspects, and those we do not welcome I shall come to in a moment.</P>
    <P>The State has gone so profoundly into transport&mdash;CIE, Aer Lingus, B &amp; I &mdash;that there is very little left.  Seeing that we have no inhibitions in regard to public ownership, how can we have any inhibitions, if we have any sense at all, about a coherent plan for putting those publicly owned bits together?  I am trying not to carp on this&mdash;there are so many things about B &amp; I of which to be proud&mdash;but there <Col N="1196" /> is a bit of evidence of CIE and B &amp; I crossing each other's lines.  They are publicly-owned companies and surely the need to give our planners some sort of really good hard guideline to go on is now overwhelming.  Surely everything that Deputy O'Donnell said about this is well-founded.  I would simply like to add my own personal voice and that of the Labour Party to the plea that he made for a coherent transport plan.</P>
    <P>Some of the difficulties that have arisen were, perhaps, unforeseeable. One is not very certain of this.  The dedication to private enterprise of the Heath Government and their intransigence in aiding the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board has been partly responsible for the difficulties of that authority.  This is a difficulty in regard to Birkenhead.  However, let me say this, as somebody with no direct interest in transport but with an interest at the livestock production end, I know there are commercial interests who often in the past have been parasitic on the Irish cattle trade and who may be acutely angered or concerned about where the cattle go.  Speaking as someone fairly close to the outlook of the people who produce the cattle I can assure the Minister, if he has any worries in that regard, that Irish farmers do not care how their cattle get to Britain provided the price is right and that it is done efficiently and quickly.</P>
    <P>In regard to the agreements we have had with the nationalised British companies, I would like to ask what slice of the cake we are getting.  The Minister talked about agreements with the UK authorities in two contexts, that of containerisation and the cattle trade. Have we what is, in the Minister's opinion, a reasonable influence in the shared arrangement?  British Rail, as it was emerging prior to the beginning of 1970, is an indication that while we in the Labour Party might wish for or expect large British companies, be they public or private to behave a little better towards this country, in fact they do not; we can expect total ruthlessness and the pursuance of British national interests in the activities <Col N="1197" /> of these companies.  It is up to us to fight as hard as we can in return. It is also up to us, as the public, to support quite consciously and specifically the companies in which our nation has an interest.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make, which comes to the heart of the matter of the public companies, is about the conditions in which we can wholeheartedly approve of the expenditure of public funds in a way such as is suggested by this Bill.  First, we have no objection in principle and, secondly, we have a sense of pride, which we share with others, in the vigour and the energy with which the B &amp; I company has been transformed.  However, we are very concerned with the form of relationships which are worked out when public moneys are used to purchase and subsequently totally control companies such as the B &amp; I.  We have the circumstance that bodies like Bord na Móna or CIE are held up as an example of how awful public ownership is.  This is not an opinion with which we concur.  We are convinced that when a Minister comes to the House looking for public money for a purpose such as this, which in general we approve, we are entitled on behalf of the people, who in the end are paying the piper and, therefore, entitled to call the tune, to demand that public companies, in this case B &amp; I, should set up different, more enlightened and more humane labour relations.  This should apply not only to labour relations but to structure of management as well.  We object profoundly to the idea that public money can be floated and used to support companies which are either very bad employers&mdash;and I am not making that particular charge in this instance as I could in the case of other State companies which I do not intend to discuss now&mdash;or else extremely old-fashioned and autocratic in their management and structure.</P>
    <P>This is the irony of McKinseys in this context, that here they are, employed by a major British nationalised transport company and, simultaneously, interestingly, employed by an Irish publicly-owned transport company, and coming, of course, from the United States having got their business <Col N="1198" /> training in an atmosphere profoundly contemptuous of public ownership but making recommendations which both the British and the Irish seem disposed to accept.  We believe that as the operation of any industry, particularly a bit of the transport industry like this, evolves, the people working in it at all levels will only work with vigour, with efficiency, with a willingness to innovate, precisely to the extent they feel part of it, committed to it.  They will only feel that if they are no longer, as the ruthless old expression has it &ldquo;hands&rdquo;.  That is what they used to be.  They will no longer accept being &ldquo;hands&rdquo;; they want to be total human beings with a sense of participation.  Not, indeed, that this makes us hostile to the most sophisticated expertise in the management of a company, but you must have a structure which is a democratic one, an evolving one, which is a workshop in which you develop the sort of worker participation, the sort of industrial relations, which can get over the current problems of alienation and in-difference, and the current problems that mark labour relations all over the world practically.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while approving of the general intent here, I should like to express my worries as to whether public moneys were expended to bale out a company that is inefficient and bankrupt and which in other circumstances would have been permitted to pay the price of its inefficiency, which would have been bankruptcy in a short time, and whether we paid too much.</P>
    <P>Secondly, apart from the whole evolution of the thinking of the Government party in regard to the control of public companies and semi-State bodies&mdash;even if they are prepared to do nothing about it at this stage I want to record my objection and, perhaps, hear the Minister's comments&mdash;I should like to think that now when the Minister is asking for public funds there is an opportunity to explain that structures are being evolved in regard to management, worker participation and labour relations which will be in keeping with the decade we are living in, and also be in keeping with the fact that ultimately all the people, and <Col N="1199" /> disproportionately the poorest people through the present taxation system, are being asked to cough up the money.</P>
    <P>If one wants to play pure old-fashioned <i>laissez-faire</i> capitalism then one can say: &ldquo;Bash the workers&rdquo; but if the Government have to say to the workers: &ldquo;We want £3 million for this&rdquo; then they owe them something in terms of a structure of management, of participation, and a humanity and modernity in labour relations that will make this both an efficient place to work in and a happy place to work in, a place that will evolve and have a highly sophisticated and skilled labour force which can deal with what we know is the beginning of a transport revolution and not the end of one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to take up the last point made by Deputy Keating that is, the importance of our State-sponsored organisations setting a headline in regard to proper management structures and labour relations generally.  That has been my desire since I became Minister for Transport and Power.  Even though the policy of bringing in consultants has been open to certain obvious trite criticisms&mdash;it is easy enough to attack the whole notion of bringing in consultants to examine State-sponsored organisations&mdash;I have brought them into a number of our State bodies in the past two years.  At the moment they are working in CIE.  They have made a very thorough investigation into the whole structure of the B &amp; I as it impinges on British Rail and other nationalised British transport undertakings and in relation to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other consultants are advising me on matters of tourism and other matters concerning the internal arrangements of other State bodies.  A very successful result has been the investigation carried out by McKinseys into the ESB which caused a complete change in the whole structure of the ESB.  The wrong nature of the management structure there, in my view, was a contributory cause to the labour problems that have arisen over <Col N="1200" /> the years in the ESB.  Since the adoption of the McKinsey recommendations in regard to a complete revamping of the management structure, not just at the top but going right down to the bottom rung of the ESB management arrangements, we have found that the greater delegation of responsibility in accordance with proper management organisation recommended by McKinsey has resulted in a very definite improvement in the morale of that organisation.  The objective I had in bringing McKinsey into this particular transport problem was to unravel a very complex transport knot.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Keating raised the question of having a national transport plan.  I am all for rationalisation of administration generally but the evolution of a national transport plan <i>per se</i> is, with respect, a rather trite phrase when you consider the tremendous international complications involved.  We are not our own masters, as it were, in regard to the immediate blue-printing of a national transport plan.  The tackling of the very complex inter-relationship between B &amp; I and CIE and the various transport undertakings in Britain and the need also for a tie-up between the B &amp; I and Holland-America, or some other Continental line, involved a very complex investigation by McKinsey &amp; Company and very complex negotiations with other undertakings in other countries.  One just could not have a blue-print plan and decide that this will be it.  As in any such negotiations and inter-relationships, one is very dependent on how far one can go and how much one can get.</P>
    <P>All I am saying is that as a result of the investigations by McKinsey we have reached certain very important decisions which will be of very real benefit to the future of transport across the Irish Sea and into Europe.  I was concerned about the situation that was developing at the start of 1970 when plans being undertaken by British Rail and B &amp; I would involve considerable duplication in regard to terminal expenditure, shipping expenditure and equipment expenditure.  That situation <Col N="1201" /> would also lead to a duplication of operating costs and to a freight war across the Irish Sea which would involve the taxpayers in both countries in fruitless expense.  McKinsey &amp; Company have unravelled that knot and agreement has been reached in principle, details of which will be announced very shortly and British Rail and B &amp; I are now proposing to co-operate in regard to managing shared terminals at Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, what I am saying is that this is what they are doing.  It is transport planning and I am not calling it by any pretentious name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is planning in a haphazard way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should listen to me.  We have got British Rail and CIE and B &amp; I together to share the capital cost. Otherwise there would have been considerable expense on the taxpayers on both sides of the Irish Sea.  A management organisation has now been established to share the terminals that are being constructed.  In the future ships will be shared across the Irish Sea which will maximise shipping capacity and result in a cut down in duplicated expenditure by the two State organisations on redundant or unnecessary shipping space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sort of money involved in this sharing, at first glance, on present costs, would be in the region of £2 million: I am talking about capital sharing in regard to terminals and ships.  With the escalation of this sort of capital expenditure, if the matter were allowed to get out of hand and develop into a rival freight war between the two organisations, the cost in capital terms would be twice that, and the cost in operating expenses would probably eventually bankrupt B &amp; I.  However, we have avoided that due to the agreement that has been reached by the two organisations and the shared <Col N="1202" /> arrangements in regard to the utilisation of equipment, terminals, facilities and ships.  While competing in the operating sense, and competing for business in the marketing sense, and while preserving two separate marketing organisations that will compete for customers, the facilities available will be shared and thereby both capital and operating costs will be reduced.  In my view this makes very good sense.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I and CIE, as the two organisations at home engaged in container traffic across the Irish Sea, have come together again in regard to the sharing of ship space which each utilises across the Irish Sea and in regard to sharing the facilities here at home.  They will continue as two separate selling organisations, two separate marketing organisations. The CIE tie-up on the other side of the Irish Sea is with a different organisation, the National Freight Corporation which is separate from British Rail.  This is what I meant when I said initially that one cannot devise an ideal national transport plan in isolation from the complications which exist on the other side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Successive British Governments have so far failed to unravel the whole field of public enterprise which is highly complex in that at the present time there are in Britain six different public enterprise organisations to cater for land and sea transportation.  CIE have a tie-up with one of them; B &amp; I now are achieving a tie-up with British Railways.  Pending the British working out their problems of rationalisation in the field of public enterprise transport we cannot decide on an ideal situation, which would be a total coming together of B &amp; I and CIE.  CIE have always been lined up with the National Freight Corporation and B &amp; I are proposing to tie-up with Brtish Railways, a separate corporation. Therefore, having regard to the situation obtaining on the other side of the Irish Sea, B &amp; I and CIE will continue on separate selling programmes so far as their freight facilities entail but at home they will share the facilities and shipping space.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the importance of the new arrangement between <Col N="1203" /> B &amp; I and the Holland-America Line. This is important because it secures direct freight shipping facilities between Ireland and Europe and it is of particular importance in view of our pending entry into the EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a further extension proposed to include transatlantic and Australian traffic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only talking about regular sailings but it is open to have such arrangements to Australia and America by the new company. The Holland-America Line is an international line but I am thinking in terms of the importance of ensuring immediate and regular shipments between Ireland and the Continent. This is most important having regard to the difficulties experienced last year with the disappearance of Hibernian Transport.  As the Deputy has mentioned, this means we are open for similar arrangements in other parts of the world, but the important matter to be secured was regular freight shipments between continental ports and Ireland.  This has been secured with the development of the joint Holland-America and B &amp; I shipping operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to a national transport plan, while I am in favour of planning and rationalisation, I am not in favour of blueprinting in such a flexible area as international transport.  Its flexibility has been emphasised by a point made by Deputy Keating in regard to the diminution in value of ships purchased in 1965 when the B &amp; I line was taken over by the State and we had to pay for the existing assets.  There is no question but that the ships were anything but an asset in the sense that everything changed almost overnight after the purchase of the B &amp; I operation by the State in 1965.  Almost immediately there was a situation where containerisation developed, exports of livestock diminished substantially, roll-on/roll-off traffic began to predominate and within a year or two of the purchase of the B &amp; I line ships that were valued in the context of shipping in 1964 and 1965 had to be sold at substantially less because of the complete <Col N="1204" /> revolution in shipping methods.  Completely new equipment had to be purchased at a substantial capital cost.</P>
    <P>I mention this point as an example of the flexibility we must have in regard to transportation problems.  The moneys involved for re-equipment and operating costs are substantial and this trend is likely to continue.  Therefore, it is impossible to have a rigid blue-print for a transportation policy&mdash;one is dependent on international factors and the complexities of international transport organisations.  They are particularly complex in Great Britain, our chief customer, and the area with which our cross-Channel transportation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Through these three companies&mdash; B &amp; I, Irish Shipping and CIE&mdash;the State will ensure effective Irish participation in freight transportation outside this country.  The most relevant such participation is the B &amp; I because of its direct total involvement in shipping to our main customer, Great Britain, and the most important State involvement is the involvement in B &amp; I.  It is important that we maintain these organisations in a sufficiently strong financial position so that they will have a stake in any arrangements that are made with British Rail or with any other State or private transportation system in Britain, with any transportation organisation such as Holland-America, or any organisation in Australia or elsewhere.  We must maintain our organisations in such a position that they can enter any such tie-up in a sufficiently strong way to ensure that Irish interests are protected.  In order to do that it is necessary to strengthen the management of the companies and to ensure that the Minister for Transport and Power maintains constant supervision of the operations of the organisations concerned with land and sea transport.  They are diverse and complex and any overall transport plan would need to be flexible because of the day-to-day changes, the ebb and flow of thought and execution of policy in this complex sector.</P>
    <P>I thought the best approach was to hire the best consultants available with a view to ensuring that a picture would emerge that would show us the way ahead.  As far as the other organisations <Col N="1205" /> in Britain and on the Continent are concerned, with which our organisations are associated, there must be the maximum degree of rationalisation commensurate with efficient selling, which will result in distribution costs being kept as low as possible from the point of view of both the exporter and the importer.  The McKinsey approach is the best approach: as far as possible, share facilities, share proposed capital investment, make maximum use of the expenditure of all moneys in both operating costs and capital expenditure, share to the greatest possible extent in this particular field and, at the same time, keep separate and competing the actual selling sectors.  In broad outline this is the basic principle. That is the way I see it operating and we have taken the necessary steps to achieve this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made a comparison between this Bill and the Bill that was before the House in regard to CIE.  There is no valid comparison. The measure passed six months ago was designed to give a straight grant from the Exchequer to meet the running cost deficits of CIE.  This is an entirely different matter.  It is an equity investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it gives an equity investment and the B &amp; I has very rapidly, having taken over an obsolescent organisation in 1965, put itself into a profit-making position.  It has done this at tremendous capital cost, a capital cost which has resulted in an imbalance between loan capital and ordinary share capital investment. This is an investment by the State.  This year the investment will be of the order of £3 million.  This is an investment by the State in a profit-making organisation, an organisation which had a trading profit of over £1 million in the year ended 31st December, 1970.  That was more than double the trading profit in 1969.  All the graphs are rising graphs.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the percentage increase last year may not have been as high as it was the previous year, but the overall graph shows an upward trend.  In 1965 the <Col N="1206" /> base was practically zero.  In those circumstances increases in the first years of operation will naturally be of a very dramatic character and must inevitably level off to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The spiral will be dramatic for two years and then it levels off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point. I do not mention this in any complacent spirit.  There are problems in regard to the car ferry business.  We need a great deal more of it.  Duty free facilities have been recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will see the validity of that recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I see the validity in the context of improving the attractiveness of the car ferry service.  In 1967 we had no cars coming across.  It was only in 1968 that the system was fully inaugurated and that accounts for the very dramatic increase in 1968 and 1969.  The increase in 1970 and the projected increase for this year are not of the same dramatic proportions.  We must make the facilities much more attractive.  The graph is still rising.  In 1969 the number of cars was 78,000; in 1970 it was 82,000 and the projected figure this year is 89,000.  The service is now obviously in a far more competitive situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>A more competitive situation plus unforeseen adverse factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The observations and recommendations in regard to the provision of duty free facilities on ships and aeroplanes are being examined at the moment.  The idea is certainly very attractive.  It is one with which I would be in full accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said that the reason fares are being stabilised on British and continental routes is that the income from duty free facilities enables the companies to stabilise fares. If we do the same thing it should <Col N="1207" /> lead to stabilisation also or, perhaps, even to a reduction in fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one factor. It might also mean a great deal from the point of view of the Exchequer because, if there was more business, that would offset any loss in revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be an added attraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about that.  The report has just come to hand.  The Deputy pointed out that the chairman of the B &amp; I company made some remarks about this some months ago.  The report is being examined at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is confusion about the livestock consortium.  Is it reasonable to assume that a satisfactory solution will be reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This, again, is a matter of co-ordination between the two big shipping companies.  The consortium is representative of the Cattle Exporters' Association, the B &amp; I and British Railways.  Their purpose is to ensure a link up by road with Heysham and by sea with Holyhead where road facilities are available. This does not take from any efforts made by any other private groups.  A few such groups have operated successfully the transhipment of live cattle across the Irish Sea on occasion to Birkenhead and other ports.  There is nothing to preclude such enterprise continuing.  We are concerned in maintaining a basic link in which the State will have some participation through the B &amp; I in conjunction with the other State organisations between here and two landing points in Britain, by road and rail.  This does not take from private enterprise in this respect. There have been a number of successful private enterprise developments in regard to these and other ports; but the importance of the consortium is that, if the various private enterprise operations are suspended for a while, or if they terminate as has happened in a number of cases in the past, in the last analysis there will be a basic link <Col N="1208" /> on behalf of our community with Britain for our cattle exporters.  This is fundamental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very difficult problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but it is essential to preserve this link.  We are guaranteed it for the next five years, with further discussions as to the terms for the following five year period.  This does not or has not prevented private operators from making their own arrangements in Birkenhead, Glasgow or any other port in England, Scotland or Wales where they may wish to land. By that there is no guarantee of security so far as the Irish farmer or Irish livestock exporter is concerned. Such a private operation may bring a very good deal for a period&mdash;this has happened&mdash;but what the community here must have is definite security for the shipper so that, come what may, the shipping link will be maintained. This is achieved by means of the consortium even though many cattle are being exported by other enterprising shippers through other routes at present and this is also a very valuable contribution and is no harm.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that I am very thankful to the House for the contributions made by both Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Keating.  The spirit and policy adumbrated in this Bill is, in fact, planning and rationalisation as far as we can go.  I emphasise that point in view of Deputy O'Donnell's introductory remarks.  In effect, this is planning and the whole business of hiring consultants to ensure that rationalisation takes place is an example of planning on a national scale in the knowledge that whatever planning we do must be done by arrangement with other operators in other countries with whom we must bargain and deal to achieve all we can by way of Irish participation in such planning and rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure a two-fold practical arrangement whereby £3 million may be taken up by the Minister for Finance, not as subsidy, but as an additional investment of £3 million ordinary shares of <Col N="1209" /> £1 each in this profit making company. This investment can be made by the State with confidence having regard to the revolutionary changes made by the company in the past six years.  These changes have resulted in doubling their trading profit in 1970 compared with 1969 in a period in which there was total re-equipment as regards ships and facilities and also in a period of revolutionary change in the whole shipping industry.  The company had to change completely its whole <i>modus operandi</i> in the shipping of freight and passengers across the Irish Sea.  In that situation over the past six years the company have proved themselves worthy of this type of investment by the State which will take the practical form of an investment of £1.3 million of equity in the current year designed to ensure a better balance between loan and equity capital in future.</P>
    <P>The loan capital invested is also fully secured.  Also, under this Bill the Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power, guarantee borrowings by the company that may be required in the future.  This all adds up to a very healthy financial situation fraught with considerable problems now and in the time ahead but these problems are being tackled by means of the rationalisation of which I have spoken.  In the circumstances I commend the Bill to the House as one enabling the Government to make the investment required in a company such as this in the confidence that it will be a worthwhile investment on behalf of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee and the Strabane and Letterkenny Railway Company and for the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the undertakings to CIE.  An important feature of the Bill and one which I will deal with in more detail later is the provision for payment of compensation by the Exchequer to holders of baronial guaranteed shares in the Strabane Company in consequence of the proposed dissolution of the company.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains a number of provisions dealing with measures to improve safety on the railways, the transfer of responsibility for maintenance of road surfaces on overline bridges to local authorities, toll charges at Fiddown Bridge, County Kilkenny, the handling of claims for redundancy compensation under the Transport Acts and with other miscellaneous matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Donegal Railways Joint Committee operates road passenger and freight services in the southern part of County Donegal.  Prior to 1st <Col N="1211" /> January, 1960, when the lines were closed, the joint committee operated rail services on its own lines and on the railway line between Strabane and Letterkenny which was owned by the Strabane Company, in which the joint committee holds a majority interest.</P>
    <P>The joint committee is owned in equal shares by the Great Northern Railway Board and the British Railways Board.  Since 1964, however, the GNR Board's interest in the undertaking has, for all practical purposes, been represented by CIE.  British Railways have for many years been anxious to sever their connection with the joint committee and the Government decided in 1961 that CIE should take over the road transport business of the joint committee and should enter into negotiations with British Railways with a view to arriving at a basis for a financial settlement.  These negotiations, which were protracted, culminated in CIE signing an agreement with British Railways on 31st May, 1967, the text of which is scheduled to this Bill, whereby, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation confirming the agreement and payment of the sum of £57,742 by CIE to British Railways, the rights and obligations of British Railways in the joint committee and in the Strabane Company would be transferred to CIE.  Pending enactment of the necessary legislation CIE have taken over British Railways' interest in the joint committee and in the Strabane Company.  The board had, in fact, taken over management of the undertaking since 1st January, 1966.</P>
    <P>To give full effect to the Government decision that CIE should take over the road transport business of the joint committee, CIE also entered into an agreement with the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company&mdash; successors to the Ulster Transport Authority&mdash;under which, subject to payment by CIE of a net sum of £3,449, the assets and liabilities of the GNR Board in respect of the joint committee and the Strabane Company would be transferred to CIE.  This agreement, which was made in pursuance of the provisions of the agreement <Col N="1212" /> scheduled to the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, was formally approved by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Development on 21st March, 1969, and by my predecessor on 3rd April, 1969.</P>
    <P>The terms of the financial settlements with British Railways and the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company were based on a valuation of the assets of the joint committee and took account of anticipated continuing annual losses on the operation of the Joint Committee's road transport services. No payment was made in respect of goodwill.  Things have turned out better than expected, however, and I am glad to be able to say that the Joint Committee's undertaking is now operating at a profit.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms the financial settlement between CIE and British Railways and provides for the transfer to CIE, with effect from a date which I shall fix by order, of the assets and liabilities of the joint committee and of the Strabane Company, excluding any liabilities of the latter company in respect of its baronial guaranteed shares.  CIE will continue to provide the road transport services, both passenger and freight, which are being provided at present by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>All staff employed by the joint committee immediately before the transfer date will become CIE staff.  There are in all about 100 staff involved, of whom 81 are permanent staff.  The Strabane company have no employees.  I am taking this opportunity to assure the House that no member of the joint committee's staff will be disemployed as a result of the transfer of the CDR undertaking to CIE.  It may be found necessary, however, to transfer some clerical staff to CIE locations outside County Donegal, but transfers of other staff are not at present envisaged; the necessity for such transfers at some future date cannot, however, be ruled out.  Transfers of CDR staff will be covered by the same arrangements applicable to CIE staff and there will be full consultation between CIE and the trade unions in advance of any such transfers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> Provision is made in the Bill for the preservation of the pension rights of existing and former salaried employees of the joint committee who are members of the British Railway clearing system superannuation fund.  These particular staff are being seconded to CIE pending completion of arrangements which are at present being made by CIE to set up a separate fund, with an appropriate share of the assets of the British fund, to which members of the fund in this part of the country, including CDR staff, will be transferred. This will require legislation both here and in Britain in due course.  Until these arrangements have been completed it will be necessary to keep the joint committee nominally in existence.</P>
    <P>On being transferred to CIE, members of the CDR regular wages grade staff aged between 21 and 50 years will automatically become members of the CIE wages grade pension scheme. The position of employees who are ineligible for membership of this scheme because they are over age will have to be examined by CIE in consultation with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Strabane company, in which the joint committee holds all the debenture stock and 87 per cent of the share capital.  The remaining shares, which are privately held, include baronial guaranteed shares with a face value of £17,510 and 148 ordinary shares which are not guaranteed.  Payment of dividend at the rate of 4 per cent per annum on the baronial guaranteed shares was guaranteed, under statute, by Donegal County Council and by Letterkenny Urban District Council. These guarantees involved the county council and the urban district council in annual payments of £640 and £60 respectively, but following the termination of the joint committee's rail services on 1st January, 1960, the two local authorities discontinued their payments on the grounds that they had been advised that they ceased to be liable for these payments when the railway ceased to operate.  The Strabane company, on the other hand, was advised that the liability of the local <Col N="1214" /> authorities continued.  Apart from 1960, when the Strabane company paid the dividend in anticipation of a settlement of the dispute, no dividend has since been paid to the holders of the baronial guaranteed shares.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the guarantees on the baronial guaranteed shares were given to the Strabane company, not to the shareholders, and as such these guarantees would become unenforceable on dissolution of the company. Further, the financial position of the Strabane company is such that there would be no assets available, on a winding up, to make any payments to unsecured shareholders, whether guaranteed as to dividend or not.  All the available assets of the company would be claimed by the joint committee, which have priority rights as holder of the company's debenture stock.</P>
    <P>In considering this aspect of the matter, the Government were conscious of the fact that in the reorganisation and writing down of the capital of railway companies guaranteed shareholders have generally been treated with some consideration.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, the Government decided that the holders of the baronial guarantee shares should receive compensation from the Exchequer on the dissolution of the Strabane company.  The amount of money involved was relatively small&mdash; the total cost to the Exchequer is about £14,500&mdash;and the baronial guaranteed shareholders were, after all, the innocent victims of changing circumstances. Section 13 of the Bill provides that CIE shall, within two months of the transfer date, pay to each guaranteed shareholder such amount which, if invested in Government securities, would produce the same amount in interest as he would receive if dividends were being paid on the baronial guaranteed shares.  Section 13 also provides for payment of the arrears of dividend on these shares with effect from 1st January, 1961.</P>
    <P>The amalgamation of the joint committee's undertaking with CIE is a logical development.  The Bill puts a statutory seal on the practical arrangements already made for the transfer of <Col N="1215" /> the CDR undertaking to CIE and provides for continuity of the road transport services already operated by the joint committee.  It is very satisfactory to be able to record that CIE are taking over an efficient and profitable unit and I hope that this will continue to be the position.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to carry out some desirable amendments of transport legislation to improve safety on the railways and to deal with some other miscellaneous matters.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill provides for the substitution of automatic controls for gates at level crossings at which CIE have no statutory obligation to provide attendance, although in some cases attendance is provided.  These are level crossings on roads which were not public roads at the time the railway was built but have since been taken in charge by the road authorities concerned.  CIE's statutory responsibility is confined to maintaining gates on either side of the railway and it is the responsibility of users to open and close the gates.</P>
    <P>There are over 70 such public crossings and some of them carry a considerable volume of traffic.  Where no attendance is provided by CIE, the gates are more often than not left open by users of the crossings, thus creating a serious hazard for both road and rail traffic.  There has been a number of fatal accidents at these crossings and the question of improving safety arrangements has been under consideration by a working group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Local Government and CIE.</P>
    <P>The working group have recommended the installation of automatically controlled flashing lights and bells, without barriers, at seven of the more dangerous crossings, without prejudice to the addition at a later stage of any further protective measures, e.g. barriers, which in the light of experience may be considered necessary.  It is expected that the group will recommend similar installations at other crossing as their examination of <Col N="1216" /> individual crossings proceeds and that the continuing development of road traffic will create a need for further similar installations in the future.</P>
    <P>As the need for these additional safety measures arose out of the growth of road traffic which compelled road authorities to make the roads part of the public road system, section 23 of the Bill provides for the sharing of the cost of providing and maintaining these automatic installations between CIE and the appropriate road authority in each case.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 25 of the Bill to increase from £2 to £25 the penalty for failure to close gates at unattended level crossings.</P>
    <P>Again in the interests of safety, it is proposed in section 29 of the Bill that engine drivers and persons whom CIE wish to train as engine drivers shall be subject to compulsory periodic medical examination, including eyesight tests, in accordance with regulations to be made by me on the application of the board and after consultation with the trade unions representative of the drivers and trainee drivers.  CIE have made periodic medical examination a condition of employment since 1968 for new entrants to the grade of locomotive driver and the board are most anxious that such examination should be compulsory for all engine drivers with a view to ensuring the detection at the earliest possible stage of drivers who might be suffering from diseases which would constitute a disability for driving and a public hazard.  I am in agreement with the board that this additional safety measure is necessary. It will be a matter for negotiation between CIE and the trade unions as to how men who are found unfit will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Section 36 deals with another railway problem&mdash;the misuse of the communication cord on passenger trains. This has been a growing problem in recent years and is particularly prevalent on trains which are being run for sporting occasions.  In some cases the cord has been pulled repeatedly with consequent lengthy delays to trains.  In the hope that an increased penalty will act as a deterrent in such cases, section <Col N="1217" /> 36 of the Bill provides for an increase in the penalty from £5 to £25.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill deal with a variety of matters including the application to level crossings on railway lines in this country owned by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company of section 9 of the Transport Act, 1958, which provides for the substitution of automatic controls for gates at level crossings on roads which were public roads at the time the railway was built; the transfer, subject to payment of compensation, of responsibility for maintenance of road surfaces on overline bridges from CIE to road authorities; the transfer from CIE to Westmeath County Council of liability to maintain Float Bridge on the River Inny&mdash;this would also be subject to payment of compensation; the reference in future of all disputes in redundancy compensation cases to the circuit court; the fixing of toll charges at Fiddown Bridge, County Kilkenny; and certain provisions relating to two of CIE's subsidiary companies, Aerlód Teoranta and CIE Tours International Incorporated.</P>
    <P>The miscellaneous provisions of the Bill can best be dealt with at Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill for the most part could be described as a tidying up measure.  As well as legalising a situation which has been in existence in regard to the County Donegal Railway and the Strabane company, the Minister has availed himself of the opportunity to do some tidying up of existing transport legislation.  The Bill was discussed in the Seanad at considerable length and certain amendments were accepted by the Minister. Therefore, I do not intend to go over the ground covered in the Seanad, but I hope CIE will ensure that the degree of efficiency provided by the CDR will be maintained.  The Minister says:</P>
      <P>CIE will continue to provide the road transport services, both passenger and freight, which are being provided at present by the joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by the <Col N="1218" /> people in Donegal and other areas in that part of the country that CIE might discontinue uneconomic sectors of the service previously operated by the joint committee, that they might start utilising antiquated buses and equipment there.  I hope CIE will continue to provide the same good service provided by the joint committee, the CDR and the other company hitherto.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has given an assurance that no member of the joint committee staff will be disemployed as a result of the transfer of the County Donegal Railway Company undertaking to CIE.  This is very satisfactory. The Minister does, however, qualify that statement by pointing out that it may be necessary to transfer some of the existing staff to other areas.  He points out that the necessity for such transfers at a future date cannot be ruled out.  I may be wrong but there appears to me to be a certain contradiction between the two statements. The first states:</P>
    <P>CIE will continue to provide the road transport services, both passenger and freight, which are being provided at present....</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Minister does not rule out the possibility of some clerical staff being transferred to locations outside County Donegal and he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...But transfers of other staff are not at present envisaged;</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of the pension rights of the staff of the Joint Committee who become employees of CIE the Minister points out that those who are under the age to qualify for the CIE pension scheme will automatically become members of that pension scheme, but ways and means will have to be devised to cover the pension rights of those over the age limit.  This is something I feel very strongly about because when the canal company in Limerick was taken over by CIE I had the case of a man who was given employment by CIE in the goods depot at the station.  Unfortunately, the man was over the age to qualify for the CIE pension scheme <Col N="1219" /> and he came out very badly.  I made representations to CIE about the matter and they have offered him an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of a couple of hundred pounds.  This unfortunate man spent his whole life in the transport industry, he worked for the canal company up to the time it was taken over by CIE and because he was over the age for admission to the CIE pension scheme he could not qualify.  He now finds himself at the age of 65 not qualifying for any pension.  The Minister in the course of his speech stated:</P>
    <P>The position of employees who are ineligible for membership of this scheme because they are over age will have to be examined by CIE in consultation with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to specially look into this matter.  When these discussions are going on it might be possible, if a new formula to embrace those who are ineligible for membership is devised, to look into the case of the former employees of the canal company in Limerick as well.  There are other cases where companies have been taken over by CIE and their employees were ineligible for membership of the wages grade pension scheme.  I am surprised this situation has not been remedied before this legislation was introduced.  It cannot be a very great problem because there are only between 80 and 100 employees who do not qualify for the CIE pension scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of technical jargon in the Minister's speech and this is inevitable in this particular case but as far as the taking over of the Donegal and Strabane Railways are concerned this Bill merely legalises what has been an accomplished fact for some time past.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to carry out some desirable amendments of transport legislation to improve safety on the railways and to deal with some other miscellaneous matters.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first circulated it appeared to be a totally harmless kind <Col N="1220" /> of Bill with no obvious implications with regard to employment or otherwise. However, after the first reading in the Seanad considerable furore arose amongst locomotive drivers because of the implications of section 29.  In relation to this section the Minister says:</P>
    <P>Again in the interests of safety, it is proposed in section 29 of the Bill that engine drivers and persons whom CIE wish to train as engine drivers shall be subject to compulsory periodic medical examination, including eyesight tests, in accordance with regulations to be made by me on the application of the board and after consultation with the trade unions representative of the drivers and trainee drivers.</P>
    <P>When it became know that new and more stringent regulations would be introduced in relation to the fitness of drivers and so forth, I, and I am sure every other Deputy as well, received strong representations from the union representing the locomotive drivers. Between two Stages of the Bill in the Seanad the Minister for Transport and Power received a deputation from the union concerned and he had a meeting with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, on Report Stage, I think, introduced a certain amendment.  I am not at all clear on this and much as I would like to facilitate the Minister as I usually do and give him the Bill I shall have to ask for a little time before Committee Stage because the situation is a bit vague.  The Minister in the course of his speech stated:</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with the board that this additional safety measure is necessary.  It will be a matter for negotiation between CIE and the trade unions as to how men who are found unfit will be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had long and detailed discussions with some of the unions representing the locomotive drivers and I have examined the situation to the extent of taking a trip in an engine myself.  As far as I can see, there is a psychological problem here.  The ambition of railway workers in CIE is <Col N="1221" /> that they will end up driving engines or locomotives.  There is a certain status attached to it and there is a sense of achievement in reaching this grade.  There is consequently a fear of any type of legislation which might make this occupation more hazardous, so to speak.  Undoubtedly, it is vitally important in an age when locomotive engines are highly sophisticated that drivers have a high degree of skill. Training, alertness and peak medical fitness are essential.  What I am concerned about and what the drivers themselves are concerned about is the danger of their being thrown on the scrap heap, so to speak.  No provision is made in this Bill for compensation or alternative employment for men who fail the medical test.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the present attitude of the unions is in this respect but I certainly am very concerned about the position of any driver who would fail this test and who would be found to be no longer medically fit to drive a locomotive.  What will happen to such person?  Some formula will have to be worked out or some scheme negotiated whereby men who in these circumstances have become disemployed as locomotive drivers can be given alternative employment in the company.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the drivers have strongly represented their fears to me in this respect.  They are seeking assurances that, in the event of a man being found medically unfit to drive, alternative employment at a similar scale of wages will be provided.  It is a difficult problem, one which is causing serious concern to every locomotive driver in the CIE network.  We must make every effort to find a solution to this problem.  I have had a number of meetings with representatives of the unions concerned and I am still not satisfied with the legislation as it now stands despite the fact that the Minister did amend it somewhat in the Seanad following meetings with the unions.  On Committee Stage I hope to be able to put forward some proposals, or that the Minister may be able to introduce amendments, which will safeguard the livelihood of these drivers and give <Col N="1222" /> them more security of employment and allay the fears they now have of being found below medical standard and being out of a job.</P>
    <P>Section 36 deals with another problem which is becoming quite common, namely, the misuse of the communication cord on passenger trains.  The Minister made a comment in the Seanad debate: I suppose it is a reflection of the society in which we live that we have this kind of vandalism and hooliganism recurring at frequent intervals.  In this Bill the Minister proposes, as a deterrent, to increase the fine from £5 to £25.  I do not know whether or not this will have the desired effect.  If this type of misuse occurs on occasions when special groups charter trains for sporting events, it is a sad situation.  If the people responsible for organising the groups would accept more responsibility in the matter, that might help. There might be an effort made to educate young people at school level as to the gravity of this offence, that it should not happen, that pulling a communication cord 10 or 15 times in the course of a journey is a bad thing. The increase in the penalty from £5 to £25 may serve as a deterrent.  I sincerely hope that it will although I have my doubts.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The other provision in the Bill deals with a variety of matters including the application to level crossings on railway lines in this country owned by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company of section 9 of the Transport Act, 1958 which provides for the substitution of automatic controls for gates at level crossings on roads which were public roads at the time the railway was built....</P>
    <P>Am I not right in saying that there are some automatic controls at present in operation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to be clear on that.  In South Tipperary, in Emly, there is an automatic level crossing that has been in operation for a good number of years and that appears <Col N="1223" /> to be working out very satisfactorily. With the growth in vehicular traffic it is inevitable that there should be some degree of automation on railway crossings.  Fears have been expressed about the safety factor in this respect. I understand that in other countries there have been a big number of accidents resulting from automatic railway crossings.  The Minister may be able to enlighten us in regard to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the Bill makes certain provisions relating to two CIE's subsidiary companies, Aerlód Teoranta and CIE Tours International Incorporated.  This is interesting because CIE Tours International Incorporated, if I remember correctly, were set up by legislation in July, 1970.  They were a subsidiary company to CIE set up for the purpose of organising and generating coach tour traffic to this country from North America and, as far as I can gather, it is the North American subsidiary of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <P>The Minister introduced the Bill to set up this subsidiary company in 1970.  I do not know what makes it necessary to add new provisions by this Bill.  I read somewhere&mdash; perhaps in the report of the Seanad debate, that certain provisions are now being made in relation to this North American subsidiary of CIE in relation to staff.  I am rather puzzled.  The Minister said today that the Bill contained certain provisions relating to both Aerlód Teoranta and CIE Tours International Incorporated&mdash;that is the North American subsidiary?</P>

      <P>The Minister may have pointed it out in the Seanad debate.  I should like to have another look at section 29.  The other parts of the Bill seem not to contain anything controversial.  Certainly I have no objection to the other provisions.  I am worried about section 29 and may have to table amendments for Committee Stage.  We can discuss that further on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to restrict myself to those features of the Bill which have some significance for locomotive drivers, about whom Deputy O'Donnell was talking.  Section 29 is that section which, in the interests of safety, provides that locomotive drivers and persons whom the board wish to train as locomotive drivers shall be medically examined from time to time in accordance with regulations made by the Minister on the application of the Board and after consultation with the trade union representative of such drivers and persons.</P>
      <P>(2)  A person shall not be trained to drive a locomotive nor retrained in the employment of the Board as a locomotive driver if, in the opinion of the Chief Medical Officer, the results of a medical examination carried out pursuant to regulations made by the Minister under this section show that the health or eyesight of the person is below the standard considered from time to time by the Chief Medical Officer to be requisite for a locomotive driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be tabling certain amendments which will seek to change this sub-section to ensure that the chief medical officer would not have the last word in this matter; that, as in so many other cases governing conditions of employment and so on, there should be an appeal to a medical appeals tribunal within 14 days of the receipt of the chief medical officer's decision.  I would ask the Minister to consider having a medical appeals tribunal appointed by the Minister, after consultation <Col N="1225" /> with the Minister for Health, the board and such trade unions representing the board's locomotive drivers.</P>
    <P>We do not contest the general validity of having safety in the actual operation of the engine.  It is important, for safety all round, that the human agents concerned in operating our railways should be equally as reliable as any mechanical devices referred to in this Bill.  It is precisely because there are human agents concerned that we ask for a human way of dealing with this problem.  The human way we suggest is that there should be a further appeal from the chief medical officer to a board that would be constituted of the three elements involved in this the unions, the Minister and again medical opinion.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will see that there is no desire on the trade union side, nor indeed on the locomotive drivers side, to hold up any improvement in safety standards in the operations of CIE.  There is a feeling that this could be done in a way more satisfactory to the human beings concerned, if there was this further appeal.  There are examples in the public service where we have this appeal from one man's decision.  As it is here, there is full control over the future employment prospects of a locomotive driver where there is a question of, say, eyesight, and this lies with the chief medical officer.  There should be a further review of the chief medical officer's decision.  There should be review by a body called an appeals tribunal composed of medical, trade union and ministerial representatives. I hope the Minister will accept such a suggestion.  I will be interested in any remarks he might make on this matter.</P>
    <P>I shall table some amendments to insert a provision regarding this appeals tribunal.  The Minister could look on this as a noncontentious addition to his Bill because it does not seek in any way to deny the inherent principle of safety in the Bill.  An amendment of this type would make the Bill more acceptable to the employees concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the fact that consultations have taken place with the trade unions in regard to people who <Col N="1226" /> are seen to be unfit by virtue of standards of sight and so on.  He should consider compensation to be the remedy here because if employees find themselves redundant as a result of very high safety standards being imposed, they should be compensated for any deficiencies they are now seen to have which makes them unfit to continue in their present jobs.  Compensation should be paid even where they must continue in the employment of the board.  Deputy O'Donnell remarked that there is a certain status attached to the job of locomotive driver so those people should be compensated for being removed from their jobs because of higher safety standards.  I should like the Minister to make some remark on this point which is of interest to the trade unions.  My remarks and the amendments I shall put down are in line with the thinking of the trade unions on this particular point.  It would be a pity, in a Bill which brings in certain welcome features, and seeing that the changes requested by the unions do not cut across the principles of the Bill, not to meet the legitimate requests of the unions in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the House for the welcome given to the general principles outlined in the Bill and the matters contained in it.  The Bill primarily is concerned with rationalising or legalising a situation which already exists in that financial arrangements have already been made with British Railways in regard to the take-over by CIE of the transport undertakings formerly administered by the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee and the Strabane-LetterKenny Railway Company in which British Railways had their investment. The Bill legitimises that situation which has been in operation now for a few years and makes legal the commercial operations of CIE in that area of operation formerly exercised by the two organisations I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the point about diminution of service.  There will be no diminution.  In fact there will be a continuation and one hopes an expansion of the service as operated by CIE on their own lines since the take-over <Col N="1227" /> was effected.  The legal details, the compensation provisions outlined in the agreement, are now legitimised under this legislation.  There will be no staff redundancy.  I can assure the House in that respect, that as far as the staff are concerned there may, as obtains in regard to any CIE staff, transfers from one area to another but they will be treated in this regard as any member of CIE would be treated.  The only such transfers envisaged might be some transfers in regard to clerical staff because of routine office rationalisation or matters of that kind.  It is not envisaged that there will be any redundancy in any other staff of former organisations taken over by CIE.</P>
    <P>The employees who would qualify for CIE superannuation will automatically have the CIE superannuation rights attached to them.  We are seeking to work out pension arrangements for the employees who, as it now stands, would not qualify if they were CIE employees, for CIE pension rights.  This is under negotiation by the trade unions and the companies at the moment.  I wish to emphasise that as the position operated they would not be entitled to any pension rights whatever. There is an improvement in the situation in that they are now being negotiated on their behalf by the trade unions with CIE.  Those people who would not otherwise be entitled to any pension whatever will get some pension and the formula is being negotiated at present.</P>

      <P>I will make a note of that.  If there are only a few cases it should be possible to fit them in. That is all I have to say on the superannuation aspect.  There are some aspects of the Bill which I have not mentioned.  There are some matters which might be brought into the Bill at a later stage.  This started as a Bill to deal with the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of these companies, their staff and superannuation rights and, the continuation of services, but it grew into a Bill taking into account other miscellaneous matters such as automatic devices at level crossings and increases in penalties for communication cord offences.  These matters arose after the Bill was drafted.  It was mentioned by CIE that there were matters needing legislation. I asked for a list of such matters so that we could incorporate them in a measure of this kind.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy O'Leary have mentioned section 29 of the Bill requiring a compulsory medical test from time to time in respect of locomotive drivers and persons trained to be locomotive drivers. There was mention of the fact that such tests should be in accordance with regulations made by the Minister on application by the board.  I saw the trade unions concerned with this matter when this Bill was being discussed in the Seanad, between the Committee and Report Stages.  I brought in the addendum to section 29 (1) to include after &ldquo;board&rdquo; on the second last line &ldquo;and after consultation with the trade unions representative of such drivers and persons&rdquo;.  In other words the regulations could be made by me on the application of the board only after consultation with the trade unions concerned.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which can be incorporated in the regulations which can only be made by me after application by the board in consultation with the trade unions.  The regulations could incorporate some appeal procedure or it could be written into the form of a statute.</P>

I thought this would circumscribe me sufficiently to meet the point put forward by the trade unions.  I suggested at the conference that I would bring in an amendment to meet the union point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill has three objects.  The first object is to amend the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; in the Firearms Act, 1825, by extending it to include component parts of a firearm.  The second object is to amend the provision in the 1925 Act, which relates to the unauthorised possession of firearms, so as to reduce the penalties applicable to firearms that may be classed as sporting weapons and to increase those applicable to firearms that may be classed as military type weapons.  The third object is to put beyond doubt that the section in the 1925 Act which makes it an offence carrying severe penalties to be in possession of firearms or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, extends to lives and property outside as well as inside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment of the definition of &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; is provided for in section 2 of the Bill.  The amendment is designed to close a loophole in the existing law whereby, for example, it is possible for stocks of component <Col N="1233" /> parts of firearms to be held by a number of people in such a way that, although the weapons can be assembled at short notice, no one person is legally in possession of a firearm.  The amendment will also cure the anomalous situation in which a slight and easily remedied defect in an otherwise perfect weapon can sometimes result in a person charged with the offence of unauthorised possession of the weapon being acquitted by the court.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in sections 3 and 5 of the Bill to ensure that separate firearm certificates will not have to be obtained for components.  Paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 3 will empower a superintendent of the Garda Síochána to authorise the possession of component parts; and section 5 will enable component parts to be given or sold to, and possessed and carried by, a person for a firearm which he is authorised to possess, without his being required to have any separate authorisation in respect of the parts themselves. Excise duty is not payable on an authorisation.</P>
    <P>These provisions taken together are intended to effect a tightening-up of the controls on possession of firearms. While one result of the provisions is that the penalty for the unauthorised possession of a component part will be the same as that for the firearm of which it is part, commonsense and the exercise of judicial discretion will, I have no doubt, ensure that minor breaches of the law arising from the possession of component parts will be dealt with as such.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to the second object of the Bill.  Under the law as it stands, unauthorised possession of any firearms attracts the general penalty provided in section 25 of the 1925 Act for offences for which no special penalty is provided, that is to say, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £50 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both and, on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both. There is a separate, indictable offence in section 15 of the 1925 Act of being in possession of a firearm or ammunition <Col N="1234" /> with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property and some Deputies might be inclined to think that that section should be sufficient to deal with any special problems relating to military type weapons.  But proving intent beyond reasonable doubt is always difficult, even where the Gardaí are fully satisfied that the intent exists, and it has been necessary to rely on the unauthorised possession provision in cases where military type weapons are seized.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill proposes to reduce the penalties for the unauthorised possession of a sporting firearm, or a firearm that had been held under a firearm certificate which had expired but had not been revoked, to, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £50 for a first offence, and, for any subsequent offences, a fine not exceeding £50 for a first offence, and, for any subsequent offence, a fine not exceeding £50 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding three months or both. In the case of the unauthorised possession of any other firearms, however, the section proposes to increase the penalties to, on summary conviction a fine not exceeding £200 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 12 months or both, or, on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £500 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years or both.  The penalty for the unauthorised possession of ammunition or a component part will be the same as that for the firearm to which the ammunition or part is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Government wish it to be clearly understood from these proposals in relation to penalties that they take a most serious view of the unauthorised possession of military type weapons and, while there is no intention of interfering in any way with the exercise by the courts of their discretion as to what, if any, penalty is appropriate in any particular case, the Government consider it desirable that the Oireachtas should, by enacting the proposals, express the determination of the elected representatives of the people not to tolerate the deliberate, clandestine possession of weapons of war.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the third object of <Col N="1235" /> the Bill.  Section 15 of the 1925 Act provides that any person in possession of a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property shall be liable to suffer penal servitude for a term not exceeding 20 years or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.  The Bill provides for clarification of the section so as to put beyond doubt that it relates to lives and property outside as well as inside the State.  Even though the application of this section is restricted by the difficulty of proving the existence of intent, I believe that clarifying the law in the manner proposed will have a salutary deterrent effect on any persons or groups who may contemplate using the territory of the State as a base for unlawful armed activities outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>To complete the picture, I think I ought to make a passing reference to the provisions of section 51 of the Finance Bill, which is currently before the House.  That section provides for increased fees for registration of firearms dealers and forms part of the Government's proposals in relation to the safe-keeping of stocks of firearms and ammunition in the hands of dealers.  In addition, the Garda have been instructed that increased care should be taken to ensure that firearms dealers at all times maintain adequate security measures in relation to the stocks carried by them.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, this is a Bill to tighten up the existing statutory controls on firearms, with a view particularly to enabling the Garda Síochána to deal more effectively with the unauthorised possession of military type weapons.  I believe that the measure is one that will have the general support of the community and I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Minister said, this Bill proposes to regulate the possession of firearms.  It also proposes to bring up to date the law relating to the possession of firearms both of a sporting type and of a more lethal or dangerous type.  I believe that the law relating to firearms should be clearly stated and should be firmly and impartially enforced. <Col N="1236" /> It is of the utmost importance that the ordinary citizen should clearly know and understand the law relating to the possession of firearms and that he should know that the Government intend to enforce that law firmly and impartially.</P>
      <P>I believe that over the years, and especially in recent years, there has been a lot of loose talk and muddled thinking on this subject.  It goes without saying that any Government worthy of the name must see to it that in this country there is only one armed army and only one police force. That is absolutely essential.  It is essential, in the interests of people who might be tempted to break the law just as it is essential in the interests of law-abiding citizens, that there should be no doubt in the mind of anybody with regard to the topic.  I said I believe that there has been loose thinking on this subject over the years.  This party support this Bill for the reasons stated. I believe that it cannot be too clearly stated or too often stated that no cause is sufficient for the establishment here of private armies or private police forces no matter how laudable the cause in the minds of the people setting up those armies.</P>
      <P>The Act which we propose to amend here is the Firearms Act, 1925, which simply deals in a global way with the possession of firearms.  I agreed with the proposal to differentiate between firearms of a sporting type and firearms held under an expired licence on the one hand and firearms held illegally on the other hand.  The Bill proposes to reduce the penalties in respect of sporting type firearms and firearms held under a licence which somebody has failed or omitted to renew, or overlooked renewing.  At present the fine in respect of the illegal possession of firearms is £50 or six months on summary conviction, or £100 or two years on conviction on indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to reduce the penalty in respect of sporting firearms and firearms held under a licence which has expired to a flat £50 in respect of a first offence, or £50 or three months' imprisonment in respect of a second offence.  It proposes to increase the penalty in respect of other types of firearms to a fine of £200 or 12 months' <Col N="1237" /> imprisonment on summary conviction, and a fine of £500 or five years on conviction on indictment.  I believe that the proposed fines in this Bill do nothing more than bring home to the people concerned the seriousness of the offences with which we are dealing. They are extremely serious offences and it is necessary to bring home to misguided people that they are serious offences.</P>
    <P>This is the Second Reading Stage of the Bill and we will have time to go into it in more detail on Committee Stage.  The Minister tells us that there is some doubt as to whether section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1925, is wide enough to make it an offence for people to have firearms in their possession within the State with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property outside the State.  Section 4 proposes to put that beyond doubt and to lay down that it is an offence for anyone here to have an unlicensed firearm or, indeed, I suppose, a licensed firearm, in his posession within the State with the intention of causing serious bodily harm or of endangering property outside the State.</P>
    <P>I take this as nothing more nor less than restating the policy and principle this party accept; that only Oireachtas Éireann can declare war on any State over which we have not got jurisdiction whether that territory is within this island or whether it is a foreign power across the water.  We accept that only Oireachtas Éireann can declare war and that only the lawfully constituted Army, acting under the authority of this House, can carry out the declaration of this House.  This section states that fact in clear terms and, accordingly, I accept it.</P>
    <P>There may be other points that will need to be discussed on Committee Stage in regard to the law relating to the licensing and retention of firearms. Recently it has been stated publicly that, while it is necessary to have a licence for firearms, it is not necessary to produce the firearms to the authorities when the licence is being renewed. Personally, I do not think that is the law.  I think firearms must be produced when a licence is being renewed and if this is not the case the law <Col N="1238" /> should be changed.  If it is not possible to identify the firearms because a number or mark has been erased or has worn off, the law should be changed to ensure, first, that the firearm is produced and, secondly, to ensure that it is checked properly.  I do not want to make wild charges in this House but it has been stated publicly by responsible people that some Members of the Oireachtas handed over their personal firearms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the Ceann Comhairle listens to me for a moment, I hope to relate it very closely to the Bill.  That charge was made and the matter was raised in this House and elsewhere.  When it was raised in this House, it was stated in reply to a query that it was impossible to check up on the position.  If that is so, now is the appropriate time to change the law and regulations.  It is not for me to say if these statements are true but it is an appalling state of affairs that we are living in conditions where statements like this can be made and when, apparently, it is not possible to clear the air.</P>
      <P>It is in the interests of everyone that the law should be known, should be clearly stated and fairly and impartially enforced.  I am in favour of this Bill in so far as it is going some considerable way towards clarifying the position and towards bringing home to all the seriousness of the illegal possession and use of firearms and the illegal setting up of arsenals.</P>
      <P>We are living in a time when persons are inclined to resort to force, whether in organised groups or individually. This Bill in ordinary circumstances might be passed over as an updating of the law relating to firearms but I am availing of the opportunity of appealing to the Government and to the Minister to talk clearly and honestly and to put the thinking and the policy of the Government in this matter beyond any shadow of doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1239" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be grave reason for bringing a measure before the House and when it is being framed every possible defect in previous legislation regarding the matter concerned should be remedied.  For that reason I am not too happy about this Bill because I do not think it does very much.  I do not go along with what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that it is updating legislation and that for that reason we should support it.  The Labour Party will support any legislation that will help to preserve law and order.  This appears to be the object of the Bill but, having read the Bill and the White Paper issued with it, and having listened to the Minister's speech, I am a little confused.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to the fact that it is proposed to reduce the penalties for the unauthorised possession of a sporting-type firearm.  I do not know whether &ldquo;a sporting-type&rdquo; would wear plus-fours and a check cap but I have a recollection that in a number of the raids carried out here sporting-type weapons were used.  Although the people carrying out the raids were not sporting they succeeded in the raids and they carried shotguns.  In this Bill it appears that the .22 shotgun is an inoffensive weapon but this is not so. I know the Minister has ruled out the sawn-off shotgun as a sporting-type weapon but any kind of shotgun can do a lot of damage if it is fired at close quarters.  The amount of damage that can be done depends very much on the cartridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go all the way with those who say that unauthorised carrying of arms must be stopped.  One sees repeatedly reports of drilling in this country, of people parading openly with weapons and ammunition, and discharging the arms in public.  Some effort should be made to take these weapons out of their possession.  They are not carrying out the exercises simply to amuse themselves.  There must be some reason for doing it.  I know a number of people have been arrested and some have been charged.  It would be interesting if the Minister could give us the figures in relation to those who are charged and convicted.  I do not know what has to be done with weapons <Col N="1240" /> before one commits an offence which merits punishment.</P>
    <P>As one who served in the National Army and who has a fair knowledge of various types of weapons, I am appalled by the stories I hear of people who are little more than children being in possession of the most sophisticated types of weapons and being taught how to use them. These weapons did not just drop out of the sky, or maybe they did. They certainly came in here and they have been kept here for some reason. We might as well face up to the fact that we are either prepared to agree that this country will be governed by a democratically elected Government or that the Government should be removed by force because there are people who apparently believe that the Government of this country should and will be removed by force.  If they do not believe that for what are they training? For what are they collecting weapons?  For what are they hoarding arms and ammunition?</P>
    <P>We hear of people using weapons. There is what I would describe as a slight reference to the fact that the punishments specified will apply to those convicted if they are operating outside the State as well as inside the State.  I do not know how this will operate.  I do not know whether the Minister means that, if someone is sitting on the Border and sees someone else coming back across the Border from the Six Counties after committing a crime, and if there is a policeman close enough to be able to say what that someone actually did, then that someone can be punished.  I do not know if that is the reasoning behind it.  Does it mean that if the someone comes across with a gun in his possession he is committing an offence?</P>
    <P>Again, if a person has been in possession of a shotgun for a number of years and has not been in the habit of taking out a licence each year, it would be unreasonable, I agree, to fine that person heavily.  Provision, however, is made for the court in this regard and the Minister referred to it in his brief.  I cannot understand why there should be a specific provision which will not permit the same court <Col N="1241" /> to punish severely someone who is in possession of a weapon which has been or will be used for other than sporting purposes; it is not very sporting to hold people up and put them in fear of their lives.</P>
    <P>I and my party are very definite about this.  Deputy Fitzpatrick stated that Oireachtas Éireann are the only people who have the right to declare war.  Less than two years ago I stated here that, since the decision of this House was that we do not take part in any kind of force against the Six Counties, then we must stand by that and, if there is to be a change, let the change be made here by the Government. Do not let us close our eyes to the fact that there are people in existence who are a danger not alone to those in the Six Counties&mdash;and I have no sympathy at all for the ruling class there&mdash;but are also a danger to this House and to everything it stands for.  Let us be fair and honest about this.  I do not think this Bill is doing what it should do.  Apparently the Garda think they have not got the authority they require to collect all the arms around the country.  Goodness knows, we heard enough about all the unlicensed guns in the North.  I would like a head count of all the unlicensed guns in the South.  If the Garda have not got the authority to collect these unlicensed guns then someone should be given that authority.  No one, except those authorised by the State, is entitled to carry guns or be in possession of weapons.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not doing what it should do.  It is about time somebody was appointed in the courts to give a fair trial to those who carry guns unlawfully for unlawful purposes, to those who carry explosives or other weapons. It makes a joke of the country when people can go into court, with all the evidence against them, and get off on a technicality, making matters worse than they actually were before they were charged.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick said that, when I was asked about allegations by a Member of this House in regard to firearms allegedly handed over by other Members of the Oireachtas, I said it was impossible to check the position arising from that allegation. I did not say what Deputy Fitzpatrick says I did: I said that the Deputy who made the allegation should go to the Garda and give them the evidence on which he made it and they would forthwith investigate but that, on the basis of an unsubstantiated allegation, I was not prepared to instruct the Garda to pick on any particular group in the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and carry out a detailed investigation.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked me to outline clearly the policy of the Government with regard to firearms and the illegal use of firearms.  I did that in my opening speech.  I have also done it from time to time during the year.  I will repeat it now.  The Government are absolutely determined to do all they can to put down the use of unauthorised firearms and especially of those referred to as military type weapons.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said he had heard rumours of drilling and people openly parading with weapons.  I cannot give the House a categorical assurance that from time to time drilling or parading with some form of weapons does not take place, but I can assure the House that drilling with any type of weapons has been very, very infrequent during the past 12 months.  It is certainly not open.  It is confined to small groups and, if it takes place at all, it takes place indoors or in extremely remote parts of the country.  There is no open parading with weapons.  There has not been for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda have standing instructions that on any show of weapons those weapons are to be seized.  They know that and they will carry out that instruction.  I should probably not be honest were I to say that there is absolutely <Col N="1243" /> no drilling because from time to time, though infrequently, we receive information of drilling in remote mountainy areas or in forests and occasionally of drilling on a small scale indoors.  But the very significant thing is that in each case the numbers are very small and the frequency with which this sort of activity takes place is now very little.  It is something which the Garda have done a very great deal in the past 12 months to stamp out.  It is practically gone and the slight amount of illegal drilling that might still go on can and will be stamped out altogether if local people who believe this may happen in their locality or is happening, inform the gardaí immediately so that they can move in.  If this is done, any remaining drilling&mdash;and I want to emphasise that it is now very slight indeed and the numbers involved are very small &mdash;will be completely stamped out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully said that what we referred to here as sporting-type weapons have been and can be used in armed raids.  I appreciate this difficulty but feel it would be unfair for me to put every weapon into the military category, even though sporting-type weapons can be used for a para-military purpose.  I am advised that a shotgun is most dangerous when it is &ldquo;sawn off&rdquo; and that it is likely to be used by non-sporting types when so altered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Tully said that some courts did not seem to be <Col N="1244" /> willing to deal with the problems posed by people charged before them with unlawful possession of firearms.  Deputies will appreciate that I cannot comment on that but if courts in some instances do not appear to impose heavy penalties, or the sort of penalties Deputies feel appropriate, that is a matter that is outside my function and that of the gardaí and the Attorney General.  It is certainly not the fault of either the Garda or the prosecution if apparently inadequate penalties are sometimes imposed.</P>
      <P>I think that answers all the points raised in the debate but I should like to reiterate clearly that the Government are determined that the unauthorised possession of firearms, particularly of a military or para-military type, will be stamped out.  The Garda are doing all in their power to achieve this and I think the Bill will make matters somewhat easier for them, in particular since it differentiates between the sporting-type weapon and the very dangerous military-type weapon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On this section, and arising out of the points raised by Deputy Briscoe, the Minister should avail of this opportunity to appeal to persons in possession of illegal firearms to hand them in.  Deputy Tully said it was being stated by, I think, one of the people who conducted an inquiry in the north-eastern part of the country that he had no doubt there were far too many illegal arms lying about.  If there are any illegal arms lying about here&mdash;and undoubtedly there are&mdash;it is highly desirable they should be handed in and put out of circulation.</P>
      <P>It is hard to discuss this sort of thing perhaps without being accused of being controversial and party political but there is no doubt&mdash;and I have tried to get this across as sophisticatedly as I could&mdash;that in the past few years there has been muddled thinking on the question of firearms and their use and people generally could be excused if they came to the conclusion that even within the Government party and even within the Cabinet there was divided opinion on this subject.  That is why I say that it is not fair to people who in that way are encouraged or might be encouraged to possess firearms for use in one place or another or one purpose or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I think therefore the point made by Deputy Briscoe is a very valid one which deserves to be considered by the Minister.  Before the Bill is signed by the President it should be made public that there is this 14 days of grace for people either to apply for a licence or to hand in the firearms.  It is very easy in the conditions which have been prevailing here to have a certain amount of sympathy for people who have been misled or misguided, and if this little discussion has done nothing more than to clarify national thinking on this point it would have done a lot of good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the mid-twenties all the republicans appeared when all the trouble was over, when the civil war was over, when the rebellion was over. The country was full of republicans. Similarly at the present time we have republicans in the country again, people who call themselves republicans, but if there was necessity for their services they would be as scarce as they were in 1916.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I have grave doubts if giving grace to people to hand in weapons will have much effect.  People who have no use for those weapons would have handed them in already and will hand them in after the passing of this Bill without danger of charge. The people who have arms and intend to use them will not avail of any amnesty.  It may be considered wrong to say this, but we are in the unfortunate position that where there is a period in which there is not likely to be a national call to arms those people will talk about their patriotism and their republicanism.  I know during the emergency years how few of those people were prepared to offer their services to the State and I have been told how few were prepared to do it when they were needed before that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason the Bill should have been aimed not at those who have no further use for their arms but at doing everything possible to collect arms, ammunition and explosives from those who want to use them or who say they want to use them, which is a different thing.  I take issue with the Minister on his interpretation of the provision in <Col N="1247" /> regard to 14 days.  Is it 14 days from the date on which the President signs the Act?  The provision states:</P>
    <P>This Act shall come into force on the 14th day after the date of its passing.</P>
    <P>The normal reading of such a provision is that it comes into operation at a certain time after it is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It has not been signed by the President at that stage.  I imagine there is some slight misunderstanding here.</P>
    <P>If somebody thinks it will do some good to give a period of grace I have no objection but I submit that every possible method should be used peaceably, if possible, to obtain possession of arms and ammunition which are in the hands of those who have not got them for good purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with Deputy Tully's point about the precise meaning of subsection (4), to the effect that the Act shall come into operation on the 14th day after the date of its passing.  Oireachtas Éireann consists not just of two Houses, Dáil and Seanad, but also of the President so that when a Bill is passed by both Houses it is by both Houses only and not by the Oireachtas.  It becomes passed by the Oireachtas only when it is signed by the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that sense, my statement that the Act shall come into operation means when it is signed by the President.  For that reason, the 14 days will begin when the President signs the Act rather than on the day when it has been passed by both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what Deputies Fitzpatrick, Tully and Briscoe have been saying about an amnesty, I want to make it clear that when I talk about a 14-day period after the passing of the Act, in that 14 days there will not be a full amnesty in the sense that no law will prevail in relation to firearms.  What I mean is that the new law will not operate during that 14-day period but people will continue to be <Col N="1248" /> subject to the existing law.  There will be an amnesty in relation to the possession of component parts under the Bill because they are not subject to the existing law.  Possession of component parts will not become an offence until the 14th day after the signing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want it to be felt that in that two-week period there will not be any law in respect of firearms.  There will be, but the more onerous provisions of this Bill will not come into force.  I appeal to people who may have military type weapons, possibly legitimately procured in that they or their forefathers acquired them during the War of Independence or in the LDF&mdash; maybe they were not meant to but they seem to have&mdash;to hand them into a Garda station and I am sure the Garda in each case will use their discretion. An alternative is that if the arms are made permanently ineffective &mdash;possibly by drilling a hole in the barrel&mdash;the need to obtain a firearm certificate does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, do I understand properly when I say that, if a person at the moment hands in a gun, the Garda in their discretion may decide not to prosecute or to prosecute?  What I understand by an amnesty is that anybody holding firearms who brings them along during that period will not be prosecuted for having them in their possession. The Minister says that under existing law a person can be prosecuted for having a firearm with a certificate. During the amnesty period they will still be subject to prosecution under the old law, or does the Minister mean that nobody will be prosecuted who brings along a firearm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody would be prosecuted under this Bill, or Act as it then will be, but the operation of the existing law during that limited period will not be affected.  However, I think Deputy Briscoe can assume that if any citizen comes along during that period to a Garda station and says he has a firearm, he has not got a certificate and he wants to hand it in, while strictly speaking the Garda should prosecute, I think that unless <Col N="1249" /> they have some good reason to do so, in the circumstances the Garda might be lenient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I have raised this matter on the Adjournment is because I feel the House is not properly aware of what has happened.  Prior to September, 1967, a person who wished to take out a hackney licence in rural Ireland had to pay £1 for a badge and £1 10s for his car and, provided the motor car which he wished to use for the service was up to the prescribed standard, he was legally entitled to go on the road and charge for the services he carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some unexplainable reason the Department of Local Government have now introduced regulations which mean that any person who wishes to take out a hackney licence in rural Ireland must now pay £11 and £30 and he must have a car which is not older than two years.  These regulations are to me criminal, particularly on the western seaboard where many small farmers, in order to supplement their already very small income, have hackney licences and drive people to Mass or take car loads to local dances at the weekends.  These people are now forced to drive a vehicle which is not older than two years, they have to pay <Col N="1250" /> £11 for a badge, £30 to license the car, and in addition they may possibly have to pay £100 insurance.  It is not proper for the Department of Local Government to expect people to pay this amount of money in order to provide a service in an area which needs such a service.</P>
    <P>In one area I know, Dunfanaghy in County Donegal, the two local taximen have gone out of business.  The area from Falcarragh to Creeslough is now without a hackney service unless some person comes up to the standards required by the Minister for Local Government.  If no one comes up to these standards the Department is forcing people to practise illegal methods of carrying passengers.  If an accident occurs these people will be told to hold their tongue and not admit that they were paying for carriage in the motor car involved in the accident.  If a compensation case is to be taken against the offending party they will be expected to appear in a court of law and remain silent.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister for Local Government today if we will revert to the pre-1967 conditions.  I am satisfied if this were done the Garda authorities would ensure that the type of vehicle offered for licensing would be of the standard required or demanded by the Department of Local Government.  How many people can state with any degree of authority that a vehicle under two years of age is a better vehicle than a vehicle which is four years of age?  The four year old vehicle may have been very well serviced and may even have a very low mileage rate, whereas the two year old vehicle could have been hired out by one of the famous car hire firms in the city and may have put up 50,000 or 60,000 miles a year; but because it was under the two year limit it would still be eligible for licensing.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister, who comes from a rural part of the country, realises that many people in small towns with businesses who find their profits dwindling supplement their income by driving people around.  The Minister knows of many small farmers who find it difficult to make ends meet and have a licence to provide a hackney <Col N="1251" /> service, but these regulations are forcing these people out of business. The Department should have another look at this.  I am satisfied that if they specify other conditions the service will still be provided.</P>
    <P>If an individual wants to get into the hackney car business&mdash;and I exclude the taximeter areas of Dublin and Cork&mdash;he must present a car which is less than two years old, he must pay £11 for his own licence, £30 for the hackney licence and pay his insurance premium, whereas an existing hackney driver will pay £1 for his licence and £1 10s for his motor car. There is an argument for protecting the men who are at present giving this service, but if these people opt out the licence is not transferable except to a personal representative or a member of the family.  It has not been defined whether the present hackney owner has the right to sell his hackney licence and I should like the Minister to clarify this particular point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the proceedings of the House and I do not want to go over ground I have already gone over, but I know of at least 20 people who have made inquiries at the local Garda station about how to get a licence but when they were told of these conditions they shied off.  While this problem is now showing its head in Donegal I am quite satisfied it will not be too long before people will be knocking at the door of the Minister's house in West Galway.  Only at that stage will he become conscious of what is happening.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the whole position and to allow into this business persons who might wish to give a service.</P>

It would appear that Deputy Harte is not concerned about the standards.  I think an ever-increasing standard in relation to the type of car that should be used is very important and that the travelling public are entitled to the best type of conveyance.</P>

      <P>The travelling public have to be protected and the new standards must be enforced to the limit.  We must ensure that the public have proper vehicles to travel in, not driven around the country in any type of crock, as has been suggested by Deputy Harte.  There are standards <Col N="1253" /> laid down and there is no reason why the Department would not fully enforce them.  This is in accord with the wishes of the people earning their living in this business.  They have made their views known throughout the country.  Deputy Harte is well aware that this matter was discussed in the House, that the views of Deputies have been brought to bear from time to time in debates on the Department of Local Government Estimate and on other occasions in relation to the upgrading of the service in order to ensure that the travelling public would get a fair and adequate deal in relation to travel by taxi or hackney.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not step down on this occasion.  I hope he will fully honour the pledges given to the people in this business in order to ensure that the vehicle registered would be able to do service on the road for a considerable time, not just any old crock that Deputy Harte has referred to.  I hope the wishes of the taxi drivers in relation to the enforcement of the regulations covering identity discs, strips and other features that affect people in the city will be fully and adequately met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole taxi and hackney business was gone into very thoroughly by me last summer and arising out of my personal investigations and interviews with people in the business I introduced new regulations which made it more difficult for persons to enter into this business.  There were many reasons for doing this.  One of the primary reasons was to ensure that the standard of service being made available to the public would be improved and, secondly, I was conscious of the need to offer some protection and guarantee to those operators in the business to enable them to make a decent livelihood out of their taxi and hackney businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am greatly surprised at the stand taken by Deputy Harte in this matter because as the position operated anybody with a motor vehicle could walk into the licensing authority, pay £2 or £3, obtain a licence and operate on a part-time temporary basis, whenever he so wished.  This was operating <Col N="1254" /> to the detriment of persons who were full-time hackney men and full-time taxi men.  They had unfair competition from persons many of whom were otherwise employed and who at the weekends would come out and take some of the business, which was, in effect, taking the bread and butter out of the mouth of the full-time hackney man and full-time taxi man.  I was concerned that this situation should not be allowed to continue and I was anxious to try to ensure that those who were in the business could be given some guarantee by me that they would have some protection from this type of operator and would have some guarantee of a decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>The measures which were decided on were decided after consultation on several occasions.  I attended these interviews myself and had personal discussions with the men in the business following which I introduced regulations, which as was stated today in the reply, will be allowed to operate for two years and shall then be reviewed. I do not think any great case can be made in support of the type of argument Deputy Harte is making here.  As a matter of fact I am very greatly surprised that he should come in and make this argument.</P>

      <P>Those who were dissatisfied with the situation were the persons in the business.  To sum up the reasons, as I have told the House already, my idea was to raise the standards in the business but in order not to operate to the detriment of those already holding licences I applied the regulations only to new entrants. Another complaint was that there was an increase in the number of licences <Col N="1255" /> being issued and this was operating to the disadvantage of those who were seeking to get full-time employment from the business.</P>

      <P>There was a very strong argument made to me to introduce a limitation on the number of licences issued in any one year but I was very reluctant to bring about that type of situation which would make it a closed shop.  In order not to close it completely I merely raised the standards for new applicants.  It would in no way affect any of those who were operating and who held licences.  As a matter of fact some persons whose licences had lapsed had been operating the business and I allowed the very generous period of two years prior to the introduction of the new regulations and the new regulations would not apply to anybody who held a licence in those two years.</P>
      <P>I do not think what the Deputy said in his question is correct, as he puts it, that particularly in respect of new licence holders in rural Ireland the fee of £30 is excessive.  The fee of £30 does not apply at all to the licence holders in rural Ireland.  It only applies to persons who are not licence holders but who are applying for new licences and who were not in the business for two years prior to the introduction of the new regulations.  I do not think there is any validity at all in the allegation in the Deputy's question. The Deputy named one place where there were not any operators, that people who had been operating had ceased to operate the business.  If there is an opportunity there for somebody to operate a hackney licence successfully, then in that type of situation I do not think the fee of £11 for the licence and £30 for the vehicle, making a total of £41, is excessive.</P>

      <P>It is not.  It is my duty to the travelling public, who avail of these publicly licensed vehicles, to ensure that the standard of these vehicles is such that a good service can be given.  There were also many other aspects of the regulations regarding cleanliness and other matters for the protection of the public which were not raised in the question put down by the Deputy.  I am not keen to encourage persons to come in and take the bread and butter out of the mouths of people who are legitimately in the business, who depend on this business for their livelihood, who, like other members of the community, have a stake in the community.  They have family commitments, housing and other expenses which arise in the normal way for all citizens, and they should not have their livelihood grossly interfered with by persons who can enter into this trade to operate at night or to operate at the weekends purely to supplement an income which they otherwise have available to them.</P>
      <P>The regulations will be reviewed at the end of two years.  If Deputy Harte wants to have this matter included in the review I shall be pleased to have it looked at then.  I certainly have no reason to believe that there is any legitimate cause for complaint in the operation of the new regulations as introduced by me last autumn.</P>
