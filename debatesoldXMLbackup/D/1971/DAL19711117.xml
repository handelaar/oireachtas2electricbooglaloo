      <P>&ldquo;I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are to provide for the registration of private employment agencies and for the approval of the fees they may charge and to require such agencies to furnish returns of their activities.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, this Bill has been debated very fully in Seanad Éireann.  I should like to say, too, that it has been improved by suggestions and amendments made by the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business of employment agencies is defined in the Bill in very wide terms in order to include all persons or bodies engaged in recruiting workers for employment by others.  It will not, of course, affect the liberty of an employer <Col N="2160" /> to recruit his own workers for employment in his own business.  It will, however, include agencies which themselves employ workers to carry out work for other firms.</P>
    <P>Some Seanadóirí were anxious that agencies engaged in &ldquo;high class placement&rdquo; should be excluded from the terms of the Bill.  They were of opinion that consultancy firms engaged in the recruitment of high level staff should be treated differently from those agencies involved in the placing of other workers.  For reasons which I explained at length in the Seanad I am not in favour of excluding any group of agencies from the legislation. In my view it would be difficult to justify exclusion of such agencies solely because they specialise in particular types of placings or because they engage in other work&mdash;such as consultancy work&mdash;as well.  However, I will go into this more fully on Committee Stage if Deputies so wish.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the House that employment agencies which carry out their functions in a responsible manner will have nothing to worry about from this legislation.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill which gave rise to some discussion was the question of fees.  I have made it clear in the other House that it is not proposed to prescribe a scale or scales of fees which would have to be adhered to by all agencies.  I introduced an amendment to section 7 in the Seanad to clarify this point.  An agency will be required to submit its fees for approval but will be free to vary its charges to individuals within the rates approved. I think it reasonable to expect that commercial competition should prevent the charging of excessive fees.  One practice which can occur, and, in fact, has occurred here and elsewhere, is the charging of fees by agencies merely for recording a person's application for work.  I inserted a new subsection 7 (2) on Report Stage in the Seanad for the purpose of forbidding this practice.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Bill there has been a number of questions asked in this House in regard to the welfare of Irish potato workers in Scotland.  The complaints in regard to <Col N="2161" /> the welfare of Irish workers abroad in such circumstances emphasise the necessity for having legislation which will allow us to exercise some supervision over the operation of agents, particularly those recruiting workers for employment outside the State. Apart from the potato-pickers issue, there have been some complaints over the years about the activities of employment agents recruiting for employment abroad.  I feel that the controls proposed in this Bill are the minimum necessary to guard against abuses in such recruitment.  There are obvious difficulties about dealing with this problem in legislation, because many of the actual abuses can take place outside the jurisdiction.  The legislation must, therefore, concentrate on the point of recruitment in Ireland and aim at preventing recruitment taking place where irregularities can be anticipated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains specific provisions relating to the advertising of vacancies for employment abroad.  The aim is to eliminate misleading advertisements for employment abroad and the Bill provides for the making of regulations which will ensure that agencies advertising vacancies abroad will give in the advertisements either the name of the employer or of an agent licensed under the Bill.  This proposal has been discussed with representatives of the daily and provincial papers and they would welcome it. They feel that such a provision will strengthen their hands in dealing with doubtful advertisements.</P>
    <P>I should like here to refer to the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 96 concerning fee-charging employment agencies.  We are one of the few countries in western Europe which have not ratified it so far.  When this Bill is enacted I expect that this country will be in a position to ratify the convention.</P>
    <P>In defining fee-charging employment agencies, the convention distinguishes between employment agencies which are conducted with a view to profit and agencies which, although charging in some form or other for their services, are not conducted with a view to profit.  Ratification of the <Col N="2162" /> convention requires member countries to introduce some system under which fee-charging employment agencies would be registered.  The convention specifies in particular that agencies shall be subject to control in respect of fees and the placement and recruitment of workers for employment abroad.</P>
    <P>In brief, the primary purpose of the Bill is to safeguard our workers and employers against unfair practices by employment agencies, whether relating to jobs in Ireland or abroad, including the charging of excessive fees, and to protect our workers from advertisements for employment outside Ireland which are misleading or inaccurate in content.  The furnishing of returns of the activities of agencies will also help my Department in the implementation of the Government's manpower policy.  Finally, if this Bill becomes law the Government should be in a position to ratify the International Labour Organisation's Convention No. 96 and to bring our practice in relation to employment agencies into line with that of most western European countries.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill got a pretty full hearing in Seanad Éireann last March.  As a result of the representations of Members of the Seanad the Minister brought in some changes. The Bill is to be welcomed in regulating, to some extent, the activities in this area.  Perhaps we would have been better served had the Minister given us a brief, historical outline of the necessity for these agencies and the reason why they have been established over the last number of years.  There is one aspect of this matter to which I would like to draw attention.  This is the situation of <i>au pair</i> employment in this country and the difficulties which arise under it.  In the Seanad it was pointed out by a Member that London County Council, as far back as 1921, had regulations under bye-laws which, to some extent, regulated the situation. Bye-law No. 11 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An agent shall not propose or arrange for the employment abroad of any female person under the age <Col N="2163" /> of 18 years without first obtaining the sanction in writing of her parents or lawful guardian and unless he has satisfied himself that suitable arrangements have been made for the welfare of such person during the continuance of such employment and for her return to this country on the conclusion of such employment and that such employment is legal in the country in which the employment is to take place; and on making an engagement with such person he shall furnish to her free of cost a written document containing the provisions of this bye-law and stating that such provisions have been complied with; and he shall keep on the premises the written sanction of the parents or guardian for a period of 12 months from the date of the making of the engagement and shall, when required, produce such written sanction to any inspector or duly authorised officer of the council. The agent shall in any particular case, if so required by the council, furnish the council with full particulars of the arrangements.</P>
    <P>Regulation Bye-law No. 12 states, and this applies in every case, whether it be a female person under the age of 18 years or not:</P>
    <P>An agent shall, in every case in which he arranges for the employment abroad of any person or of the employment in this country of any person resident abroad, furnish such person free of charge with a copy of the contract or other document showing the terms and conditions of such employment drawn up in a language understood by such person and he shall keep a copy of such contract or other document on the premises for a period of 12 months from the date thereof and shall, when required, produce such copy, contract or other document to any inspector or duly authorised officer of the council.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some merit in bye-laws of this type.  As was mentioned in the Seanad, it is about time that these excellent conditions were incorporated in our statute law.  One of the great difficulties, and this was <Col N="2164" /> raised in the Seanad, is that of distinguishing between what one might call the run-of-the-mill agency and agencies catering for professional people at a pretty high level of recruitment.  The Minister adverted to this in his speech or in his reply to the Seanad.  Perhaps this matter could be more fully dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill could more adequately be dealt with on Committee Stage but I have one comment which I would like to make concerning this matter.  It is not proposed that a scale of fees should be exhibited in each employment agency but that the Minister should have the right to allow a certain scale to fees.  The Minister will not prescribe fees but will allow them.  This means that the Minister can disallow any scale of fees until the right scale is achieved.  One of the things to be applauded in this Bill is the right to go to a higher tribunal, the High Court, in any appeal from the Minister's decision. In general, we are in broad agreement with the principle of this Bill.  The Minister has referred to the abuses abroad in relation to potato-pickers and others.  In relation to the ILO Convention No. 96 the Minister says that it is necessary to have this Bill in order to be able to ratify that convention in this country.  I understand that this convention has not been ratified in England.  As was pointed out before, our particular conditions are closer to those of England than those of the Continent in regard to this matter.  Part 2 of the convention to which the Minister referred provides for the progressive abolition of fee-charging employment agencies conducted with a view to profit.  Part 3 provides for the regulation of fee-charging employment agencies including the agencies conducted with a view to profit.  Perhaps this is implied in the terms of the Bill but we would like to see a more clearly expressed declaration of Government policy on this matter.  The Minister, in replying to the debate on Committee Stage, might like to refer to this matter.  In general we welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this essential piece of social legislation on behalf of the trade union and <Col N="2165" /> labour movement generally.  The legislation is very much overdue.  The Minister is to be commended on bringing in this Bill even at this late stage in the history of social and industrial legislation in this country.  At the moment some 60-odd employment agencies are in operation, the vast majority of which operate from Dublin addresses.  Most of them are reputable but some of them are not.  I feel that the Minister has, quite rightly, brought in general legislation which will provide elementary public protection for Irish men and women and young people who must offer their skills on the labour market at large.  An effective step towards that elementary public protection is contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is essentially a preventative measure, preventing exploitation, abuse and questionable practices where conditions of employment are accepted by individual workers applying for employment. I am glad to note that the Minister has indicated that, on the adoption of this Bill, he will be in a position to ratify the ILO Convention No. 96.  It should be pointed out that that convention, as a general principle, hopes to see all countries abolishing the practice whereby workers generally, or employers, would have to pay a fee in respect of somebody being taken on and given a job.  This is one of the essential provisions of that ILO Convention.  I see nothing wrong in that because I think in a properly organised, Christian, humanitarian and socially conscious society neither an employee nor an employer should have to actually pay somebody in order to provide a job for some person.  The overriding hope that we have here that this Convention will be adopted by the Minister is certainly very welcome by the Labour Party and indeed, as indicated by Deputy Richard Burke, it is also welcomed by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions might be raised here on this Bill.  We are anxious to expedite this Bill, and if the Minister wishes he can have all Stages today. This Bill has been going through since last January and the sooner we get it on the Statute Book the better. I welcome in particular the provision, which we hope to see in operation, in <Col N="2166" /> relation to the placing of advertisements concerning employment in newspapers. I understand that the Minister in the debate in the Seanad and in other statements he made indicated he has had appropriate discussions with the representatives of the daily and the provincial newspapers and that they have welcomed the provision regarding advertisements for employment abroad.</P>
    <P>The elimination of misleading advertisements, which will prevent the placing of advertisements by outside agencies or by domestic agencies acting on behalf of employers on the Continent or further abroad, is certainly very welcome to the newspaper proprietors, and particularly welcome to the trade union movement.  Many of the newspaper advertisements in relation to employment in this country are indeed, open to question.  Many such advertisements do not even state the name of the employer.  That practice is undesirable.  I have seen quite a large number of firms who have suffered from a sense of closed mindedness in terms of employment and who suffer extraordinary reluctance in telling even their own employees of a vacancy in their undertaking. They place the usual advertisements in the newspapers headed by: &ldquo;National concern requires&rdquo; this, that or the other in terms of employment. Very frequently underneath one finds that the advertisement is inserted by an employment agency or a consultancy firm.  If we hope to have a democratic society in this country advertisement in relation to employment by all employers, whether they be employers of a trade union character, a private enterprise character, a public enterprise character or by Departments of State&mdash;we know Departments of State indicate their appropriate employment opportunities&mdash;should be openly inserted in the public Press without any kind of this allegedly confidential, behind closed doors approach which goes on in relation to many aspects of employment recruitment in this country, with the type of skulduggery that goes on in respect of interviews and in respect of placings.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that many workers looking for jobs do not necessarily want to disclose to their current employers <Col N="2167" /> that they are on the market for new jobs, and in that sense applications for employment must be confidential, but employers should not have it both ways in terms of taking on employees. Some of the advertisements are socially undesirable, socially discriminatory and socially a disgrace to an allegedly Christian community.  Employment agencies and employers should be prohibited from advertising employment which discriminates on sectarian grounds, sex grounds, marriage prohibition grounds and on differentiation of wage rates.  We see many advertisements in daily and provincial newspapers which indicate that married women need not apply. There is no provision in this Bill whereby that kind of practice is prohibited, that no employment agency should be permitted to advertise a job, certainly in its own agency, which would in effect say that married women are not wanted in the particular employment.</P>
    <P>Many agencies, by virtue of employer practice and social customs in this country in relation to employment, indicate of course that differentiated sex wage rates will apply.  This practice should be outlawed under the worker employment agency.  We have practices also where grossly misleading advertisements have been placed by some agencies&mdash;for example, for employment in South Africa.  We have seen advertisements placed by some agencies, some of them with offices in Dublin in the neighbourhood of Grafton Street, where employment opportunities of the most rosy hue and of the most socially desirable character were placed.  Irish people were recruited by such agencies to go to South Africa and take up employment there.  It could be a country in which they would be going into employment as white persons, a country discriminating against the coloured population.  These were, in essence, apartheid advertisements accepted by newspapers here. They were not denounced as they should have been denounced by a Government professing to be a Christian Government, a Government which did not allow anti-racialist manifestations. That kind of advertising should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> I am glad that this Bill will come to grips effectively with the abuse and exploitation of Irish men and women by fellow Irish men and women.  We do a good deal of breast-beating about the practices of foreigners but some Irish employment agents have shown a scant regard for the welfare of their fellow men and women when recruiting these for employment in Scotland and elsewhere.  This Bill will go a substantial way towards eliminating this kind of abuse.  It is the responsibility of the Government to legislate; and when &ldquo;Backbencher&rdquo; castigates politicians he should remember that it is not the Opposition who should be castigated but the Government.  Legislation is the responsibility of the Government and had this legislation been introduced even 12 months ago the appalling abuse of Irish workers in Scotland would not have occurred.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Burke's views about employment on the Continent.  A great number of young girls are recruited for employment as <i>au pairs</i>.  This is an area of employment which should be examined by the Government and steps should be taken to prevent abuses.  These young girls work in continental homes in appalling conditions. Their aim is to become proficient in a foreign language.  In the process they are exploited and some people collect fat fees for making the arrangements.  These practices should be investigated by the Minister and steps should be taken to ensure that abuses do not occur.</P>
    <P>My colleague in the Seanad, Senator Owens, referred to the notification of application for a licence.  Notice need be published in only one daily newspaper. An intending agency need publish just one notice in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and comparatively few may know that the notice has been published. <i>The Cork Examiner</i> is not exactly a national newspaper, though I think it could easily be one.  It could be <i>The Guardian</i> of this country; the standard in <i>The Guardian</i> is not that high.  Specifying just one daily newspaper could lead to subterfuge and the Minister might have a look at this provision again and specify at least <Col N="2169" /> two national newspapers.  That would mean that intending agencies could not get away with it.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service is inadequate.  Private enterprise employment agencies developed because successive Governments failed to establish a proper employment service, a service which could be of great help to workers in particular.  Had such an agency developed in the proper time it could have dealt with inquiries relating to domestic employment. There is unfortunately a certain snob value about some employment agencies. I hope that the work of replacement officers and civil servants in the employment offices will increase to such a degree that it will not be necessary to rely exclusively on private enterprise employment agencies to do national work.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in not having a double-barrelled register of such agencies giving a special exemption, as was sought, for a consultancy firm.  This would not have been in the national interest.  This is a genuine piece of legislation and as such I do not think that consultancy firms engaged in recruitment of high level staff &mdash;I like that phrase&mdash;should be treated differently from agencies involved in placing other workers&mdash;presumably low level staff, but we shall let that pass.  The Minister said in the Seanad that one matter with which many of the agencies were concerned was insisting that employers publish their names in advertisements seeking workers. He went on to say, at column 1056, Volume 69 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>They find objections to that.  They say that many firms would not wish it to be known that they are looking for particular staff.  They prefer it to be kept secret.  That is why they use agencies.  They will not be in favour of the rates of fees being displayed because in many cases it is the employer who pays the fee. They do not always like the job-seeker to see the potential bosses' fees because they might judge what they are worth from seeing what he is prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary statement. Certainly, many workers, if they were <Col N="2170" /> aware of what their employers have to pay some employment agencies, would demand a substantial increase in wages immediately.  If some typists doing temporary relief work only knew what their employer is paying the employment agency they would have a picket outside his office.  The Minister said that the reaction of the employment agencies is &ldquo;they do not always like the job-seeker to see the potential bosses' fees because they might judge what they are worth from seeing what he is prepared to pay&rdquo;. I hope we find out rapidly the scale of fees of such agencies.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from the organisation which represents about half, or at least 40 per cent, of the agencies, the Irish Federation of Employment Agents, in connection with this legislation and I understand the difficulties facing them.  The points they made to the Minister have been dealt with by him at length both at his meetings with them and in the Seanad discussion and I have no doubt that the fears they expressed, particularly about confidentiality of the firm's relations with employees, are not well founded.  I do not think the Department of Labour are so well equipped that they could have inspectors careering around inspecting the files of every individual looking for a job in each employment agency.  I think their fears, while understandable, are not as well founded as they might think.  Therefore, I think the legislation is particularly welcome.  I would stress that the majority of employment agencies are reputable and provide a service but the public interest and the rights of Irish men and women seeking employment transcend the role of any agency.  This legislation is most welcome.  I do not want to keep the Minister from that very important meeting at 11.30.  He shall have much on his mind in the next 15 minutes in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I want to welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on the speed with which he acted in preparing it after there had been alleged abuse in the city.  I want to say of the existing agencies that when one case of gross abuse came to light there was only one agency in my view which was suspect; the others seem to be doing their job quite well. Because of our history it is women who are mostly affected by this Bill. We must try to protect them in their employment abroad.  The Minister has placed the emphasis on this and has refused to exclude the more exclusive or higher staff appointments.  That was why the old fashioned legislation we had on this matter fell asunder.</P>
      <P>If you go back to the Public Health Act of 1980, or thereabouts, you find it dealt only with domestic servants.  Anything else was outside its scope.  The local authorities had to provide certain services so that girl applicants could wash their hands and so on, but that is as far as we went.  After that they could go where they liked and to whatever job they liked.  The Minister deserves credit for up-dating the legislation.  Is he consider going further I suggest he might think on these lines.  Because of our history we have two or three women's agencies which try to help emigrant girls but could we have a sort of joint industrial council for this type of business in which you would have a Government nominee, a representative of the agencies and of the voluntary societies to see what further changes are needed in the legislation and also to keep a close watch on any possible abuses, particularly in regard to women, by any agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the Minister cannot legislate for people abroad so that the whole emphasis must be on recruitment and the advice given to people going abroad by efficient management in these agencies.  We must start at the root as the Minister has done, and ensure that recruitment will be above board and efficient, and that the <Col N="2172" /> agencies will be able to place people in good employment.  Deputy Burke mentioned the <i>au pair</i> arrangement which, I suppose, could be examined. A small point that may not be in the Bill; as sport becomes more professional we find that young boys are being recruited here.  At the moment the better type of English football clubs will not accept a boy unless he has completed his intermediate certificate, not that the boy needs the certificate to play football but their view is that if he does not make the grade in cross-Channel football he can come back and will have time to become an apprentice, or something like that.  The Minister cannot guard against every possibility but our feeling is that any boy recruited for any form of sport abroad should at least have his intermediate certificate.  If he does not make the grade he can then return here and start again.  I know that many English and Scottish clubs, in fact, will send a boy on to university but these are the boys who make the grade at football, not the boys who do not make the grade and are sent back after a year or two.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this legislation and I hope that on Committee Stage if there are any shortcomings in the Bill we will remedy them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the reception the Bill has got.  As it had such a good screening in the Seanad, it was to be expected that it would have a short run here on Second Stage because if there is any merit at all in initiating legislation in the Seanad it must be reflected in its being given a short run in the Dáil.  This is one of the Bills that was initiated in the Seanad and discussed there fully on all Stages.  Some of the items questioned here are matters that were questioned in the Seanad also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Au pair</i> is one thing that has agitated the minds of some people when they think of any control being exercised over recruitment of employment.  In preparing the Bill this was something to which I and the officials of my Department gave considerable consideration. <Col N="2173" /> We did not have any difficulty in deciding in the end that it was another day's work.  The provisions of this Bill, which controls employment agencies, would not provide the type of machinery that would be required to effectively deal with the control of <i>au pair</i> arrangements.  <i>Au pair,</i> as the House is aware, is a type of cultural arrangement under which people come to learn the language and culture or go to learn the language and culture of another country.  It may be and no doubt is sometimes abused for the purpose of getting cheap domestic labour. Having said that, one must agree that on the whole it is worked very genuinely in 99 per cent of cases.  However, the fact that there might be any abuses would justify some control being exercised. Foreigners who come in under <i>au pair</i> arrangements are different from any other type of employee in some ways, particularly in that they are not compelled to apply for permits as aliens and they are not subject to the regulations regarding social welfare weekly contributions.  In any event, this is as much the concern of the Minister for Education and the Minister for Justice as it is the concern of the Minister for Labour and to properly supervise the different complaints that one would get would require some staff that would not be available under the provisions of this Bill anyhow.  Furthermore, recruitment of <i>au pair</i> people is very often done on a personal or family basis, maybe through religious Orders or through schools, and it would be extending the scope of this Bill to an extent where the actual provisions of the Bill regarding employment agencies would become immersed in a volume of other provisions or completely submerged so that the real purpose of this Bill as a control of employment agencies Bill could be lost.</P>
    <P>This Bill aims at controlling employment agencies.  For that reason the ratification of Part II of the ILO Convention 96 does not arise.  It would allow us to ratify Part III.  Part II calls for the abolition of employment agencies, Part III calls for the control of employment agencies.  It would allow us to ratify Part III.  That is the only part we would be concerned with.</P>
    <P>We do recognise, in bringing in <Col N="2174" /> this legislation, as other speakers have admitted, that we have employment agencies doing an excellent job, very well organised and acting in the best interests of their clients.  I should not like anything in the legislation to in any way jeopardise or impede the work which these agencies are doing nor would I like anyone to think that we are trying to put any undue obstacle in their way.  We are taking in the Bill powers to ensure that there are no abuses and these powers will eliminate abuses to the extent that some agents might find it difficult to operate at all. It will, as far as it is possible to do so, eliminate abuses such as those we had in relation to the potato pickers in Scotland but it will only be effective, as I already said, in so far as it will control recruitment and advertisements here.  It does not cover anything that happens outside the jurisdiction, and a considerable amount of recruitment in that respect does go on among the Irish abroad, the Irish who may be working in Coventry, London or other parts of England.  There is recruitment there for potato picking and it is difficult through this Bill to deal with that.  It is a matter for Foreign Affairs and I know that the Minister has recently taken very definite steps, particularly in considering the appointment of a representative to Scotland, to ensure that this will be eliminated as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill then are such as to ensure I would hope that ultimately we will have none but genuine agents doing a good job so that people who seek advice or use these agencies for the purpose of seeking employment will know that they are being dealt with properly and that they are dealing with legitimate organisations.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any major point at this stage to be dealt with. Matters will come up on Committee Stage.  Voluntary agencies are not intended to be affected by the Bill. Agencies which operate on an advisory basis or agencies which give a service such as religious communities will be exempted.  They may sometimes charge a small fee to cover expenses but could not be regarded as being in the same category as commercially organised, <Col N="2175" /> profit-making employment agencies.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables regulations to be made governing many things and these will in the usual way be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas which provide the necessary safeguards and there is also the provision for appeal to the High Court.  The legislation will not impinge in any way on the liberties of persons or unduly interfere with the business of legitimate concerns.  One has to have recourse to these things in introducing legislation of this kind.  I do not think the fears expressed in the Seanad with regard to inspections, the undue harassing of agencies and the prying into their records, were genuinely held by the people who raised them because there would be no purpose in abusing any of the privileges or powers given to persons acting as inspectors under the Bill to carry out their work in any but the necessary manner.  In almost every case it would be a general type of inspection.  The inspector would be satisfied by knowing that the agency was working in accordance with the requirements of the Bill.  Only where it was felt that a certain organisation was not conforming to the requirements of the Bill would there be any kind of onerous inspection or interference with the records of an agency. I do not think the agents' representative who came to see me about the legislation entertained any fear or doubts in that respect.  I should, however, like to repeat the assurance I gave in the Seanad that any powers taken by the Minister or those acting on his behalf will only be used in essential cases.  They will not be used to interfere unduly with the private working of a legitimate business concern such as a properly established agency will be.</P>
    <P>Once the Bill is in operation for some time it will probably, like every other piece of new legislation, show some defects or shortcomings and there is no reason why changes may not be brought about at that stage.  The power to make regulations will cover to a great extent many of the unforeseen difficulties and requirements which may be exposed as a result of the working of the legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2176" /> I do not think it is necessary to say anything further at this stage.  We covered the Bill fairly exhaustively in the Seanad and the House will have an opportunity of looking at all sections on Committee Stage although they have already been closely scrutinised in the Seanad but that is not to say that the House will not have an opportunity of doing that again.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which has been welcomed by all sides of the House, will also be welcomed by those people who are involved in the conducting of reputable agencies, legitimately established and already doing a good job.  I want to thank Deputies who have commended the Bill and welcomed the Second Stage.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1971 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill arises from recommendations that have been made by the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  In fact, it is only the first instalment of the legislation which will result from the work of the commission.  The commission were appointed in January, 1966, and their terms of reference cover the whole law of landlord and tenant with the exception of the rent restrictions code.  All the recommendations that have been made by the commission in the two reports which they have furnished to-date have been accepted by the Government subject only to relatively minor amendments.  This acceptance involves the promotion of legislation to make considerable changes in the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967.  A comprehensive Bill dealing with these changes is being prepared.  This Bill &mdash;the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1970 &mdash;was introduced in Dáil Éireann last December by way of long and short titles.  It will be a substantial and complicated piece of legislation involving the repeal and the re-enactment, with amendments, of the Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967.  This present Bill will also be absorbed in the comprehensive Bill. The text of the comprehensive Bill has yet to be finally settled.  Meanwhile, because a certain urgency attaches to some of the changes in the law recommended by the commission, the Government decided to introduce this present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was indicated in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated to Deputies when the Bill was introduced in Seanad Éireann last August, the Bill deals with three matters.  These are&mdash;<Col N="2181" /> first, the grant of sporting leases, secondly, the grant of renewal rights and of the right to purchase the fee simple to tenants holding under a certain type of pre-1931 lease and thirdly, a necessary amendment of section 10 of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967.  The proposed amendment of section 10 of the 1967 Act does not stem from the recommendations of the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  The section is, however, defective as it stands and it is desirable to amend it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The proposals that concern sports clubs are, of course, the most important. What is being proposed is that outdoor sports clubs should in certain circumstances have the right to a 99-year lease.  This proposal is based on a recommendation of the Landlord and Tenant Commission and it is designed to deal with a problem of considerable urgency.  Lands used for sporting purposes, such as golf courses and football grounds, are usually situated close to cities or towns.  The demand for land for development of one kind or another means that in many cases these lands have acquired a greatly enhanced value in recent years.  As a consequence, it is only natural that landlords should, in cases where the tenancy of a club has expired or is about to expire, be increasingly tempted to refuse to grant a new tenancy to the club and to hand over the land for purposes of development. Under existing law, a sports club normally has no right to obtain a new tenancy from its landlord.  Unless the law is changed, therefore, it is likely that many clubs will simply disappear. The Government recognise, just as the commission do in their report, that facilities for outdoor sports confer important benefits on the community. We recognise also that any loss of these facilities could well be irretrievable since clubs, once dispossessed, are most unlikely to be able to provide themselves with fresh sportsgrounds, at least where the larger centers of population are concerned.  We believe that action must be taken now if these facilities are, as far as possible, to be preserved.  The Government have <Col N="2182" /> therefore decided to promote this legislation.</P>
    <P>The solution proposed by the commission, and which the Government have accepted with certain amendments, is that where a club uses land for outdoor sport or recreation and where it satisfies certain conditions it should be given a right approximating to the right to a reversionary lease under the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.  The conditions to be satisfied are designed to ensure that only clubs that have a genuine claim will stand to benefit. Broadly speaking, the proposals in the Bill are that the validity of a club's claim should be tested in two ways.  The first relates to the term of its lease, or, if it does not hold under a lease, the lenth of time it has held the land.  The second relates to the club's investment in the land.  The club must have expended a reasonable sum in developing or adapting the land so as to render it more suitable for the purpose of the sport&mdash;for instance, on club buildings, drainage, the levelling of the land and so on.</P>
    <P>The Bill modifies the recommendation of the commission in a number of ways.  As regards the length of time, the qualifying period recommended by the commission has been reduced from 25 to 21 years.  The Bill proposes that a club should qualify in this respect if it has been in continuous occupation or possession for the purpose of the sport for 21 years prior to its application for the lease or if it holds the land for that purpose under a lease the term of which is not less than 21 years.  Furthermore, the Bill proposes that continuous possession for the purpose of sport for the necessary period will suffice.  That is to say, a club is not necessarily being required to show that it had a formal tenancy or series of tenancies during the qualifying period.  Provision is also being made to clarify the position where the land is not used solely by the sports club&mdash;for instance, where the landlord has retained grazing rights.  In such a case, it is being provided that user of the land for the purposes of sport must be the primary user, if the club is to benefit.  The Bill again modifies the commission's recommendation in relation <Col N="2183" /> to the minimum sum that has to be spent on development of the land or on buildings.  The commission recommended that the club's expenditure in this regard should be not less than 15 times the amount of the yearly rent. The Bill follows this recommendation as far as it goes but it proposes also that the amount must be at least £1,000.  On the other hand, the Bill does not include a condition which was recommended by the commission, namely, that there should be permanent buildings on the land which are used in connection with the land for the purpose of the sport although the Bill does allow the expenditure requirement to be met in whole or in part by expenditure by the club on permanent buildings provided those buildings are used in connection with the sport.  In section 2 (3) of the Bill, special provision is being made for a situation where a subsidiary portion of the land used for sport does not fulfil all the conditions required to attract the right to a new tenancy but the major portion does or is freehold.  In order to preserve the club as a going concern in such a case, the Bill proposes to ease the conditions to enable the club to obtain a lease of the subsidiary land.  The proposed conditions require the club either to have a lease of the subsidiary land for a term of not less than 12 years or to show that it has been in continuous occupation or possession of that land for at least 12 years.  A further condition is that the subsidiary land does not amount to more than one-fourth of the total area of land which the club uses for sport.</P>
    <P>The Bill also modifies the recommendations of the commission in relation to the terms on which the new lease&mdash;which is called a &ldquo;sporting lease&rdquo; in the Bill&mdash;is to be granted. The commission recommended that the new lease should approximate to a reversionary lease granted under the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, that is, a lease for a 99-year term at a ground rent.  The most important modification of the 1958 Act provisions that they recommended was that the rent should be subject to review at 33-year intervals at the option of the lessor.  This modification <Col N="2184" /> was reflected in the Bill as introduced in Seanad Éireann.  However, I accepted the general view of the Seanad that 33 years was too great an interval between reviews of the rent and section 5 (3) (a) of the Bill now provides for reviews of the rent at 25-year intervals.  That means that the lessor can now procure reviews of the rent on three occasions during the term of the lease, instead of two as the commission recommended.  While the Bill gives effect to the other variations of the 1958 Act provisions that the commission recommended, it does not follow the recommendations of the commission in regard to the method of fixing the rent in a sporting lease. If the Act of 1958, as amended by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, were to be applied to sporting leases, as the commission recommended, the rent would be fixed at one-eighth of the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo;, that is, one-eighth of the national open-market rent.  This is the formula which has evolved over the years for determining the ground rent of built-on land, but I think it is clear that it is a formula that reflects the fact that much the greater part of the value derives from the buildings rather than from the land itself.  It would, in my view, be inappropriate to apply this formula in the case of a sports club where the land itself rather than the clubhouse or other building normally constitutes by far the more valuable element.  Accordingly, the Bill proposes that the club should be required to pay a fair rent, just as they would have had to pay if there had been no danger of clubs being refused new tenancies because of encroaching urban development and no need for this Bill at all.  Accordingly, section 6 provides that, where the rent in a sporting lease has to be determined by the court&mdash;because the parties concerned have failed to agree&mdash;the court shall fix a fair rent.  This section also provides guidelines for the court in the determination of a fair rent.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of sporting leases, I think I should mention also the provision relating to compensation for disturbance.  Subsection (3) of section 4 provides that the compensation provisions of the 1958 Act shall apply in a case where a sports club that is <Col N="2185" /> otherwise entitled to a sporting lease fails to obtain one because the landlord or any superior landlord is able to satisfy the court on a number of specific points.  One of these points is that he requires the land for development and has obtained planing permission, and another is that it is reasonable that a sporting lease should be refused.  The application of the compensation provisions of the 1958 Act means that compensation will be measured in accordance with the court's opinion of the extent of the loss suffered by the sports club as a direct consequence of the refusal of the sporting lease.</P>
    <P>The only remaining matter that I believe I should mention at this stage in connection with sporting leases concerns the proposals contained in subsection (7) of section 2.  This subsection proposes that the provisions relating to sports clubs shall operate from 3rd March, 1970.  This was the date of a public announcement of the Government's decision, which had been taken that day, to frame legislation in relation to sports clubs on the general lines of the recommendations contained in the Second Report of the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  The official statement of that day, which was released through the Government information Bureau, stated that it was proposed that the benefits accruing under the legislation would operate from the same day.  The statement was published at the time so that all those who might be affected would be aware of what was intended and thus enabled to negotiate in the knowledge of the proposed changes in the law.</P>
    <P>The second matter with which the Bill is concerned is dealt with in sections 8 and 9.  This matter is of particular concern to certain tenants in Sandycove, County Dublin, and to others holding in similar circumstances. Section 8 is a replacement for section 10 of the Reversionary Leases Act of 1958.  It extends the right to a reversionary lease under the 1958 Act, and consequentially the right to acquire the fee simple under the Ground Rents Act of 1967, to a new class of tenants who hold under a certain type of pre-1931 lease.  These tenants did not qualify for such rights <Col N="2186" /> under the Acts of 1958 and 1967 because their houses, although built by the original lessees under what would nowadays be called building leases, reverted to the landlord when the original leases came to an end. The landlord subsequently granted new leases to persons who had no entitlement to the lessee's interest under the old lease.  Consequently, when these new leases in turn began to run out the tenants who held them, since they were not the successors of the original lessees, had no right to a renewal under the 1958 Act.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission in their Second Report have recommended that the right to a reversionary lease under the Act of 1958, together with the right to acquire the fee simple under the Act of 1967, should be extended to the tenants in question. They also recommended that, in line with similar provisions in the 1958 and 1967 Acts, these rights should be available for a limited period to those lessees whose leases expired up to five years prior to the amending legislation provided the lessee under the expired lease was still in possession of the property, that he had not entered into a new arrangement with the landlord and that no other person was entitled to a reversionary lease of the property. The proposals in section 9, which concern lessees whose leases have already expired and which, as I have said follow similar provisions in the 1958 and 1967 Acts, concern particularly certain tenants in Sandycove.  The situation of the Sandycove tenants whose leases have expired is what gives urgency to these proposals and it is the reason for their inclusion in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from provisions based on the recommendations of the Landlord and Tenant Commission the Bill deals with one final matter, that is, an amendment of section 10 of the Rent Restrictions Act of 1967 to remedy a defect in that section.  In accordance with section 10 of that Act the tenant of a rent-controlled dwelling must, generally speaking, have the landlord's written consent to an assignment of the dwelling. This provision has had an in advertent result in the case of those dwellings that technically come under <Col N="2187" /> the Rent Acts but are held on long leases.  The application of the Rent Restrictions Acts&mdash;which involves the control of rents together with protection of possession&mdash;was extended by section 2 of the 1967 Rent Act to owner-occupier dwellings.  These are dwellings whose occupiers hold under leases for terms of more than 21 years. The extension in 1967 of the application of the Rent Acts to owner-occupied dwellings was necessary for the protection of lessees, mainly certain owner-occupiers in Sandycove&mdash; the same people with which sections 8 and 9 of the Bill are concerned&mdash; who had no protection in regard either to security of possession or the level of rent once their existing leases expired. One of the consequences of the application of the Rent Acts was, however, as I have mentioned, that the tenant's right to assign his interest is restricted.  This means that the owner-occupier of a dwelling held on a long lease and coming under the Rent Acts cannot make a valid assignment of his property without the landlord's consent. There are certain circumstances where this restriction does not apply, namely, where the dwelling is used in part for business purposes, where the lease expressly authorises assignment without consent or where the assignment is to a <i>bona fide</i> resident member of the tenant's family.  An assignment made without the landlord's consent, where such consent is required, is void. Section 10 of the Bill is designed to rectify the matter, with effect from the passing of the 1967 Rent Act, and to validate any assignments that may be void solely by reason of section 10 of that Act.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Bill will meet with the approval of the House.  It is, as I have said, only the first instalment of a considerable body of legislation that arises from recommendations made by the Landlord and Tenant Commission. Before I conclude, I should like to take this opportunity to express on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government our thanks for the very valuable work which the members of the commission have done and continue to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has told us that a comprehensive Bill dealing with the landlord and tenant code and codifying, so to speak, the Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967, will be circulated in the future. He has not told us when exactly he hopes to circulate this Bill.  It was introduced last year and my own opinion is that it is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The landlord and tenant law is a highly complicated code.  It is set out in very technical Acts that have been amended from time to time and it is no exaggeration to say that general practitioners in the legal profession find it difficult to follow the implications of these Acts and that apart from specialists, very few people are really familiar with the complicated landlord and tenant law as we have it.  I think the Minister said that he was endeavouring to ensure that the new Bill he is introducing will be as simple as possible and that the sections will be easy to follow.  That would be welcomed by the public generally as well as by the legal profession.</P>
      <P>Landlord and tenant law is a branch of the law which affects a great number of people and it can be viewed from two points of view.  It can be viewed from the point of view of the landlord on the one hand who relies on it as a source of income, and from the point of view of the tenant on the other hand who occupies property as a dwelling or as a place of business.  There are strong arguments on either side.  I am of the opinion, and I have been strongly of the opinion for some time that the trend should be to enable tenants in occupation, lessees in occupation, to buy out the landlord's interest, to purchase the fee simple interest, on reasonable terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our landlord and tenant code refers to building leases and reversionary leases and it is very hard to fit it into the various categories.  In conferring a right on a tenant or lessee to purchase the interest, regard should be had to the age of the building.  Regard should be had to the length of time for which it has been let, and regard should be had to the amount paid for the property by the lessor.  That is not taken into <Col N="2189" /> account at present, I think.  It is interesting to note that that feature appears in this Bill.  So far as I know, this is the first time that such a yard-stick for fixing the rent has been introduced into legislation.</P>
    <P>Where a lessor or his predecessor has not been in possession of property or buildings for 50 years or upwards, and many of them have not been in occupation for much longer than that, and have not spent any money on it, and where that property has been maintained and improved and insured by the tenant, the tenant should be given the opportunity as of right to buy out the fee simple interest in that property on reasonable terms.  One of the considerations to be taken into account should be the cost of that property to the landlord when it was built or when it was bought by him.  In doing that no injustice would be created against the landlord.</P>
    <P>It is in the national interest that as many people as possible should own the building in which they live or work because, if they own those buildings, they will be more likely to spend money on them, to keep them in proper repair, and to decorate them. The general overall picture would be that our towns would look better and be more attractive, and that property would be kept in better condition.  That is all I want to say in a general way about the landlord and tenant code.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are moving fast enough towards conferring a right of purchase.  Although there is a trend in that direction, I do not think we are moving fast enough especially in regard to property which has been out of the possession of the landlord for a great number of years or, in fact, in cases where it has never been in the possession of the landlord.</P>
    <P>This is a piecemeal effort, as the Minister has said, to deal with matters requiring urgent attention.  The first provision in the Bill confers on sporting clubs the right to retain possession of land used for sporting purposes.  It is right that that provision is being introduced. It is correct that sporting clubs should have fixity of tenure on reasonable terms.  Otherwise, as the Minister said, with the increasing value of land <Col N="2190" /> in urban areas, or in areas adjacent to towns, the probability is that sporting clubs will be ejected and the land used for other purposes.  Around the city of Dublin there is a trend towards race courses being sold and the land used for development because the value of land has increased enormously and because land is becoming scarce in the vicinity of cities and large towns.  So far as this provision is concerned to give leases for 99 years to sporting clubs that have been in occupation for 21 years, I think, it is reasonable.</P>
    <P>It is right, too, that the Minister should go further, as he has done, and give them a right to acquire the lease of land rented by sporting clubs subsequent to the original lease or the parent lease and used for a shorter time.  Occupiers of this type of land will qulify for a new lease if they have been in occupation for 12 years. That is reasonable because golf clubs and other sporting clubs have increased the area of land used by them over the years.  If that provision were not in the Bill there could be a situation in which a sports club could get a lease for portion of the land occupied by them, and could not get a lease for the rest of the land.  The point was raised in the Seanad that the figure should be ten years instead of 12 years.  I suppose there has to be a beginning and an end some place and by and large 12 years is not altogether unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I also agree that it was right not to follow the recommendation of the commission in regard to the fixing of rent for this type of land and that one-eighth of the market rent would not be reasonable in this case.  The argument put forward by the Minister is rather sound, that in the reversionary lease, under the landlord and tenant code, buildings were the important things, the valuable things, that the buildings had not been put there by the lessor but by the lessee.  Here it is different. It is the land which is valuable.</P>
    <P>In section 6 it is stated that the rent to be fixed by the court, if the court has to fix the rent, is to be the fair rent.  The section does not stop there. It goes on to set out all sorts of guidelines and, if my reading of these guidelines is correct, each and every one is <Col N="2191" /> weighted in favour of the sporting clubs.  Subsection (2) provides:</P>
    <P>In fixing the rent the court shall have regard to the general intention of this Act in relation to sports clubs which is the advancement of outdoor sports, games and recreations and the preservation of open spaces for the common good and, without prejudice to such other considerations as it considers relevant, may take into account the rent or other sum previously paid for the property by the sports club and any covenants and conditions under which it was so paid, to the rent paid by other sports clubs of the same kind in the same or comparable locality, to the contribution made by the sports club to the enhancement of the property, and to the price paid by any person who is a necessary party to the granting of the lease in the acquisition of his estate or interest.</P>
    <P>This is the provision I mentioned earlier.  The provision in relation to taking into account the amount paid by the lessor would be very relevant if the lessor had acquired the property within the past few years when it was subject to the tenancy in favour of the sports club but I think that all those guidelines there are weighted against the owner of the land and in favour of the sports club.  It looks to me as if the court is being invited to fix a low rent because the land is being used for the advancement of outdoor sports, games, recreation and the preservation of open spaces.</P>
    <P>The rent fixed in these cases should be a fair rent and I would invite the Minister on Committee Stage to put another guideline in there, a guideline which would enable the courts to have regard to the financial position of the sports club or the members of the sports club.  I do not think that is unreasonable.  You could have a very wealthy sports club who would be in a position to pay a market rent or a fair rent.  That is something that the court should be entitled to take into account.  You could have a sports club whose members were comparatively <Col N="2192" /> well off people who could afford to increase their subscription and in those circumstances it would not be reasonable that the owner of the land should subsidise the club.  Rather, the club members should increase the subscription in order to pay a reasonable rent. On the other hand, you could have a struggling football club or some other club that was not wealthy or whose members were not wealthy and which was catering for a different section of the community, a section not so well off, and that is something that should be taken into consideration.  In making this suggestion to the Minister I am not breaking any new ground because another section of an Act that I will be speaking about in a few minutes already enables the court to take into account the financial circumstances of the landlord and of the tenant in fixing a rent under section 4 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1967, which was in force for only two years.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see powers being given to the court to insert a covenant providing for the termination of the lease should the property cease to be used for sports purposes because many abuses could arise where a lease would be got under this section and then the sports club might fold up and the property pass to one of its members or to somebody else and be used for commercial purposes.  It is right that that provision should be inserted.</P>
    <P>The next matter covered by the Bill is the renewal of leases which have fallen between two stools, with particular reference to the Sandycove area of Dublin and the Proby estate.  This is something that might be dealt with in more detail on Committee.  Something is being done in this Bill to improve the situation and to improve the lot of the tenants but I understand that sufficient is not being done.  Deputy Cosgrave is much more familiar with this problem than I am and I understand he may deal with it.  These tenants complain that they have been deprived of the right to purchase the fee simple interest in this property because they were compelled to renew their leases at rents which exceeded the poor law valuation and were, <Col N="2193" /> therefore, disqualified from the right to purchase the fee simple interest.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted&mdash;I am speaking in a general way&mdash;that there is a severe hardship on the tenants on this estate, the Proby estate, that advantage has been taken of them and that the landlords took advantage of technicalities in the law which enabled them to exploit the tenants and to deprive the tenants of rights which it was intended that they should have.  I understand that this Bill does not go far enough to completely cure that situation and I would ask the Minister to listen carefully to arguments which will be put forward and to go the whole hog and put an end to this.</P>
    <P>The next point covered by the Bill is the amendment of section 10 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1967, which really had results which were never intended by the framers of the section or by this House.  As Senator O'Higgins said in the Seanad, the members of the legal profession took the bull by the horns and ignored that particular section and proceeded as if it were not there.  I am glad that the Minister now confirms the action of thelegal profession and that he has made this section retrospective.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is unusual to hear someone from these benches or, indeed, someone from the Opposition side of the House approving of retrospective legislation.  I want to go on record as saying that, in general, I am utterly opposed to retrospection in legislation but there is a difference here because this is simply to cure a mistake which this House made on a previous occasion and to re-enact the law as it was intended it should be in 1967.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I am sorry has been left out of this Bill although it is not strictly relevant to it.  The Minister might have availed of this Bill to amend or re-enact section 4 of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, just as he availed of this Bill to amend section 10 of the same Act.  Section 4 of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, enabled the landlords of short tenancies, weekly tenancies, <i>et cetera,</i> to have the rent of those tenancies revised and revised on very fair terms.  That is the section I <Col N="2194" /> spoke about a few minutes ago.  I shall not read it in detail; it is a long section. That section has written into it that the court shall take into consideration in revising the rent the circumstances of the landlord, the circumstances of the tenant and shall proceed on the basis that hardship will not be worked on either party.  But, the very last two lines of that section&mdash;subsection (3) of section 4 of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967&mdash; say that no applications shall be made under section 8 of the principal Act after the expiration of two years from the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>From memory, I think that was the 9th May, 1969, and that slipped the attention of many people who wished to have their rents adjusted one way or the other, and I understood from the Minister that the intention was to re-enact that section for a further period; as a matter of fact, when I saw an amendment of section 10 of the Act of 1967 I thought for a moment this was the section we were dealing with, but it is not.  I think the Minister should have dealt with that section in this Bill.  It would be just as relevant to deal with section 4 as it was to deal with section 10.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, this Bill is another example of how Bills like this can be introduced in the Seanad and dealt with there in a very constructive way.  This Bill was introduced in the Seanad and got a very full reading there, but the Minister's approach to this was somewhat different from his approach to the Courts Bill.  He had his mind more or less made up about this Bill, and I do not think many amendments, if any, were made to it in the Seanad.  At any rate, it got a full, constructive, intelligent reading and debate there, and on that account it will not take so long to deal with it here.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the Minister in his word of thanks to Judge Conroy and the other members of the Landlord and Tenant Commission for the work they are doing, for the patience they are showing and the reports they are bringing in.  We propose to give the Minister the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Col N="2195" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said about the terms of the Bill and to join with him and with the Minister in complimenting the commission under the chairmanship of Judge Conroy for the manner in which they have considered the very complex aspects of laws that affect a great many people.  Some of us who had occasion, one way or another, to appear before the commission on behalf of constituents who were intimately concerned with the problem, appreciate the amount of time and attention given, and indeed, the generous way in which the commission listened to the various matters that were brought before them.  They endeavoured to give a full and fair hearing to everyone who wished to make representations.  The Bill, as the Minister said, is an interim part of a much more extensive proposal to amend the Landlord and Tenant Laws, but urgent problems have arisen which have been the subject of concern to a number of people in certain respects, as a result of which this measure has been brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a general welcome for the proposal in respect of sports grounds and sports clubs.  This, I suppose, in the main applies to golf courses, football grounds and sports clubs of that character.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, however, did refer to another aspect of it which may not involve a very large number of cases but which might well be the subject of some investigation. So far as Dublin is concerned, up to the moment there are three race courses here: one of them is now the property of the Racing Board, Leopardstown, and will continue to be used and has been very greatly developed as a permanent race course.  However, there are places where race courses may no longer be available for one reason or another.  The general question of sporting amenities of this character might be considered, because, as the Minister said in the course of his introductory speech, if property is once developed it is impossible to restore it to its former use.  This aspect of the matter and the need for sporting facilities in areas adjacent to both cities <Col N="2196" /> and towns might require further investigation.  The work which the commission did on this aspect of the matter showed a considerable amount of enlightened thought.  I know they received many representations from sporting clubs on the matter and gave it very full consideration.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of this that I am particularly interested in is the proposal to deal with a matter concerning certain tenants in Sandycove, County Dublin.  Sandycove, Dún Laoghaire, is in my own constituency and I am very familiar with the problem which has agitated the minds of a number of tenants there of the Proby Estate.  This has been the subject of discussions in this House both by way of debate and Parliamentary Questions, and was the subject of strong representations by the tenants themselves to the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  This indicates that the landlord concerned, and his representatives, had full knowledge of the situation as it existed, and that in fact, while the Landlord and Tenant Commission were sitting and considering this problem steps were taken, and successfully taken, to coerce some tenants to enter into arrangements with the landlord under exorbitant terms.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary on this occasion to go into the whole history of this matter, but I think it is generally known that the manner in which these estates were acquired a very long time ago does not in any way entitle the successors of those who acquired these estates to deal in the arbitrary and dictatorial manner in which the successors in title have attempted, and successfully so in certain specific cases, with tenants and occupiers of houses.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick rightly pointed out, the position here arises because of the complicated problem of building leases and reversionary leases. The 1931 Act did not cover these cases. Apparently in certain respects, neither did the 1958 Act nor the 1967 Act cover them either.  I know that the Minister has received representations from the tenants concerned and has got details of the specific cases.  It is not necessary to name the persons concerned. <Col N="2197" /> I will outline the details briefly.</P>
    <P>While the Landlord and Tenant Commission were considering this matter, proceedings were taken against certain tenants whose leases had expired and because of the loophole that existed in the 1958 Act the Proby Estate took action against the tenants. In one specific case the tenant successfully contested ejectment on four occasions but he ultimately had to settle for a very substantial sum of money.  This man settled for £3,000 because of the loophole in the 1958 Act.  The settlement was forced on him because of the loophole.  Another tenant, having no lease, was seeking to get rights and privileges similar to those which it is now proposed to confer on others.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> that it is commonly accepted that some if not all of the houses on the estate were not built by the previous landlord, Lord Proby.  In fact, this was admitted in court during the eviction proceedings against one particular tenant.  The matter was very complex.  The commission had to deal with a great problem.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill deal with the claims of certain tenants but because this was not done in earlier legislation some tenants have been excluded.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick when he says that normally everyone dislikes retrospective legislation. In this particular case the landlord and his agents were aware that the Landlord and Tenant Commission were sitting and investigating the whole question.  While this investigation was being conducted, and when it was obvious that the commission would sit for a long time, steps were taken to compel certain tenants to settle with the estate.  These tenants were unlucky in that their leases were expiring.  Because of this some of them were forced to settle.  This surely was a case in which, if the recommendation which is now being implemented in sections 8 and 9 had been applied in the Acts of 1958 or 1967, the problem would have been covered.</P>
    <P>This matter should be considered <Col N="2198" /> with a view to covering the cases of people who have had to come to terms. Obviously tenants in an estate of this character have little power to deal with wealthy landlords and are forced to come to terms.  It could be said that the exorbitant terms with which certain tenants had to comply in order to remain in possession of their houses highlighted the problem.  The same unjust action would have been taken against the other tenants but for the fact that their leases did not expire at that particular time.  For that reason another look should be taken at individual cases and, if possible, amendments should be introduced which would cover them.  The individual cases do not need to be mentioned here by name.  It is generally acknowledged that full details are available to the Minister and were presented by the persons concerned to the Landlord and Tenant Commission.</P>
    <P>I support the view expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick that in so far as possible the tendency should be to enable the tenants to purchase their houses.  The general improvement from the point of view of having an interest and a stake in their dwellings is obvious.  This is in line with general policy adopted in respect of local authority housing.  It must result in people taking more interest not only in their own property but also in the locality as well.</P>
    <P>As was mentioned earlier, this is a complex and difficult part of the law. Any steps which can be taken for the implementation of the recommendations of the commission in the wider legislation mentioned by the Minister will undoubtedly be welcomed by persons affected and legal practitioners. The earlier Acts are extremely complex. Those who had to study law will remember that special study of the terms of these Acts was required of them.  In many cases there was a special course dealing with aspects of these Acts.  Anything that will simplify the study of it or simplify the application and interpretation of it for those concerned will be welcome.  This particular piece of legislation is an interim measure to deal with certain urgent <Col N="2199" /> problems and to that extent we will give it as speedy a passage through this House as it got through the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would like to urge again that the tenants on the Proby Estate at Sandycove who are not covered by this legislation should be covered.  The fact that this has been discussed here may bring to light cases that have not already been notified.  There are a number of cases of very great hardship.  Because of the manner in which action was taken to deprive them of rights which are now being granted to other tenants, at a time when the Landlord and Tenant Commission are sitting, this reinforces the case for retrospective legislation.  In this case the landlord took action to &ldquo;jump the gun&rdquo;. He took action because of the state of the law at the time, but knowing the commission was sitting and realising the circumstances and the difficulties of tenants who had no option but to try and come to terms with him.  This now reinforces the case for taking remedial action to compensate the people concerned and to put them in a position where their situation will be the same as the other tenants who have been covered by the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, on behalf of the Labour Party, to welcome this Bill and to make a few brief comments on it.  The Minister said that the Bill deals with three specific problems as a result of the Conroy Commission on landlord and tenant problems.  The Bill is made necessary at this time because of the demand for building land and for building development, particularly in the cities and the larger towns in this country.  The developers' eyes are turning to the last remaining green belts in the city of Dublin, such as sports grounds, whether they be race courses, football clubs or golf courses. Only the corporation parks are safe. There are still three race courses adjacent to Dublin and one of these, Baldoyle, has already been sold to a developer.  This leaves Leopardstown and the Phoenix Park and I believe both of these are being preserved for people who want to follow that sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> There are two golf courses, at Newlands and at Lucan, awaiting the passage of this Bill since there is a threat to their continuance on their present sites.  Golf courses are the only open spaces in some areas and the pressure to have these developed for housing and other purposes is very great.  Those of us who have advocated the great need for houses in the city and in our own constituencies must realise the conflict which exists.  Once development takes place on these open spaces they are developed indefinitely and one must strike a balance between the need to preserve certain open spaces in a built-up area.  I feel there is land available for housing in this city and in other areas&mdash;areas such as Bray, near the centre of the town&mdash; which can be developed for housing and office building.  If these last remaining open spaces are used, then our towns and cities will become congested and will have no lungs to breathe.</P>
    <P>The chances of a person living in an area where there is a golf course becoming a member of that golf club and using its facilities are almost nil, since most 18-hole golf clubs have a membership of approximately 1,000. Very many people in the areas where those golf courses are situated have no chance of availing of that amenity. Any club which takes advantage of this legislation should have represented on its committee some people from the adjacent locality who will insist on people from that area being allotted places in that golf club.  The practice has grown up that when two or three vacancies occur in a golf club in a particular area these are given to the friends of the committee and certainly to people who have generous incomes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and who can afford the very high subscription rates which many city clubs require at the moment.  I feel this Bill is preserving the restrictive practices which exist in golf clubs at the moment.  I hope the Minister, when we come to the Committee Stage, will see to it that people <Col N="2201" /> who live in the different areas will have some say over the use of these open spaces if sporting leases are granted. Newlands and Lucan hope to have their leases extended when this Bill is passed and I believe there are others as well.  There is, however, the position where golf clubs are offered such large sums of money for their land that they can afford to sell off to the developers, go to the outskirts of the city and maybe even as far as my constituency, buy land at a much cheaper rate and start a new golf course or a new sports ground in that area.  The type of person who is a member of these golf clubs can afford to drive down on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning and use the facilities of the club while those who have built beside the original club find that the old club is developed without their having any say in that development. There is no pressure group and the committee of the club is not really representative of those in the particular area.  That is one point I make in regard to golf clubs.  It is a point worthy of note.  The committees of these clubs are not democratic.  They are not representative of the area.  I should like some provision whereby local representation on such committees would be insisted upon particularly in the case of those clubs which may avail of this measure to get extension of leases.</P>
      <P>The section dealing with the Proby Estate has largely been dealt with by other speakers.  On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill and I hope it will be implemented with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Dáil for its approval of the Bill.  The main point of difficulty was that raised by Deputy Cosgrave in relation to the Proby Estate.  I do not think the problem is as widespread or as grave as he suggests.  Neither do I think it is right to say, as Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests, that the amelioration of the position of these tenants does not, in fact, go far enough.  The Bill is retrospective for a period of five years.  That is, I think, as long as anybody could reasonably expect.  So far as I can ascertain&mdash;this, I think, is borne out <Col N="2202" /> by what Deputy Cosgrave said&mdash;the only people who are not satisfied are the two people we know of who entered into contracts before the question of this change in the law came up.  I have great sympathy with them because, quite clearly, they have had to pay a great deal more than those who were able to avoid entering into contracts.  On the other hand, what Deputy Cosgrave suggests would be rather dangerous.  He suggests that the Oireachtas should come along and set aside existing and executed contracts. While one might think it not entirely morally wrong to seek to do this, the fact is that, if one accepts the principle that the Government should promote legislation to upset existing and executed contracts, then there would be no knowing where this would end.  I am advised that any such exercise could run into serious constitutional difficulty.  If this sort of principle were pushed to its logical conclusion, one could visualise a situation in which a Government would ask the Oireachtas to set aside contracts between individuals simply because the Oireachtas did not like one of the individuals concerned. Indeed, the Oireachtas could be asked to do that in respect of contracts into which the Government had itself entered.  The principle is a bad one and, because it is, I could not accept it.  But, even if I were willing to accept it, I am precluded by the Constitution from doing so.  That is not to say that I do not sympathise with individuals who have been forced by the Proby Estate to settle with the estate. Fortunately, they seem to be few in number.  We have had details of only two.  There have been references to the possibility that there may be a few more: these may have settled on more advantageous terms.  I am satisfied the Bill goes as far as it can go.  It benefits almost everybody affected by the unusual nature of the leases or tenancies in this estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is really only a small first instalment of a great deal of new legislation.  I introduced a comprehensive Bill last December by way of Long and Short Titles.  It has not been possible, unfortunately, to publish <Col N="2203" /> that Bill yet because of its great complexity and the difficulty in drafting it.  I would refer the House to section 4 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1967.</P>

      <P>I will come to that. What I want to do now is to give an example of how complex this legislation can be.  Section 4 is simply the insertion of a new subsection in section 8 of the Principal Act, the 1960 Act, and this subsection runs to five full pages.  It is very difficult to read a subsection of this length and then to go back and insert all that into section 8 of the principal Act and then read the whole of the new section 8.  Although I am not altogether certain about it, the section may ultimately run to ten pages.</P>

      <P>That gives one an example of the difficulty in drafting this type of legislation.  I asked the draftsman to try, so far as is humanly possible, to make this legislation less complex but I am not certain that it is possible, unfortunately.  The fact that a subsection alone runs to five pages shows the problems we have and I say this by way of apology to the House for the delay in the appearance of the main Bill.  So far as the content of the particular subsection inserted by section 4 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1967, is concerned, I cannot myself recall having said that I would re-enact it but I am told that I undertook at some stage in connection with the comprehensive Bill&mdash;not this one&mdash;that I would consider the re-enactment of section 4 (1) of the 1967 Act in view of the fact that its two-year life had expired.</P>

      <P>I find it rather difficult on reading this now to understand why I did undertake to consider it in relation to the comprehensive Act because it seems to be purely a rent restrictions matter, not a landlord and tenant matter.  The reference in section 10 of this Bill to the Rent Restrictions Act is purely fortuitous because it is not really a rent restrictions point at all; it is an unexpected consequence in landlord and tenant law of a technical slip in a Rent Restrictions Act.  The point Deputy Fitzpatrick is now urging on me is, I think, purely a rent restrictions point.</P>

My problem, apart from whatever sympathies I might have in regard to the point, is that it does not appear that this is an appropriate Bill in which to make a substantive amendment of the rent restrictions code.  However, I shall consider the point as to whether that could be done but it is rather a major point in rent restriction matters and I may have to consult my colleagues in the Government as to whether they are prepared to make this concession. There may well be Members of the House who possibly would not agree with the effect of the amendment he <Col N="2205" /> suggests.  I should consider the point but I must have reservations about it because I believe it is a substantive rent restrictions matter and not a landlord and tenant matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a State-sponsored company, Fóir Teoranta, to cater for reconstruction finance for potentially viable firms which are in danger of closing down because of their inability to raise capital from commercial sources.  The decision to establish this company has already been announced in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cases have come to light in recent years where firms were on the verge of closedown because of serious financial difficulties although there was good reason to believe that they could be viable in the long term.  While the State has provided <i>ad hoc</i> financial assistance to tide a number of such firms over their immediate difficulties, I consider that there is need for an orderly, established procedure to deal with any such cases in the future.  I propose that <Col N="2206" /> this work be undertaken by a new State-sponsored company, Fóir Teoranta, the principal functions of which are set out in section 4 of the Bill.  Briefly, these functions are to provide finance for eligible concerns by such means as acquiring shares and debentures, issuing loans and bill finance and guaranteeing borrowing.  It is envisaged that finance on concessionary terms as regards both interest and repayment will be necessary in many cases.</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for financial assistance a concern must comply with a number of conditions.  It must be engaged in an industrial activity. Employment and capital invested in it must be significant.  The proportion of the promoter's contribution to its total capital and the prospects of profitability on a permanent basis must be reasonable.  It must be able to show that further finance cannot be procured commercially and that failure to obtain financial assistance would have serious repercussions nationally or locally.  It is the intention to interpret industrial activity in the broadest possible terms to include all economic activities that can reasonably be described as being of an industrial nature.</P>
    <P>The criteria for eligibility for financial assistance cannot be measured in quantitative terms and it will be left to the board of Fóir Teoranta to decide in each particular case whether or not a firm should be regarded as an eligible concern.  For instance, one of the criteria is that the capital and the employment content of the firm in difficulties must be significant; the measure of significance is bound to vary according to the area in which the firm is located.  We will rely on the good sense of the board to ensure that the criteria are applied fairly in all instances.  I want to make it clear, however, that, while the company may be a lender of last resort, there is no intention of applying State funds in propping-up industrial concerns which have no reasonable prospect of viability in the long term.</P>
    <P>In the past the State on occasion has had to deal at very short notice with appeals for help from firms which were <Col N="2207" /> in immediate financial difficulties.  The decisions to give help in such instances had to be taken under the threat of imminent closure of the firms concerned, with the result that a comprehensive examination of their affairs was not possible in the short time allowed.  These <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements are obviously unsatisfactory, and in order to avoid a recurrence of this situation it will be the policy of the new company to insist as far as possible that firms in financial difficulties which need State assistance should give sufficient notice to enable their affairs to be examined in detail before the position becomes so critical that a close-down is imminent.</P>
    <P>As a condition of granting finance, Fóir Teoranta may, in suitable cases, require applicants to employ consultants and implement their recommendations including changes in their board of directors and management. This is desirable in order to guard against the danger that State support would be given to concerns which might not of their own accord make the necessary changes in their internal organisation to improve the prospects of future viability.  There may be special cases where, in order to maintain the continuity of a business, Fóir Teoranta might have to arrange to find a new owner or to negotiate a merger or other form of association with another firm.  These arrangements can be made administratively and it is not necessary to cater for them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The company will have a nominal share capital of £100 and will obtain its financial requirements by way of Exchequer advances.  Section 12 of the Bill fixes a limit of £3 million on aggregate borrowing by Fóir Teoranta for purposes other than those in connection with functions transferred to it from Taiscí Stáit Teoranta and section 13 fixes a similar limit on advances from the Minister for Finance to the company.  I propose on the Committee Stage of the Bill to move amendments to sections 12 and 13 raising the limit in each case to £7½ million but these new limits will apply to moneys required to meet Taiscí Stáit's outstanding commitments as <Col N="2208" /> well as to moneys required by Fóir Teoranta for its own purposes. Taiscí Stáit's outstanding commitments amount to approximately £1.3 million so that the ceiling on moneys which Fóir Teoranta may borrow for its own purposes will be just over £6 million.  The limits were fixed at the low level of £3 million in the first place to ensure that the Oireachtas would have an opportunity to review the company's activities inside four or five years.  The Bill is now before the Dáil for a year and the growing demand for reconstruction finance combined with the falling value of money make it desirable to fix considerably higher limits on the amounts which the company may borrow.  It is intended that the company will pay interest on Exchequer advances to the extent that a return will be earned by it on its investments.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill for the guaranteeing by the Minister for Finance of borrowings by the company from non-Exchequer sources.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult to estimate the amount of assistance likely to be required for reconstruction finance in the average case, it is envisaged that the firms most likely to have to avail of the company's help will be small or medium-sized and I consider that, as much of the finance is likely to be on concessionary terms, the company should not provide financial assistance to any individual concern in excess of £100,000 without the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce.  This will be arranged administratively with the company.  The company will have discretion in deciding what form the assistance will take in each case and the extent of any interest and repayment concession. Normally freedom from interest or deferment of interest will not be allowed for a period exceeding five years.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill provides for the dissolution of Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, the transfer to Fóir Teoranta of the property and liabilities of Taiscí Stáit and the preservation of its existing contracts.  Taiscí Stáit Teoranta was set up in 1964 principally to acquire share in and to issue loans to State-assisted <Col N="2209" /> industrial concerns.  In practice the main function of the company has been the provision of loans on preferential terms in part substitution for grants for large-scale industrial projects.  In the absence of a more appropriate State source the company has also been used to assist certain firms which found themselves in financial difficulties and which I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment Taiscí Stáit has provided assistance to 25 industrial concerns by way of preferential loans or share investments.  In a majority of instances this assistance was for new industrial projects or the expansion of existing projects.  The demand for rescue finance was not significant in earlier years but the position in this regard has changed in the past two years when the main emphasis has been on rescue operations.  Taiscí has already assisted or has undertaken to assist twelve industrial concerns in urgent need of finance which they could not raise from the normal commercial sources.  Taking into account the commitments which will be transferred to Fóir Teoranta, Taiscí Stáit's contribution to Irish industry will amount to approximately £8.8 million and of this approximately £3.0 million represents rescue finance.  So far the company has had to write off loans and interest to the extent of £40,000 but it now seems most likely that upwards of a further one million pounds is irrecoverable.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1969, confers powers on the IDA to guarantee loans for and to participate in the equity of industrial concerns and to give interest subsidies in respect of loans.  In the circumstances there is no longer a need for Taiscí Stáit to continue to provide facilities to large-scale industrialists, while its present functions in regard to rescue operations will be superseded by the new company.  It is proposed, therefore, that the company be dissolved to avoid the possibility of a duplication of State facilities.  As I have already indicated, Fóir Teoranta will honour existing Taiscí Stáit commitments and will take over its existing investments.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of <Col N="2210" /> standard provisions relating to the formation and operation of the company. There are the usual requirements in regard to the form of the company's accounts and their presentation to the Oireachtas&mdash;section 16&mdash;the furnishing of an annual report and other information to the Minister&mdash;section 17 &mdash;and the contingency of membership of either House of the Oireachtas by the directors of the company&mdash;section 18.  In accordance with section 5 of the Bill, the articles of association will provide that the number of directors, including the chairman, shall not exceed seven and that they shall be appointed by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  While the board of Taiscí Stáit has always been comprised solely of civil servants, it is envisaged that, in accordance with normal practice in regard to State-sponsored bodies, the directors of Fóir Teoranta will be chosen mainly from outside the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company has acted as managers to Taiscí Stáit Teoranta and has conducted the day to day administration of its affairs. This arrangement has proved satisfactory as the ICC has long experience in industrial finance; it has first hand knowledge of the problems of industry and its staff have the necessary skills required in this field.  The Board of Fóir Teoranta will decide whether the company should have its own staff or whether the ICC should be invited to act as managers of the company. Either arrangement can be made administratively and there are no provisions in this regard in the Bill. Whatever course is followed by the board of Fóir Teoranta, close liaison with the ICC and other State agencies will be maintained.</P>
    <P>In a period of rapid transition in industry it is inevitable that some firms, however well managed or fundamentally viable, will be confronted with special difficulties and will be unable to get assistance from the normal commercial sources.  It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that no firm will be forced out of business unnecessarily. This Bill provides an appropriate means for the rehabilitation of potentially <Col N="2211" /> viable firms and I consider it as a vital link in the chain of measures to assist industrial development.  I, therefore, confidently recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather disappointing on hearing the Minister's speech to realise that what I might describe as the commercial philosophy behind this change is hazy.  On reading the Taiscí Stáit Act, 1963, and the Industrial Credit Act, 1933 I can see very little difference, particularly between the proposed new Bill and the 1963 Act.  I cannot see the need for a completely new piece of legislation.  The powers taken in this new Bill are practically identical with those contained in the Taiscí Stáit Act, 1963.  The essence of the power contained in these Statutes is to enable a State company to take up shares in private firms and that is also the function of the Industrial Credit Act, 1933.  Consequently, I am puzzled to know what is the real commercial reason for this.  If it is to be a fire brigade operation let it be said openly and plainly that this is what this Bill is to be.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, as the Minister pointed out, the direction of Taiscí Stáit in involvement and investment has been in fire brigade operations rescuing firms on their last legs.  The Minister has indicated this has not been very profitable, not through any fault of Taiscí Stáit, but because the firms concerned have left their approach for help too late in the day.  I do not know if the situation will be cured in any way by the Bill because I do not see anything in it to make it obligatory on companies which may be in financial difficulties to come for consultation with Taiscí Stáit or the ICC at a sufficiently early time for assistance to be of use to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, possibly necessarily so, is somewhat vague on the criteria which will cause investment by this new company in an ailing private company or, indeed, in any industrial activity.  Both the Bill and the Minister are regreattably vague as to the type of involvement that will be made by the new company.  Up to now&mdash;<Col N="2212" /> having regard to the reverence in which we hold procedure in this country&mdash; involvement has been through the agency of the ICC.  The ICC has a very commendable commercial record; it is an expanding and profitable financial venture but I would submit to the Minister that the ICC is the wrong body to advise the company it is proposed to set up by this Bill because in my experience the ICC applies orthodox and, consequently, conservative, commercial criteria.  They are not going to recommend an investment unless a proposition is extremely sound. If it is in that condition, I suggest that the ICC themselves should invest in it. If this is to be a fire brigade operation, it should be such and its investment should not be determined by a conservative financial body like the ICC. If there is to be investment by this body in ailing firms, it should be something more than just a contribution to the capital needs.  In addition to a nominee on the board, which would have to be a <i>sine qua non</i> of any investment, the opportunity should be taken, if not to take over the firm on behalf of the State, to go a considerable distance towards that.  The opportunity presented by this investment should be used for advanced exercises in industrial relations, worker participation and various aspects of that nature which are missing from our industrial scence at the moment.  The lack of those things in industry at the moment is one of the factors which contributes so greatly to the prices and incomes difficulty which has been a constant sore with the Minister and his Department for a number of years past and which has caused considerable difficulties in our economy.</P>
    <P>I envisage a situation where a firm is coming to this new company for investment either because its proposition is unacceptable commercially or because it is in a difficult financial state.  Such a firm should be prepared to accept an advance on whatever conditions it gets it even if it means that the original speculators or investors have to withdraw or part with their equity although at that stage the equity will probably have no real value.  It is envisaged that the help will be given to <Col N="2213" /> small firms and if control has to be parted with, I do not think there will be any great objection because the control is going to go any way by way of liquidation.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be used as an opportunity for a radical rethink of the philosophy of Government investment in private firms to make sure that the State in general and the workers in particular will be the first consideration and the owners of the equity very much down the scale.  Up to now the operations by Taiscí Stáit so far as my limited knowledge of them goes&mdash;I am open to correction on this because my knowledge is limited&mdash; has not been as radical as that.  They have been content to give money and, perhaps, go in as a holder of a debenture with a nominee on the board.  In the preliminary investigations as to whether Taiscí Stáit would make an investment, an advance or a loan to an ailing company I found that the approach adopted in Dublin was too conservative and too bureaucratic&mdash;I do not use the words in a pejorative sense&mdash;and enough cognisance was not taken of the problems on the ground so to speak.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a particular instance of a firm in my own town, Weirside Textiles, which got into financial difficulties for reasons well known to the Minister, Taiscí Stáit and the ICC. Those reasons would make one depressed as to the future of the firm. But, if the reality of that situation could have been got across to the people with the purse strings, and the advance which was originally offered and subsequently withdrawn left with this firm, the 80 workers involved in Athlone would be gainfully employed instead of walking the streets as they are now doing.</P>
    <P>The kernel of that situation was that there were markets available and production could be organised to take advantage of those markets but because of earlier factors, principally a history of bad management and a certain lackadaisical approach to the problems after the first call for help was made, there was a loss of confidence on the part of Taiscí Stáit <Col N="2214" /> towards that firm and the offer of assistance was withdrawn.  I think it was withdrawn too hastily.  The reason it was withdrawn was due to a lack of real and intimate knowledge on the part of those making the investment with the situation on the ground. Whatever administrative structure is going to be given to this new Bill, as I say I imagine it is going to be mainly a fire brigade operation, there will have to be something of the nature of Whizz Kids&mdash;although I dislike that term&mdash; prepared to descend on the firm in question and examine it from A to Z.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the record it would be more correct to say that in the case to which the Deputy was referring the offer was not withdrawn but rather rejected by the management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There were terms attached to the offer which made it impossible to accept it.  In effect, it was withdrawn and there were propositions for lesser amounts which were not acceptable.  Ultimately, when a lesser sum was requested, it was not forthcoming. A full report was available but there was no first-hand knowledge on on the part of the people making the decision of the situation on the ground. If this Bill is to be effective this first-hand knowledge must be obtained. With respect to the Industrial Credit Corporation, they are not the people to advise on investment for this new bank because their criteria are conservative and commercial.  They are totally inadequate and inapplicable to the situations that will be met by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall seeing a large investment by Taiscí Stáit in an industry in County Louth in which they took up one-third of the share capital.  At the time it struck me as an extraordinary investment by Taiscí Stáit and it would be interesting to hear the commercial reasons that compelled them to make that large investment.  I may be wrong on this point and I should be glad to be corrected if this is so, but for an investment of one-third of the equity&mdash; in which there was a very substantial sum&mdash;Taiscí Stáit do not have anyone on the board of that company.  Perhaps it is intended they will at a later date, <Col N="2215" /> but if the State is to invest to that extent in a private concern it should have at least a nominee on the board and should impose conditions of the type to which I referred earlier, involving worker participation and more modern industrial relations in any such firm.</P>
    <P>One change I see in the Bill as opposed to the Act of 1963 is in relation to the audit of the accounts.  Section 5 of the Bill provides that the auditor will be nominated by the Minister. I hope the Minister will nominate the office of the auditor general because I consider he is the proper person to look after the accounts of State and semi-State bodies.  I am not suggesting there would be malpractice on the part of ordinary commercial auditors, but when State money is involved, and as the auditor general is a protected personage under our Constitution, he is the person to look after State moneys.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister is going to constitute the new board.  As he indicated, up to now the board has been comprised of civil servants&mdash;the secretaries of four Departments.  Without any disrespect to the gentlemen on the present board, people of wider commercial experience would be required.  I think the Minister should consider as members of this board people who are prepared to experiment in matters of industrial management, who are willing to get away from the traditional management philosophies we have had in this country and which we have had to import from differently structured societies because of the size of our country and the average size of firms.  The concept of managing director in isolation from the floor is a matter that must be looked into and changed radically.</P>
    <P>Something I should like to see done by the Minister is the submission to the House of the memorandum and articles of association.  The Bill merely says that the company shall be formed and it gives a general line of the memorandum and articles of association. It is proper that details of these matters for a body such as this should be submitted to the House, particularly in view of the amount of money that <Col N="2216" /> will be involved and because the powers contained in the articles, the administration of the company and the detailed functions, will form the personality of this new company.  The House should have an opportunity of seeing these and be in a position to comment on them so that the company will not be a duplication of the Industrial Credit Corporation, taking slightly more risks but in an equally conservative way.</P>
    <P>The idea generally is welcome to us on this side of the House because we recognise that at the moment there are firms who may be in difficulty through no fault of their own but because of trading conditions over which they have no control, and it is only right that the State should come to the assistance of those firms.  The most important point I should like to make to the Minister is that there should be some rule binding on firms to advise the board of the new company in good time when they see danger signals on the horizon.  As the Minister pointed out, too often people come when it is too late and the State finds itself rushing in at the last moment making <i>ad hoc</i> advances to guarantee wages and commitments to keep the firm going until its position can be investigated. If on investigation it is found the firm cannot be kept going, those <i>ad hoc</i> advances are lost.  As the Minister has said, the last two years have shown an increase in this tendency.</P>
    <P>It is critical to the success of this Bill and the successful operation of this company that some system should be devised to cope with this problem, perhaps a system of inspection by the Minister's Department.  I do not know what the procedure would be but perhaps there might be some form of compulsion on the firm's accountant to notify the Department that there are danger signals ahead.  I do not think this would inhibit the operations of a firm or that it could be complained of as being an invasion of privacy.  Frequently these firms have got State money, either by way of grants or loans, and it is only proper that the people should be entitled to see that the operations of the firms are carried <Col N="2217" /> on in a proper manner.  I have no doubt that if some of the firms in which Taiscí Stáit have invested in the last two years had been inspected at an earlier date their future might have been secured.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there is a limit on the amount that can be provided by way of assistance without the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, but I wonder whether the figure is a realistic one.  When one reaches the six figure mark, one is dealing with large sums of money.  But having regard to the costings of plant and machinery nowadays and the cost of management consultants&mdash;as the Government know to their cost&mdash;the ceiling might be lower and if the Minister intends appointing a board of the standard we expect him to appoint, they should be given discretion for a larger sum than that mentioned in the Minister's speech.  Again, bearing in mind that the nature of this operation is fire brigade, there would inevitably be further delay if the consent of two heads of Departments has to be obtained for advances over a certain limit.</P>
    <P>I would have some worry too that the board would have discretion as to the terms of repayment; but, having regard to the nature of their activities, I suppose they would have to have some discretion.  The Minister should emphasise to this board that their discretion should always be exercised in favour of continuing employment for workers in a firm that is in danger.  I do not know what are the statistics but I have no doubt that they will prove that the investment by Taiscí Stáit to keep jobs going has achieved this purpose at a much lower cost than that of setting up a job initially.  In this particular firm in Athlone that I have mentioned it would have cost about £300 for each job, whereas it would cost the IDA a four-figure sum to provide a job at the moment.  Having regard to that difference, this new body could lean over slightly backwards when considering the commercial viability of a firm in which it intends investing because, even if the investment proved unsuccessful, there is still the big difference between what it might have <Col N="2218" /> gained and the cost to the IDA of setting up a new job.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of this company will depend on the commercial philosophy that they apply.  They will have to be prepared to take risks, to encourage novel working arrangements within factories and they will have to investigate problems that reach them from time to time in a way that will be very different from the way in which they are being investigated now by the ICC and by Taiscí Stáit.  At this stage, with free trade blowing a very cold wind and with Europe around the corner, it is essential that the various businesses in this country be made aware, for the sake of their morale, that a helpful and sympathetic State company are in the background&mdash; sympathetic and helpful without being sentimental or foolish.  This can be got across and if firms are given this confidence they could be encouraged to go to the company in the early stages of their problems.  If that general type of philosophy can be used by this company in their operations they should be successful.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney has the quality which I used attribute to the former Deputy Dillon and that is that one could listen to him all day without agreeing with a word he was saying. However, I was very impressed by the critical analysis that has been made of this Bill by Deputy Cooney.  I could agree with most of what he has said but he made a few points with which I would disagree violently.  I welcome the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party but consider it a pity that, when the Government decided more than 12 months ago that a Bill of this nature was necessary, they did not go ahead with it then when things were not as bad as they are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must know that the committees and bodies set up to assist industries have not been able to cope with the applications coming before them, and this has been particularly so during the past 12 months. While it is all right to talk about the number of firms that require fire brigade action&mdash;I do not suppose those men who were outside the gate yesterday  <Col N="2219" /> would be very pleased with that particular description&mdash;the Minister must realise that the phrase often used by the late Mr. Seán Lemass, &ldquo;Prosperity Around the Corner&rdquo;, is the one which most firms use as their slogan. Very few firms are prepared to admit they are doing badly and that there is very little hope of recovery; it is not until a firm has reached the stage where it is almost impossible to recover without a sizeable financial injection that they seek help.  Therefore the situation in this country has been that most of the firms that seek assistance from State companies are firms that are on their last legs as it were.</P>
    <P>My main objection to the existing arrangements is that it takes far too long to process claims.  While we may have experts dealing with these matters, particularly in the case of Taiscí Stáit and the IDA, those bodies give the impression that they belong not only to different organisations but to different races of people.  For instance it is not good enough to hear the ICC saying that the investigation carried out by the IDA has nothing to do with them and that they are not prepared to accept the findings of the IDA and then they start cross-questioning directors of a firm who have done everything possible to keep their firm going and their numerous workers employed. Deputy Cooney used the word &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; in respect of these State companies, but I would put the word &ldquo;ultra&rdquo; before that.  The ultraconservative approach of some of the people in those companies has a dampening effect on firms seeking assistance but perhaps that is the intention.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that workers should be given consideration before the rights of the equity holders; but if one has spent all his life building up a firm and has invested all his money in that firm, it is not easy to say that his rights should be wiped away in the event of the firm going into liquidation. Those rights should be protected. Worker participation is a phrase that is very much overworked by some people, but if we are to have worker participation I do not think <Col N="2220" /> that the right place to start would be in a company on the verge of bankruptcy. We must start with the companies that are doing well and try to persuade them to give workers participation. Let those who talk so loudly about worker participation use their influence to encourage the really successful companies to participate with their workers in the running of their companies, and then, when that has been successful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If something goes wrong, they have not got their week's wages. If the Minister has any doubts about that, he should consult the almost 8,000 people who lost their jobs this year, due to the fact that the industries they worked in closed down, or did not need them, with the result that they did not get their week's pay the following week.  They are finding it very difficult to exist.  If we start talking about workers' participation or about starting companies with the assistance of workers, we must realise that there must be some way of finding the money which is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to enlighten me on an attitude adopted by State bodies.  I suggest that the new body being set up now should take a <Col N="2221" /> good hard look at this.  Take a firm employing 100 people at £25 a week. That firm closes down because it requires an injection of £100,000 to keep it going.  The 100 workers sign on at the labour exchange and they get an average of £10 a week.  I do not have to be a financial genius to realise that in that 12 months almost the required amount of money has been paid out in benefits, money which could, possibly, have saved the company.</P>

      <P>In addition, there is the loss of income to the State from income tax paid by the workers.  There is the loss of the income from social welfare payments by the workers.  There is also the 35 per cent and in many cases 55 per cent from another State organisation. This shows a net loss to the country, not to speak of the loss of purchasing power, or the social effects on the families and on the towns and villages in which they live.  This attitude of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing must be changed.  The Minister being an intelligent young man who has views on these matters might try to right them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says this Bill is not for the purpose of dealing with small companies.  In some peculiar way he then changes that around and says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is difficult to estimate the <Col N="2222" /> amount of assistance likely to be required for reconstruction finance in the average case, it is envisaged that the firms most likely to have to avail of the company's help will be small- or medium-sized...</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for financial assistance a concern must comply with a number of conditions. It must be engaged in an industrial activity.  Employment and capital invested in it must be significant.  The proportion of the promoters' contribution to its total capital and the prospects of profitability on a permanent basis must be reasonable.</P>
    <P>This suggests to me that the Minister is talking about large concerns but, in the other quotation I gave, he referred to small- or medium-sized firms.</P>
    <P>This must be spelled out fairly clearly because I can see a group of people, and particularly civil servants, saying to a firm with 25 to 30 workers that they are only little chaps, that they do not qualify and that the Minister said so.  There would be very little use in somebody digging out what he said earlier or later, pointing out that the Minister said something contradictory and asking which was correct.  Like the Minister's age, the size of the firm is relative.  In a small country town or in a rural area, a firm employing 15 to 25 workers is not a small concern, whereas in Dublin city it would not be worth considering at all, I assume, because it was employing such a small number relative to the population.  This must be spelled out so that those who are applying will know before they make application whether they are likely to comply with this requirement.</P>
    <P>I am interested in a comment in the Minister's speech.  He suggests that profitability is one of the matters that must be taken into consideration with regard to the making of a loan.  I presume that means profitability to the board.  Would the Minister not consider that the question of profit to the nation should take precedence?  While a firm may not be immediately able to do more than repay advances, overall it may show a profit to the nation and to the area in which it exists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2223" /> With regard to the appointment of members to the board, as Deputy Cooney remarked, this is a matter of interest to many of us.  If the Minister has anything to do with these appointments, he should get away from the idea that to be appointed to a board people must be good Fianna Fáil men. We had an instance of this recently, although it was pooh-poohed by certain people in this House and by a section of workers who felt, I am quite sure, it was the thing to do.  The fact that somebody is accustomed to using a container for the purpose of taking effluent out of a septic tank does not of necessity make him an ideal choice as a director of a firm using a similar type vehicle for carrying around beer. There might be some connection, but this is the sort of thing that can be stretched a bit too far.  I remember a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Fine Gael Party commenting that all other things being equal the party man should be appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should quote the member of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan. The other man is dead and everybody knows who he is so there is no point in quoting him.  When someone is being appointed to a board the first thing to be considered is whether he will be a useful member of the board, before the question of party membership is considered. I do not belive in giving certain things to the party faithful simply because they are the party faithful.  The Minister who is an honest man should realise that this is of vital importance at present.  Some people may say it is not so important but I believe it is of vital importance.  It reduces confidence in a firm if it is found that room is being made on the board for party men.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear, however, that while the company may be a lender of last resort, there is no intention of applying State funds in propping-up industrial concerns <Col N="2224" /> which have no reasonable prospect of viability in the long term.</P>
    <P>This is the whole kernel of the Bill. The people who make the decision on that problem are the people who will make or break this Bill and make or break industry.  I was told of somebody who went out from a State concern to have a look at a firm which had applied for a loan and a grant.  Having gone out there, this gentleman found that the application had been made for the wrong type of assistance.  It was a small industry grant that had been applied for and it should have been for re-tooling.  The person who was sent out, having had a look around, said to the harassed owner, &ldquo;Of course, you know that you have not a snowball's chance in hell of getting anything out of this.  Your firm and the smaller type firms are going to the wall and you are not likely to get anything.&rdquo; He did not tell him that he had applied for the wrong type of assistance.  It took the Minister&mdash;to his credit&mdash;to point this out at a later stage.  To a harassed factory owner or manager who is attempting to provide employment and to get a market for his product, this is not the type of encouragement he wants.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that people who are sent out on such a mission should at least find out the facts before saying that it does not seem likely that assistance will be given.  In fact, in the case I have referred to, substantial assistance was subsequently given and, I am glad to say, the firm are doing well. This sort of approach should not be allowed.  The type of approach made to applicants for assistance is a very important matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney was rather puzzled. He said the proposed organisation was very like the existing organisation and he wondered why it was necessary to introduce Fóir Teoranta.  I believe that one of the reasons is that it was one way of having additional finance made available and a handy way; that if you did not introduce this Bill, which has been on the stocks for so long, another Bill would have had to be introduced at this stage to increase the amount of <Col N="2225" /> money made available.  If that was a reason, it was a perfectly legitimate reason.  In view of increasing costs, the amount of money could have been much higher than that suggested by the Minister.  I am serious about this because I remember one occasion where a firm, who are now riding very high according to what we are told, came into this House at the end of July, less than a week before the Dáil went into summer recess&mdash;perhaps the Minister may remember the particular incident&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and gave an ultimatum to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who had to come in here and say that unless they got £1.2 million within a week they were closing down with consequential loss of nearly 1,000 jobs, and the £1.2 million was made available to them.  They had already got very substantial amounts of State assistance.  It will make the amount of capital made available under this Bill look very sick, if items of that amount are required by one or two firms, as they very well can be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney was quite correct. While £100,000 is a great deal of money, it would be too bad if the fact that not more than that could be granted without approaching the Minister and having the matter cleared &mdash;and he might be as difficult to find as a Minister was recently&mdash;meant that a firm who would be looking for money of that kind and who would normally employ a big number of workers might have to close.  It is very difficult to re-start a business that has fallen down. The Minister might have a look at that section of the Bill and see if there is not another way of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to providing a crutch, or whatever the Minister likes to call it, for business that are doing badly, it might not be a bad idea, at this stage, long before the occasion arises, if information were given to firms that by doing certain things it might be possible for them to get assistance which would enable them to employ more people and thereby secure a bigger turnover, if they got a market. <Col N="2226" /> This would keep them from going down hill and would put them in a good way of making a profit.  This matter could possibly be publicised. Again it depends a great deal on the newspapers.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I had an argument the other day about the provision of factories.  I know of cases where people with factories which they started with a small number of employees and have built to the stage that they have markets and have taken on additional employees, are not able to expand any further due to limitation of space. There should be some way in which such people could be encouraged to avail of State finances for the purpose of acquiring larger factories which in turn would help both the State and the workers who could be employed.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to see a reference here to the effect that smaller concerns are not to be considered for this sort of assistance. I remember distinctly one firm which a few years ago were producing something which was not considered to be very important but which did employ nine men.  These people were producing hurleys.  They applied for assistance to the State because they wanted to enlarge the factory and thereby increase employment because there was a sizeable demand for the product.  After several weeks they got a very detailed memorandum from the State organisation to which they had applied, the principal question on which was what was the prospect of exports of the commodity to the EEC countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is going a long way back in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>About that time the King of the Belgians had been in this country and had been shown by a certain high personage how to hit a hurley ball with a stick.  This may have been in the minds of those dealing with the application who possibly felt that Belgium would take up hurling in a big way and it might be possible to sell a lot of hurleys there.  That company have not been able to improve because the kind of assistance they required at that time was not made available.  This is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may consider a factory <Col N="2227" /> of 25 to 30 in Dublin as a small factory but such a factory is a big thing in a country area.  If the Bill is allowed to go through in its present form, the gentlemen sitting behind the shiny tables, whom we take clients in to see to ask them if they will be prepared to give financial aid by way of loan or grant, may say that 25 workers in a factory in the country is not such a terribly important matter because they know of factories in the city that are employing perhaps 500 or 1,000 workers.  The opportunity to say that sort of thing should be taken out of the Bill.  The Minister might consider that the reference, and particularly his reference, to small industries would with very good effect be deleted so that this sort of situation cannot arise.</P>
    <P>Let me refer now to the question of the formation of the board.  If the board of a company are to have made available to them substantial sums of money, it is not alone not unreasonable but it is incumbent on the State to ensure that there is a director from the State on that board, not for the purpose of collecting a director's fee but for the purpose of ensuring that the people who lend a large amount of money know at least how that money is being expended.  This may not be the time or place to say this, but we are all aware of companies which got substantial State assistance, which did not have a director appointed by the State and which got out pretty quickly with the money, leaving nobody at a loss except those employed and the State itself.  The State is made up of the taxpayers. Everyone who buys anything pays tax. It may sound grand talking about the Government giving £1 million by way of grant but it should be remembered that it is the people who contributed to that £1 million and, because they did so contribute, they are entitled to value for their money.</P>
    <P>I do not know how soon the Minister expects the new arrangement will come into operation.  He can say that the sooner the Bill goes through the quicker it will go into operation.  Is it intended to switch the staffs of the &ldquo;old firm&rdquo; to the new firm?  Is it <Col N="2228" /> intended simply to change the name or, as Deputy Cooney said, to put in a few commas here and there?  That would be the quickest way.  Will it be an arrangement whereby a selection will be made to ensure that those who will administer this particular new company will administer it in a way designed to help those looking for assistance?</P>
    <P>While most civil servants in the Civil Service itself and on State boards are most courteous, I have had the experience, and pretty recently, of questions being asked in a manner I would definitely consider insulting. Obviously, those asking the questions seemed to think that it was normal practice.  Possibly it was but, if it was, then it should be changed.  I do not think any civil servant is entitled to insult anybody and, if they do it even accidently, the fault is all the greater because they should know at least whether their questions are fair. Is it that they consider the applicant for assistance fair game to be asked smart alec questions, questions he may find it difficult to answer?  Let me say immediately that those concerned were most helpful eventually, as things turned out, and possibly the questions were stock questions laid down by someone else.  I often think it would do a great deal of good if someone would set up a bureau whose main function would be revising official forms.  Some of the stupid questions asked, and this goes from old age pensions right up to State grants, just do not make sense in 1971.  They may have been all right in the opening years of this century.</P>

Unfortunately, when they meet trouble the first people to feel it are the workers, their wives and children.  If the Minister can ensure a smoother passage for industry in the years ahead he will be doing a good job.  This Bill was introduced in 1970 and we are now discussing the Second Stage in the winter of 1971.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The introduction of this Bill at this time is opportune.  The Bill was introduced, as Deputy Tully said, on 28th October, 1970.  It is now being proceeded with.  It is opportune.  The object of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a State-sponsored company to cater for reconstruction finance for potentially viable firms in danger of closing down because of inability to raise capital from commercial sources. I was shocked to learn that over the last couple of years the demand for rescue finance has become all important. The Minister said that over the last two years the emphasis has shifted to rescue operations and the spate of redundancies in the last two years would emphasise the Minister's statement that rescue operations are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prompted to speak on this measure because of a meeting I attended in the town of Cootehill last Monday night.  I was invited there by the Cootehill Chamber of Commerce. The meeting was held in the huge assembly hall of the comprehensive school.  The hall was filled to capacity. There were even people on the balcony. The meeting was called to deal with the position of the local industry, Cloth Manufacturers Limited.  This industry was established some 20 years ago and I understand there was a considerable State investment in the industry.  It is now part of the economy of Cootehill.  I have not got the exact figures, but I believe there are about 100 people employed in the factory, a big percentage of those employees being men.  The workers are at the moment on a three-day week and, according to reliable statements at the meeting, there is imminent danger of <Col N="2230" /> a complete close down.  Speeches were made from the platform, well-prepared and eloquent speeches, but it was one or two speeches from the body of the hall which impressed me.  There are grave fears in the town of Cootehill among the workers of that factory, some of them married men with six or seven children, that they may be completely out of employment in a short time.  They pose the question: &ldquo;What will they do or what will be done for them?&rdquo; No meeting I attended in recent years impressed me so much on account of the pathetic but strenuous appeal from the floor about the possibility of the factory closing.</P>
    <P>This factory seems to me to qualify completely for assistance under this Bill in respect of most of the tests set by section 4. It is stated that a concern shall be eligible for the purposes of the subsection if in the opinion of the company they are engaged in an industrial activity&mdash;Cloth Manufacturers, Cootehill are certainly engaged in an industrial activity&mdash;if the employment and capital employed in the factory are significant&mdash;the employment content of this factory is extremely significant as far as Cootehill is concerned; it has become part and parcel of the town's economy.  If the factory collapses now, having been there for 20 years, and with a huge investment of State capital in the factory, the town will be frustrated and many family breadwinners will have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>The section goes on to say &ldquo;the proportion of promoters' contribution to its total capital is reasonable&rdquo;.  As far as I know, when this factory was established a good deal of capital was put into it from County Cavan, a fair percentage was raised within the county.  Therefore, the factory qualifies under that heading.  It is also laid down that a firm should have &ldquo;reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis, whether as for the time being constituted or after adaptation&rdquo;. I am not prepared to comment on that because I am not an expert but if this undertaking has not reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis as at present constituted it is the duty of some State body, whether the one we are setting up under this Bill <Col N="2231" /> or some existing State agency, to adapt them.  Provision is made in this subsection for adaptation and now is the time to adapt before the firm collapse and people lose their jobs and must emigrate.  If they cannot be made work as they are at present I think it is the duty of the Minister, because I believe that either directly or indirectly he is the major shareholder in this factory or if not he is the major creditor&mdash;to ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> He should ensure that they are adapted or reconstituted so as to give employment and ensure that the local contribution and the vast national contribution in the firm are not lost with consequent loss of employment.</P>
      <P>The factory certainly meet the next qualification that in order to qualify, the continuance of the undertaking must be in doubt because of inability to obtain their financial requirements from commercial sources.  There is a huge question mark hanging over the future of this concern.  The final qualification in section 4 is that their failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally.  Here and now I can say that the collapse of this undertaking would certainly have serious repercussions locally.  I would fear the attitude of the workers in this factory in that event.  One man at the meeting said: &ldquo;I am a married man.  I have six children and I can see my job in jeopardy.  Where shall I go?  What will be done for me?&rdquo; There will be serious repercussions if something is not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rose specifically to deal with this problem in my constituency.  When I was here this morning dealing with another Bill and saw this Bill I thought that it was very opportune as far as Cootehill was concerned.  The Minister must have certain rights and certain obligations in respect of this factory.  He is probably not a shareholder but the State must virtually now own the factory.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this factory does not close down and that the workers' <Col N="2232" /> jobs will be preserved, that the three-day week employment provided at present be converted to a five-day working week and that the economy of Cootehill shall not suffer.</P>
    <P>There are peculiar circumstances here in that probably for the past 20 years the State has been injecting ratepayers' money into this factory and in that way it has encouraged the town of Cootehill to rely on this factory as part of its economy and has encouraged men and women to get married, settle there and rear families on the understanding that they had secure employment.  I am giving the Minister credit for that, not blaming him, but the interest the State took in this factory led to those things.  Therefore, there is a serious obligation on the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that these people are not thrown on the scrap heap and do not lose their employment and are not forced to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for its general provisions which enable a State-sponsored body to engage in rescue operations of this type but I particularly welcome it because it gives me an opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention and that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government in general to the plight of this undertaking and the plight of the town of Cootehill at present and of urging that something be done about it.  I could make a further appeal because the meeting I have spoken about demanded that further industries should be established in Cootehill, but if I were to develop that line the Chair might be forced to draw my attention to the fact that I was getting outside the scope of this Bill.  I shall, therefore, confine myself to appealing to the Minister to rescue the existing factory.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of this Bill enables the Minister to appoint the chairman and directors, to prescribe the remuneration of the chairman and the directors and to approve of the auditor.  I am not simple enough to believe that it is possible to get directors or a chairman or an auditor who do not profess any politics.  There are no such people. <Col N="2233" /> I am appealing to the Minister not to let politics be the qualification. I do not care what a man's politics are if he is efficient, if he is fit for the job. If he has the qualifications to carry out the job that he is appointed to do he is entitled to have his politics, whether they are pro the Government of the day or anti the Government of the day. In the past there has been far too much of appointing people to boards of directors of this sort simply as compensation for political services rendered to the present Government.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That may have been dealt with finally today.  I do not know.  A lot of our trouble in the industrial sector over a great number of years has been caused by the nomination of people to State boards who have no qualifications other than political ones.</P>
      <P>I am strongly urging on the Minister that when he is doing this the first and paramount qualification should be that the men appointed should be qualified to act as directors, qualified to discharge the duties that this Bill imposes upon them.  Nobody wants to get personal, nobody wants to mention names, but it would not strain the research capabilities of anybody to go back over the years and pick out ministerial nominees on various State bodies who have no qualification, good, bad or indifferent, other than that they have served the party and served it well and think that they are entitled to be compensated.  It would be far better to revert to an honours list or something and put them on pension rather than to inflict them on the economy and on the industrial sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his speech that the relevant Department is not concerned until the collapse of a concern is imminent.  I am telling him now that Cloth Manufacturers, Cootehill, have been on a three-day week for a considerable time, that there are a great number of jobs at stake and that unless he does something, and does it quickly, it will collapse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooney was asking what was the difference between what was proposed here and what was the position with Taiscí Stáit.  The primary function of Taiscí Stáit was, and is, to provide additional State finance for large-scale industrial projects. Its reconstruction finance operations are a purely secondary function as far as Taiscí Stáit are concerned. On the other hand, Fóir Teoranta, as proposed in this Bill, will be concerned solely with reconstruction finance and it is envisaged that it will set up orderly expert procedures for dealing with applications for assistance of the kind <Col N="2235" /> envisaged and outlined by me in introducing the Bill on this Stage.</P>
      <P>There are some other differences. Taiscí Stáit are not free to operate in any individual case without a direction from the Minister for Finance.  As Deputies will be aware, in the case of Fóir Teoranta this will not apply and the Minister for Finance only comes in in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the proposed assistance goes above £100,000. I shall deal with that ceiling later on.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter to which I did not advert when introducing this Stage.  Under the legislation of Taiscí Stáit it is precluded from giving assistance to a company which has not either received an industrial grant or is entitled to one, in other words had applied for one and has been approved for one.  This is a technical difficulty but the activities of Taiscí Stáit, as originally conceived and as they operate in practice, are quite different to a very great extent from the activities envisaged for Fóir Teoranta. In addition, some of the operations of Taiscí Stáit have now, in fact, been conferred on the IDA under its fairly recent legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cooney also raised a question about investment by Taiscí Stáit in a certain firm in County Louth and he asked what were the commercial reasons for this investment and why Taiscí had no representatives on the board.  The company in question have excellent prospects of profitable operation in the long term and they are a very large source of employment, as the Deputy knows.  In the short term they were in urgent need of working capital on quite a large scale and this was not available to them from normal commercial sources.  It was appropriate, therefore, that Taiscí Stáit should invest in the company.  It is one of the kinds of cases envisaged in the Bill as it meets the various criteria involved. Taiscí Stáit have in fact two representatives on the board.  I am not sure what the public position about that is, I do not know whether it has been announced or not.  The fact is that Taiscí Stáit have two representatives <Col N="2236" /> on the board one of whom has been appointed chairman of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. I got the impression from the newspaper report that Taiscí Stáit had bought out one of the major shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is the position. Both Deputy Cooney and Deputy Tully referred to the whole question of what might be called an early warning system when there is difficulty arising in a firm.  This is a particularly difficult problem.  It is one of the major matters with which the new board are going to have to concern themselves as soon as they are set up.  It will be obvious to Deputies that there are a number of practical and even legal difficulties in making it compulsory for a firm to give notice in advance of difficulties arising. I expect the solution to be arrived at will probably be on the lines of making it as widely known as possible in the industry that in the event of a firm getting into difficulties and coming to Fóir Teoranta at the last moment it is more than likely they will not be assisted.  If this can be got across to industrialists through publicity it will be of considerable help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be realistic about it.  It can happen that a firm will come at the last moment and failure to assist it for the technical reason that it had not got in touch beforehand could simply throw many workers out of employment and that is not a good enough reason for throwing them out of employment.  I am surmising when I say this.  I would hope when the board get down to this problem they will devise as satisfactory a method as can be devised to try to ensure that due advance notice will be given of difficulties arising for a firm.  This is a very difficult problem for the Government. They have to deal with them in a rush, under pressure and without having an opportunity of assessing the situation properly.  This has happened on a few occasions.  It is a matter on which trade unions have made justifiable complaints, in my opinion, in the past. When a firm are closing down and their members are being made redundant <Col N="2237" /> they sometimes hear about it only a week or even a few days beforehand.  I freely admit there are practical difficulties. Deputy Tully was being realistic when he said that it is normal for a firm who are in difficulties not to admit they are in difficulties because if they do that may close them down.  This is one of the practical difficulties with which we are faced.  Fóir Teoranta are set up and designed to assist a firm in that condition and it should be possible in the interests of the firm, with due precautions as regards confidentiality, to devise a system which will be more satisfactory than the one we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully, if I understood him aright, was somewhat critical of the limit of £100,000 on individual loans. In case there is any misunderstanding about it I should like to make it clear that there is not in fact a limit on individual loans.  What is proposed is that a sum above £100,000 will require the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any such case will ever occur.  What is involved here is simply a matter of judgment, how much should be left to the board and how much should be a matter for decision by Ministers, and therefore a responsibility generated from the House.  The opinion I came to was that £100,000 represented about the right level, one could argue for more or less, I do not claim I have the <Col N="2238" /> right answer, and if there is a strong feeling in the House to change it I certainly do not have a closed mind about it.  I might say the same thing with regard to the point made by Deputy Tully about the overall limits of capital.  The Deputy will appreciate that what we are trying to do is to ensure that the amount of money laid down in the Bill is such that in the course of, say, four years or so, the matter will have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas again to give public representatives an opportunity to discuss the operation of this company. The Deputy may well be right when he says the figure is too low and in certain circumstances we might have to come back in a year or two years but the Deputy will appreciate that the thinking behind it is to ensure that both Houses of the Oireachtas will get a reasonable opportunity in due course of reviewing the operations of the company. If there is any strong feeling in the House about changing those limits I would be prepared to have another look at it between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Cooney mentioned the necessity of a director from the State being put on the boards receiving assistance from Fóir Teoranta.  The general intention is that Fóir Teoranta will nominate directors to boards of firms where they provide substantial assistance but the decision in each individual case will have to be for the board of Fóir Teoranta.  As I indicated in connection with the case raised by Deputy Cooney in County Louth, this is in fact the practice we are following in regard to Taiscí Stáit.  Where investment is substantial we are appointing members to the boards of companies concerned.  The number of the directors bears a relationship to the substantial nature of the investment made.  The same practice will be followed by Fóir Teoranta although the decision in each individual case will have to be one for the board of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully made a point with <Col N="2239" /> regard to the question of small firms getting assistance.  During the course of my introductory speech I tried to spell out that it is not a question of simply whether the firm are large or small but whether they are large or small in relation to the area in which they are operating.  I specifically said, if I may quote myself:</P>
    <P>For instance, one of the criteria is that the capital and the employment content of the firm in difficulties must be significant; the measure of significance is bound to vary according to the area in which the firm is located.  We will rely on the good sense of the Board to ensure that the criteria are applied fairly in all instances.</P>
    <P>I can certainly visualise&mdash;it may help Deputy Tully if I put it on the record&mdash; a situation in which a firm employing 30 or even 20 people could be quite significant in a particular area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often ten in some places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, possibly.  On the other hand, we do not wish to create here a machinery which is simply going to attract every failed or failing industry in the country.  That is not the objective.  There are some industries that will go out of business regardless of what is done.  That is a law of economics.  It may be hard but it happens. Some firms go out of business while others continue to grow.  We are not trying here to take on all the lame ducks that will exist in the country but I want to assure Deputy Tully that mere smallness will not be a reason for excluding people from assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should mention also that Fóir Teoranta as envisaged is really part of an internal early warning system which we tried to organise a few years ago in co-operation between the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce.  It involves the IDA, the industrial reorganisation branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Credit Company.  The setting up of this body is a further leg in that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2240" /> In regard to the comments made about the approach of the ICC, in all fairness to them I should say that the approach adopted by the ICC in what might be regarded as their normal sphere of activity is quite different from the approach they adopt in cases which at the moment we refer to as Taiscí Stáit cases in rescue operations where they act as managers for Taiscí Stáit.  Their approach, of necessity, is different because they are dealing with different criteria.  Nevertheless, whether there is to be a continuation of the employment of the ICC as the managers of Fóir Teoranta or whether Fóir Teoranta are to set up their own staff is a matter that will have to be decided by the board.  I would envisage that in the beginning the board would have to operate through the ICC but it will be a matter for the board to decide whether that is the most appropriate way or whether they should have their own organisation to do this kind of work.  ICC staff have a particular expertise in this field, an expertise that is not always easily obtainable, and this would be a consideration that the board would have to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney made the point that opportunities should be taken when this kind of investment is taking place to experiment with new approaches to worker-participation and other matters that he had in mind.  Apart from Fóir Teoranta at all, this was a matter I considered when certain investments were being made but the difficulty here is the one that was pointed out by Deputy Tully, that is, that the time when a firm are in difficulty is not the time to make radical departures.  If a radical departure is to have any chance the firm must be operating successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Floating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To make radical departures at a time when a firm are in difficulty may be endangering both the future of the firm and the prospects of the experiment.  This is the practical difficulty involved.  I am in sympathy with the idea and I would expect that the board of Fóir Teoranta would consider this and, on an appropriate occasion, would try to do something about it but I cannot undertake in <Col N="2241" /> advance to tie them to doing anything like that.</P>
      <P>I agree that members of the board of Fóir Teoranta should have wider commercial experience than is available at the moment in Taiscí Stáit where secretaries of Departments are concerned.  One of the reasons for this board is to ensure that we will have this wider commercial experience.  So far as I am concerned I can assure the House that every effort will be made to get the most suitable people for this kind of operation.  It is not easy to get them but we will make every effort in that direction.  Deputy Tully referred to a recent case where there were nominees by Taiscí Stáit and he referred to one of these nominees being a Fianna Fáil man.</P>
    </Speaker>

Figures for some of the categories are not readily available in respect of 1960 because of a change in the commodity classification in 1963.  Data in respect of the year 1963 are also shown in the statement for comparative purposes.</P>

      <P>When I put down the question I underlined the word &ldquo;formal&rdquo; because I wanted it put in italics.  I am not suggesting that anybody interfered with it in any way, but it did not appear that way.  Will the Minister answer the question whether he has made formal representations, underlining the word &ldquo;formal&rdquo;?  The meaning is quite clear.  If the Minister is worth his job he should know the answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I see what the Deputy wants.  In the particular circumstances of the case the Government decided that a direct as well as a public approach should be made, making it quite clear to the British what we thought of one-sided internment in a situation where political action was required.  A formal representation we felt would be less useful in the situation. Is that what the Deputy wants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have repeatedly told the House that representations made in private, or in conversations, or any discussions we have about it are matters which I do not feel free to publicise. The Deputy is aware of the public replies to the public statements made about interment since the beginning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>In response to the cases put forward by Ireland and the other applicant countries the Community have accepted that serious problems exist for these countries in connection with the provision in the fisheries regulation on free access to fishery waters and that a solution must be found for these problems in the context of the enlargement of the Community.</P>
      <P>The Community put forward specific proposals to us and to the other applicant countries at the ministerial meetings on 9th November which were designed to solve the problems involved. We were unable to accept these proposals as they would not, in our view, have dealt adequately with the problems which free access would involve for us.  The other applicant countries reacted on similar lines in so far as their own particular interests were concerned.</P>
      <P>The Community have now agreed to re-examine the whole question in the light of the arguments put forward by the applicant countries.  We and the other applicant countries are to have further ministerial meetings with the Community on 29th November and in the meantime the Commission is having discussions with these countries.</P>
      <P>My purpose in the negotiations on the fisheries question is to ensure conditions in which the livelihood of our fishermen will be protected, the fish stocks in our waters conserved and our fishing industry expanded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Beef imports to the United States are subject to the imposition of quotas under the United States meat import law of 1964.  Mandatory quotas do not apply at present but a voluntary restraint programme is in operation whereby supplying countries undertake to keep the total import quantity below the level which would bring the statutory restrictions into operation.  Under this arrangement the 1971 quantity fixed for Ireland was 69.7 million 1b. and this amount was increased by 6.2 million 1b. on 3rd November, 1971.</P>
      <P>Cheese of certain kinds is subject to quota under section 22 of the US Agricultural Adjustment Act.  Ireland's total quota for 1971 was fixed at 756,500 lb.</P>
      <P>Sugar imports are governed by the United States Sugar Act, 1948, and subsequent amendments.  The Irish quota for each of the years 1972-4 was fixed on 14th October, 1971, at 5,371 tons&mdash;the same level as for the years 1965-71.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new quota on sugar confectionery <Col N="2264" /> which will cover sweets and chocolates as well as chocolate crumb will come into effect in 1972 under the Sugar Act Amendment of 1971.  Chocolate crumb is already subject to import quota under section 22 of the United States Agricultural Adjustment Act.  Ireland's chocolate crumb quota for 1971 was fixed at 13.2 million lb.  A case is at present being pressed for a quota allocation to Ireland for sugar confectionery and chocolate crumb which would adequately provide for our exporters' needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.  I am informed by the ESB that it is not possible to state the precise number of new houses awaiting connection at any one time without a considerable amount of research.  The present annual rate of new house connections is about 15,000 with over 10,000 of these arising in estates. Connection to houses can be delayed in certain cases due to local difficulties &mdash;for example, peaks of house completion, simultaneous completions at different parts of a big estate with no development in between <i>et cetera.</i> The board must work within the limits of the capital available and it would be unreasonable to ask them to gear themselves generally to completely obviating such delays.</P>
      <P>Connection to isolated houses in rural areas can be held up because of the necessity to keep to the planned rural electrification programme 1971-75.  The aim of this programme is to offer supply at subsidised terms to all unconnected rural householders by 1975.  To achieve this target it is essential that the ESB proceed systematically, rural area by rural area, not diverting resources to making individual connections to supply out of turn, which are wasteful of both capital and labour.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any specific cases in mind I will have their positions examined by the board on receipt of details.</P>

      <P>The Income Tax Acts provide that, notwithstanding that an appeal has been made against an assessment to income tax, the tax charged in the assessment carries interest from the statutory due date as if there were no appeal against the assessment.  The interest charge may, however, be avoided.</P>
      <P>Where an assessment is under appeal, the taxpayer and the inspector of taxes may come to an agreement as to the amount of the payment to be made on account.  Where this is done and (a) the payment on account is made within two months from the due date and (b) the balance of the tax found to be due on determination of the appeal is paid within two months from the date of the determination, no interest whatever is payable in respect of the tax.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, where an agreement has not been reached between the taxpayer and the inspector, if a payment, which proves to be at least 80 per cent of the tax ultimately found to be due on determination of the appeal, is made by the taxpayer within two months from the due date and the balance of the tax found to be due is paid within two months from the date of the determination, no interest is payable.</P>
      <P>If it transpires that the payment on account made by the taxpayer is in excess of the tax ultimately found to be due he is refunded the tax plus interest at the same rate&mdash;that is, .75 per cent per month&mdash;as interest charged on late payments.</P>

      <P>The personal income tax allowance for a married man amounting to £424&mdash;£524 for the year of marriage&mdash;together with the appropriate earned income relief constitute the main elements in the tax-free allowances.  While earned income relief varies with the amount of earnings the minimum amount of relief for a married man is £250.  The effect of this taken together with the personal allowance of £424 is that a married man with earnings of £674 a year is not liable to tax.  If he pays social welfare contributions he is entitled to claim a further deduction of £18 bringing the tax-free earnings to £692.</P>
      <P>The personal allowance of £424 and the minimum earned income relief of £250 were raised to their present levels in 1969 and 1971 respectively.  The question of further increasing these allowances is a budgetary matter which will receive consideration at the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the effects which the application of the Community price and marketing system will have on prices generally for cattle here, it has not been considered necessary to seek special arrangements for the continuation, after Ireland's accession to the Community, of the <Col N="2282" /> licensing control which at present applies to exports of calves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think the Deputy should put down a separate question to get to the roots of this.  I do not understand it fully myself.  It would be for my own information as well as the Deputy's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is concern amongst some farmers in Northern Europe in regard to very heavy exports from their countries of very young calves for veal to Southern Italy, exports which are disrupting the economies to some extent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This may well be the case with Northern European farmers, let us say in Northern Germany or Denmark, but the Deputy will be aware that the system of husbandry there, and especially the system of zero grazing and the use of grasslands in the way they use them, would warrant the export of calves in their case but not in ours.  In our case, having as we do the best conditions in Europe for the production of grass, it would be a very unwise step for Irish farmers to engage in the export of calves except in very extraordinary circumstances because the price they could hope to get by bringing the cattle to maturity, say, at the age of two years&mdash;and I think the maturity age will be dropping somewhat&mdash;would be much more profitable for Irish farmers than what they would get by exporting them as calves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that in the main the people who rear the calves would not be the people bringing them to maturity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy will also appreciate that expectation of very substantial rises in the price of beef will automatically reflect increases in the price of calves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It should, and probably will.  If the Deputy has been watching, there is a tendency for calf prices even now to rise quite spectacularly in recent times.  I anticipate this rise will continue if the Deputy considers that calves being purchased now will be coming towards maturity after January, 1973.  This is one of the reasons why farmers are purchasing calves and paying heavily for them now.  They are anticipating the rises likely to accrue at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the estimated percentage increase in livestock prices when this country joins the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The current guide price for cattle in the EEC is some 50 per cent above average fat cattle prices here in 1970.  There is as yet no common market organisation for sheep and lamb in the Community and consequently it is not possible to say at this stage whether a common price system will operate and if so, at what level.  However, having regard to the high prices obtaining at present in the existing Community and to the improved conditions of access to Community markets which we can expect to enjoy following accession, it is reasonable to assume that there will be a substantial rise in Irish sheep and lamb prices after we join.  In the case of pigs, where market conditions have a major influence on price, the existing Community average market price is about £19 per cwt. deadweight compared with approximately £16 per cwt. deadweight here in 1970.  While on the basis of these figures there should also be an increase in pig prices here following accession, the size of this increase will, of course, depend on actual market conditions prevailing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals for the introduction in the near future of a scheme of legal aid in civil cases and I am not satisfied that I would be justified in singling out one particular type of civil proceeding in this context.  I may say, in reference to the particular type of case mentioned in the question, namely the case of a married couple desiring legal separation, that in many cases there is no need for High Court proceedings as legal separation can be arranged by an agreed separation deed drawn up by a solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently received, from an organisation concerned with family problems, representations about cases where only one of the parties desires legal separation, possibly as a result of continued serious ill-treatment, where all efforts of reconciliation have failed, and where the costs of High Court proceedings would be beyond the means of the person concerned.  I have suggested that, as the matter is a very complex one with many facets, <Col N="2316" /> the best approach would be for the organisation concerned to make a submission to the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure, Four Courts, Dublin.</P>

      <P>I agree that can be the situation in some cases but in the cases referred to in Deputy Corish's question&mdash;and indeed in the majority of cases&mdash;both parties desire separation and in those instances it is not necessary to entail any expense in court, it is only necessary to go to a solicitor to have a deed drawn up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the acute economic position of many deserted wives, he will consider increasing, as a matter of extreme urgency, the maximum amount payable on maintenance orders to women in this position; and, if he will also enter into discussions with the British Government about the possibility of introducing reciprocal legislation whereby Irishmen who desert to the United Kingdom can be made pay maintenance to their wives in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to section 18 of the Courts Bill 1971, which has been passed by the Seanad and which is now before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders between this country and Britain, the position is that there is no real prospect of such an arrangement coming into effect for some time yet.  Detailed discussions have already taken place with the British authorities and good progress has been made but the enactment of the necessary legislation on the British side is not expected to be possible for some time yet.  Moreover, it now appears possible that a bilateral agreement with Britain may not be the most satisfactory solution from our point of view because the EEC countries have concluded a convention on the reciprocal enforcement of court judgments <Col N="2318" /> and the provisions of that convention, which presumably this country will be ratifying on our accession, may suit our needs better than any alternative.  The EEC Convention is not confined to maintenance orders but applies to court judgments generally, with some exceptions. The matter will be discussed further both with the British and with EEC representatives and, for the moment, our options are being kept open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the case, as I understood from the Minister's reply, perhaps wrongly, that if and when we do join the EEC this will automatically become, effective, where then is the option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is whether it would be worth our while making a bilateral agreement with Britain in the meantime to cover the period between now and the date of accession.  I understand the EEC authorities have stated they do not favour these bilateral agreements being entered into at this juncture.  This is particularly so in the light of the fact that it would be a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that we had reached agreement in principle with Britain and the obstacle lay on their side because of problems in their legislative programme.  Where then is the option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems is that the British have agreed with us so far as our side of this problem is concerned but they have to try to reach agreement with a number of other countries and they are finding difficulty in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>Compilation of the figures for prosecutions would involve a special check of Garda and court records at local level and I do not consider that their value would justify the work that would be involved.</P>

      <P>Suim £505,000 atá i Meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta i mbliana.  Nuair a chuirtear leis sin airleacan £475,000 as an bPríomhChiste do Ghaeltarra Éireann, feicfear go bhfuil beagnach £3 mhilliún á chur ar fáil i mbliana don Roinn agus do Ghaeltarra ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht agus leis an nGaeilge. Is geall le méadúfaoi chúig é sin ar an tsuim bhliantúil a bhí ar fáil don Roinn agus do Ghaeltarra sular foilsíodh an Páipéar Bán um Athbheochan na Gaeilge.  Is deimhniú eile é seo go bhfuil leas eacnamaioch, sóisialach agus cultúrtha na Gaeltachta á chur ar aghaidh ag an Rialtas le fonn agus le ruinneamh.</P>
      <P>Is mar seo a leanas atá príomhshuimeanna na bliana seo:-</P>
      <P>£225,000 le haghaidh scéimeanna tithíochta: ardú £55,00 ón mbliain seo caite,</P>
      <P>£763,000 le haghaidh scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht: ardú £268,000,</P>

      <P>£675,000 do Ghaeltarra le haghaidh na ndeontas a íoctar chun comhthionscail agus miontionscadail a chur chun cinn: ardú £75,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá roinne mhaith sonraí i dtaobh scéimeanna agus obair Roinn na Gaeltachta ar fáil go héasca i Leabhrán Eolais na Roinne: seoladh cóipeanna den eagrán reatha chuig na Teachtaí cheana.  Nuair a chuirtear caiteachas na bliana seo caite leis na figiúirí in aguisín sa leabhrán sin, feicfear gur caitheadh suas le £10 milliún d'airgead poiblí in imeacht sé bliana ó foilsíodh an Páipéar Bán a luaigh mé.  Is i rith na trémhse sin a rinneadh mórán de <Col N="2322" /> na scéimeanna sa leabhrán a thionscnamh nó a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla go bhfuil i gceist ag an Dáil gníomhaíochtaí Roinn na Gaeltachta a thabhairt chun suntais maidir leis an soláthar a deonaíodh don bhliain dar chríoch 31 Márta, 1971, ba mhaith liom léargas a thabhairt ar obair na bliana sin.</P>
    <P>Faoi na Scéimeanna tithíochta críochnaíodh cásanna mar seo a leanas:&mdash; 160 teach nua; 280 feabhsú tí; 270 seomra folcaidh; 250 soláthar uisce; 250 saoráid séarachais; 90 feabhsú uisce agus séarachais; 50 méadú speisialta do chuanirteoirí agus 20 sealla saiore.</P>
    <P>I gcás na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin rinneadh obair mar seo a leanas:&mdash; 170 feabhsú bóthair áise; 800 foirgneamh feirme; 1,300 feabhsú plásán féaraigh agus 1,200 feabhsú thionscadal talún.</P>
    <P>Tá feabhas á chur i gcónaí ar áiteanna calaíochta beaga ar fud na Gaeltachta agus, ar ndóigh, bíonn muiroibreacha móra á ndéanamh chomh maith.  Tá fad curtha leis an bpiara i gCill Rónáin, Inis Mór, ar chostas os cionn £100,000 agus tá náios mó ná £60,000 caite ar oibreacha feabhsúcháin ar an gCloch Mhór&mdash; Darby's Point&mdash;Oileán Acla.  Tá tús curtha le hoibreacha i gcuan an Daingin a chosnóidh breis agus £100,000 agus tá deontas £360,000 ceadaithe chun scéim mhór a chur i gcrích i Ros an Mhíl.</P>
    <P>Tá spéis ar leith againn sna hoileáin Ghaeltachta agus, dá chomhartha sin, tá aerpháirceanna tótha ar Inis Mór agus ar Inis Meáin le cabhair dheontas ón Roinn; tá córas speisialta leictreachais curtha ar fáil cheana ar Oileán Chléire agus tá córas dá leithéid á chur ar fáil ar Oileán Thoraí agus á bheartú d'oileáin eile.  Oileáin nach bhfuil teacht acu ar an ngnáthsholáthar leictreachais atá i gceist agam agus is amhlaidh a rinne an Rialtas socrú speisialta faoina seasann Roinn na Gaeltachta costas bunaithe scéime agus faoina nglacann na hoileánaigh féin, trí chomharchumann, le reachtáil na scéime.  Bhí deis ag Teachtaí cúrsaí Ghaeltarra Éireann a phlé i mí Márta seo caite nuair a bhí Bille faoi bhráid <Col N="2323" /> na Dála chun cumbachtaí Ghaeltarra a leathú tuilleadh.  Le blianta beaga anuas, ó tugadh cumhachtaí breise do Ghaeltarra chun tionscail a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht, is mór an dul chun cinn atá dénta.  Tig le Gaeltarra scaireanna a ghlacadh i gcomhlachtaí agus deontais tionscail a thabhairt do na comhchomhlachtaí sin.  Chomh maith leis sin is féidir le Gaeltarra deontais a thabhairt chun miontionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur ar aghaidh gan dul i bpáirtíocht leis na daoine ina mbun. Tá cur síos ar a raibh déanta go dtí deireadh na bliana 1970 le fáil i dtuarascálacha Ghaeltarra atá leagtha faoi bhráid na Dála.  Nuair a bheidh na tionscail, idir mhór agus bheag, a bhfuil cúnamh ceadaithe ag Gaeltarra dóibh faoi lánseol, meastar go mbeidh breis mhaith agus 1,500 cainteoir Gaeilge eile ag obair iontu.  Ní nach ionadh bíonn fadhbanna le réiteach ag cuid de na tionscail nua ach déanann Gaeltarra gach dícheall chun aon deacrachtaí a shárú.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairim gur tuilleadh fostaíochta an príomhriachtanas ar fud na Gaeltachta go fóill.  Sin é an fáth a bhfuil láfhostaíocht sna seachtóidí do na cainteoirí Gaeilge mar chuspóir ag an Rialtas agus is chuige sin a d'iarr mé ar Ghealtarra tamall maith ó shin plean speisialta a leagan amach.</P>
    <P>I mí Bealtaine seo caite cheadaigh mé moladh ó Chomhairle na Gaeilge go mbunódh Gaeltarra agus Cuideachta Forbartha Aerfort Neamhchustam na Sionna Teo meitheal iobre chun tuarascáil a ullmhú agus beidh mé ag súil leis an tuarascáil sin go luath.</P>
    <P>Ba maith liom go dtuigfí nach mar ionad ar an léarscáil a fhéachaimse ar an nGaeltacht ach mar chomhluadar daoine arb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáhtheanga i gcúrsaí an lae.  Is mian liom go mbeidh fonn ar na caianteoirí dúchais sin fanacht sa Ghaeltacht agus leanúint orthu ag labhairt na Gaeilge. Chuige sin is maith a thuigim go bhfuil fadhbanna le réteach agus airgead le caitheamh.  Ní sa Ghaeltacht amháin, áfach, atá, atá fadhbanna mar sin. Is é mo thuairimse nach bhfuil cúis ar bith go bhfaigheadh ceantar sa Ghaeltacht <Col N="2324" /> níos mó cabhrach ón Stát ná áiteanna eile mura bhfuil muintir an cheantair sin ag cloí leis an nGaeilge. Dá bhrí sin, ní cóir d'aon cheantar bheith ag súil le cabhair speisialta Ghaeltachta mura bhfuil an Ghaeilge go láidir ann nó mura bhfuil tréaniarracht á dénamh ann leis an nGaeilge a chaomhnú agus a chothú.</P>
    <P>Creidim féin gur fédir a chur ar chumas na gcainteoirí Gaeilge buntástí na linne seo a bheith acu chun saol iomlán a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine ann nach n-aontódh leis sin toisc go gceapann siad go mbeidh deireadh leis an nGaeltacht mura gcoinneofar an saghas saoil agus na slite beatha a bhí riamh ann.  Ach ba chóir go dtuigfimis go léir nach bhfanfaidh muintir na Gaeltachta sa Ghaeltacht mura bhfaighidh siad ann na háiseanna agus an caighdeán maireachtála a bhíonn ar fáil in áteanna eile; agus ní tógtha orthu é sin.  Ní ceart dúinn a bheith ag súil le híobairt&mdash;íobairt nach mbeimis féin sásta a dhéanamh&mdash;ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta d'fhonn saol an phobail ansin a choimeá d sa riocht ina raibh sé sa tsean-aimsir.  Is é mo thuairimse gur fédir aonad bríomhar forbarthach a dhéanamh den réigiún Gaeltachta agus gur féidir dul chun cinn an fichiú haois a thabhairt i gcrích ann gan dochar don Ghaeilge.  Chuige sin caithfear cultúr na Gaeltachta a aithint mar chultúr a bhfuil forbairt agus athrú ag teacht air faoi mar a thagann ar gach cultúr beo. I ngach rud a dhéanfar, áfach, caithfear an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú: is tríd an nGaeilge bheo is fearr a choinneoimid fíorthuiscint ar shaintréithe ár gcine.</P>
    <P>Tá cúpla rud nua ag teacht ar aghaidh agus táim cinnte go gcuideoidh siad go mór le pobal an réiguúin Ghaeltachta chun a dteanga agus a gcultúr a chothú agus a chur chun cinn.  Is é Radio na Gaeltachta an Chéad cheann.  Is eol don Dáil gur shocraigh an Rialtas go gcuirfí lánseirbhís chraolta ar fáil don Ghaeltacht; chomh maith le tuairisciú nuachta beidh cláir ann a léireoidh gach gné de shaol sóisialach, cultúrha agus eachnamaíoch na Gaeltachta.  Faoi mar a fógraiodh cheana, tá breis agus £1/4 mhilliún á chur ar fáil ag an Rialtas do na hoibreacha caipitil.  Tá Comhairle <Col N="2325" /> Radio na Gaeltachta.  Ceannaire agus clár-reachtaíiceaptha agus tá suil agam go mbeidh an tseirbhis ar an aer go luath san athbhliain.</P>
    <P>Is é an dara rud nua atá i gceist agam ná an t-atheagrú atá beartaithe don chóras rialtais áitiúil faoi mar a míníodh sa Pháipéar Bán a d'fhoilsigh an Railtas i dtús na bliana seo.  Ba mhaith liom mir amhain a léamh amach mar gheall ar an nGaeltacht:</P>
    <P>Is ar phobal na Gaeltachta atáhar ag brath chun labhairt na Gaeilge mar ghnáththeanga a chothú ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Mar chabhair chuige sin ba mhaith leis an Rialtas go mbeadh pobal na Gaeltachta in ann tuilleadh freagrachta a ghlacadh, ar mhodh daonlathach, i ngnóthai riaracháin a bhaineann leo féin agus na gnóthai sin a dhéanamh tri Ghaeilge.  Déanfar socruithe, mar sin, chun go bhféadfar:</P>
    <P>&mdash;toghlimistéir áitiúla ar leith a leagan amach do cheantair Ghaeltachta,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a chur ar chumas an phobail sna ceantair sin ionadaithe a thoghadh, agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;cumhachtaí agus feidhmeanna de chuid na gcomhairlí contae a thabhairt do na hionadaithe sin.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag súil go dtiocfaidh de na socruithe sin gur fearr a bhrostófar le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge araon agus gur fearr a chothófar muinín phobal na Gaeltachta astu féin.</P>
    <P>Tháinig moltaí ó eagrais agus ó dhaoine égsúa&mdash;agus ba mhór an chabhair iad&mdash;mar gheall ar an saghas rialtais átiúil is fearr a d'oirfeadh don Ghaeltacht.  Tá buíochas ar leith tuillte ag Comhairle na Gaeilge as ucht an staidéir a rinne siad ar an gceist chasta sin.  Tháinig an Railtas ar chinneadh faoin scéal le déanai agus tiocfaidh an Bille cuí os comhair na Dála a luaithe is féidir.  Beidh deis ag Teachtai an scéal a phlé go mion ansin.  Go hachomair is é atá beartaithe nána hionadaithe a thoghfar do thoghlimistéir nua Ghaeltachta i ngach contae Gaeltachta a thabhairt le chéile mar Choiste Gaeltachta agus na comhaltaí go léir de na <Col N="2326" /> coisti sin a thabhairt le chéile mar Lár-Chomhairle na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ní leis an nGaeltacht amháin, ar ndóigh, a bhaineann feidhm Roinn na Gaeltachta i dtaobh labhairt na Gaeilge a spreagadh.  Dá chomhartha sin tá soláthar sa Mheastachán chun cabhrú le heagrais Ghaeilge, le nuachtáin agus téimhseacháin a fhoilsitear inGaeilge agus le gearrscannáin Ghaeilge.  Tig leis na heagrais dheonacha a lán a dhéanamh chun an gnáthphobal a thabhairt tuilleadh i dtreo na Gaeilge agus nós labhartha na teanga a fhairsingiú ina measc.  D'fhonn go mbeidh toradh ceart ar dheontais na Roinne chuir mé in iúl d'ionadaithe na n-eagras i gComhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge go geaithfidh siad pleananna soiléire oibre, mar aon le spriocanna nó cuspóiri soaitheanta, a leagan amach dóibh féin: is é atá uaim ná go bhféadfar féachaint chuige nach mbeidh gach eagras ar leith ag imeacht ar a bhealach féin gan aird cheart ar a mbeadh ar siúl ag eagrais eile.  Ina theannta sin, tá curtha in iúl d'eagrais Ghaeilge nach bhfuil aon chúis mhaith go leanfadh an Roinn ar aghaidh ag tabhairt deontas dóibh mura léir go bhfuil ag éri leo bá agus tacaíocht an phobail ina leith a mhéadú &mdash;agus tacaiocht airgid go hárithe: ni sásúil an rud go mbeadh deontas na Roinne d'eagras an-ard i gcomparáid le teacht isteach an eagrais ó fhoinsí eile.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine ann&mdash;agus cuid de chairde na Gaeilge ina measc&mdash;a cheapann go gcaillfear an Ghaeilge nuair a rachaimid isteach i gComhphobal na hEorpa.  Ni aontaimse ar chor ar bith leis an dearcadh diúltach sin.  Dá mhéad teagmháil a bheidh aggainn le cultúir éagsúla is ea is mó, dar liomsa, an meas a bheidh againn ar ár ndúchas féin.  Is é mo thuairim, mar sin, gurb amhlaidh a rachaidh dlúthchaidreamh le muintir na hEorpa chun tairbhe dár gcultúr dúchais.  Is é an t-ullmhúchán is fearr don Choómhargadh ná sinn féin a neartú i gcúrsai eacnamaíchta, i gcúrsai sóisialta agus i gcúrsai cultúir. Sin é atá ar siúl ag Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag Gaeltarra Éreann&mdash;a bhfuil soláthar dóibh sa Mheastachán seo.</P>

      <P>Dúirt an Rúnai Parlaiminte go raibh sé chun breis airgid a <Col N="2327" /> chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Fáiltim roimh an ráiteas sin ach níl sé soileír anseo conas a chaithfear an t-airgead.</P>
      <P>Sé an priomh-phointe atá aige anseo go bhfuil £225,000 le haghaidh scéimeanna tithíochta, ardú £55,000 ón mbliain seo caite.  Ar tógadh níos mó tithe sa Ghaeltacht i mbliana ná mar a tógadh sa bhliain seo caite?  An bhfuil nios mó scéimeanna feabhasúchain sa Ghaeltacht ná mar a bhi an bhliain seo caite?</P>
      <P>Measaim féin go bhfuil a fhios ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte&mdash;tá conaí air sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;go bhfuil na costais i gcóir teach nua a thógháil ardaithe go mór.  D'fhéadfadh duine sa Ghaeltacht timpeall £550 d'fháil chun tigh a thógáil.  Bhi an méid céanna airgid le fáil deich mbliain ó shin, agus nach bhfuil sé in am anois árdu mór&mdash;abhair 25 faoin gcéad&mdash;a dhéanamh maidir leis na deontais sin chun tigh a thógail anois?</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom dá ndéanfai an scéal sin a iniúchadh mar tá a fhios ag an Rúnai Parlaiminte go bhfuil costais amh-abhair ag dul in airde agus nach bhfuil aon ni ag éiri nios saoire.  Tá a fhios ag gach Teachta atá ar chomhairle contae nach bhfuil aon airgead ag teacht ón Roinn Rialtais Átiúil chun scéimeanna séarachais agus scéimeanna uisce a chur ar fáil. Nach bhfuil sé in am d'Aire na Gaeltachta rá leis an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil go mba cheart dul ar aghaidh leis na scéimeanna atá beartaithe do na Gaeltachtaí? Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire agus ag gach Teachta atá ina bhall de chomhairle contae go bhfuil na scéimeanna istigh i dTeach an Chuistaim leis na blianta. Tá sé in am don Aire Rialtais Átiúil na scéimeanna sin a chur go dti na comhairli contae i gCorcaigh, i nGaillimh, i gContae Mhuigheo, i nDún na nGall agus i gContae Chiarraí</P>
      <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh scéim uisce nó scéim séarachais ins na tithe sna Gaeltachtaí.  Na daoine a thagann ó Shasana agus ó Bhaile Átha Cliath, tá na h-áiseanna sin acu ina dtithe féin agus nuair a thagann siad ar a laethe saoire chun na Gaeltachtaí bíonn na rudai sin á lorg acu.  Iarraim ar an Aire Féachaint chuige sin.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2328" /> Chuir sé ionadh orm nach raibh aon fhocal in aon chor i ráiteas an Rúnai Pharlaiminte mar gheall ar an iascaireacht. Tá rudaí anseo is ansiúd aige ag cur in iúl go bhfuil airgead á chaitheamh aige chun cabhrú leis na daoine.  Táim ag ceapadh nach bhfuil aon mhaitheas sna cúntais sin muna bhfuil scéim ag Roinn na Gaeltachta chun na buachaillí atá ina gcónai cois farriage a ghrífosadh agus deontais speisialta a thúirt dóibh chun báid a cheannach.  Cuirim milleán ar Roinn na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil nios mó buachailli óna Gaeltachtaí ag gabháil leis an iascaireacht, mar sli bheatha atá ann, sli bheatha shuimiúil, agus na daoine atá ag iascaireacht anois tá saol maith acu agus tásiad pósta agus tá siad ábalta tithe a cheannach agus tá gach duine atá ag iascaireacht sásta. Ba cheart do Roinn na Gaeltachta níos mó airgid a chaitheamh sa tsli sin.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Rúnai Parlaiminte linn go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann le nios mó oibre a chur ar fáil do na daoine atá ag maireachtaint sa Ghaeltacht.  An raibh an Rúnai Parlaiminte i ndáirire? Mar is eol do gach duine sa Teach seo, cúpla seachtain ó shin, nuair a foilsiodh cúntais Ghaeltarra Éireann ar na nuachtáin, nochtaiodh cailliúint mhór. Tháinig ráteas&mdash;nil a fhios agam cad as&mdash;go bhfuiltear chun deireadh a chur le Gaeltarra Éireann agus rud éigin eile a chur ina ionad.  Nil focal dá laghad anseo go bhfuil deireadh le Gaeltarra Éireann.  An bhfuil a fhios ag an Rúnai Parlaiminte cad tá a dhéanamh ag Gaeltarra Éireann?</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach bhfuil aon fhirinne san ráiteas úd go bhfuil deireadh le Gaeltarra Éireann.  Measaim nach ceart deireadh a chur leis mar tá a fhios agam go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann ag déanamh a ndíchill chun saol mhuintir na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú agus obair a chur ar fáil do na daoine atá ag maireachtaint sa Ghaeltacht. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAire ábalta a rá linn ag deireadh na deóspoireachta seo cad tá i ndán do Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Tá seanfhocal ann: &ldquo;The divil you know is better than the divil you do not know.&rdquo;  Measaim fein go mba cheart don Aire a rá linn go soiléir cad tá in aigne Roinn na Gaeltachta agus in aigne Aire na Gaeltachta <Col N="2329" /> i dtaobh Gaeltarra Éireann.  Is féidir a rá anseo anois go bhfuil Gaeltarra Éireann ag déanamh a ndichill chun na daoine a choimeád sa Ghaeltacht.  Dá dtabharfadh an tAire Airegadais nios mó airgid do Ghaeltarra Éireann do bheadh i bhfad nios mó rudai ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht ná mar atá faoi láthair. Tá daoine, go mór mhór daoine i small industries, g cur litreacha chuig Gaeltarra Éireann agus nil Gaeltarra Éireann ábalta aon ni a dhéanamh dóibh toisc nach bhfuil an t-airgead acu.  Is mór an tru é seo.  B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAaire ábalta rud éigin a rá linn i dtaobh Gaeltarra Éireann. An bhfuil sé chun nios mó airgid a thúirt dóibh?  An bhfuil sé beartaithe aige deireadh a chur leo?  Tá an cheist sin an-shuimiúil agus tá a lán daoine atá ag obair sna Gaeltachtai, go mór mhór i nDún na nGall agus i nGaillimh ag rá, ótháining an ráteas seo amach, go bhfuil deireadh lena slí bheatha.  Tá ionadh orm nach bhfuil aon fhocal mar gheall air anseo.</P>
    <P>Bhí an Rúnai Pairlaiminte ag caint mar gheall ar rialtas áitiúil i gcóir na Gaeltachta.  Cuirim fáilte roimhe sin.  Ar an dtaobh eile den scé, an mbeidh &ldquo;Boundary Commission&rdquo; ann chun na Gaeltachtai a leagaint amach agus &ldquo;electoral divisions&rdquo; a leagaint amach?  Ós rud é go bhfuil i bhfad nios mó buachailli agus cailíní ag dul go dti an mheánscoil agus an cheard scoil, tá i bhfad nios mó Gaeilge ag na páisti, abair, ná mar a bhi acu deich nó chúig bhliain ó shin ann ins na bailti agus na h-áiteanna i n-aice leis na Gaeltachtai.  An bhfuil an tAire anois chun &ldquo;border&rdquo; eile a chur suas?  Tá &ldquo;Border&rdquo; amháin sa tír agus táa fhios ag gach énne an diobháil atá an &ldquo;Border&rdquo; sin ag déanamh.</P>
    <P>Má tá an tAire chun na paróisti sin a briseadh suas, abair, go bhfuil an teach so sa Ghaeltacht agus nach bhfuil an teach sin sa Ghaeltacht, beidh sé ag cur suas &ldquo;berrier&rdquo; nó &ldquo;border&rdquo; sna h-áiteacha sin agus beidh a fhios ag an Aire le h-imeacht aimsire an diobháil a dhein an &ldquo;border&rdquo; sin.  Nil a fhios agam cén slí atá beartaithe aige chun na bailti seo nó na &ldquo;electoral divisions&rdquo; a leagaint amach.  Tóg, mar shampla, <Col N="2330" /> an Daingean nó an Clochá Liath i nDún na nGall agus b'fhéidir áit in aice na Gaillimhe.  Tá an Ghaeilge sna bailte sin.  Tá an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga ag na páisti scoile anois.  Tá an Ghaeilge ag a lán de na daoine atá ag obair ann.  An bhfuil an tAire á rá anois go bhfuil sé chun deireadh a chur leis na daoine sin agus á rá leo nach bhfuil siad sa Ghaeltacht anois?  Caithfidh an tAire bheith an-chúramach ar fad nach ndéanfaidh sé diobháil don Ghaeltacht nuair a bheidh na &ldquo;eletoral divisions&rdquo; á leagadh amach aige. &ldquo;No gerrymandering&rdquo; anois.</P>

    <P>Is mó an trua nach bhfuil an tAire Rialtais Áitiúil sa Teach ag éisteacht leis an ndiospóireaccht seo agus an tAire Oideachais chomh maith.  Tá cónai ar an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil i nGaillimh agus tá a fhios aige cad tá ar suúl sa Ghaeltacht.  Níl a fhios ag an Aire Oideachais mar tá seisean ina chónai i gContae Lú.  Bhi mé ar tí a ránach raibh suim ar bith ag an Aire Oideachais sa Ghaeltacht ach tá a fhios agam go bhfuil suim aige inti mar labhrann sé an Gheilge i gcónai.

    <P>Tá a fhios ag gach duine go bhfuil fearg ar mhuiintir na Gaeltachta anois mar nach bhfuil aon ni fágtha sna Gaeltachtai ach páisti is daoine óga.

    <P>Tá a fhios ag gach éinne cén fáth. Thóg an tAire Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh an &ldquo;dole&rdquo; óna &ldquo;lads&rdquo; agus chuaigh na &ldquo;lads&rdquo; go léir thar sáile mar nach raibh aon phúnt ag teachy istaech cuchu.  Tá sort &ldquo;pride&rdquo;ag na daoine seo.  Ní raibh siad sásta púnta a lorg ón athair nó ón máthair oiche Shathairn chun cúpla deoch a cheannach.</P>
    <P>Nilim chun mórán eile a rá ach is mór an trua nár labhair an Rúnai Parlaiminte i mBéarla leis mar tá Teachtaí anseo nach bhfuair an seans céanna a fuair mé féin agus roint daoine eile an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.  Tá a fhios againn inár gcroi go bhfuil suim ag na Teachtaái sin sa Ghaeltachta, go dtéann cuid acu chun na Gaeltachta ar a laethe saoire agus go ndéanfadh siad rud ar bith chun cabhrú leis an nGaeltacht. Ni mór dúinn a admháil nach mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáththeanga ag muintir na hÉireanna a choche ach tá seans maith ann go mbeidh an tir seo dhá-theangach.</P>
    <P>I shall not speak at any grat length in English.  I make these remarks now without any animosity of any kind towards the Minister or the Parliamentary Secreatary; I think the Parliamentary Secreatary should have spoken in English as well as in Irish.  He has distributed a copy of his intrductory speech in English, but he should also have spoken in English.  Everybody, with a few exceptions, has goodwill for the language but, because the Parliamentary <Col N="2332" /> Secreatary introduced this Estiamte in Irish, Deputies who might have something useful to contribute may be reluctant to do so.  I appeal to Deputies who are interested in the Gaeltacht and in the Irish language to make an efort to speak in Irish and, if they cannot speak in Irish, then I appeal to them to contribute to the debate by speaking in English.  they may have something to contribute which has escaped the attention of everybody else, something which might lead to an improvement in the lives of those reside in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not increase the housing and the reconstruction grants.  One does not have to be a mathematician to appreciate that the cost of building has gone up, from 1955 to 1971, by at least 50 per cent, if not more.  The grant was fixed in 1955-56 at £550.  It should now be increased by 25 per cent at least to £750 or £800.  I made this point last year, but apparently the Minister did not listen to me.  It is regrettable that the Minister for Local Government is not sitting in on this debate.  Every Deputy who is a member of a local authority knows that schemes are pushed forward by county councils to the Minister for Local Government for sanction, and some of these schemes, if sanctioned by the Minister, and if money was provided for them, would be of benefit to the people in the Gaeltacht.  There is no use telling us that we are giving extra incentives to the people living in Gaeltachta when all the water and sewerage schemes have been held up in the Custom House for the past five or six years and held up for lack of finance.  If the Minister came to the House today and told us &ldquo;I have sanctioned this scheme: I have let this scheme through&rdquo;; and read out all the different schemes that were held up there, every Deputy would clap him on the back.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to have a chat with the MInister for Local Government with a view to getting all those schemes, whether for Cork, Kerry , Clare, Mayo, Galway, Donegal or Waterford going.  If they have to do with the Gaeltacht or adjoining the Gaeltacht, he should let these schemes <Col N="2333" /> through so that work would start. Everybody knows that many of the people in the Gaeltacht ar dependent on the tourist industry, and the first priority of any person from Dublin or from England on arrival in a Gaeltacht is water and sewerage, and if a house has not got these facilities, he is not going to stay there.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to have a look at this matter because these people can supplement their income by the extra grants which the Minister has made available for chalets&mdash;we congratulate him for this initiative&mdash;but when they have not got those facilities, they lose their effect altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a local authority were envisaged for the Gaeltacht and I welcome that announcement, but I should point out to him&mdash;he knows it as well as I do&mdash;that in the last ten years the knowledge of Irish of the younger generation, due to free secondary and technical education, must have increased enormously.  It is a well-known fact that these children can now speak the Irish language fluently, every bit as well as people in the Gaeltacht, and this is very true of those in the parishes adjoining Gaeltachta.  I for one would not like to see borders created in different parishes, in different townlands, whether in Mayo, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Cork or Waterford, with this house in the Gaeltacht and the other house outside the Gaeltacht.  The Minister for Local Government should be very careful when drawing these boundaries because they could do more harm than good to the Irish language in the long run if such a thing happened.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that politics being what it is, if there is a village of 300 people in the different Gaeltachta divided up, there will be a Fianna Fáil man, a Labour man and a Fine Gael man, and politics being what it is, politics is going to play a very strong role in the appointment of these local authorities.  I know that is true of my own area.  It is fair comment and there is no point in kidding ourselves.  That is going to happen and I do not know how we are going to avoid it but it is a well-know fact that in some Gaeltachta, the people may be all <Col N="2334" /> Fianna Fáil, in another, all Fine Gael, and in another, all Labour.  That is quite possible, quite on the cards, and if it happens politics will rear its ugly head as far as these local authorities are concerned and that then will be the end of these local authorities.  I would ask the Minister when making the boundaries not to take any area which is in the Gaeltacht out of the Gaeltacht. This is the first essential.</P>
    <P>The Minister was down in Listowel a couple of months ago and gave a very enlightening address.  In fact, his address was imaginative and had foresight. He said it was about time that the Gaeltachta forgot their negative attitude and expanded.  I go along wholeheartedly with that because I am quite sure that with proper incentives, with the proper spirit and temperament, the Gaeltachta can be made bigger than they are, and fruitfully so.  I suggest that he might have pilot areas in which to try this experiment and see if it is worthwhile.  It is well-known that in Donegal, in the parish of Gweedore, you have the Gaeltacht, and all the surrounding areas have the Irish language.  You can thank the factories in Gweedore for the grater knowledge of the language which is now developing in Donegal, and Deputy Delap will bear me out on this.  I was very surprised, when canvassing in Donegal last Christmas, to hear such fluent Irish in the parishes adjoining Gweedore.  I think the same could be said of other parishes in different counties as a result of such a policy.  Let us get away from the negative policy and adopt an expansionist policy.</P>
    <P>One thing with which I am disappointed in this ráteas is that the Minister has not placed enough emphasis on fisheries.  He has said that there is so much money allowed for the improvement of different piers and the dreadging of different harbours.  I note that Dingle is mentioned, but it has been there for the past three years and this is the year they start.  He got good mileage out of that.  The point I am making is that the Gaeltachta have a tradition of fishing.  They are beside the sea and the harvest is there beside them.  I think that Roinn na Gaeltachta should provide special incentives for young boys who wish to <Col N="2335" /> make fishing a career.  Let nobody frown on a fisherman.  His way of life today i every bit as lucrative as that of some of the most academic people in the country, if he will work his boat, go out in the morning and come back at night, for six days a week, That has been proved to be successful&mdash;the goahead fisherman has made a success of it and I strongly appeal to the Minister that special incentives should be made available to the young lads in the Gaeltachta to take up fishing.</P>
    <P>I know that this summer a large percentage of young men left the different Gaeltachta.  They left in April because the Minister for Social Welfare in his wisdom decided to take the dole from them, which meant the loss of £2 15s a week to the vast majority of these young lads.  I know that many of them will come back some time in November when the dole will be given back, but some of them probably will not come back, and there is a consequent loss to this community. It is quite true to say that if these people had the incentive, if special grants were made avilable to them, they would make fishing their career.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might send an inspector to the technical and secondary schools because there are so many boys being told now that if they have four honours in their leaving certificate they will get a university scholarship, but some of these boys would make every bit as much at fishing as if they went to the university to follow a profession. No one should frown on the fishermen.  It is a healthy and lucrative life, if a man is prepared to work, as has been proved by several fishermen up and down the coast who are now in a very happy position, thanks to their own industry, hard work and grants from Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I want to make that point very forcibly, that the Minister should adopt a scheme under which lads of 17 and 18, who get maybe only two honours in their leaving certificate, could do the skipper's course and there would be a special incentive for them that because they are from a Gaeltacht, they would qualify for a boat.  We have beautiful ports from Galway to <Col N="2336" /> Donegal, to Kerry and Castletownbere, as well as Dunmore East.  This is where the Gaeltachta are and it is only right that these facilities should be used to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Lig dom an focal deireanach a rá mar gheall ar Radio na Gaeltachta. Nil a fhios agam cén fáth nach raibh an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa i láthair agus Radio na Gaeltachta faoi chaibideal. Measaini go bhfuil fearg ar mhná na Gaeltachta toisc nár cuireadh aon bhean ar an údarás céanna.  Bhi diomá ar mhná na Gaeltachta nach raibh guth ar an údarás seo acu.  Táa fhios ag gach éinne gurb iad na mná a bheidh ag éisteacht le Radio na Gaeltachta mar beidh na fir amuigh sa pháirc.  Nil na &ldquo;transistors&rdquo; in úsáid ag muintir na Gaeltachta sna páirceanna.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs appointed the authority for Radio na Gaetachta he did not include a woman on the authority.  It is well known that it is the women in teh Gaeltacht who will be listening to this radio.  It is an aspersion on them if the Minister thought that not one of them was fit to sit in the company of the men he selected.  Even at this late stage the Minister might see fit to put a woman on the authority.  I am quite sure the feminine point of view would be very helpful.  We have not yet reached the stage in the Gaeltacht where farmers carry transistros out to work while digging or sowing potatoes or threshing and so it is the women who will listen to the radio. I appeal to the Minister, therefore, to inform the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that it would be approriate to have a woman won the authority.</P>

      <P>Cheaps go mbeadh an meastachán seo os ár gcomhair amárach agus, dá bhri sin, náil mórán le rá agam anois.  Aontaim leis an Teachta Begley nuair a dúirt sé go mba chóir do Theachtai Dála mar mé féin a rugadh lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht labhairt san diospóireacht seo mar ba chóir dúinn go léir suim a chur sa Ghaeltacht agus i saol mhuintir na Gaeltachta. <Col N="2337" /> Sí an cheist is mó sa Ghaeltacht easpa iobre agus, chun an firinne a rá, ar feadh na mblianta is beag a rinne Rialtas ar bith ar son na Gaeltachta. Ni fheicim aon rud ar suúl faoi láthair a thugann dóchas dom go dtiochfaidh feabhas ar an scéal.  Nil dada i ráiteas an Rúnai Parlaminte chun dóchas a thúirt dúinn.  Muna gcuirfear obair ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta leanfaidh an meath atá ann faoi láthair i saol eacnamaiochta agus sóisialta na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Rinne an Rúnai Parlaminite tagairt don údarás nua a bheidh sa Ghaeltacht nó sna contaethe ina bhfuil na Gaeltachtai. Is dóigh liom gur maith an rúd é sin.  Is fearr go mbeadh a údarás féis ag gach ceantar.  Gheallann an Stát seo, an Rialtas seo do mhuintir an Tuaiscirt faoi láthair go mbeidh meas againn ar an mionlach Protastúnacll nuair a thiocfaidh siad isteach in Éirinn aontaithe.  Sin é an saghas gill a thugtar i gcónai.  Ach is féidir le mionlach na Gaeltachta a insint do Phrotastúnaigh an Tuaiscirt cén meas atá againn dáirire ar mhionlach na Gaeltachta ar feadh na mblianta fada. Chun na firinne a rá nior thugamar aon chbhair cheart don Ghaeltacht ó thaobh má theipeann ar an ngaeltacht ó thaobh cursai eacnamaiochta dhe tépfidh ar an saol sóisialta freisin.  Cuirim i gcás dúnadh scoil Dhún Chaoin.  Is sompla beag é sin ach is sompla tábhachtach é agus ba mhaith liom tuairim an Rúnai Parlaiminte a fháil inniu.  An bhfuil aon athrú tagtha ar intinn an Rialtais i dtaobh na ceiste seo? An bhfuil aon seans ann go n-osclófar n scoil sin aris?</P>
      <P>I had intended speaking on this Estimate at some length tomorrow but it came up rather suddenly and I must be very brief.  We may have an opportunity when the Parliamentary Secretary, as he has promised here, introduces powers for a Gaeltacht authority, of speaking at grater lenght on a question on which I feel deeply.  I agree with Deputy begley that those born outside the Gaeltacht should have as much interest as anybody else in this serious national question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Begley is worried about the political connotations of the new <Col N="2338" /> authority.  I speak as a member of the Labour Party and I say that all three parties represented here had scant interest in reality in the Irish language. They all carry out the majority wishes of their organisation which is English-speaking. All three parties have paid little attention to the Irish language in any fresh, Genuine or honest way of looking at it because they have had other concerns: they have mirrored the problems of the majority of English speakers in this country.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the new Gaeltacht authority but I hope it is not some kind of Bantu development&mdash;something without real power.  I should be very anxious to ensure that they have real power when the time comes and that they are not simply pictureque additions to Bord Fáilte, making recommendations about the cultural habits of a particular area.  We shall wait and see.  I am not, nor I think is anybody who is interested, concerned about the supremacy of one dialect over another. This State failed the people who spoke Irish as a normal, everyday language in their daily intercourse and discussions. It has failed that community for the past 40 years.  It continues to fail that community.  Usually discussions on the Irish language in this House are bogged down on whether, in fact, we are doing enough to promote it but where it was used as a normal means of expression this State turned its back on this country.</P>
    <P>My point is that promise the minority in the North, the Protestant, that in a united Ireland their interests, their susceptibilities, what they believe in, will be respected.  I am saying that our own minority in this State, the Gaeltacht minority, could tell them in reality what happens to minorities in this State and could tell them much more eloquently than anybody else exactly what might be the Protestant fate in a united Ireland if we can judge by the neglect of this so-called cherished ideal of the Irish language over the years in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I will simply ask the Parlimentary Secretary this: in evidence of good faith is there any rethinking going on <Col N="2339" /> in his Department on the matter of Dún Chaoin school and its re-opening? I think this symbolises whether this Government are serious or sincere on the question of help, change of heart towards Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Rialtas chun a thuilleadh airgid a chaitheamh ar na Gaeltachtaí.  Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoin Ghaeltacht.  Mar is eol daoibh, is i gceantar iargcúlta in iarthar na hÉireann atá furmhór na Gaeltachtaí suite.  Tá an talamh bocht ann.  Níl an bochtanas i bhfad ar siúil in am ar bith.</P>
      <P>Tá caiteachas mór airgid a dhith sna Gaeltachtaí sa dóigh go mbeidh slí bheatha na ndaoine ar chomhchéim le daoine sna bailte móra.  Ba cheart áiseanna nua-aimsire a chur ar fáil dóibh, i.e., uisce reatha, séarchais agus aibhléis a chur ar fáil go gasta sul a raibh na ceantair iargcúlta sin bánaithe.  Caithfear fostaíocht a chur ar fáil go gasta leis na Gaeltachtaí a shlánú agus slí bheatha a thúirt do na daoine sa bhaile.</P>
      <P>Níl an t-eagraíocht atá riachtanach le lán-fhostaíocht a thúirt chun críche ag Gaeltarra Éireann.  Níl cúis gnoithe iontu.  Cuireadh Gaeltarra Éireann ar bun le fostaíocht a thúirt do dhaoine sna Gaeltachtaí agus cé go raibh deacrachtaí ag baint le tionscail a chur ar bun sna h-áiteanna iargcúlta, rinne Gaeltarra Éireann dearmad dá gcuspóir, sé sin, an Ghaelige a leathnú agus anois tá Gealtarra Éireann taobh trom le daoine atá ina gcónaí taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá i bhfad barraíocht bainisteoirí agus bodaigh mhóra nach bhfuil suim nó aird acu ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus níl cúis gnoithe ar bith iontu ach tá said sásta dul ar aghaidh leis an ndul amú atáthar ag cleachtadh ó cuireadh an t-eagraíocht ar bun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2341" /> Chaill Gaeltarra Éireann an aidhm a bhí acu úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú. Níl béim go leor ar úsáid na Gaeilge sna monarchain.  Ba cheart do Gaeltarra Éireann, muna bhfuil béim ar úsáid agus ar leathnú na teanga acu, éirí as an obair agus an obair a thúirt do chomhlucht éigin eile.  Tá daoine ag saothrú a mbeatha acu atá i gcoinne na Gaeilge.  Tá daoine eile ann a bhfuil scoth na Gaeilge acu nach bhfuil i ndán obair a fháil sna monarchain. Is mó an díobháil nó an tairbhe do phobal na daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu i nGaeltarra óir bíonn said ina gceap magaidh agus ina sompla de chur-i-gcéill maidir le slánú na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Níl aon dóchas ag muintir na Gaeltachta as Gaeltarra Éireann.  Ba cheart don Aire Coiste Forbartha don Ghaeltacht a chur ar bun&mdash;ionadaí óna Gaeltachtaí agus ionadaí óna Ranna go léir&mdash;agus comhoibriú a dhéanamh leis an Ghaeltacht a leathnú agus a shlánú.</P>
    <P>Cúis íontais dom, cé gur bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann 40 bliain ó shin, nár tugadh aon traenáil nó aon oiliúint do ghasúir as an Ghaeltacht i gcúrsaí bainisteoireachta.  Tá an intleacht agus an léann agus an Ghaeilge acu ach níl siad maith go leor.  Cúis áthais ar na mallaibh gur mhol an tAire Saothair, Seosamh Ó Braonáin, scoil traenála AnCo a chur ar bun san eastát tionscail i nGaoth Dóbhair le muintir na Gaeltachta a oiliúint le haghaidh na dtionscal.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis an Teachta M. O'Leary nár dhein an Rialtas aon rud do na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá forbairt mhór im pharóiste féin.  Cuireadh dá mhonarcha ar bun ansin.  Tá monarcha eile á chur ar bun agus tá scoil á tógáil agus tá an Ghaeilge go bríomhar ansin agus tá daoine ag teacht chun obair d'fháil sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom níos mó idir-chaidreamh a fheiceáil idir na Gaeltachtaí agus ba mhaith liom dá ndéanfadh an Roinn deontas speisialta a thúirt do gach rud a chuidíonn leis sin, mar shompla, peileadóireacht idir na Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Aontáim leis an Teachta Begley gur ceart deontas na dteach a mhéadú.  Ní raibh aon mhéadú ann ó 1964 cé go <Col N="2342" /> ndeachaidh na bun-ábhair suas go mór.  Níl ach deontas £300 le fáil do shealaí a chosnaíonn £1,600.  Ní leor sin.  Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire deontas faoi leith a chur ar fáil do daoine bochta nach bhfuil ar a gcumas teach a thógáil mar &ldquo;prefabricated, demountable house&rdquo;&mdash;agus daoine a fhágann na h-oileáin nuair a éiríonn siad aosta agus nach bhfuil aon de mhaoin an tsaoil acu.</P>
    <P>Is ceist mór í ceist na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Caithfidh an Rialtas socrú ar leith a dhéanamh do na Gaeltachtaí le h-iad a shlánú san oideachais, i gcomhnascadh na scol, na téacsleabhra, agus mar sin.  Cé go bhfuil forbairt sna Fíor-Ghaeltachtaí, agus tá mo pharóiste féin sa bhaile na measc sin, tá neamart á dhéanamh sna breacGhaeltachtaí agus sna pócaí Gaeilge de na Ghaeltachtaí móra.  Deir Roinn na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil caighdeán na Gaeilge árd go leor iontu sin.  Deir gach Roinn gur leis an nGaeltacht an limistéir sin.  Deir an Ghaeltacht nach leo é agus mar sin de, tá neamart á dhéanamh orthu.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoi theanga agus faoi chultúr.  Ba mhaith liom dá ndéanfadh an tAire timirí a chur ar fáil i nGaeltachtaí chun an pobal a ghríosadh sna ceantracha ina bhfuil an spiorad lag.  Tá gá mór le caitheamh aimsire tré mheán na Gaeilge, ranganna, damhsaí, céilithe a shaothrú, dramaí don aos óg, córacha don aos óg.  I gceantracha tá dearcadh na sean &ldquo;congested districts boards&rdquo; acu go fóil.  Má thugtar aire faoi leith don limistéir sin anois, b'fhéidir gur seo an chéad shompla de leathnú agus de shlánú na Gaeltachta.  Ba chóir timire a cheapadh ar feadh bliana amháin ar dtús agus ansin a shaothar a mheas.  Nárbh fhiú do Roinn na Gaeltachta a leithéid a cheadú?</P>
    <P>Aontaím gur rud maith do na Gaeltachtaí Radio na Gaeltachta agus cé nach raibh mná ar bith ar an udarás tá súil agam go mbeidh mná páirteach sna cláracha.  Aontaím leis an Teachta Begley fosta gur chóir do Roinn na Gaeltachta amharc isteach san iascaireacht arís leis an iascaireacht a mhéadú agus a leathnú, mar slí bheatha deas folláin is ea í agus ba cheart do Roinn na Gaeltachta deontais <Col N="2343" /> a chur ar fáil le céanna agus bádaí móra a sholáthar sa Ghaeltacht. Ba cheart dóibh, fosta, scoláireachtaí a chur ar fáil d'fhir óga sa Ghaeltacht a bhfuil suim acu san iascaireacht.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom buíochas a thúirt don Uasal Ó Colla, Aire na Gaeltachta, agus dá Rúnaí Parlaiminte, Mícheál Ó Ceit, ar son an méid, faoi réim Fianna Fáil, a rinne siad do Ghaeltachtaí Thír Chonaill, go mór mhór do mo Ghaeltacht fhéin sa bhaile.  D'iarrfainn orthu gan dearmad a dhéanamh ar na h-oileáin Ghaeltachta agus chím go bhfuil tagairt déanta dóbhtha san ráiteas seo.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Rialtas chun a thuilleadh airgid a chaitheamh ar na Gaeltachtaí ar fud na tíre chun go ndéanfaimid uilig an seod is deise inár n-oidhreacht a chaomhnú, sé sin, labhairt na Gaelige a leathnú sa dóigh go mbeidh cainteoirí dúchais i ngach áit ar fud na tíre, go mór mhór i n-iarthar na hÉireann.</P>

      <P>Níl ach cúpla focal le rá agam ar an Meastachán seo.  Níl an méid airgid ann go ro-mhór chun an Ghaeltacht ar fad.  The economy of the Gaeltacht is what keeps the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Ní chuala mé blas ar bith uaibh riamh.  Fan anois.  Ní thuigfeadh aon duine sa Ghaeltacht cad tá á rá agat.</P>
      <P>As I have already said the economy of the Gaeltacht is what keeps the people in the Gaeltacht.  We have been exporting the Irish language for years and years.  The injections of capital are eaten up in overheads before the money ever gets to the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coisfhairge in Galway is a congested area which goes back to the days of the Famine when people went to the sea to get what they could from the sea once the land failed.  There is not as much fishing done as there should be and tourism is the greatest money earner <Col N="2344" /> in that area.  The Department of the Gaeltacht should give a greater injection of capital to the people in this area to enable them to build up the tourist trade.  I realise that other Departments are responsible for providing such moneys but unless the people in the Gaeltacht are able to build up the economy the sort of sops which are given to the Gaeltacht are lost and consequently the people are lost as well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley and others have mentioned that in order to build up a tourist industry amenities like electricity, water and proper roads are necessary. Have the Department of the Gaeltacht made any efforts to encourage the supply of electricity to people in the Gaeltacht?  Unless such amenities are available the tourist industry will never prosper.</P>
    <P>Many people who have built houses along the west coast are still dependent on an oil lamp or calor gas.  That is not good enough for people returning from England, who have sweated for John Bull in order to earn enough money to come home.  Some of them have modern homes but there are others who have no electricity supply and it would be impossible in such circumstances to engage in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Fishing could play a very important part in the economy of the West if it were developed but unless there are piers to cater for the fishermen they cannot be expected to engage in fishing. I understand that a report dealing with the provision of piers and slips in the Gaeltacht areas was compiled but when I tried to obtain this report I was told that it was only for the Minister's perusal.  In other words, the Minister in Dublin is regarded as being more interested in the West than those who have local knowledge of where piers and slips are required.  There should be more imagination in regard to fishing and the processing of seaweed off the west coast.  It is local cumainn that are listened to and it is they who get first preference in these matters.  It is interesting to note that there is a mention of Rosaveal.  Rosaveal was mentioned too before the last general election so perhaps there is another general election in the <Col N="2345" /> offing.  On the night before the last general election it was announced that a sum of £300,000 was being made available for Rosaveal.  The people were given to understand that all they had to do to secure a pier was to vote No. 1 for a Fianna Fáil candidate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that only the Minister should have to consider this report while people who were born and reared in these areas and who come here to express the views of the local people are not brought into the picture at all.  Is the matter one for the Minister and the local cumainn?  This will take a lot of explaining to the people who have to provide the money.  The importance of piers in the context of fishing and its relationship to the economy of the Gaeltacht areas has been stressed by other speakers.  There is no point in trying to encourage people to engage in fishing if there is no proper berthage for their boats.  Rough seas can eliminate an entire fleet overnight if there is not proper berthage.  I saw <Col N="2346" /> that happen not so many years ago.</P>
      <P>Another matter I wish to raise is the possibility of providing turf-cutting machines in Gaeltacht areas.  Many young men leave those areas during the summer season and more so now that they do not receive the dole.  Therefore, it is important that turf-cutting machines be provided for those who remain.  I suggest the Department provide those machines, especially in the Spiddal area.  It would mean a lot to people in Gaeltacht areas to have some turf to sell.</P>
      <P>Gaeltacht housing was also mentioned. Down through the years people have been refused grants for housing as a result of the cigire questioning of a child who, perhaps, might be only four years of age.  A child from a Gaeltacht area is quite different from a child that one would meet in Dublin.  In the first place a child from a Gaeltacht area is shy so that he would not be likely to answer questions put to him by a stranger particularly if that man was speaking in a dialect different from the child's.  It has happened from time to time that people have been deprived of grants because the cigire will say that a child had not a grasp of the language.  There is room for improvement in respect of such grants so as to ensure that the people get a fair crack of the whip. Another factor in this context is that housing costs have increased enormously but so far as I know grants have not increased <i>pro rata.</i></P>
      <P>Regarding Radio na Gaeltachta, I said here some time ago that it would be interesting to see who would be appointed to these boards.  Before developing this matter I wish to pay tribute to one of the appointees, Padraig O'Rahilly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the promotion of the Irish language may I ask if it is new policy that Irish classes are being discontinued in the vocational schools?  Another interesting aspect is the reorganisation of the local government system as it affects Gaeltacht areas.  We are now to have representatives of the Gaeltacht.  Is this a sort of Dáil Connachta or Dáil Uladh?  Unless these people have money behind them I fail to see what they will be able to achieve because their powers are to be very vague.</P>
      <P>I hope that natural gas will be discovered off our west coast.  That will do more for the Gaeltacht than all the gas we have had up here over the years.  One whiff of that gas might mean the building up of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting to see ships coming in from the Atlantic to our port in Galway, week in, week out, to replenish their stocks, after tapping the sea bed.  This is a regular thing. Some of these ships have fancy names. <Col N="2348" /> Please God natural gas will be discovered and then the Government can keep their grants.  The Gaeltacht will be built up on its own.  The Gaeltacht should be able to stand on its own feet.  Perhaps the approach taken to it is the reason why so many grants have to be given.  The Government have taken away the dole from some people. That made the difference between many a young man staying to look after his aged mother or father and going away.  I know the dole is not the responsibility of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, but men are on the dole for whom work should have been provided. The Department of the Gaeltacht should look into that question so that the Gaeltacht can stand alone without any sops.</P>

      <P>Is gnáth le muintir Fhianna Fáil á rá gurb í ceist na Gaeilge ceann den dá cheist is tábhachtaí sa tír seo.  Sí ceist an Tuaiscirt an cheist eile.  Tá sé sin ráite agus ath-ráite acu agus chualamar go minic é agus go ró-mhinic b'fhéidir. Is annamh a bhíonn uain againn anseo ceist na Gaeilge a phlé.  Ach tugann an Meastachán seo deis dúinn rud éigin a rá.  Chad a chímid?  Níl Aire ar bith anseo ón Rialtas a chuireann oiread spéise sa cheist mhór seo.</P>
      <P>With no apologies to Deputy Tunney I will say that in English too.  The Fianna Fáil Party have told us ever since their foundation that the two most important questions in this country are the question of the Irish language and the question of the North.  We very rarely have an occasion here for a serious discussion on the question of the Irish language.  One of these rare occasions is the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht.  If they were serious, if they meant what they say, you would expect, on such an occasion when one of the two most important questions before the country was being discussed, to see Ministers here, members of this Government for whom this is one of the two most important questions. There is no Minister here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told&mdash;and of course I accept it&mdash;that the Minister responsible, Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance and for the Gaeltacht, cannot <Col N="2349" /> be here because he has these two sets of responsibilities and because he has to be in the Seanad.  I am sure he would be here if he could.  I will just make a further comment on this, that it is the Government who have the ordering of the day's business in, as I understand it, both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would not have been beyond the ingenuity of man, and certainly not beyond the ingenuity of Deputy Colley, the dual Minister, who is a very intelligent man, to order the business of the House&mdash;and I am sure we would all agree with it&mdash;in such a way that he could be here so that we could at least have the Minister for the Gaeltacht here for the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht.  That is not a great deal to ask.  I think we are justified in suggesting that that should have been done.</P>
    <P>There are other Ministers who should be concerned and who are not here.  The proposals put before us in this statement include proposals which affect the Department of Local Government. We also suggest that the Minister for Education should be here. Frankly, I do not think that it is quite good enough that he is not here when the question that has concerned people who are interested in the Gaeltacht, perhaps more than any other question in the past year and more, has been the question of education, of which the symbol is Dún Chaoin school, or an important symbol.  I do not think it is enough in reply to that for the Parliamentary Secretary to say: &ldquo;That is not for us.  That is for Education.&rdquo;  I do not think that is treating the House or the public as adults and I do not think it is showing an integrated, coherent approach to the problems of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney is here.  We will be hearing from him later.  If I may say so, it is always a pleasure to hear him speak in the Irish language which he speaks beautifully.  Most of us, myself included, could take lessons from him.  As well as how beautifully he says it.  I will also be interested in what he will be saying so beautifully when he talks in particular about Dún Chaoin school.  He has views on that <Col N="2350" /> question and I am not sure that his views are all that remote from my own.  I hope he will give expression to them.</P>
    <P>The question of the Gaeltacht&mdash;and here the Government will agree with me in terms of verbalisation&mdash;is not just a question of material aid and material contributions.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned an increase in contributions to the Gaeltacht. That is welcome but it is only part of the whole story.  He said:</P>
    <P>Is ar phobal na Gaeltachta atáthar ag brath chun labhairt na Gaeilge mar ghnáththeanga a chothú ar fud na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>It depends on the people of the Gaeltacht to spread the speaking of Irish as an ordinary language throughout the Gaeltacht.  True, but if that effort is to be expected of the people of the Gaeltacht, surely they need something more than just doles and talking down to from on high, which is what they get and which is, I am afraid, what they get in this statement.  While it says some nice things, its tone rather resembles the tone of a fairly enlightened colonial governor towards some slightly backward people.  There is that overtone in it.  I am afraid this is the approach of the Government to this question.</P>
    <P>We put questions about Dún Chaoin school to the Minister for Education. I put to him in particular the question, &ldquo;How come this?&rdquo; The parents of Dún Chaoin have made it clear that they want to keep the school open and furthermore the school is actually being kept open with the support of the great majority of the parents and the children are going to it.  I asked the Minister: &ldquo;How can you prefer the words of two inspectors of yours who assure you of something or other, to what the great majority of the parents in this remote but very keen parish think?  They say one thing.  Your inspectors say another.  Without hesitation you take the inspectors' words.&rdquo; The Minister's answer was, with a little inflection: &ldquo;Oh, you know the Gaeltacht people.&rdquo;  He did not expand on that but I am afraid the implication was, these are people you cannot rely on: they are not like the very <Col N="2351" /> civilised civil servants who come down from Dublin and on whom you can depend, who are authorities on what the people of Dún Chaoin think even if the people of Dún Chaoin say they think something different.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, in a nutshell, is the colonial attitude.  There was an enlightened paternal attitude in the old colonialism but there were other very regrettable attitudes in it too.  I am sure the attitude of the Government is intended to be enlightened and paternal but it is not adequate; it is not suitable, because if the people of the Gaeltacht are to be encouraged, as distinct from receiving a remote lecture, if they are to get real encouragement to get the Gaeltacht moving, to have it a real, live community instead of a decaying rather stagnant area, then it needs something more than addresses from on high and something more than redrawings, we really do not know on what principle, of local government boundaries.  It needs, above all, the kind of approach that involves listening to the people of the Gaeltacht, not talking at them, but listening to them. I see no signs of that approach here.</P>
    <P>A Department of the Gaeltacht who was genuinely, seriously, profoundly concerned with the Gaeltacht would not have presented a document here at the end of the year such as we have had, which did not say a word about this question, a question which is not just represented by Scoil Dún Chaoin. That is not mentioned, on the arid, narrow, bureaucratic ground, &ldquo;That is for the Minister for Education&rdquo; and the Minister for Education is not even here.  This is the Minister for Education who does not care sufficiently about the Gaeltacht to be here when the Estimate is being debated and it is to this Minister, who cares to that extent about it, that the Minister for the Gaeltacht, who is not here either, is happy to hand over the whole problem. &ldquo;That is for Education&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Surely, this will not do?  Surely, there must be people in Fianna Fáil who see that this will not do, who see that if something is to be done in the Gaeltacht it is the people of the Gaeltacht who must do it and that in order to help them to do it&mdash;our help from <Col N="2352" /> outside can only be a secondary thing in any case&mdash;they must first listen to the people of the Gaeltacht?</P>
    <P>I am going to say a little bit about this question of Scoil Dún Chaoin.  I am a Dublin Deputy and I am delivering most of my speech in English because, quite frankly, I speak with more ease in that language than I speak in Irish.  I think there are many Deputies who feel the same way.  Unfortunately, they are not here.  They vote for English, you might say, with their feet. The Deputies who are here are, of course, fluent in the language.  But&mdash; and Deputy Begley said this too and I was very glad he said it&mdash;the question of the Gaeltacht ought to be of concern to all of us, even those of us who speak and use English with considerably greater facility than we use Irish. For all of us&mdash;and all of us have at least studied Irish in school, or almost all of us&mdash;the question that is symbolised by Dún Chaoin school is important because there are two aspects, frankly, of the Irish language. There is one which is capable of drawing affection, love, respect, and that aspect is represented by the living literature of Irish and the old literature and by the Gaeltacht, the life of the Gaeltacht, the people in the Gaeltacht, and their speech.  That is something which can still, from generation to generation of young people who are in contact with that, draw their affection, can become a meaningful, living thing in their lives.  It can enrich them as people.  I think we would all agree with that, at least in form.</P>
    <P>But there is another aspect that makes people shrug their shoulders and say &ldquo;Oh, Irish!&rdquo; and turn away from the language and do desperate things like joining the Language Freedom Movement, which is directly against this language.  I do not approve of the Language Freedom Movement, or belong to it, but I think that those who have been responsible for the Irish language and for the Gaeltacht over all these years, those who have failed to reach young people with the message that this is something attractive, extraordinary, unique and interesting, are responsible for the growth of the Language Freedom Movement.  It is their creation because <Col N="2353" /> people are repelled, frankly, by all the hypocrisy, the monumental, official hypocrisy that surrounds this whole subject, that, as they say in contemporary dialect, turns them off.</P>
    <P>Even though, or even because, the Gaeltacht themselves are very small units, in demographic terms tiny, for this reason itself they are extraordinarily precious.  They are precious to us all, even to those who have never to any great extent beaten, as it were, the drum of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Here we come to this point of numbers. The particular Gaeltacht that I am going to speak of here&mdash;it must be true of most of them&mdash;is the Gaeltacht of Corca Duibhne, of which one important centre is Dún Chaoin.  I am not from that part of the world but my wife's family have long connections with it and she and I spend a considerable time there.  This community has received an injury and an insult in the official decision to close this school.  It is a proud community. It has a lot to be proud of.  I do not want to be invidious in comparisons but it certainly has one of the most live literary traditions of any Gaeltacht.  Three people in that parish have written poems about the closing of that school.  These are not in any ordinary sense of the word intellectuals.  They live by the work of their hands.  Nor are they stirred up, as someone was foolish enough to suggest, by outside agitators on this point.  They write the poetry because they care.</P>
    <P>This is something from a living stream.  What have they got from the Government?  From the Department of the Gaeltacht, which should be concerned, they have got the brush-off. From the Department of Education they have been told: &ldquo;Go, jump in the lake.&rdquo;  That is the advice.  The Minister for Education applies a rule of thumb: the numbers have gone below a certain point.  The decision is to kill off the school without any consideration of the fact that this school is one of the dying, precious key points in what should be an integrated strategy for the Gaeltacht.  Of course, one cannot talk of an integrated strategy here when the Department of <Col N="2354" /> Education does not even bother to show up for the Estimate on the Gaeltacht.  There is nothing integrated about this.  It is all piecemeal.  Essentially there is nothing but doles.  I do not say that doles are unnecessary or undesirable. They are needed as a kind of crutch.  Doles are no substitute but doles are all that are offered.</P>
    <P>I should like to plead for the application of two principles.  First, I would ask the Minister and the Government to listen to the people themselves, not in some vast hall where a great many people come together and there are oráidí, but to listen to the people in their own little community, talking about their little communities, and not to treat them to vaguely conceived generalities but to treat each little community with the respect it deserves, the respect which is not symbolised by public tribute but rather by listening to them and doing what they ask so far as that can be done.</P>
    <P>I come back now&mdash;I make no apology for doing so&mdash;to the question of Dunquin school.  It may not seem important in Dublin that that school should be kept open.  The children can be taken by bus to Ballyferriter.  To the people living in the area, the people affected, that is not the answer. This little Irish community has survived almost miraculously in the face of the passivity and artificiality of the Government.  It is a precious area and the views of the people in the area should have been listened to and should have prevailed over a mere rule of thumb.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht should have been in there, expostulating with his colleague.  He should have told him he must not do what he proposed to do.  This rule of thumb may be useful in normal circumstances in other areas, but the condition of the Gaeltacht is far from normal and, if you are going to snuff out local schools because numbers fall below a certain level, irrespective of the wishes of the parents, then you are killing the Gaeltacht and destroying the tradition of the Gaeltacht.  I have nothing to say against the Irish tradition of Ballyferriter.  It is also rich traditionally, but it is different.  It is neither better nor worse; it is just <Col N="2355" /> different from Dunquin.  There are separate traditions.</P>
    <P>There would be a point at which numbers might fall so low that the situation would become absolutely impossible. But the parents in Dunquin are by no means silly or deluded people.  They have strong ideas about the interests of their children and they will not struggle to keep open a school in which their children cannot get a proper education.  Why would they? Their concern for their children is much deeper than ours or the Department's and, I would say, it is more intelligent and more flexible.  They know what can be done.  They ask for what they know can be done and they are overruled.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not find it necessary to refer to this matter in his opening statement.  His colleague, the Minister for Education, is not here.  That is an indictment of Government policy.  The Government say one thing and, because of their insensitivity, they do the other thing. The prime need is to listen to the people in the Gaeltacht and show receptivity to their reactions.  The demand in Dunquin is clear but, if the demand cannot be met, the people there should at least be told why.  This is the kind of respect that has not been shown and no doles are any substitute for the absence of respect.  There is an attempt to kill this little Gaeltacht to the accompaniment of statements which are unintentionally but actually contemptuous and patronising.</P>
    <P>There should be an integrated approach to the Gaeltacht.  It is the Minister for the Gaeltacht who should speak after consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Education, and he should present to us not a rather narrow type of financial statement, which is what we have here, which is essentially congratulatory of the Government because of the money provided out of the taxpayers' pockets for the area, but a statement of an integrated strategy for the revival and development of the Gaeltacht.  These are the two main points.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the Gaeltacht radio.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2356" /> Fáiltímid go léir roimh Radio na Gaeltachta agus roimh scéimeanna riaradh a gcúrsaí féin a thúirt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, más fíor gurab iad muintir na Gaeltachta féin a bheidh go h-éifeachtach i gcumhacht ins na h-eagrasaí nua so.  Sin í an cheist a lua mé cheana faoi mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin, gur radio don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghalltacht a bheidh ann agus nach cláracha is dóigh le muintir Átha Cliath a bhéadh oiriúnach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go mór mhór nach cláracha chun turasóirí a mhealladh nó Gaeilge a mhúineadh don Ghalltacht a bheidh ann ach an treoir a dtuigtear do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a bheadh taithneamhach agus oiriúnach dóibh féin.  Chun sin a bheith éifeachtach beidh sé riachtanach dul i gcomhairle, mar adúirt mé cheana, le muintir na Gaeltachta i ngach Gaeltacht.  Tá claonadh ann a bheith sásta gach rud a thúirt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach an rud a lorgaíonn siad féin.  Ceantar beag gach Gaeltacht agus má tugtar saoirse áitiúil dáiríre dóibh, is ar cheisteanna beaga áitiúla a bheidh a n-aire.  Is toisc nach bhfuil iontaoibh acu as Áth Cliath chun na ceisteanna beaga sin a riaradh go cneasta atá féin&mdash;riar uathu&mdash;Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta.  Is chun gur futhu féin a bheadh an bhreith scoil Bhéal an Dorais a dhúnadh nó a chaomhnú atá féin-riar uathu toisc go bhfuil sé de dhánaíocht iontu a cheapadh gurab iad féin is fearr a thuigeann tábhacht na scoile sin ina saol féin. Is dóigh leo gur mór an grá agus an dílseacht don teanga a labhair siad le sinsearacht ná an grá agus an dílseacht atá ag státseirbhísígh nó fiú amháin ag Teachtaí mar mé féin iontu féin agus ina bpáistí agus aonadaí staitisticiúla. Tá tábhacht an-mhór le staitistic sa cheist seo go léir.</P>
    <P>Má tugtar radio dóibh caithfidh a stiúradh bheith futhu ina iomlán agus cuirim an cheist seo ar an Rúnaí Parlaiminte: an amhlaidh a bheidh sé?  An mbeidh Radio na Gaeltachta faoi chumhacht mhuintir na Gaeltachta? Muna fíor é sin, an Radio na Gaeltachta a bheidh ann ar chor ar bith nó radio eile de chuid Átha Cliath?  Má tugtar féin&mdash;riaradh dóibh caithfidh cumhacht dáiríre gabháil leis <Col N="2357" /> a fhéachfaidh chuige nach dtarlóidh leithéid scoil Dhún Chaoin arís, cumhacht a thabharfaidh scoil thar n-ais do mhuintir Dhún Chaoin.  Caithfidh na tabhartaisí seo a bheith ionnrac.  Ní h-aon mhaith dallamullog a chur ar dhaoine.  Má tá an Rúnaí Parlaiminte dáiríre, caithfidh sé bheith sásta toil na Gaeltachta a chur abhaile ar na Ranna eile Stáit.  Sin í an cheist go h-iomlán.</P>
    <P>That is the question: can the Minister for the Gaeltacht impose the will of the Gaeltacht in relation to the Gaeltacht on the rest of the Government, or is he really a sort of vestigial appendix of an old affection for the Irish language which is slowly disappearing? If the answer to that is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that the Government's interest in the Gaeltacht is serious, that they intend to take a genuinely dynamic new approach, then I hope that when we next come to discuss the question of the Gaeltacht in this House, there will be at least one member present of that Government which regards the Irish language as one of the two most important questions for our nation.</P>

      <P>Mura bhfuil sé agaibh anois, is eagal liom nach mbeidh sé agaibh go deo.  Beidh sé agaibh mar atá sibh, ach maidir leis an nGaeltacht, is breá agus iontuigthe go mbeidh a chuid tuairimí ag chuile duine maidir leis an nGaeltacht agus le ceist na Gaeltachta.  Chuaigh mé féin chun na Gaeltachta agus tá fhios agam céard a mheall ansin mé.  Bhí tuismitheoirí agam, go ndéanaidh Dia trócaire ar dhuine amháin acu, a bhí fábhrach don Ghaeilge.  Bhí aithne agam ar dhaoine anseo sa chathair a raibh Gaeilge acu, ach níos tábhachtaí ná sin, daoine a tháinig ón Ghaeltacht, agus thuig mise mar Bhaile Átha Cliathach go raibh rud éigin ag na daoine seo a chuir feabhas orthu agus dá mbeadh a raibh acu san agamsa seans go gcuirfeadh sé feabhas orm fhéin, mar Éireannach.  Sin é an fáth gur chuaigh mé chun na Gaeltachta. Sa Ghaeltacht dom thuig mé go raibh deacrachtaí ag baint leis an áit; thuig mé go raibh feallsúnacht agus slí bheatha agus tuairimí ag daoine ansin <Col N="2359" /> agus nach ar leas na tíre seo é nach raibh na tuairimí sin le cloisint.  Níl mé ag rá gur aingil ar fad iad na daoine atá ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Tá rud amháin maidir leis na daoine a théanns chun na Gaeltachta anois. Bhí mé fhéin i mbliana san Spidéal; bhí mé i mBaile an Fhéirtéirigh agus sa Daingean agus maidir leis na daoine a théanns annsin ó áiteacha eile sa tír, do chonaic mé nach raibh mórán teagmháil acu le muintir na háite.  Ní raibh siad, de réir mar chonaic mise é, ach ag dul ar scoil san áit sin.  Dar ndóigh&mdash;agus is maith an rud é&mdash;bhí saghas Gaeilge ar siúl sna scoileanna sin ach b'fhearr liomsa ar fad dá mbeadh deis ag na daoine sin Gaeilge a fhoghlaim sna tithe ar fud na Gaeltachta. Tá a fhios agam go gcosnódh sé roint mhaith airgid ach tá roint mhaith airgid á caitheamh cheana féin ar an nGaeilge agus ar an oideachas i gcoitinne.  Baineann sé seo le muintir na Gaeltachta féin.  Caithfimid a theaspáint, mar adúirt an Teachta Cruise-O'Brien, go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta féin ar a laghad chomh maith, agus deirimse b'fhéidir níos fearr, ná daoine eile ach, de réir mar fheicimse é, níltear ach ag túirt dídean agus bia do na gasúirí faid atá siad ansin.  Níl an teagmháil eatorthu.  Ní thig leis na gasúirí agus leis na scoláirí an fhealsúnacht úd ar ar thrácht mé níos lua a bhlaiseadh, na tuairimí atá ag na daoine seo nach bhfuil i gcónaí ag sodar i ndiaidh rudaí eile agus na faisiún atá ar fud an domhain.  Ba mhaith an rud é dá bhféadfadh na gasúirí agus na scoláirí caint, cómhrá agus foghlaim óna daoine sin.</P>
      <P>Níl aon chruthú agam ar an gceist seo ach i rith na bliana chuala mé lucht na cathrach anseo ag gearán gur chualadar ráflaí&mdash;ar ndóigh bíonn an ráfla ann an t-am ar fad&mdash;maidir le roint de na chúrsaí seo a bhí ar siúl ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Nuair a bhí na buachaillí agus na cailíní óga ansin agus nuair ba cheart dóibh bheith ag scoraíocht, nó ag céilí, nó i n-áit éigin ina bheadh spórt den chineál sin ar siúl acu, gurab amhlaidh a bhíodar i n-áiteacha eile, áiteacha nach raibh Gaeilge ar siúl iontu, agus áiteacha nach mbeadh tuismitheoirí na cathrach sásta leo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2360" /> Chuala mé An Teachta Coogan ag rá &ldquo;The Gaeltacht should be able to stand on its own feet.  Something should be done about the Gaeltacht&rdquo;. Measaim nach bhfuil mórán maitheasa i ráiteas den saghas sin, go mór mhór ó Teachta a thagann ón Ghaeltacht, duine a bhfuil níos mó eolais aige, nó ba cheart go mbeadh, ná mar atá againne maidir le saol na Gaeltachta. Ó thosach cháin sé an Rialtas, Roinn na Gaeltachta agus, mar chonaic mise é, muintir na Gaeltachta.  Rud eile, agus is rud pearsanta é seo, a Cheann Comhairle, lean sé ar aghaidh ar feadh soicind nó dhó i nGaeilge; stop sé agus ansan, luaigh sé an blas.  Sin rud atá ag déanamh dochair don Ghaeilge.  Dúirt mise anseo cheana féin, agus deirim arís é, go mb'fhearr liom éisteacht leis na daoine anseo agus Gaeilge de shaghas éigin ar siúl acu i n-ionad éisteacht le duine amháin ar feadh soicind a bheadh blas aige.</P>
    <P>Ligeann an Teachta Coogan air go labhrann sé ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar an gceist seo ach ón dteagmháil a bhí agamsa le lucht na Gaeltachta bhí siad i gcónaí sásta cúnamh a thúirt do dhuine ar bith a raibh sé de thoil aige Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus ní raibh siad riamh tuatach maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Níorbh ionann iad agus an Teachta Coogan&mdash;duine a bhí ag sleamhnú agus ag tuitim ó chloc go chéile, cosúil le fear ar meisce, ag iarraidh rud éigin contrártha a fháil. Níl sé ag tabhairt cothrom na Féinne do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus &ldquo;na capers&rdquo; sin ar siúl aige.</P>
    <P>Níl mé féin sásta go bhfuil dóthain á dhéanamh ar son lucht na Gaeltachta ach ní h-ionann san is a rá nach bhfuil mé sásta go bhfuil rudaí áirithe á ndéanamh.  Caithfimid a admháil gur ceist an-thábhachtach í ceist an airgid maidir le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Chím go bhfuil tuilleadh airgid á chaitheamh i mbliana thar mar a caitheadh anuraidh.  Is comhartha maith é sin. Muna dtagann an &ldquo;gas&rdquo; úd a bhí i gceist ag an Teachta Coogan, caithfimid i gcónaí bheith ag túirt lámh chúnta do mhuintir na Gaeltachta i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta ar a laghad. Aontaím leis an Teachta Begley go mba mhaith an rud é níos mó airgid a chaitheamh ar an iascaireacht.  Ba <Col N="2361" /> mhaith liom dá bhféadfaimís níos mó airgid a chaitheamh ar an bhfeirmeoireacht. Tá caoirigh ansin.  Tá capaill ansin.  Measaim nach bhfuil dóthain á dhéanamh sna rudaí sin.</P>
    <P>Tháinig smaoineamh chugham i mbliana agus mé sa Spidéal.  I rith na bliana leis bhí mé san Iodáil, sa bhFrainc agus i Shasana agus chaith mé tamall insna tithe ósta ansin.  Ach chaith mé deireadh seachtaine amháin i dteach sa Spidéal agus fuair mé biadh agus cúram ansin ó bhean an tí agus ó fhear an tí nach bhfuair mé i n-áit ar bith eile sna tíortha a rabhas iontu.  Tá se sin le fáil ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Ba cheart níos mó airgid a chur ar fáil do na daoine atá sásta é sin a dhéanamh.  Bhí an Teachta O'Brien ag caint ansin faoi &ldquo;integration&rdquo;. Tá smaoineamh amháin agamsa maidir leis an gceist sin.  Tá deontais le fáil ag na daoine maidir le teach a thógáil ón Chomhairle Chontae, ón Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil.  Tá deontais eile le fáil acu ó Bhord Fáilte maidir le cuartaíocht.  Ba cheart tuiscint a bheith idir an Chomhairle Contae, An Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil agus Bord Fáilte ar an gceist seo agus b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí deontais níos fearr agus níos mó a thúirt do dhuine ar bith atá sásta teach a thógáil agus atá sásta seomraí a chur ar fáil do chuairteoirí.</P>
    <P>Ní fheadar an ceart ceist Dhún Chaoin a phlé anseo ar chor ar bith. Tá a fhios agam gur thug an Teachta O'Brien cuireadh dom bheith páirteach sa cheist seo.  Tá a fhios agam gur mhol sé mé sul ar thug sé an cuireadh sin dom.  Maidir le Dún Chaoin níl aon eolas pearsanta agam ar an gceist. Maidir le guth mhuintir na Gaeltachta tá sa Teach seo triúr a roghnaíodh sa toghachán deireanach.  Is daoine iad a labhrann ar son mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Níil a fhios agam an ndéanfaidh muintir na Gaeltachta an Teachta O'Brien nó duine éigin eile a théann chuchu ó Bhaile Átha a thoghadh sa chéad toghachán eile.  Maidir liomsa tá mé sásta mo threoir a ghlacadh óna Teachtaí a thagann ón cheantar sin agus chomh fada agus is eol domsa níl mé féin agus an Teachta O'Brien ar an dtuairim chéana maidir leis an gceist sin.  Dúirt sé go mba ceart &ldquo;integration&rdquo; a bheith i ngach áit <Col N="2362" /> maidir leis an Ghaeltacht, go mba cheart don Aire Airgeadais a bheith anseo ach ar an dtaobh eile mhol sé nár cheart muintir Dhún Chaoin a mheascadh le muintir Bhaile an Fheirtéirigh. Is é bhí á rá aige, dar liom go mba cheart dúinn muintir na Gaeltachta, go h-áirithe muintir Dhún Chaoin, a choinneáil ansin i gcúinne agus gan cead imeachta a thúirt dóibh riamh.  Ní thagaim leis sin.  Tá mé cinnte nach dtagann an Teachta O'Brien leis ach oiread.  B'fhéidir go ceapann sé go bhfuil sé faisiúnta.  Níl a fhios agam.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Radio na Gaeltachta tagaim leis an Teachta O'Brien san méid adúirt sé.  Tá súil agam gurb iad muintir na Gaeltachta a bhéas le cloisint ar na cláracha ach tuigim nach bhfuil sé i gcónaí éasca é sin a dhéanamh.  Déarfadh an Teachta O'Brien go mba cheart é sin a bheith amhlaidh maidir leis an nGaeltacht. Ar ndóigh, d'fhéadfaimis an rud céanna a rá maidir leis na Béarlóirí. Bíonn an Teachta O'Brien agus daoine eile ar an radio agus Béarla ar siúl acu.  Níor chuala mé gur dhiúltaigh sé riamh cuireadh ar bith dul ar an radio agus labhairt i mBéarla de bhrí gur cheap sé nár ghnáth-dhuine é, de bhrí gur cheap sé nach mbeadh sé ag labhairt ar son gnáth-dhaoine na tíre seo.  Tá súil agam freisin go mbeidh leathnú ar na cláracha seo agus go mbeidh siad le cloisint ar fud na tíre. Tá súil agam go mbeidh cláracha ceoil ann, díospóireachtaí agus cláracha nach iad ach, de réir mar a fheicimse é, is é an rud is tábhachtaí ná fealsúnacht, saothúlacht na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Déanfaidh mise iarracht anois an cheist seo a phlé tré mheán na Gaeilge cé go mb'fhearr, b'fhéidir, dá ndéanfainn i mBéarla é ach caithfidh muid cur chuige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá súil agam gurb é seo an t-am deireanach a thiocfaidh meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta os comhair an Tigh seo.  Molaimse anois faoi mar atá molta cheana féin ag Devlin go ndéanfaí athrú bunúsach ar fheidhmeanna agus ar imeachtaí na Roinne seo.  Sé atá molta aige sin agus ag an dtuarascáil atá curtha amach ná go gcuirfí deireadh leis an Roinn mar atá sé <Col N="2363" /> anois agus go gcuirfí ina áit Roinn chultúir náisúnta.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé seo in ord, a Cheann Comhairle, ach ba mhaith liom dá mbeitheá foighneach liom.  Ceapaimse go bhfuil an ceart ag Devlin anseo, go bhfuil sé thar a bheith in am anois go ndéanfaí iniúchadh ar cheist na Gaeilge, ceist na Gaeltachta, ceist an chultúir náisiúnta mar atá sé faoi láthair.  Aontaím le Devlin gur féidir leis an Roinn nua atá á moladh obair a dhéanamh nach fuirist do Roinn ar bith eile a dhéanamh, sé sin, cúram ar leith a dhéanamh d'imeachtaí an Rialtais, feidhmeanna náisiúnta i leith labhairt na Gaeilge, forbairt an chultúir Gaeilge agus forbairt na healaíona Gaeilge chomh maith.  Sé atá molta aige ná go mbainfí cúram na Roinne Airgeadais i dtaobh labhairt na Gaeilge sa Stáitseirbhís den Roinn sin agus go gcuirfí cúram foilseachán Gaeilge agus freagracht i leith Institiúid Theangeolaíocht na hÉirinn ar an Roinn nua atá molta aige.  A lán den gnó atá anois á dhéanamh i Roinn na Gaeltachta faoi na h-eagraíochtaí Stáit mar Ghaeltarra Éireann agus Institiúid Theangeolaíocht na hÉirinn d'fhéadhfaí iad a chur faoi chúram na Roinne nua. Is é prionsabal ginearálta Devlin go gcuirfí cúram shlánú na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge ar aonad feidhmiúcháin sa Roinn nua agus go mbeadh freagracht chomheagraithe ar rúnaí cúnta sa Roinn sin.  Sa chaoi seo chuirfí cúram an chultúir náisiúnta ar aon Aire amháin agus ar aon Roinn amháin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liomsa a rá anois go bhfuil sé thar a bheith i n-am go ndéanfaí cúram seo athbheochan na Gaeilge agus an chultúir náisiúnta a chur faoi bhráid Aire go mbeadh an cúram sin go lán-aimsearach aige.  Ní theastaíonn uaimse beag a dhéanamh den Rúnaí Parlaiminte.  Nílim ag túirt aon mhasladh dó ar chor ar bith.  Tá an méid seo á rá agam go fírinneach.  Ní theastaíonn uaim aon mhasladh a thúirt d'éinne anseo.  Ach tá sé i n-am, im thuairim, go mbeadh cúram ar an Aire na ceisteanna seo go léir a phlé as so amach.</P>
    <P>Níl sa Ghaeilge ach ceann amháin de na haidhmeanna náisiúnta atá <Col N="2364" /> againn.  Caithfimíd smaoineamh ar na gnéithe eile den chultúr, den oidhreacht, de chúrsaí ealaíona, agus den chaitheamh aimsire atá againn. Faoi láthair, tá na rudaí sin go léir scaipithe ar fud an Rialtais agus níl cúram ar dhuine ar bith chun iad go léir a chomheagrú.</P>
    <P>Tá sé molta ag Devlin go mbeadh gnáth-aonad sa Roinn seo faoi mar atá sna Ranna eile, idir airgead, pleanáil, ordú agus foireann.  Molann sé cúram na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a chur ar rúnaí cúnta amháin agus go mbeadh an dara rúnaí cúnta freagarthach as an oidhreacht náisiúnta, sé sin, na páirceanna náisiúnta a bhaint d'Oifig na nOibreacha Phoiblí, go dtabharfaí udarás ar leith do Choimisiún na Lámhscríbhinn, do Choimisiún Béaloideasa Éireann agus don rúnaí cúnta seo; go dtabharfaí cúram ar leith dó i dtaobh cúrsaí Acadamh Ríoga na hÉireann, Cumann Amharclann Náisiúnta na hÉireann atá anois faoi bhráid na Roinne Airgeadais.  Tá mé ar thaobh an mholadh seo, go ndéanfaimis tosnú arís ath-eagrú a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta, na h-ealaíona, an chultúir go ginearálta agus go gcuirfí an cúram sin go léir ar Aire Stáit nua nó Aire Stáit atá ann faoi láthair agus ar Roinn nua, Roinn an Chultúir Náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam gur gá polasaí de shaghas éigin a bheith ann chun a leithéid a chur i gcrích ach dá luaithe sea is fearr, mar faoi mar a chítear domsa anseo anocht, níl aon tsuim i gcúis na Gaeilge.  Ní h-aon mhaith dúinn bheith ag masladh a chéile.  Tá an cuspóir seo i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná cúrsaí polaitíochta de chuid Fhianna Fáil nó de chuid an Lucht Oibre nó de chuid Fhine Gael.  Caithfimid a theaspáint go bhfuilimid dáiríre i dtaobh na ceiste seo.  Sé an t-aon rud amháin atá idir lámhaibh againn ná conas is fearr ár gcultúr a chur ar aghaidh.  Sin a bhfuil le rá agamsa faoi cheist na Roinne féin. B'fhéidir go gcuirfidh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte na smaointe seo os comhair an Rialtais mar tá sé thar a bheith i n-am go ndéanfaí amhlaidh.  Mhol Devlin go gcuirfí cúram Radio <Col N="2365" /> Telefís Éireann ar an Roinn nua seo. Bheinnse féin i bhfábhar an mholadh sin mar go bhfuil an-tionchar ar fad ag na <i>media,</i> an radio, an telefís, agus mar sin.  Faoi láthair, tá siad faoin Roinn Poist agus Telegrafa agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil ceist teicniciúil ag baint leis, gur ceist teicniciúil ba chúis leis sin ar dtús.  Ach, anois, b'fhéidir gur féidir atheagrú a dhéanamh ar na cúrsaí sin go léir.</P>
    <P>Chun na fírinne a rá, níl mórán eolais agamsa i dtaobh na Gaeltachta mar atá sé ach amháin gur thug mé cuairt ar Ghaeltacht Tír Chonaill i mbliana.  Chuir sé an-áthas orm an Ghaeilge a chloisint chomh flúirseach ansin.  Dúirt duine amháin liom, faraoir, go bhfuil duine anseo agus ansiúd a chuireann iachall ar na páistí bochta Béarla a fhoghlaim i gcás gur gá dhóibh dul go Sasana nó áit éigin eile.</P>
    <P>Tá tagairt anseo d'fhostaíocht agus do jobanna, agus mar sin de, faoi chúram Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Sé dualgas Bhord Ghaeltarra Éireann cabhrú le caomhnú agus le leathnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra na Gaeltachta. N'fheadar an féidir oifig fostaíochta ar leith a chur ar bun i n-áit éigin i n-Éirinn, i mBaile Átha Cliath fiú amháin, agus in ionad na lads ón Ghaeltacht dul ar fán go Huddersfield nó níos fuide, go dtabharfaidís aghaidh ar an oifig seo agus b'fhéidir go dtabharfaí fostaíocht ar leith dóibh i nÉirinn; fiú amháin, dá bhféadfaí iad a choimeád i nÉirinn, do bheadh dul chun cinn á dhéanamh againn.</P>
    <P>Táimid anseo ag déanamh díospóireachta i dtaobh gniomhachtaí Roinn na Gaeltachta don bhliain seo. Tá mé sásta go leor go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh anseo ach dúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte go raibh deis ag na Teachtaí cúrsaí Gaeltarra Éireann a phlé i Mí na Márta seo caite.  Tá an ceart aige.  Dheineamar iad a phlé nuair a bhíomar ag caint faoi chúrsaí tionscail Gaeltachta nuair a tugadh an Bille nua isteach.  Anois, ba mhaith liom go dtabharfadh sé freagra dom ar chúpla rudaí anseo.  Tháinig árdú ar thuas-teorainn an £2,000 leis na deontais chun mion tionscadail shomhaoineacha a chur ar aghaidh; ardaíodh é sin go dtí £10,000 sa bhliain 1968.  Tá an thuas-teorainn sin curtha ar ceal <Col N="2366" /> sa Bhille sin, ionas gur féidir leis an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail níos mó ná £10,000 a thúirt i gcásanna éagsúla. An féidir leis an Rúnaí Parlaiminte a chur i n-iúl dom ar tugadh aon deontas sna cásanna sin agus, má tugadh, cé mhéid fostaíochta atá ann dá bharr san?</P>
    <P>Bhí rud tábhachtach eile sa Bhille sin.  D'fhéadfadh údarás áitiúil dhádtrian de na rátaí a mhaitheamh go ceann deich mbliana ar áiteabh tionscal ó Ghaeltarra.  Anois, tá sé sin ceart go leor ach, i gcuid eile den ráiteas a chuir an Rúnaí Parlaiminte amach, tá sé ag caint faoi fheidhmeanna ar leith a thabhairt; tuilleadh freagrachta a ghlacadh ag muintir na Gaeltachta i riaradh na h-áite sin. Agus, an tríú rud atá ráite aige anseo ná cumhachtaí agus feidhmeanna de chuid na gcomhairlí contae a thúirt do na hionadaithe sin.  B'fhéidir gur mhaith an rud é sin a dhéanamh. B'fhéidir nár mhaith.  Ach, nuair a thiocfaidh sé os comhair an Tí seo, ba mhaith liom a fháil amach cé íocfas as na h-imeachtaí seo go léir. Chomh fada agus is eol domsa, níl mórán rátaí á dhíol ag muintir na Gaeltachta san am seo.  Conas is féidir díol as na seirbhísí go léir a bhéas faoi réir na gcomhairlí contae seo?  Nuair a thabharfar an reachtaíocht seo isteach, an mbeidh contae eile againn? Tóg, mar shompla, Dún na nGall.  Má táthar chun cumhachtaí agus feidhmeanna eile a thúirt, an bhfuiltear chun na cumhachtaí agus na feidhmeanna sin a bhaint de chomhairle Chontae Dhún na nGall mar atá siad faoi láthair?  Cuirim an ceist céanna i dtaobh Contae na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Tá baint faoi leith ag na socraithe nua seo leis na comhairlí contae mar atá siad ann faoi láthair.  Tá tagairt déanta cheana ag an Teachta Begley do na ceisteanna seo agus níl mise chun dul isteach iontu.  Sé an rud is tábhachtaí, is dócha, fostaíocht lánaimseartha a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht. Ní fheadar cén mhéid fostaíochta atá curtha ar fáil ag eagrais oifigiúil mar Ghaeltarra Éireann, Fó-Roinn Foraíoseachta na Roinne Tailte, an Bord Soláthair Leictreachais agus Bord Iascaigh Mhara, agus a leithéid? N'fheadar an i gceart lár na Gaeltachta <Col N="2367" /> nó ar imeall na Gaeltachta atá pé méid fostaíochta atá curtha ar fáil as so.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire Dé Mairt seo caite go raibh áit éigin i nDún na nGall ina raibh borradh, fás agus forbairt ar an nGaeltacht agus is áthas liom é sin a chlos.  Tá sé in am dúinn anois tathaint ar an Rialtas agus ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta gan bheith ag caint faoi chaomhnú na Gaeltachta ach bheith ag túirt faoi bhorradh agus faoi fhás. Caithfidh an Ghaeltacht leathnú amach ar fud na tíre.  Tá deis nua ann anois nuair atá an radio nua seo á chur ar fáil chun a chur i n-iúl do mhuintir na hÉireann as so amach go bhfuil cultúr taithneamhach sa Ghaeltacht.  Fiú amháin más gá Béarla a labhairt ó am go h-am ar an radio seo, ná bíodh aon eagla orainn é sin a dhéanamh.  Ba mhaith liom go gcraolfaí ceol Ghaelach agus is é mo thuairim go mbeadh gach éinne ar fud na tíre, go h-áirithe ar fud na tuaithe, ag éisteacht leis.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart do Roinn na Gaeltachta agus do na h-eagraíochtaí go léir bolscaireacht de gach aon tsaghas a dhéanamh i leith Gaeilge as seo amach.  Ní h-iad muintir na Gaeltachta amháin atá sa Ghaeltacht.  Leathann an Ghaeltacht ar fud na tíre.  Aon duine go bhfuil cúis na Gaeilge ina chroí aige cuireann sé leis an Ghaeltacht agus tá mise ag fanacht anois go mí-fhoidhneach go dtí go gcuirfear tús le Radio na Gaeltachta mar ba mhaith liom éisteacht leis na cláracha a chraolfar.</P>
    <P>Le déanaí chuir mé ceist ar an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa cén canúint Ghaeilge a úsáidfí sna cláracha a chraolfaí.  Timpeall 20 nó 30 bliain ó shin, sí Gaeilge Chuige Mumhan a bhí i réim.  Le déanaí, braithim go bhfuil Gaeilge Chonnachta á leathnú. B'fhéidir go mbeadh áthas ar an Cheann Comhairle dá mbeadh Gaeilge Uladh á h-úsáid.  An féidir linn caighdeán a sholáthar a d'oirfeadh do gach éinne?  B'fhéidir nach féidir é seo a dhéanamh.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé in am dúinn canúint faoi leith a úsáid. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil.  B'fhéidir gur fearr na trí nó na ceithre canúintí&mdash;<Col N="2368" /> pé méid díobh atá ann&mdash;a bheith ann an t-am ar fad.</P>
    <P>Chuir Seán Ó Riada&mdash;go ndéanaidh Dia trócaire air&mdash;faoi sa Ghaeltacht. Tá cónaí ar Dheasmumhan Fennell sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba mhaith liom traoslú leo siúd go bhfuil sé de mhisneach agus d'fhonn acu chur futhu sa Ghaeltacht. Dá mbeadh am agus deis agus, b'fhéidir, níos mó airgid ag níos mó daoine chuirfidis futhu sa Ghaeltacht. Ná bíodh aon easpa misnigh orainn as seo amach.  Taimid&mdash;tá mise, pé scéal é&mdash;go láidir taobh thiar den Roinn seo.  Más ceadaithe dom pointe beag polaitíochta a lua&mdash;dob iad Fine Gael &mdash;an Rialtas Eadar-Pháirtí a bhí ann ag an am&mdash;a chuir tús le Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Is iad a chuir an tAire ann i dtosach i 1956.  Ó shin i leith ní dóigh liom go raibh cúram na Roinne seo ar Aire ar bith.  Tá sé in am anois cúram lán-aimsire a thúirt d'Aire de chuid an Rialtais, duine go mbeadh ar a chumas tathaint ar Ranna Stáit eile, ar udaráis cosúil leis an Roinn Oideachais, ar Dháil Éireann, ar Sheanad Éireann, túirt faoi labhairt na Gaeilge níos flúirse agus níos fairsinge.  Ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh an córas aistriúcháin i bhfeidhm sa Dáil níos luaithe ná mar atá beartaithe.  Tá sé i n-am dúinn túirt faoi cheist na Gaeilge agus ceist na Gaeltachta níos dúchrachtaí ná mar a rinneadh go nuige seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na státseirbhísigh agus le gach éinne atá ag gabháil don cheist seo agus tathaint orthu, más féidir é, níos mó a dhéanamh ar son an chultúir.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé in n-am deireadh a chur leis an Roinn mar atá sé agus túirt faoi Roinn an Chultúir Náisiúnta a chur ina h-áit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Níor éirigh leis an Rialtas cuidiú leis an Ghaeltacht nó an teanga nó muintir na Gaeltachta ó thosaigh mé féin ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Is fíor go bhfuil na tithe i bhfad níos fearr anois i gConamara&mdash; an t-aon Ghaeltacht amháin a bhfuil eolas agam air.  Is cinnte freisin go bhfuil caighdeán maireachtála mhuintir na Gaeltachta faoi láthair níos fearr ná mar a bhí sé.  Tá na buachaillí sa Ghaeltacht níos fearr.  Tá éadach á chaitheamh ag na páistí agus ag na <Col N="2369" /> daoine atá i bhfad níos fearr ná mar a bhí sé.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil níos mó airgid ag muintir na Gaeltachta faoi láthair ná mar a bhí.  Is trua go bhfuil an teanga i nGaeltacht Chonamara ar aon nós i bhfad níos laige ná mar a bhí sí.  Níl na daoine anois ag labhairt na Gaelige ach amháin i n-áit anchúng i nGaeltacht Chonamara.  Nuair a chuaigh mé féin go dtí Conamara ar dtús, gan dabht, bhí an Ghaeilge á labhairt ón Spidéal amach, in Indreabhán, sa Cheathrú Ruadh, agus i gCarna.  Is cuimhin linn go léir an Teachta Josie Mongan.  Bhí Gaeilge líofa aige agus labhair sé í i gcónaí anseo agus is féidir an rud céanna á rá mar gheall ar Dhonnchadh Ó Briain.  Gaeltacht an-láidir ar fad a bhí ann an uair sin.  In Uachtar Ard bhí an Ghaeilge an-láidir ar fad.  Ba mhian le muintir na Gaeltachta Gaeilge a labhairt an uair sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach anois, tá an-athrú tagaithe ar an scéal.  Tá tithe móra anois ar an mbealach go dtí an Spidéal agus go dtí an Indreabhán.  Is leis na boic mhóra na tithe sin, daoine nach bhfuil sásta Gaeilge a labhairt ar chor ar bith.  Labhrann siad i mBéarla beagnach i gcónaí.  Tá na céadta ag éirí as an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus tá i bhfad níos mó daoine as Conamara anois ina gcónaí i London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Boston, New York, agus mar sin de.  Caithfidh na mílte daoine imeacht leo as an tír agus is ón Ghaeltacht a imíonn an chuid is mó acu.  Is ionadh liom sin mar bhí fios an scéil ag na rialtais ar fad agus ag an Taoiseach Éamon de Valera.  Bhí a fhios aige. Rinne sé a dhícheall gach cabhair a thúirt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus an teanga a thúirt thar n-ais ach níor éirigh leis.  Theip ar an Rialtas.  Anois níl ann ach Gaeltacht an-bheag ar fad. Thart timpeall na h-áite ina bhfuil cónaí orm féin, An Cloch Mhór, Indreabhán, Ros a' Bhíl, ní labhartar ach Gaeilge amháin.  Ceist an-deachair ar fad í ceist na teanga, i bhfad níos deacra ná mar a ceapadh nuair a thosnaíodh ar athbheochan na Gaeilge. Mar adeireann Oscar Wilde: &ldquo;They destroyed the thing they loved&rdquo;.  Is é an cuspóir a bhí ann go mbéadh Gaeilge á labhairt ag gach duine sa tír.  Tá an-bhrón orm go gcaitfidh mé é seo a rá, nach mbeimid i n-ann é sin <Col N="2370" /> a dhéanamh go deo.  Is cuma cad déarfaimid anseo i nGaeilge.  <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum.</i></P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag gach duine go bhfuil eolas aige ar an nGaeltacht nach bhfuil fágtha sa Ghaeltacht ach na sean daoine is na daoine óga.  Tá na daoine eile imithe.  Níl na cailíní sásta fanacht i gConamara.  Níl siad sásta pósadh i gConamara.  Mar sin de, tá na buachaillí óga ag éirí as agus tá siad ag imeacht leo i gcónaí.  Tá an Ghaeltacht ag dul i laghad go tapaidh.  Níl mé i n-ann a rá cén fáth a rinneamar an dearmad so ach dearmad mór a rinneamar gan dabht ar bith.</P>
    <P>Fiche bliain ó shin d'iarr mé ar an Rialtas Radio Gaeltachta a chur ar fáil.  Theastaigh Radio Gaeltachta uaim ionnas go mbeadh ar mo chumas éisteacht le cláracha de gach saghas ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Ach níos tábhachtaí fós, theastaigh Radio Gaeltachta uaim ionnas go mbeadh deis againn go léir sa taobh seo tire éisteacht le fuaimeanna cearta na Gaeilge agus feabhas a chur ar ár gcuid Gaeilge dá bharr. Is maith an rud é go bhfuil Radio na Gaeltachta á chur ar fáil, go bhfuiltear ag dul ar aghaidh leis.  B'fhearr liomsa go mbeadh muintear na Gaeltachta féin i bhfeighil an radio.  Tá furmhór na ndaoine atá ar chomhairle Radio na Gaeltachta as Baile Átha Cliath.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ar an gcomhairle seo chun bainisteoireacht agus chuile short a dhéanamh? Cuirim failte roimh Radio na Gaeltachta. San am gcéanna is é mo thuairim go bhfuil sé ró-dhéanach mar tá an telefís i go leor tithe anois sa Ghaeltacht agus ina lán óstán.  Tá an telefís i bhfad níos cumhachtaí ná an radio anois i gConamara agus tá an chuid is mó de na cláracha telefíse&mdash; díospóireachtaí, léachtanna drámaí scannáin agus mar sin de&mdash; beagnach go léir i mBéarla. Bhí mé féin san Leitir Mór roint mhí ó shin agus ní raibh Béarla ar bith ag na daoine ar labhair mé leo. Ní raibh siad i ndán na cláracha telefíse a thuiscint mar bhí na cláracha go léir i mBéarla.  Ach tar éis tamaill bhig beidh muintir na Gaeltachta i ndán na cláracha telefíse a thuiscint agus beidh Béarla thar bárr acu agus ansin labhróidh siad i mBéarla.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag na Teachtaí a bhfuil <Col N="2371" /> eolas acu ar na Gaeltachtaí go bhfuil an fhírinne á h-innsint agam.  Tríd na blianta, tá athrú mór ar an gCeathrú Ruadh, baile beag nach raibh focal Béarla ann deich mbliain nó cúig bhliain ó shin ann.  Ansin tháinig scata daoine nach raibh ach Béarla acu agus anois sa Cheathrú Ruadh tá i bhfad níos mó Béarla ná Gaeilge á labhairt ag muintir na h-áite sin, an áit is Gaelaí in Éirinn.</P>
    <P>Is é rud atá ag teastáil anois scéim telefís i nGaeilge do Chonamara.  Is maith an rud é go bhfuiltear chun Radio na Gaeltachta a bhunú ach tá an telefís i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná an radio agus tá sé níos cumhachtaí. Blianta ó shin dúirt mé nach raibh gléas ní b'fhearr chun an Béarla a scaipeadh ar fud Conamara ná an nuachtán&mdash;<i>Scéala Éireann,</i> the <i>Irish Press,</i> cuir i gcás.  Is iontach an rud é sin mar an uair úd dob é Éamon de Valera a bhí ina Thaoiseach agus dob é freisin a bhí ós cionn an <i>Irish Press.</i> Tá an chuid is mó de na daoine sa Ghaeltacht ar thaobh Fhianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh ach páipéar amháin le léamh acu&mdash;the <i>Irish Press, Scéala Éireann</i>&mdash;agus Béarla ar fad, beagnach, a bhí ar fáil sa pháipéar sin. Bhí ionadh orm arís nuair a chonaic mé fógraí i Leitir Mealláin: &ldquo;Is maith duit Guinness&rdquo;&mdash;i nGaeilge&mdash;ag tionscal mór Shasana; &ldquo;Caith toitíní Gold Flake&rdquo; ag tionscal mór eile Shasana; agus &ldquo;Buy the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;i mBéarla. Bhí ionadh orm mar san am gcéanna bhí na daoine sin á rá le muintir na Gaeltachta go mba cheart dóibh Gaeilge a labhairt gidh nach raibh siad ach ag cur nuachtáin amháin i mBéarla ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus ag múineadh Béarla i gcónaí do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Ba mhar a chéile é leis an radio i rith na blianta ach tá an radio i bhfad níos fearr ná an telefís maidir le Gaeilge.  Tá an radio agus, anois, an telefís an-chumhachtach ar fad.  Tá siad ag déanamh go leor díobhála do chúis na Gaeilge muna ndéanfar rud éigin eile a chur in áit na telefíse sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> Tá an caighdeán maireachtála i bhfad níos fearr sa Ghaeltacht anois ná mar a bhí sé nuair a thosnaigh mé ag dul chuig an Ghaeltacht.  San am gcéanna, tá saol na ndaoine ann róchrua fós.  Sí an Ghaeltacht an áit dheireanach atá fágtha againn ina bhfuil an Ghaelige.  Caithfimid, mar sin, cuidiú níos mó le muintir na Gaeltachta fanacht sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní h-aon mhaitheas a rá, mar adúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte: &ldquo;Is mian liom go mbeidh fonn ar na cainteoirí dúchais sin fanacht sa Ghaeltacht agus leanúint orthu ag labhairt na Gaeilge.&rdquo;  Níl deis oibre ag na daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  De ghnáth, bíonn muirear mór ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá airgead ag teastáil uathu.  Tá na costais ag méadú gach uile lá.  Níl siad chun fanacht sa Ghaeltacht chun Gaeilge a labhairt.  Ní mór slí mhaireachtála a bheith acu agus níl slí mhaireachtála ag an gcuid is mó acu, ach an &ldquo;dole&rdquo;.  Tá a fhios ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte go bhfuil an talamh bocht.  Tá sé an-chrua ar fad slí mhaireachtála a bhaint as an mbochtanas i gConamara.  Níl na fir óga nó na cailíní sásta fanacht níos fuide mar gheall ar an saol crua atá rompu má fhanann siad ansin.  Is mór an trua é sin.</P>
    <P>Is áit dheas i Conamara sa samhradh. Bíonn an aimsir te agus bíonn radharcanna le feiscint chuile áit.  Ach tá an-difríocht idir an samhradh agus an geimhreadh i nGaeltacht Chonamara agus tá conaí ar mhuintir Chonamara ann gheimhreach agus samhradh.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud é go bhfuiltear chun cé nua a dhéanamh i Ros a' Bhíl.  Beidh na báid iascaigh i n-ann teacht isteach. B'fhéidir go mbeidh níos mó airgid le fáil ag muintir Chonamara.  Sé mo bharúil féin go dtéann an chuid is mó den airgead seo go dtí na daoine móra i nGaillimh, sa bhFrainc, sa Bhreatain agus in áiteacha eile agus nach bhfaghann muintear Chonamara é as na gliomaigh agus éisc eile.  Ní mór don Rúnaí Parlaiminte cuidiú leo ar gach bealach maidir le cúrsaí iascaireachta, agus níl ach bealach amháin againn chun teacht i gcabhair ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge i gConamara. Caithfimid chuile rud a dhéanamh chun iad a chaomhnú.  Rinne an Rialtas obair mhaith maidir le foraoiseacht. Tugann sin obair mhaith do mhuintir <Col N="2373" /> na Gaeltachta Tá neart caorach le feiceáil ar shléibthe Chonamara.  Tá i bhfad níos mó tionscal ag teastáil agus ní foláir muintir Chonamara féin a chur i bhfeighil na dtionscal sin.  Tá sin an-thábhachtach.</P>
    <P>Tá na scoileanna i bhfad níos fearr anois.  Tá deis ag buachaillí agus cailiní Chonamara anois freastal ar an gceardscoil. Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar na cúrsaí seo i gConamara.  Ach, faraoir, tar éis dóibh freastal ar an gceardscoil, ní bhíonn deis acu obair oiriúnach d'fháil i gConamara.  Gan dabht, rinne an Rialtas dea-obair maidir leis na cúrsaí sin i gConamara ach san am gcéanna tá muintir na Gaeltachta ag bailiú leo as an nGaeltacht agus nuair imíonn siad imíonn an Ghaeilge leo.</P>
    <P>Is mór an trua é go bhfuil na sean-cheardanna ar nós na fíodóireachta agus na tuíodóireachta ag dul i ndísc. Tá na ceardanna sin beagnach imithe anois.  Is náireach an rud é go mbíonn ar dhaoine a bhfuil céard iontach bhréagh acu obair ar na bóithre.  Is trua nach rabhamar i n-ann an fhorbairt nua agus na sean-cheardanna a chur ar aghaidh i dteannta a chéile.  Níl mórán difríochta idir Conamara anois agus áit ar bith eile i nÉirinn.  Níor mhaith liom ná beadh le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta na rudaí atá le fáil ag chuile dhuine eile sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gcóras iompair a chuireann CIE ar fáil tá sé an-chostasach. Tá sé an-chostasach dul ón Spidéal go dtí Gaillimh nó taisteal ón Indreabhán go Gaillimh nó go dtí áit ar bith i gConamara.  Sin é an fáth gur maith le muintir na Gaeltachta dul go dtí na cathracha móra agus imeacht leo ón Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart na táillí a bheith níos ísle sa Gaeltacht ná in aon áit eile sa tír.  Deineann an ESB rud den saghas sin.  Tá sé an-costasach ar fad dul ó áit go chéile i gConamara. Goilleann sin ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta go h-áirithe ó thaobh a gcuid páistí a chur go dtí an ceardscoil, an mhéanscoil nó an iolscoil i nGaillimh.  Caith fidh na páistí sin dul go Gaillimh agus cur futhu ansin, rud atá an-chostasach ar fad.</P>
    <P>Is mór an trua nár éirigh le scéim an Teachta Aiken, scéim na dtrátai.  Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil talamh Chonamara an-bhocht agus tá sé an-chruaidh <Col N="2374" /> slí bheatha a bhaint as.  Níl a fhios agam cén fáth nár éirigh leis an scéim sin agus ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Rúnaí Parlaiminte: an bhféadfaidh sé scéim ar bith eile den saghas sin a bhunú?  Ba dheacair na trátai úd a shárú.  Bhí muintir Chonamara go hiontach agus bhí na trátai ar fheabhas.  Níl a fhios agam cad a thárla ach chuaigh an scéim i léig nuair d'imigh an tAire.</P>
    <P>Tá muintir Chonamara in ann obair an-chruaidh a dhéanamh.  Tá siad sásta obair an-chruaidh a dhéanamh mar caithfidh siad í a dhéanamh mar tá an talamh chomh bocht agus an saol cruaidh i gConamara.  Má thugann an Rialtas an deis seo dóibh, beidh siad lán-tsásta chuile chuidiú a thúirt don Rialtas chun an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú, a labhairt agus a thúirt do mhuintir na Galltachta ar maith leo Gaeilge a labhairt agus a fhoghlaim.  Beidh siad lántsásta gach rud a dhéanamh ach caithfimid i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh fós go dtí go gcuirfear i bhfeidhm an cuspóir a bhí ag chuile Rialtas ó bunaíodh an Stát, an Ghaeilge a bheith ag gach duine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Rúnaí Parlaiminte Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom búíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí go léir a labhair ar an Meastachán seo, is cuma má labhair siad i nGaeilge nó i mBéarla nó sa dá theanga.</P>
      <P>Cháin an Teachta Begley mé faoi nach ndearna mé cuid dem óráid i mBéarla.  Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl dó gurb é an nós atá ann ón uáir a bunaíodh an Roinn ná labhairt i nGaeilge amháin.  Bunaíodh é mar is eol dó in aimsir an Chomh-Rialtais. Bhí beirt Aire óna Pháirtí féin sa Roinn agus thosaigh siad an nós.  Tá seanfhocal ann &ldquo;Ná déan nós agus ná bris nós&rdquo; agus níl fúm an nós sin a bhriseadh fad a bheidh mé anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labhair a lán Teachtaí ar a lán pointí suimiúla sa díospóireacht seo agus go deimhin labhair níos mó Teachtaí sa díospóireacht ar an Meastachán seo ná mar labhair ar an Meastachán céanna roimhe seo.  Is cosúlacht mhaith é sin agus léiríonn sé go bhfuil an-spéis agus suim ag na Teachtaí i Roinn na Gaeltachta agus <Col N="2375" /> i gcúrsaí na Roinne agus Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Chuir an Teachta Begley ceist orm: an bhfuil níos mó tithe á dtógáil anois nar má bhí agus is é an freagra air sin: &ldquo;Tá&rdquo;.  Bhí laghdú beag ann nuair a bhí an stailc stroighne ar siúl ach tá níos mó tithe á dtógáil anois ná mar a bhí.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Teachta ceist orm freisin an bhfuil aon scéim againn ar mhaithe le hiascairí óga agus chuir cúpla Teachta eile an cheist chéanna orm. Tá scéim dá leithéid sin ag an Aire Talmhaíochta agus Iascaigh faoina dtugtar deontais oiliúna do na hiascairí óga agus deontais freisin chun báid a cheannach.</P>
    <P>Chuir cúpla Teachta ceist orm mar gheall ar Ghaeltarra&mdash;luaigh an Teachta Burke é freisin&mdash;an bhfuil deireadh le cur leis?  Is é an freagra air sin go bhfuil Gaeltarra ann fós agus tá Roinn na Gaeltachta ann fós de réir an dlí a ritheadh sa Teach seo agus beidh siad ann go beo bríomhar go dtí go n-athróidh na Teachtaí sa Teach seo an dlí sin agus go gcuirfidh siad rud éigin eile ina áit.</P>
    <P>Luaigh mé sa ráiteas a rinne mé gur cheadaigh an tAire moladh ó Chomhairle na Gaeilge i mí Bealtaine seo caite go mbunódh Gaeltarra agus Cuideachta Forbartha Aerfort Neamh-Chustam na Sionna Teoranta meitheal oibre chun tuarascáil a ullmhú.  Níl an tuarascáil sin faighte fós ag an Aire. Nuair a bheidh sé aige déanfar staidéar air agus, má bhionn aon leasú ag an Rialtas le déanamh, tiochfaidh Bille os comhair na Dála agus tig leis an Teach é a phlé ansin.</P>
    <P>Labhair a lán Teachtaí ar na limistéir Ghaeltachta chomh maith leis an Teachta Begley.  Tá go leor daoine ann, ar nós an Teachta Begley, ar mhaith leo leathnú a fheiceáil sa Ghaeltacht. Is féidir an scéal sin go léir a phlé nuair a bheidh an Bille os comhair na Dála mar gheall ar an gcóras rialtais áitiúil don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Cruise-O'Brien agus an Teachta O'Leary faoi scoil Dhún Chaoin agus ag an am sin dúirt mé leo gur cheist é sin don Aire Oideachais agus nach ceist do Roinn na Gaeltachta é.  Mhol an Teachta <Col N="2376" /> Delap timirí a chur ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht chun cúrsaí teanga agus cultúir agus ceoil agus rudaí mar sin a chaomhnú agus a chothú.  Féachfaimid isteach sa cheist sin.  Tá stiúrthóirí againn sna ceantair Ghaeltachta cheana agus is dóigh liom go gcomhoibríonn said leis na coistí gairmoideachais agus le timirí na gcoistí sin agus b'fhéidir go mbeidis in ann an obair a mhol an Teachta Delap a dhéanamh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mar sin a thuig mise an scéal.  Labhair an Teachta Coogan ar an airgead a cheadaoímar do Ros an Mhíl agus ba mhaith liom an scéal a mhíniú dó.  Dúirt sé gur cheap sé go mbeidh toghchán ag teacht de bhrí gur cheadaíomar an deontas seo.  Seo é an míniú ba mhaith liom a thúirt air sin don Teachta.  Ar mhaithe le hiascairí Árann agus Chonamara, agus chun leas Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe a chur chun cinn, cheadaíomar deontas lán-chostais £360,000 le déanaí chun scéim mhór aontaithe de mhuiroibreacha a chur i gcrích i Ros an Mhíl.  Is iad seo na príomhoibreacha atá beartaithe:&mdash; (1)  déanfar piara nua, breis agus 400 troigh ar fad, a thógáil agus achar taobh thiar de a líonadh isteach&mdash;leithead de bhreis ar 120 troigh san iomlán; beidh spás fairsing ar an achar sin chun foirgnimh a thógáil agus éisc a láimhseáil: (2) Déanfar dreidireacht ar an ngrinneall ionas go mbeidh doimhne 14 throigh ag lag trá ar feadh leithid 250 troigh; tabharfaidh sé sin spás, uair ar bith ó thaobh taoide, do 18 gcinn de ghnáththrálaeirí agus iad ar ancaire trí cinn taobh le taobh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl an mioneolas i mo cheann agam.  D'iarr an Teachta Coogan an t-eolas agus tá mé á thúirt dó: (3)  Déanfar an piara nua agus an seanphiara a cheangal le chéile le cabhsa ar a mbeidh bóthar 18 dtroigh ar leithead agus cosán 5 throigh ar leithead taobh leis.  Tuigfear, ar ndóigh, <Col N="2377" /> go dtógfaidh sé tamall scéim chomh mór sin a thúirt i gcrích.  Nuair a bheidh na hoibreacha críochnaithe, is ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe a bheifear ag brath chun súil a choinneáil orthu agus aon ní is gá a dhéanamh chun iad a chothabháil.  Dá réir sin tá iarrtha ar an gcomhairle chontae a dheimhniú go mbeidh siad sásta glacadh leis an gcúram sin, agus tá Roinn na Gaeltachta ag súil le scéal uathu gan mhoill.  Idir an dá linn tá Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí ag dul ar aghaidh le gach uile rud a réiteach ionas go mbéifear ullamh chun tairiscintí a lorg ó chonraitheoirí a luaithe is féidir.  Ní miste a lua go raibh scéim a chosnódh £186,000 beartaithe do Ros an Mhíl cúpla bliain ó shin.  Ní raibh na hiascairí sásta leis an scéim sin áfach agus, ar ndóigh, ní bheadh sí chomh héifeachtach leis an scéim nua.  Tuigim go bhfuil na hiascairí ansásta leis na hoibreacha atá le déanamh anois.  Sin é an scéal mar gheall ar Ros an Mhíl.</P>
      <P>Chuir an Teachta Tunney ceist orm an bhfuil deontas le fáil do sheomraí le haghaidh cuairteoirí agus tig liom a rá leis go bhfuil&mdash;agus tá sonraí ina dtaobh san leabhrán seo, Leabhrán Eolais, leathanach 13 agus leathanach 33.  Cuirfidh mé an leabhrán chuige agus feicfidh sé na deontais atá le fáil. Chuir an Teachta R. Burke ceist orm ar íocadh aon deontas níos mó ná £10,000 ó ritheadh an tAcht leasaithe i mí Márta.  Tig liom a rá gur ceadaíodh roint deontas níos airde ná an £10,000 ó ritheadh an Bille a luadh tríd an Teach.  Níl aon mhioneolas agam ina dtaobh ag an bpointe seo ach ceadaíodh iad agus is dócha go mbeidh sé in ann an t-eolas go léir a fháil i gceann tamaill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl mórán eile le rá agam ach ba mhaith liom tagairt arís don Leabhrán Eolais seo.  Feicfidh na Teachtaí litir ann ón Taoiseach a chuir sé chuig na hAirí go léir.  D'iarr sé ar gach Aire féachaint chuige go dtabharfaí tosaíocht ar leith do gach rud a bhain leis an nGaeltacht.  Feicfidh na Teachtaí a labhair go bhfuil na hAirí á dhéanamh sin, mar shampla, i gcás na n-aersheirbhís chuig na hoileáin a luaigh mé san óráid, i gcás na scéime leictreachais agus an radio don Ghaeltacht, <Col N="2378" /> agus i gcás na n-óstán agus na réamh-mhonarchana.  Tá na hAirí eile ag teacht isteach agus ag túirt cúnaimh d'Aire na Gaeltachta chun na rudaí sin a dhéanamh agus na háisteanna sin a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí, mar adúirt mé, a labhair ar an Meastachán. Labhraíonn an t-airgead atá luaite agam freisin&mdash;£3 mhilliún&mdash;go láidir go bhfuil rud nach beag á dhéanamh don Ghaeltacht agus do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá súil agam go leanfaimid ar aghaidh agus, de réir an díchill atá á dhéanamh againn, go mbeidh lán-fhostaíocht ar fáil do Ghaeilgeoirí na Gaeltachta sna seachtóidí.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,988,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works; for expenditure in respect of public buildings; for the maintenance of certain parks and public works; for the <Col N="2379" /> execution and maintenance of drainage and other engineering works; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass) Noel T. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This 1971-72 Estimate of £10,988,000 is nearly £400,000 more than the original amount voted for 1970-71.</P>
      <P>Subheads A, B and C cover administrative expenses.  The combined increase of £124,000 reflects the 12th round increase in salaries, improved rates for travelling and subsistence and increased post office charges, as well as the transfer to this Vote of certain charges for office equipment formerly borne on the Stationery Office Vote.</P>
      <P>The provision under subhead D is, as Deputies will observe, very much less than the corresponding figure for last year.  The reason is that last year provision had to be made for two exceptionally large payments in respect of office buildings in Dublin, that is to say, the new office block in Kildare Place, and the purchase of a large part of Nos. 11/13 Upper O'Connell Street. This year the bulk of the provision is for routine purchases of sites for Garda stations and office buildings for Government staffs, both in Dublin and the provinces, and for the purchase of the fee simple of some existing leasehold properties.  The appeal against the court decision regarding the purchase proceedings relating to the national monuments at Tara has not yet come up for hearing in the Supreme Court, but it may do so during the current year.  A provisional amount for this item has accordingly been included.</P>
      <P>A list of the works for which provision is made under subhead E has been supplied to Deputies.  I will refer briefly to the more significant items.</P>
      <P>The extension and alteration works at Leinster House are now completed and the provision of £2,000 is for the payment of some small outstanding accounts.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Item 1 (a)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new provision to provide in this House for a simultaneous translating system from Irish into English. It was expected that the system could <Col N="2380" /> be installed during last summer recess but that was not found possible and it will have to be left over until next summer.  I hope that the installation of the system will bring about a great increase in the use of Irish in debates.</P>
    <P>Under the general heading of &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; a sum of £661,000 has been provided mainly for the provision of office accommodation for various Departments.  The three main items are: the provision of a building for a computer unit at Inchicore, the new building for the stamping branch of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin Castle and the fitting out of the new office block in Kildare Place.  The computer unit at Inchicore will be used by various Departments whose requirements would not warrant a computer of their own.  Tenders for the project are under examination and the unit should be in operation some time next year.  The stamping branch building is now proceeding well and is expected to be finished by mid-1973.  I have already explained the arrangement which was entered into with a development group for the erection of a new office building on the site of the former Church of Ireland Training College in Kildare Place so as to centralise all the headquarters staff of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Deputies will no doubt have noticed that work is well advanced.  The provision now made is to meet the cost of fitting out the building to meet the requirements of the Department.</P>
    <P>The five items Nos. 17-21 while small in themselves are of particular interest.  They are: the inscription on the back wall of the Garden of Remembrance and the erection there of the central sculptural feature; the State memorial to the late President Kennedy; the memorial to Roger Casement in Glasnevin Cemetery; the restoration of buildings at Scoil Éanna, Rathfarnham (Stage 1) and the restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham (Stage II).  I will say a few words about each of these items.</P>
    <P>First, the Garden of Remembrance. Oireachtas na Gaeilge arranged a competition for a suitable inscription for the back wall.  Three prizes were <Col N="2381" /> offered&mdash;£500, £300 and £150 and as Deputies will have read in the papers the awards have been made and arrangements are now being made for cutting the inscription.  The provision covered the prizes and the cost of erecting the sculptural feature which was dedicated on 11th July during the Truce commemoration ceremonies. I take this opportunity of congratulating Mr. Mac Uistín the winner of the inscription competition, and of paying tribute to Mr. Oisín Kelly for the very fine sculpture which he designed and which now graces the focal position in the garden.  The second item is the State memorial to the late President Kennedy.  Deputies will recall that on the 9th of this month the Minister for Finance in answer to a Parliamentary Question said that he hoped to consult the Government in the near future regarding this project.  The Roger Casement memorial, which takes the form of a heroic size effigy of Casement on a pedestal, has been cast and arrangements for erection and unveiling are at present being considered.</P>
    <P>At the ceremony on 28th April, 1970, for the handing over of Scoil Éanna to the State, the Taoiseach announced that part of the house would be restored to the condition it was in when the brothers Pearse lived in it, and that the rest would be used as a museum to display items connected with the Pearse family.  He said also that the grounds would be artistically laid out.  The implementation of that decision constitutes a major task which will take some time to plan and to carry out.  A small committee representative of the Office of Public Works, the Department of Education and of persons who were closely connected with Scoil Éanna and who are sympathetic to the project have been formed to assist in advising on the problems likely to arise.  The work is being tackled with enthusiasm and good progress has been made.  The first stage is the repair and renewal of the roofs of the buildings and the contract for that work has been placed and work is in progress.  At the same time work on the lay-out of the grounds which will take some years to complete is in hands and had progressed <Col N="2382" /> to such an extent that it was possible to open the greater part of the grounds to the public in September last.</P>
    <P>The last of the five items is the restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  The building has been allocated to the Department of Education to accommodate a folk museum and the natural history division of the national museum.  The first stage of restoration, which comprised the north wing, was completed in 1966.  It is now proposed to tackle a further stage. Planning will take some time and the small provision of £1,000 is for planning expenses.  There is no prospect of any works being done this year.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to place a contract shortly for the restoration of the picture gallery wing of Kilkenny Castle. The castle will be the focal point of a park area which it is proposed to establish in the Kilkenny region and when fully restored it will provide for a wide range of cultural activities in addition to information and interpretation services for the park area.  It is hoped that part of the restoration cost will come from voluntary subscriptions.</P>
    <P>Dunmore Cave, County Kilkenny, is in the Commissioners' care as a national monument by reason of its historical associations.  It is mentioned in old Irish literature and was plundered by Godfrey and the Vikings of Dublin in 928 when 1,000 people are said to have died.  While the cave has always been of considerable interest to speleologists, difficulty in gaining access to it has put it beyond the range of most visitors.  Over the years the question of presenting it as a show cave has been considered on different occasions &mdash;similar caves in Britain, America and elsewhere have proved very popular. Early in 1969 a scheme of works was put in hands designed to make the cave more accessible and more interesting to visitors.  The approach road has been improved, a car park has been provided, steps have been constructed down to the mouth of the cave and electric lighting is at present being installed. These works are being financed jointly by the Office of Public Works. Bord Fáilte, Kilkenny County Council and the South Eastern Regional <Col N="2383" /> Tourism Organisation, Limited.  The final stage of development will be the erection of a visitor reception building arrangements for which are in train.</P>
    <P>A sum of £25,000 is being provided this year to start a scheme of general improvements on the River Shannon navigation to meet the growing demand for cruising and other recreational facilities.  Amongst the works being financed from this provision are a new jetty at Lough Key, extension to the landing place at Battlebridge, the removal of shoals in the river at Cootehall and Jamestown.  Investment by private enterprise supported by Bord Fáilte continues to grow and it is important that more public amenities be provided to keep pace with this rapidly expanding feature of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; a total of £247,000 is provided.  Of this, £225,000 is required for the erection of new Garda stations, improvements at existing stations and the provision of improved accommodation for Garda personnel in Dublin Castle.  Three new stations in the Dublin area have been completed this year at Ballyfermot, Dundrum and Raheny and two more are being erected at Rathmines and Ballymun.  A scheme of major improvements at Kevin Street is nearing completion and it is hoped that work on the reconstruction of the station at Store Street will commence early in 1972.  Outside Dublin, three new stations were completed this year and three more are in course of erection, the largest being in Waterford.  New buildings and major improvement schemes are being planned for many other centres throughout the country. Here I would like to refer in particular to Limerick.  The principal station there, namely William Street, has for long been a source of serious concern to us because of its age and general condition.  The need for a new central station was accepted years ago but regrettably site difficulties have delayed the erection of such a building. I am now happy to report that at last these difficulties have been overcome. Agreement has been reached for the purchase of an excellent site <Col N="2384" /> lying between Henry Street and the quays.  The preparation of the necessary plans, <i>et cetera,</i> will be put in hands with the minimum of delay and the project generally will be expedited as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Last year the grant expenditure on the building of primary schools was £3,360,000 approximately.  Forty-six new buildings were erected and major improvements were carried out at 51 other schools.  Eighteen thousand four hundred pupil places were provided and a further 6,600 places were made available in prefabricated units.  The amount included for school building in this Estimate is £3,325,000.  As Deputies are aware, the Minister for Finance has announced that an additional sum of £500,000 will be made available.  This will be covered by a supplementary estimate later.  The greater part of the money will again be spent in providing schools for new housing areas in cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Special schools for mentally and physically handicapped children are also well catered for.  Six projects were completed last year and plans for a further 12 schools are being prepared. In this field, I might mention that at the request of the Department of Health a day-care centre for severely mentally handicapped children is being provided in conjunction with the new school for moderately mentally handicapped children at Cootehill, County Cavan.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that the requirements of the new curriculum would result in changes in the planning of schools and in the design of a new range of school furniture.  The new furniture will be available early in 1972.</P>
    <P>The policy of amalgamation of small rural schools into larger central units is continuing.  The total number of national schools in operation has been reduced to approximately 4,100 from the peak of about 4,800.</P>
    <P>As usual, there is a substantial provision of £218,000 for buildings, research, training and advisory services for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The main items this year are the regional veterinary and dairy produce <Col N="2385" /> laboratories at Kilkenny and Limerick, a new post-mortem unit and laboratories at Abbotstown and a performance testing station for beef bulls at Tully, County Kildare.</P>
    <P>A sum of £600,000 is being provided for fishery harbour works under items 50 and 51 of which £400,000 is for major fishery harbours.  Work at Dunmore East harbour has been completed apart from harbour buildings which will be started this year.  Good progress is being made at Castletownbere and Killybegs harbours.  Provision is also made for improvement schemes at a number of other harbours, including Kilmore Quay, County Wexford, Reen, County Cork; Killala, County Mayo; Burtonport, County Donegal; and Cleggan, Emlaghmore and Roundstone, County Galway.  Other harbour works being carried out by the Office of Public Works in Gaeltacht areas are paid for from the Vote for Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>A sum of £205,000 is required for works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Except for the computer and training centre buildings at Dundrum&mdash;items 57 (1) and 57 (2)&mdash;the works covered are mostly post offices and sorting offices.  In addition, the Office of Public Works will in the the current financial year carry out about £500,000 worth of works for the telephone service, which will be paid for out of the telephone capital account.  The F group of subheads provides for the cost of servicing State properties.  Subhead F 1 provides the funds for the maintenance of those buildings as well as of the State harbours, the national parks and the River Shannon navigation.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the national parks.  Phoenix Park was always a place where one could enjoy a few hours peace and quiet away from the noise and bustle of a busy city.  It was an ideal recreation centre for young children who could roam at will over the wide expanses in complete safety.  It was inevitable that, situated as it is on the doorstep of a continually expanding metropolis, the amenities of the park would come under increasing pressure.  Improved living standards have led to a spectacular <Col N="2386" /> increase in the volume of car traffic in Dublin over the past ten years and the Phoenix Park is now feeling the full effect of this growth and the concurrent increase in leisure time.</P>
    <P>At the weekends in particular the park is becoming choked with motor traffic and cars can be seen speeding along the roads or driving over the grass without regard for the comfort or safety of other park users.  Of late, I have been receiving many complaints from persons who have enjoyed the park for many years and who feel its whole character is changing for the worse. There is power, of course, to prosecute for breaches of the bye-laws, but to pursue such a course without tackling the problem as a whole would be a negative attitude.  We must ask ourselves, however, if we want our premier national recreation park to become one monstrous car park or racing track every weekend.  We must remember that in a park setting children are much less on the alert for motor traffic than in any other public place and the danger of accidents can be all the greater.</P>
    <P>Deputies are also aware that the growth in pony trekking and horse riding has brought its own problems, and as I have already told the House I am having the bye-laws suitably amended to provide for better control of this activity.  There will be no question of banning horse riding entirely but certain restrictions will have to be imposed to protect both the turf and other park users.  Notwithstanding its size the park cannot meet in full all the demands on its use.  The basic problem is to what extent and by what measures the conflict can be resolved. A plan is, therefore, required which will provide for balanced management and development and best use of the area and its features.</P>
    <P>As I announced recently a full amenity study of the Phoenix Park is being carried out by a group of fourth year students of the school of architecture, survey and building technology of the College of Technology, Bolton Street under the guidance of Mr. Kevin Fox, head of the school, and in collaboration with the national parks and monuments <Col N="2387" /> branch of the Office of Public Works. The study will cover many aspects of park management and user including the use of the park roads as traffic arteries within the city road system as well as access to park facilities; how vehicular traffic conflicts with pedestrian use, with livestock, with wild-life movement and the problem it creates in the matter of parking, intrusion on grass areas and road-lighting.  In the fields of sport and general recreation the students will examine the present and potential use of the park for team games, and such sports as polo, cycling and horse-riding and the need for facilities such as picnic sites, children's playgrounds, shelters and toilets.  They will also study landscape aspects of the park including garden areas, plantations and ornamental features and design relationships of structures to landscape and will assess the adequacy or otherwise of the stewarding arrangements.</P>
    <P>Any Deputies who have seen the excellent and very popular amenity study of Kilkenny carried out by the Bolton Street students under a similar arrangement will look forward eagerly to the results of their study of the Phoenix Park.  As I stated when I announced details of it, I hope that its study and its findings will engender public interest in the steps which may be necessary to preserve the wonderful amenity of the Phoenix Park and I am sure the public will co-operate with the students so far as their co-operation may be required.  I am now satisfied as to the feasibility of laying out an 18-hole public golf course in the Phoenix Park extension and I hope to make a further statement on this project shortly.</P>
    <P>Improved visitor facilities are being provided at other national parks.  The Bourn Vincent National Park at Killarney continues to attract more and more visitors from home and overseas.  From surveys we have carried out there during the past three years, it is clear that most visitors want the park to be preserved as it always has been.  It is our policy to protect the natural beauty of the park while providing visitors with more facilities to enjoy its amenities to the <Col N="2388" /> full.  This year a new access road, with car park, has been provided which enables visitors to get a new and exciting view of Killarney and, should they so desire, to reach the shores of Muckross Lake after a short walk. The nature trail which was opened in October, 1970, proved a great attraction and two more comprehensive trails were opened this year.  These trails commence on the shores of Muckross Lake and provide an opportunity for visitors to see the real beauty of Killarney and to acquire a greater appreciation of its unique botanical, zoological and geological features.</P>
    <P>It has been decided in consultation with the Botanic Gardens authorities to establish near Muckross House an arboretum of trees which would be difficult to grow in more exposed sites elsewhere in Ireland, but for which the Killarney climate is particularly suitable.</P>
    <P>The programme of scientific research which commenced last year has been expanded by the initiation of projects on the red deer population of the Killarney valley and the lakes.  The project known as the Vincent scholarship is a co-operative effort between the University of Wisconsin, USA, University College, Dublin, and the Office of Public Works.  Here, I would like to pay tribute to Mr. W. B. Vincent, son of the former owner of the estate, who was mainly responsible for sponsoring the scholarship.  I am hopeful that in years to come further financial aid will be provided by Irish-American groups for more research projects in both this and other national parks.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that discussions have been taking place between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Transport and Power regarding the future of the Grand Canal. A full engineering survey of the Grand Canal and Barrow navigation was carried out by the national parks and monuments branch and a copy of the report was sent to the Department of Transport and Power and the Department of Finance for consideration. While I cannot anticipate the Government's decision in the matter, it is <Col N="2389" /> generally appreciated now that in the canal system we have a recreational asset of great value.  The Barrow stretch of the navigation has been described as the most beautiful waterway in these islands, and is of special importance as a recreational resource in the context of the Kilkenny Park area.</P>
    <P>A recent visitor to our country who has visited many parts of the world on matters connected with national parks and conservation, when commenting on the unspoiled beauty of our island, its great intrinsic value and how we take it so much for granted, remarked that there are millions of people in over-populated, over-developed countries so starved of the beauty of nature that they would pay a high price not just to own but to sit and watch for a short time occasionally even a small meandering stream of pure, unpolluted water in one of our many lesser known valleys.  This should give all of us food for thought.  It is, I think, evident that we are beginning to appreciate more the responsibility we have to protect and to preserve for our people the great natural beauty of our land.  Deputies will have noticed in recent years the growing demand from people at all levels for the reservation of further areas as national parks, to ensure their availability for the enjoyment and recreation of all the people for all time.  I think this is a development to be welcomed, and I personally welcome the increasing interest which Deputies from all sides of the House have been showing in our national park service in recent years.</P>
    <P>The increase in the provision in respect of subhead F. 3 is due to the leasing of additional space to house the expanding staffs of various Departments. The main rent increases relate to the leasing of accommodation in Dublin for the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Health, Local Government and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The G group of subheads contains provision for expenditure in connection with the programme of arterial drainage undertaken under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The most important of the group are G1, G2, and G5.</P>
    <P>Subhead G1 provides for the expenses <Col N="2390" /> of field and hydrometric surveys which must precede the preparation of drainage schemes.  The amount requested, £30,000, compares with £35,000 provided last year.  Among the schemes at various stages of preparation or consideration are the Corrib-Mask-Robe, Erne, Boyle, Mulkear, Suir, Owenmore (Sligo) and Nore major catchments and the minor catchments of the Bonet, Dunkellin and Lavally.  The possibility of schemes for the Finn sub-catchment of the Erne in Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh, and the Bradoge in Counties Donegal, Leitrim and Fermanagh is being examined in co-operation with the Northern Authorities.  Small schemes for the Ards Flats in County Donegal and Moanakeeba, County Galway, are also under consideration.</P>
    <P>Subhead G2 provides for expenditure on works in progress.  The amount sought, £878,000, is less than the £1,176,000 provided last year and it does not enable a start to be made on the Maigue scheme.  Provision is included for the Boyne which is in full swing, the Corrib/Headford and for the completion of the Moy.</P>
    <P>The work of completing the Ringmoylan to Foynes embankments in the Shannon Estuary has also been provided for bringing to almost £1,500,000 the amount spent on embankment restoration in the Shannon Estuary since the storm of October, 1961, caused extensive breaching.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included for completion of work on the Carrigahorig Drainage Scheme, Counties Tipperary and Offaly, and for the continuation of work on another small scheme, the Groody near Limerick city.</P>
    <P>In connection with arterial drainage I would remind Deputies that the Office of Public Works have been operating to a brief prepared for them some 30 years ago.  For some time past doubts have been expressed about the return from capital allocated for arterial drainage and there have been complaints of damage caused by drainage schemes to fisheries, nature reserves and the natural environment.  Moreover, questions are being asked as to whether drainage schemes are intended <Col N="2391" /> primarily to relieve flooding of lands or primarily to alleviate the problems of people living in areas subject to flooding&mdash;including problems affecting their standard of living, their health and their quality of life.  If the latter is the primary objective, alternative ways of dealing with the problems caused by flooding may need to be considered.</P>
    <P>In the context of programme budgeting, which, as announced by the Minister for Finance is being introduced into the public service, projects will in future be subjected to close scientific scrutiny from the point of view of cost/ benefit ratio before qualifying for allocations from the capital budget.  When it is remembered that the Boyne catchment drainage scheme is estimated to cost upwards of £10 million gross at current prices and that regrettably the experience is that many landowners have neglected to take advantage of arterial drainage in other areas the necessity for a review of the relative value of arterial drainage as a means of improving the economy of holdings or of raising agricultural output will be appreciated.</P>
    <P>With a view to reaching a conclusion on such matters the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Office of Public Works have put in hands a full cost/benefit study of arterial drainage as administered at present and an outline of an analysis specifying the lines on which the investigation should proceed has been prepared and agreed.  Good progress has been made on the study but it is not expected that the result will be available for 12-18 months.</P>
    <P>I should like also to mention in this connection that one of the assets this country has in attracting new industry is its plentiful supply of fresh water and, as the problem of inadequate water resources grows elsewhere, this asset may become more important in the future.  The hydrometric unit of the engineers branch of the Office of Public Works, which hitherto had been concerned almost entirely with measurements relating to the incidence and duration of peak flood flows is becoming more and more involved in the <Col N="2392" /> collection and processing of data relating to low water flows to cater for a very big increase in inquiries concerned with the establishment of industries and the adequacy and continuity of water flow at all times for other purposes also.</P>
    <P>Subhead G5 provides for the maintenance of completed schemes.  The sum requested, £540,000, shows a considerable increase on last year due mainly to the ever-increasing number of schemes being brought to completion and coming under maintenance, and to wage increases.</P>
    <P>I am asking for £485,000 for subhead H for the purchase and maintenance of engineering plant and machinery, the purchase of stores and the payment of wages to the workshop staffs.  It is intended to continue with the replacement of the fleet of dragline excavators with more modern and more efficient hydraulic excavators which will reduce working costs.</P>
    <P>The provision under subhead I for coast protection works has been increased this year to £55,000.  The scheme for the Murrough, County Wicklow, is completed and works at Youghal, County Cork, and Moville, County Donegal are proceeding satisfactorily. It is hoped that some further schemes will mature and can be started this year.  Provision is also included under this subhead for maintenance of protection works at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Personally I should like to see an expanded programme of coast protection work.  I am aware that, in many areas around our coasts, there is urgent need for such work and, of course once the sea takes over, be it a roadway, a house or a field there can be no question of replacement.</P>
    <P>A sum of £13,600 has been provided under subhead J for minor marine schemes sponsored by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The K group of subheads deals with the national monuments service.</P>
    <P>Subhead K.1 provides for the maintenance and conservation of national monuments in State care, for the presentation and interpretation of the monuments to visitors and for archaeological <Col N="2393" /> exploration.  The Commissioners' statutory functions are not confined to the monuments in State care: they include all monuments generally and all archaeological exploration. Last year I adverted to the need for extending our statutory authorities in regard to national monuments to meet the needs occasioned by economic growth and social development and this is under active consideration in consultation with the National Monuments Advisory Council.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of monuments is now being carried out on a regional basis and a work force of some 70 men is employed directly.  Last year a new district centre was established at Trim and this year an additional one&mdash;making a total of five&mdash;has been established at Sligo to cater for monuments in the north-western region.</P>
    <P>In addition to the routine work of keeping monuments in a safe and presentable condition, major schemes of conservation were completed during the year at Urlaur Abbey, County Mayo, Aughnanure Castle, County Galway, Gallarus Oratory, County Kerry, and Drishane Castle, County Cork.  Work at Cahir Castle, County Tipperary, is virtually completed and a visitor service, which has proved very satisfactory at Newgrange Tumulus and the Rock of Cashel, was extended to Cahir Castle this year.</P>
    <P>Major conservation works were put in hands last year at Portumna Castle and Clontuskert Abbey in County Galway, and at St. Francis's Friary in Kilkenny city.  The major scheme in progress at Kells Priory, County Kilkenny, is continuing and work has begun on Kanturk Castle in County Cork.  Minor schemes are also in hands at Trim Castle, Mellifont Abbey and Ballinacarriga Castle, County Cork.</P>
    <P>The archaeological survey set up in 1965 to record scientifically all monuments up to 1200 A.D. has been virtually completed in Counties Louth, Monaghan and Meath.  It was extended last year into Counties Cavan, Westmeath and Longford, and is proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Public interest in archaeological excavation continues to grow and 15 excavations financed by the Commissioners <Col N="2394" /> covering a wide variety of monuments were carried out during 1970.  These yielded a fund of information on the mode of living in bygone days, and are helping to piece together the history of man's occupation of and the various migrations to this island over the last 7,000 or 8,000 years.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me from time to time regarding the inadequacy of the type of notice displayed at national monuments.  I am very conscious of the need for improvment in this regard and I am pleased to inform the House that the national parks and monuments branch, in collaboration with An Bord Fáilte, have selected some 300 major monuments at which new information plaques will be provided to replace the old type notices.  The scripts for a number of these have been prepared and a contract has been placed for the supply of the first batch of notices. Further batches will be provided according as time and financial resources permit.</P>
    <P>On these new notices and, indeed, on all new permanent signs to be provided hence forth by the national parks and monuments branch at national monuments, national parks and inland waterways in their charge, Deputies will notice a symbol consisting of three groups of contiguous concentric circles, and may be curious as to what this represents.  The symbol has been authorised for use specially by the national parks and monuments branch&mdash;the three groups representing the merging in one branch of the three services, national parks, national monuments and inland waterways.  The concentric circles are a reminder of the megalithic art as may be seen on the magnificently decorated stones at the pre-historic Boyne Valley passage graves and the trefoil format is representative of the nature conservation element in our national parks.</P>
    <P>Subhead K3 provides for a grant-in-aid towards the cost of the restoration of Holy Cross Abbey, County Tipperary, for which legislation enabling the Commissioners to carry out the work was enacted in 1959.  The project is now well under way.  The cost of the restoration work will be borne by <Col N="2395" /> diocesan trustees and lodgments made will be credited to Appropriations-in-Aid. Conservation works on the fabric of the monument will be paid for by the State.  Subhead L covers the annual grant-in-aid for the operation and maintenance of the yacht &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the main activities of the Commissioners of Public Works. There may be items which I have not specifically mentioned in which Deputies may be interested.  If any Deputy desires further information on any item I shall be only too glad to provide it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is unfortunate that copies of the text of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech could not be given to interested Deputies at a more reasonable time.  This practice of Deputies being handed copies of a speech like this in the House should stop.  There is nothing secret in this document.  I do not know why this method of distribution has been adhered to down through the years.  Nobody could delve deeply into and make an adequate criticism of a speech like this in five minutes. Therefore this practice must stop. Excepting a very confidential document like the Budget Statement, interested Deputies should be given copies of speeches at a reasonable time so that they can study the subject matter contained therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interest shown last year in this Estimate was indicated by the number of Deputies who participated in the debate.  This springs from the fact that the activities and operations of the Board of Works impinge on every constituency.  Representations are made to Deputies and, when they come in here, they voice their opinions by way of criticism, recommendation or commendation. Now all recommendations should be carefully studied and examined because the opinions voiced here are the opinions of a cross-section of the entire community and Deputies voicing their opinions here on behalf of their constituents act really as an examining body relative to the efficiency of the operations of the Board of Works throughout the <Col N="2396" /> country.  Recommendations should, as I say, be carefully examined.  If they are not feasible they can be thrown out and, if they are feasible, they can be implemented.  I trust that this will be done in future.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious an increase has occurred under subheads A, B and C. Anyone of reasonable intelligence realises this increase has been caused by the increase in the cost of living. Increased living costs give rise to demands for increased wages.  These demands have to be met.  This is the reason for the big increase in salaries, wages, travelling expenses and post office services.</P>
    <P>There is a marked decrease under subhead D due to the fact that a large sum was given last year for the premises in Kildare Place.  There is a sum of £70,000 for the purchase of sites for Garda stations and other public buildings.  In the Board of Works and in Departments of State generally the transfer of sites is finalised with expedition.  In local authorities the transfer of sites takes anything up to 18 months.  There is a very critical housing situation and I suggest that transfers of sites for housing should be expedited.  In Mayo we have an appalling housing crisis. Last night I was told by a member of a deputation from Donegal that it takes up to two years to transfer a simple site from a farmer, who gives it willingly, to the local authority.  This is a shocking state of affairs.  Red tape and bureaucracy should not militate against the provision of houses.  I know this is not a matter for the Board of Works; it is in the Department of Local Government the hold-up occurs.</P>
    <P>Under subhead E the money is provided for new buildings, alterations and additions.  This is work carried out for Departments through the agency of the Board of Works.  Subhead E covers a wide range of activities.  One of these is the building of primary schools.  I am glad more money is being provided this year by the Department of Education for the building of new schools.  Many new schools have been built but there is still a great deal of work to be done in this direction.  Anyone travelling through the country must be aware of <Col N="2397" /> the obsolete, rat-infested schools which children are compelled by law to attend.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to expedite the building of schools.  In 1967 certain facilities were offered to managers to enable them to install heating and proper sanitary facilities.  Officials gave of their time willingly to advise and counsel and to help with plans and designs.  This has been a wonderful boon in country districts and I commend those who really went out of their way to help.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a change in the national school curriculum and this will call for extra expense because teachers will have to have space for assignment work and so forth. I understand, too, that teachers have been asked to establish small museums. Again, more space will be required for these and this will mean increased cost.</P>
    <P>I want to say a special word about schools for the mentally handicapped and the physically handicapped.  A special design is essential, first of all, and then there has to be special equipment. This is an extra burden on the Exchequer but no one will grudge the extra expense because of the excellent results achieved, results reflected in the children themselves and in the happiness of the parents.  Up to ten years ago these children had to be kept at home.  There were neither teachers nor educational facilities to cater for them. In the last four years wonderful progress has been made in this respect.  I have here a letter from the Mayo Association of Parents and Friends of Mentally Handicapped Children.  The letter is as follows:</P>
    <P>I understand from statements of the Minister for Finance that there is a little money yet in the funds and I would be very glad if you would use your strongest influence to get our mentally handicapped school on the list for immediate attention.  It is well over two years since we purchased the site at Convent Hill, Ballina, County Mayo, and plans have been prepared and approved for some time.  I understand that there was some delay in having title completed to the satisfaction of the Department but this is now in order. We have had two house-to-house <Col N="2398" /> collections in the county since purchasing the site and many embarrassing questions are being asked about the delay in getting the building under way.  It is also a great hardship on the 55 to 60 children who are on the waiting list and for whom nothing can be done until the school is provided.  I think that it is very important that the Department concerned should move now to have the school built without undue delay as it is really a very urgent matter.</P>
    <P>He signs himself Chairman, Ballina Branch, of this Society.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get this school under way with all expedition.</P>
    <P>Dealing with schools, before I pass on to another item in the Estimate, I would like to mention that there is one particular complaint which I get from contractors in the part of the country I come from, especially contractors who install heating in the schools. It is that when they have finished their contract, they do not get paid in some cases for a year to 18 months, or maybe two years.  Somebody has mentioned its being a Board of Works job, but it is not that at all.  The Board of Works has come in for a lot of derisive criticism over the years, but as I have had to study it over the past two years, they do not deserve it at all; but in cases like this, where the contractor has finished, to the satisfaction of the engineer, a certain assignment or a job of work given to him, and if the engineer supervising the work gives him a certificate of completion and satisfaction, that contractor should be paid out of hand.  The reason for this is that the contractor is being pressed by the builder's provider, and if he cannot come across with the money within a reasonable time, a few months, he will not get supplies again, so I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary as a recommendation to have expeditious payment made to those contractors who do a satisfactory job.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the sum of £225,000 for Garda stations.  In the Book of Estimates for Public Services, it is only £140,000, plus £60,000, making £200,000.  That is item No. 31.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2399" /> There is a difference of £25,000 but what is a sum of £25,000 when you spend millions?</P>
    <P>In some parts of the country, the Guards are still trying to carry out their duties in barracks which are really obsolete and it is only when you are on the ground and pass through the rural areas that you see this grim, gloomy and, I understand, damp building inside.  Somebody will ask &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;, and you say &ldquo;That is the Guards barracks&rdquo;.  If we have any respect for the law, we should also have respect for the people who preserve the law, and should have the respect for them that we give them some comfortable, suitable and wellheated quarters in which to carry out their duties.  Not alone that, but in the summertime and sometimes in the winter, visitors and tourists must go to the Garda barracks for directions, for advice and counsel.  This leaves a very poor impression on people who come for the first time to the rural areas of Ireland and who have to go into such an obsolete building asking for advice.  First impressions, I suppose, are strongest, and so they go home to their various countries whence they came, bearing with them an image of our police force which is excellent but the places in which they must work deplorable.</P>

      <P>I doubt it, Sir.  I want to say a word of commendation to the people in charge of the National Building Agency.  This is an agency which gives very efficient service and, as I said about the transfer of sites, I was talking to a contractor, a man who takes upon himself contracts for the National Building Agency, and he tells me that an inspector can come down&mdash; I do not know from which Department &mdash;buy ten sites and within a week work is started.  If that happens with the National Building Agency it should also be the same way with the local authorities.  I have mentioned this before, but I want to emphasise it, on <Col N="2400" /> account of the people who are bereft of houses and who with the coming winter, have, I suppose, most Deputies plagued with &ldquo;Will my house be built before the winter comes?&rdquo;.  If it is possible, an expeditious transfer of sites should be accomplished, no matter what type of Department we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>Subhead E also deals with improvements to Government buildings and here in Leinster House&mdash;this is the only one I will comment on&mdash;we have an excellent building, excellently run, but there are still some defects in the work which the Board of Works has done on the building.  First of all, we had a very large crowd here last week.  When a crisis or pseudo-crisis arises within the vicinity of this House, the people flock in here and try to get on to the gallery.  Last Wednesday, admission was only by ticket.  Every Deputy got one ticket&mdash;some Deputies got more than one but we will not quibble about that&mdash;but I went down to give my ticket to a friend who had asked me the week before and I could hardly get near the gates.  They got inside the gates all right but they could not see the ushers who were inside the waiting room.  That waiting room just at the gate has been built, I suppose, over the last three or four years, but definitely it is completely inadequate.  Only one person at a time can go in the door and if he stands there, he blocks the whole way. They do not, in a rush, go in and stay in the outside room near the street&mdash; they wait there and block the others.  I want to congratulate the ushers on the way they handled the situation, but I am afraid that something more adequate must be constructed near the gate.  I understand of course that there is a security risk involved and we must have this security risk abolished, but we must also have an adequate way of dealing with visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hear complaints yet about the thermostat which governs the heating in this place.  Some people complain that they are too warm; other people complain that they are too cold, but I believe that it depends upon the room you are in.  I would ask the officers, if they can manage it at all, to get an even temperature permeating the <Col N="2401" /> atmosphere, both here and in various other places in the building.</P>
    <P>Last year I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary that the ushers here should be given a lighter uniform for the summer.  I understand a sample of a certain cloth was procured but I believe it was not quite suitable, being heavier material than what they are wearing.  The present uniform is really a burden on these wonderful men whose efficiency is undoubted and whose co-operation with Deputies, visitors and all concerned makes them men above men.  I do not think we could replace the staff we have here, the superintendent, the captain and all the ushers who facilitate us in every possible way.  They facilitate visitors and make them feel at home.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his staff.</P>
    <P>Subhead E provides money also for new offices.  Now I come to a very controversial subject which has given rise to conjecture and almost civil strife in various places in Castlebar.  In 1967 &mdash;was it an election year&mdash;a proposal was made to decentralise the Department of Lands to Castlebar and the Department of Education to Athlone. This caused great excitement in my home town, also the home town of the former Minister for Lands.  At that time he moved that proposal.  This matter is still a matter for conjecture despite assurances from various Ministers. Last year the Taoiseach attended a function in Breaffy House, Castlebar and gave a solemn undertaking&mdash; I do not doubt his word but who can accept the word of any Minister nowadays when so many irresponsible statements have been made?  &mdash;that decentralisation would take place and that Castlebar would be the location of an enlarged Department of Lands. The urban council purchased a site.</P>

      <P>Not really money; it is the transfer we want.  I have here an article which says that definite progress is being made in the Government's plan to transfer the Department of Lands headquarters to Castlebar from Dublin, according to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Flanagan.  This was in an interview with the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Press</i>.  The date of the article is last Sunday.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>He gave me the information when I asked him about rumours that the decentralisation scheme for his Department and for the Department of Education had been abandoned by the Government.  &ldquo;It is quite to the contrary,&rdquo; said Mr. Flanagan. &ldquo;In fact we are busy just now organising a pilot scheme which will be the first move to Castlebar.  The plan is definitely on.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big plan to go west was announced by the Government in the summer of 1967.  It caused a flutter of excitement throughout the 30,000strong Civil Service.  A census in 1967 showed that 82.27 per cent of the Civil Service Clerical Association's members in the Department of Lands and Forestry expressed an unwillingness to go west; 5.67 per cent said they would go to Athlone and 3.54 per cent said they could not make up their minds. If there is no compulsion it does not take a Garret FitzGerald to calculate that if this plan is carried out, 5.98 <Col N="2403" /> people will come to the town of Castlebar. We do not want to recruit people from Dublin to come there if this transfer goes through.</P>

      <P>If the money is forthcoming I hope this office will be built. Perhaps I am a &ldquo;doubting Thomas&rdquo; but until I put my foot across the threshold of that office I will not believe it.  I hope it comes because if it does not the town of Castlebar, the urban council and all concerned will be at a very severe financial loss.  The first indication is the building and there is nothing built yet.  If we are to spend £1,650,000 on this project and if we provide only £5,000 for this year it will be more than 100 years before it will be done&mdash;something like 330 years.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, as an indication of his goodwill, at least to come down and turn the sod.  The same thing applies&mdash;£5,000 only being provided for this year&mdash;to the building of new offices in Athlone. I think it is a gimmick and it gives me an idea that there might be something coming up in the near future although we were told it was only in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead E provides money for harbour improvement schemes and landing facilities.  On 11th June, 1970, £40,000 was provided for an improvement to a landing pier at Roonagh Point, Louisburgh, County Mayo.  This pier is three miles from Clare Island so there was a proposal.  I understand, by the Office of Public Works to improve the pier at Clare Island and then improve the pier at Roonagh Point.  Roonagh Point, I am told, was the subject of a discussion by the <Col N="2404" /> Louisburgh Development Association and the representatives of the county were called in last year.  The people in Louisburgh had got all the relevant information that they could regarding the approaches to Roonagh Point pier and the people who knew most about tides, currents and favourable and unfavourable winds suggested that the Office of Public Works should have another look at the location of this improvement work.  They suggested that a new location should be arranged at Old Head, Carramore, or Carrow-niskey. I would ask the Board to examine the suggestion.  I would also ask them to leave the £40,000 as allocated; if they cannot get a better location for its expenditure it must be kept allocated to the pier at Roonagh. I wanted to impart that information lest they might do the same as was done two years ago at a small pier in the Gaeltacht area of Portacloy where £20,000 was expanded two years ago. Portacloy is in the Erris Peninsula.  An excellent slip was made but that slip has not been used yet by the fishermen in that area because the approaches to the place are governed by a groundswell. People coming from offices in Dublin or anywhere else do not have the local knowledge that these fishermen have.  It is a fact&mdash;I shall quote later from the publication of the Irish Fishermen's Association&mdash;that this place has never been used although £20,000 was spent on it two years ago. That is why I am asking them to have another look at the Roonagh Point location.</P>
    <P>Other harbour works are provided for under subhead E.  These, I understand, are provided in the Gaeltacht areas by the Board of Works.  The places I wish to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials are all situated in the Erris Peninsula on a line of coast from Ballvcastle, first west and then south, round by Achill Head, taking in Broadhaven Bay, Blacksod Bav, right into the new harbour at Darby's Point.  Darby's Point is situated at the entrance to Achill Island to the south. It was talked about for 25 years and the job was done in two years.  I do not want that to happen at any of the locations I mention tonight.  This area <Col N="2405" /> extends from Ballycastle right along the north of the Mayo coast through Belderrig, Porturlin, Portacloy, into Broadhaven Bay, over the top of the Stags of Broadhaven, across into Blacksod and right around into Achill.  The fishermen there started off in a very small way with currachs. Currachs can be carried to above high water mark and they are quite safe. The fishermen used to make stone shelters for them.  Now the currachs have been replaced by 26-foot half-deckers issued to them by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  There must be up to 100 of these in the various areas and there is no shelter in which they can anchor.  In Inver they built a small anchorage for themselves and that is where £20,000 was spent two years ago, but the jetty cannot be used so that is £20,000 down the drain.  I blame the fact that the engineers, in good faith, just came and did the job without knowing the currents.  I do not know whether the fishermen were consulted or not but in future it would be a good idea, when dealing with marine works, if the local people were asked for their opinions because they know every current from their fathers' and their great-grandfather's time that we landlubbers know nothing at all about.</P>
    <P>In a place called Porturlin there are 32 26-foot half-deckers.  These are used for lobsters and cray fishing and now and again when the fish are very plentiful they just go out and fill their boats with mackerel and herring.  This is one of the richest fishing grounds in Europe because it is contiguous to Donegal Bay, off Rathlin Island, straight across into the Stags of Broadhaven.  It takes 6½ hours from Killybegs to the Stags of Broadhaven and when the boats are filled they must steam back that distance again. If we had even a minor harbour where the trawlers from Killybegs could go in and berth in Broadhaven Bay they could be out again the next morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite in order then.  In Broadhaven Bay there are 60 boats but there is no place for them to berth.  If a storm occurs at night the owners must go down to the bay and winch the boats up above the high water mark. Under the Estimate for the Gaeltacht £40,000 was given to Ros an Mhil.  The same sum could be given to Broadhaven Bay.  There are two excellent landing places opposite each other in Broadhaven at Ballyglass and Inver.</P>
      <P>There are two co-ops in the area, one is called the Ellis Fisherman's Co-op and even though it has only been established in the last year it has a huge turnover.  I would ask the officers of the Board of Works to examine the feasibility of having one decent jetty in a central place in the harbour of Broadhaven.  It would prove of inestimable value not only to the people in that area but to the trawlers from Killybegs because it would save them a return journey of six and half hours. The authentic publication of the Irish fishermen&mdash;the <i>Irish Skipper</i>&mdash;says:</P>
      <P>The nearest major landing piers to north-west Mayo are Darby's Point, far south in Achill, and Killala, well to the east.  Most of the 60 boats in the area therefore have to tranship their catches and crews into currachs to get ashore.</P>
      <P>And not only does the lack of a good harbour in Broadhaven prevent local fishermen from progressing into bigger vessels, but also it forces Killybegs boats working off the Stags to steam home after every trip&mdash;a six and a half hour run which can be dangerous when the holds are full.</P>
      <P>It is therefore distinctly obvious that a good fishing harbour is vital in Broadhaven.  The activity has illustrated the enthusiasm among the local fishermen&mdash;an enthusiasm which will undoubtedly result in pressure being brought to bear on the authorities for a Broadhaven harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, it is on the record anyhow.  Subheads F.1 to F.4 provide for the cost of servicing State premises, maintaining parks and maintaining Shannon navigation.  Public demand is for more amenities, and more open spaces.  When pollution is frequently the theme of many debates, inquiries and seminars, the preservation of open spaces such as public and national parks, and the proper maintenance of the Shannon navigation are most important matters.  If the aim of the national parks and monuments branch is more parks that is a noteworthy object which should be fostered and assisted in every possible way.  It is recognised that the Shannon has immense potential as a recreational waterway; no other river in the British Isles is comparable as a holiday location for fishermen, boats-men and sportsmen.  The Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and the local authorities are to be commended on the efforts they have made to promote still further the development of the Shannon as a holiday centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subheads G.1 to G.3 deal with flooding and arterial drainage.  I want to place on record the disappointment and frustration of the people of south Mayo over the restriction imposed on them by the withdrawal of money for arterial drainage last year.  They were under the impression that the Corrib-Mask would be continued but it has not been.  The Corrib-Headford is almost at a standstill.  The scheme only came as far as Kilmaine and the people from the townlands of the Neal, Cross, Cong, Glencullen as far as Ballinrobe and Ballintubber and across into Thomastown on the far side of Ballinrobe are inundated with water.  It is a terrible state of affairs that farmers whose land is under water for six months of the year have to pay rent and rates.  They must also withstand the financial loss due to crops being washed away, stock being drowned or lost from fluke and hoose. <Col N="2408" /> I want to impress on the Board of Works the necessity for starting this arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>The Corrib-Headford scheme is due to finish in 1971.  Last year the Parliamentary Secretary promised that when the Corrib-Headford scheme was finished the Corrib-Mask-Robe would continue.  The farmers of south Mayo are buoyed up with the hope and assurance that this will be done.  I trust it will be started within the next financial year.  I understand a part of it is being left out.  I received a deputation from a district called Ayle.  They informed me that this vast area was being omitted from the Corrib-Mask scheme. All this district drains into the Ayle river which drains into Lough Mask.  It is unthinkable that this area, which is on a slope, could be omitted from the scheme.  No engineer could possibly think of omitting this particular district. All the farms are small and every rood of land that can be saved should be saved on their behalf because an acre of land salvaged from floods in the west is far more valuable than an acre of land salvaged in County Meath, not valuable materially but in a sociological way.  Every perch of land in the west counts; it is worked to its fullest capacity.  I want to contradict the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary that full advantage is not being taken of the benefits from arterial drainage.  I can assure the House that full advantage is being taken of every perch of land salvaged from the floods that formerly inundated the catchment area in the Moy.</P>
    <P>It is on record that in County Mayo there is a better return from the pilot area than from any other pilot area in the country but it is sad that farmers who are in a pilot area find that after a year or two the lime is leeched from the land with the result that their crops decline and their livestock get disease because of fluke and hoose which result from flooding.  This flooding leads also to a shortage of fodder.</P>
    <P>As part of my duties as a public representative I attended a meeting of the Aughagower development association. At that meeting I was asked if the district is included in the Corrib-Mask drainage scheme.  I could not <Col N="2409" /> answer the question but I understand that the format is on exhibition in the Office of Public Works.  Therefore I must go over there and if this area is not included we shall have to bring to bear all the pressure that is possible so that it will be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The smaller ones are as important as the major ones and these smaller ones are usually outside the catchment area where there is a water shed intervening.  An ideal place to implement one of these schemes is in a pilot area which comes under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This area lies between Newport and Westport and embraces two parishes.  Farmers there complain that although they are in a pilot area, which means they can avail of facilities and concessions that farmers in other areas cannot avail of, they cannot get fertiliser to their lands and they cannot make use of the land reclamation scheme because there is no outfall for the water.  I would recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that a study of this matter be made at some stage so that it might be put on the list even if not, perhaps, on the priority list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coast protection is mentioned in the statement.  The amount of money allocated for this purpose in the year 1970-71 was £40,000 and for this year it is to be £55,000 but so far as I am aware no money whatsoever has been spent on coastal protection in County Mayo.  On Monday last there was a question before a meeting of the county council concerning an application <Col N="2410" /> that was made from a district below Kilalla, a place called Caramore-Lacken. It appears that the protection wall at the pier is so low that the sea comes in over it and inundates ten acres of arable land and three houses. I understand that the local authority can make application to the Office of Public Works to initiate an examination of such floodings as a result of which a scheme is designed for the purpose of affording protection from flooding.  When this matter comes before the Parliamentary Secretary from Mayo County Council, I ask that it be given favourable consideration. The sooner this matter is attended to the better.  We have only had one or two storms so far this year but one of those completely inundated ten acres of land and three houses.  I hope the problem will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>National monuments are a feature of the Estimate this year again.  On the previous occasion certain recommendations were made in this respect. There are national monuments to be found in most parts of the country.  I suppose Deputy Tully is in one of the most historic areas of the country.  He was one of the Deputies who had some suggestions to make last year.  One of these was that a guidebook should be available to visitors at places of historic interest.  It must be frustrating when visitors come to these places and find there is no way of ascertaining their historical background.  Guide-books would solve this problem.  I understand that guides are available in only two locations in Ireland.  One of these is looked after very well by the Davern family and I do not know where the other people operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Incidentally, I understand that the guides at Cashel are doing an excellent job.  When the Office of Public Works take over a monument they erect a dark plaque with a notice to the effect that the monument has been taken over by them but I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that there are to be certain improvements in this sphere. <Col N="2411" /> Such improvements would be to the benefit of visitors and would, perhaps, encourage them to return.</P>
      <P>I have covered most of the significant items in the Estimate.  During my contribution, I may have seemed somewhat critical but these criticisms were justified.  On the other hand any commendations that have been made or that may be made during the debate are merited.  The officials of the Office of Public Works fully deserve the praise they get.  I want to record my deep appreciation, and the appreciation of every public representative, be they councillors or Deputies, of the officers who were in charge of the Moy drainage.  The Moy drainage scheme is now at the maintenance stage and I trust that the same co-operation, the same efficiency and the same courtesy will be forthcoming from the officers in charge of maintenance work in County Mayo.  I know it will.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has always been courteous, co-operative and mindful of the smaller factors which show his consideration for the welfare of his employees, his colleagues, visitors to this House and all others with whom he is in contact. For the period he has been in charge of that Office, as far as I know, no one can say that he has not done his best inside the limits of financial restrictions.  We trust that soon his Minister will relax such restrictions and release much needed moneys to those activities over which the Parliamentary Secretary has jurisdiction.</P>

When Deputy Lemass took over as Parliamentary Secretary many heads were shaking and people were saying: &ldquo;Well, this is going to be a dead loss&rdquo;. Among others I was agreeably surprised to find that not only was that not true but that, in fact, Deputy Lemass has done his job very well within the limitations of the present Government.  There were odd occasions when he did not come up to scratch and I propose to refer to one of them <Col N="2412" /> here tonight.  In the main, I found him most courteous and efficient, and one cannot expect more from a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is a bit unreal that we should be talking on 17th November about the granting of a sum of money of £10,988,000 for the running of the Office of Public Works for the year ending 31st March, 1972.  Already a substantial amount of that money must have been spent.  While it is not relevant in this debate, something must be done about the Estimates because there is no point in talking about money after it has been spent.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>The combined increase of £124,000 reflects the 12th round increase in salaries, improved rates for travelling and subsistence and increased post office charges, as well as the transfer to this Vote of certain charges for office equipment formerly borne on the Stationery Office Vote.</P>
      <P>The increase in the Vote is not sufficient. I am quite sure that the amount of money required to pay the increases is very much more than the amount which has been allowed for here.  There are savings on some of the Votes and I presume that is where the other money comes from.</P>
      <P>I had a letter from a constituent who is employed as a maintenance worker in the Office of Public Works.  He and his colleagues have been working on the Glyde and Dee drainage over a number of years.  They are now pensionable servants of the Office of Public Works.  Normally they start in March and finish in late December or early January.  This year they did not start until June and they were notified that they would be finishing at the end of November, simply because a wage increase was granted to them during the year.  Somebody is trying to put a quart of liquid into a pint bottle, attempting to get the work done with a very much reduced amount of money.  I wonder is this matter being dealt with seriously at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year there was a danger that these men would be laid off before <Col N="2413" /> Christmas.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he would intervene and ensure that at least they would be kept on until after Christmas, as in previous years they had been kept on until some time in late January or early February. I am glad to say that he took the necessary action to have these people retained.  May I again impose on him by asking him to intervene on this occasion and try to have these men retained at least until after Christmas? It is a bad Christmas box to be told that they must go on the Labour Exchange a month before Christmas. Many of them are married men whose families have grown up and gone away so they will be living on about £7 a week over Christmas and until March or April or, as happened this year, June, unless the Parliamentary Secretary intervenes.</P>
    <P>Talking about wages, surely the Office of Public Works should grow up with regard to deductions for income tax, <i>et cetera,</i> from their employees. The Office of Public Works collect income tax on the previous year's earnings. Therefore there should be no difficulty whatever about deducting from the first week in April of the following year, the amount of money which should be deducted each week. Surely it is ridiculous to find that in some cases no deductions at all are made until October or November.  In other cases a small amount is deducted and then the employee is told that he owes a certain amount of money to the income tax authorities. This year one man with £17 a week had £9 deducted from his wages in one week.  He was left with £8 to bring home to his wife and children. The following week they took £5.  The following week they took £4.  It would have been just as easy to deduct an equal amount every week from April on.  If the PAYE system were in operation and the deductions were in regard to the current year I could see the difficulty.  I can see no difficulty whatever when it is on the previous year's earnings.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could arrange for a typist to be employed in the establishment office of the Office of Public Works so that I <Col N="2414" /> could get a reply to a letter within 12 months.  As a trade union official I have written numerous letters and have failed to get a reply.  I do not propose to take that any longer from the Office of Public Works.  There is no reason why those letters should not be answered and I am now putting it squarely to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he does not do something about this I shall have no option but to bring the matter to the Labour Court and he will look well trying to defend an action like that in the Labour Court.  It is gross discourtesy and nothing else.</P>
    <P>The local offices of the Office of Public Works, even if they have to do it by hand, reply to correspondence by return of post.  Why can we not have a reply from the people in head office, to letters dealing with rates of wages and particularly the question of whether somebody is being paid the correct wage?  I do not want to pursue this matter any further but this is the second time I have had occasion to bring it to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary and, when I tell him that some of the letters I referred to last year have not been replied to yet, he can understand why I am a little peeved about what is not happening.</P>
    <P>I said there is one matter on which I disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary and I want to refer to it now. I wrote to him last week, I called to his office and spoke to his private secretary and to himself about a matter which he says he has already discussed with numerous other public representatives. I take his word for that. I am quite sure that he has satisfied himself that the replies which he has given to other people are all right and that justice is being done.  I am not so satisfied.  I am not prepared to take secondhand information from anybody. Somebody referred to me as the patron of lost causes.  Maybe that is so.  However, I do not think this cause is a lost one.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that I went into great detail in my letter to point out that somebody who was employed as an assessor by the Office of Public Works on a drainage job in the west of <Col N="2415" /> Ireland was offered a transfer which he did not take and thereby got on somebody's back.  Subsequently he was offered another transfer, which he took, but the only accommodation he could get cost £6 per week rent.  There was a slight concession made.  The house needed some minor repairs and a sum of £4 was set aside by the landlord on condition the repairs were made.  Subsequently when this man submitted his expenses sheet to the Board of Works it was said that the expenses sheet showed money that was not due.  The man assures me the amount is slightly over £4.  The man was sacked.  After two or three months he was offered a job as a labourer. The excuse given was that he had falsified accounts.  This he denies.  He has a document to show that the man who rented him the house is prepared to agree that the sum was due. Possibly I am now annoying someone in saying this.  I do not care who I annoy.  I want to make this very clear. Whether or not officials think this is a matter which should not be raised in this House does not interest me. Having tried in another way and failed, I will, with the permission of the Chair, raise it here and now.  I am quite sure the gentleman who had him dismissed would have no hesitation in thinking that with the six days, or whatever it is, uncertified sick leave in a year, he could have taken that day off as a sick day, if required, and, if it is true that this man was dismissed because somebody in the Board of Works felt that the sum of £4 was claimed, and there was some doubt about it&mdash;this man is prepared to swear that the £4 was really due&mdash;I consider that a grave injustice has been done to a married man with two children.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will give his side of the story when he comes to reply or, if he does not wish to do that, perhaps he would let me have in writing his side of the story. So far, I have failed to get an opportunity of discussing the matter with him; though I have discussed it with his private secretary, I have not had a reply to my letter.  I do not propose to deal further with the matter now.</P>

      <P>I have already said that, as far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, I have found him both courteous and obliging.  He has never tried to dodge the issue and neither have his officials.  I particularly want to mention this case because it has been strongly represented to me that a grave injustice has been done and that is something over which I am not prepared to stand if I can get it rectified.</P>
      <P>In the provision for the House of the Oireachtas there is a sum of £2,000. Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if the further £2,000 includes repairs to items inside the Houses which were not properly finished and still have to be finished?  Some of the lights are still falling down in the new building.</P>
      <P>I am astonished that there are no safety regulations for the public gallery.  Last week on the Confidence Motion debate the gallery was packed. So was the House and its precincts.  A hoaxer sent a message that a bomb had been placed.  Had that been made known to those in the gallery I am sure a substantial number would have felt it was safer to get out.  How would 140 or 150 people get out of the gallery? Through one door?</P>

      <P>There is and something should be done about it.  We should not wait until something happens and people get hurt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A document has been sent out by the Department of Local Government <Col N="2417" /> all over the country requiring certain things to be done in little halls in regard to fire protection.  These little halls hold only a couple of hundred people and the proprietors have been notified that they must instal an emergency lighting system which will cost anything up to £1,000 and, if they do not comply, they will have to close down.  These instructions are issued by a Department of State and it is all rather ridiculous when, at the seat of Government, no effort is made to improve safety regulations where fire is concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the public address system, while it is possible to hear most Deputies, there are Members, particularly Ministers, who just cannot be heard in the public gallery.  It is rather ridiculous to allow that situation to continue.  Over and over again a number of people have complained about this and yet the unsatisfactory condition continues.  It is bad enough to be on the gallery&mdash;very often they are people waiting for some Deputy&mdash;but to have to sit there as if one were at one of the old silent movies is ridiculous. The situation should be remedied.</P>
    <P>I notice £9,000 has been allowed for the State apartments.  A sum of £2,000 is provided for repairs and extension to the automatic fire detection system. Is this for repairs to Iveagh House? Surely it should be possible to carry out repairs there.  It is a show place.  It is a little foolish to have the State hiring a room in an hotel for State functions.  If that is one of the purposes of Iveagh House then it should be used for that purpose.  Putting in an automatic fire detection unit now is like locking the stable door after the horse has gone.</P>
    <P>There is a sum of £508,000 for Dublin Castle.  That is quite a large sum.  If it is a show place this may be money well spent.  I believe it is, but there are many who do not agree with me.  They feel that that £500,000 could be spent on more important things than in putting gilt on the Dublin Castle apartments and things like that. However, that is a matter of opinion and I suppose that all of us will never agree on these things.</P>
    <P>I notice also that there is provision <Col N="2418" /> for building a computer.  The amount is £300,000, of which £110,000 has been provided in this Estimate.  I believe we are rather overdoing this computer business.  Some of them seem to be programmed in such a way that they are turning out a lot of useless information and useless material.  We have the typical example of the one in the income tax offices which produced some extraordinary things over the years, including the bill for £1,000,000 which the former Deputy Dillon's friend got some time ago.  Deputy Haughey's comment that the only way to get over that was to pay the bill and that she would get a refund did not help at all.  I had the experience recently of a constituent of mine who got a tax free allowance for 75p a week.  He is married with three children and the employer named on the form was an employer with whom he had been working ten years ago.  Nobody can explain how they got into the computer, unless it prowls around at night to find out what people did, but it drove the poor man up the walls because he was finding it hard enough to live on what was left after paying this tax.  That is the sort of thing that happens and we should not rush into getting all this expensive equipment until we are at least able to make full use of the equipment we have already.</P>
    <P>I notice that fitting out of new office premises for occupation in Kildare Street is to cost £25,000.  This is quite a tidy sum for office equipment but maybe there is a computer stuck in there too.  The new Revenue offices in Dublin Castle are to cost £1,085,000, £305,000 of which has already been spent, and there is to be a further £250,000 spent this year.  With this, and a number of other Revenue Commissioners offices being repaired, I think that one of the reasons why the income tax people are so tough is because the conditions in which they work are so bad that nobody could blame them for not being terribly sympathetic with anybody who sends in a claim.  It is absolutely ridiculous that even still when one goes into one income tax office to make an inquiry, first of all, one has to stand in a queue, sometimes a double queue, with a shutter as if one had to knock three <Col N="2419" /> times and say &ldquo;Sesame&rdquo; before one can get any service; after that a person may have to give his life story standing shoulder to shoulder with his next-door neighbour.  This is all wrong, and if this money now being spent on the income tax offices is going to improve matters, I believe it will be money well spent. I think the very least that income tax payers are entitled to, if they go into an office to try to straighten out their sometimes very tangled income tax affairs is to be able to do so in private and not have to make an open confession, whether it is good for the soul or not.</P>
    <P>In addition, the conditions under which people employed in income tax offices work are really bad and I honestly believe that an effort should be made to improve these conditions. I am rather surprised that the association which looks after them has not kicked up a bigger row.  Quite a number of these people have to work in small, cramped offices with no air and certainly no air conditioning&mdash;I suppose they are heated enough in them.  I would not mind so much if that is what the money is being spent on.</P>
    <P>I am interested to know more about the Government offices in Monaghan which are to cost £30,000 and the new offices in Drogheda for which £115,000 is provided.  I would like to know what this money is being spent on.</P>
    <P>I am interested also in the amount of money being allocated for the socalled transfer to Castlebar of the Department of Lands and to Athlone of the Department of Education. Honestly, I do not think that anybody alive to-day or coming after us will ever see those transfers taking place. The miserly sum included here is evidence enough that there is no intention to move people and the fact that the Civil Service&mdash;and I believe rightly so, having made their lives in a certain area around this city, having built their houses and put their children in schools&mdash;should be asked at this stage to transfer <i>en masse</i> down to Castlebar simply because the former Minister for Lands and the present Minister come from that area <Col N="2420" /> seems a little ridiculous.  On one occasion I asked if, when Deputy Faulkner succeeded as Minister, would that mean that they should transfer to Drogheda, and then move with every Minister, from home town to home town, finishing up like nomads with no fixed abode.  The Government should be honest about this and say that they did fly a kite, an election gimmick, which possibly worked at the time, and having found that even the people they were trying to cod did not believe them, they should now say: &ldquo;We made fools enough of ourselves; we are not going either to Castlebar or to Athlone&rdquo;, and try to talk the people in the area who have invested their money in supplying accommodation for the civil servants, who will never go there, into doing something else with their buildings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but the Parliamentary Secretary has a small amount there which possibly he could use far more efficiently.  If the Parliamentary Secretary was allowed use it he would not continue to put it in here as if something was going to be done because he is a sensible man and he knows damn well that this is all cod.  I am interested, too, in the money being spent on the new works for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am all with that, because it is money very well spent, but is it relevant to the Office of Public Works at all? Should this money be in this Estimate? Should it not be in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>They do the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And as soon as they finish, it becomes the property of the <Col N="2421" /> Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  That being so, I believe that this is a matter which that Department should look after.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by another item&mdash;I do not know if the Minister has noticed it himself.  I wonder if he has compared the amount of money which the Government are prepared to spend on a memorial to Roger Casement with the amount of money they are prepared to spend on a memorial to John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  Both were great men, but Casement was an Irishman who died in the cause of Ireland and this Government are prepared to spend £5,000 on a memorial to him&mdash;£1,000 this year and £1,000 last year&mdash;but in the case of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, also a great man, they are prepared to spend £3,810,000&mdash;£94,000 last year and they are putting in 1,000 this year to keep it going.  Possibly there is a drawback&mdash;money coming from some other source which will be included&mdash; but I think that Roger Casement, if in a position to do so, would probably resent very much this attempt to devalue him at this rate, but I suppose he does not mind now what way the money is spent.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary will also tell me what exactly is the position about Trim.  He mentioned last year that certain work was to be done on King John's Castle. There is an amount of money allocated for it but what is it proposed to do and when does he think it will be done?  That is a fair question and I should like an answer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what exactly is the point about Tara.  We know that there is an appeal coming, but are there any plans?  The late Donogh O'Malley announced many years ago that the State had decided that they were going to take over Tara.  While some people seem to feel that because Tara is farm land, the owner should sell it as farm land and should take no cognisance of the fact that it is Tara and should not have extra value on that account.  I do not agree with that because the man concerned&mdash;I only know him casually and he is not a supporter of mine as far as I am aware &mdash;is entitled to a fair price for it.  The State were wrong in attempting to play <Col N="2422" /> down the value of Tara.  In view of the cost of other places which the State have been developing, I think it was entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Tara is quite an important place and an effort should be made to have something done there instead of waiting until the High Court case is over and then take another five years before action is taken.  It must be ten years now since the first suggestion of development of Tara was made.  It will cost a lot of money.  As it stands, unless you view it from the air it does not look very much.  A rather discredited statue of Saint Patrick is about all there is to be seen.  Possibly if you go to great trouble you can find the mounds but even the markers on these seem to have fallen down and nobody bothered to replace them.  A certain amount of excavation took place there.  This is a matter that should be treated as a matter of urgency and if the money allocated to Castlebar and Athlone was made available there at least something could be done with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny also said the area I come from is very historic.  So it is.  As I mentioned in this debate last year the central portion of Meath, particularly in the direction of Drogheda, was inhabited and was a civilised area before many of the great civilisations in the world existed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong there.  Ballycastle, County Mayo, was the first inhabited area in this country. That has been certified by the archaeologists in the last year.  The first inhabitants settled in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they not very foolish?  As has been shown at Newgrange, 1,000 years before Christ was born they were using Newgrange as a burial chamber.  They had a rather intricate design on the front of Newgrange and it has been proved that at ten minutes past ten on 21st December the sun shines on a particular portion inside the chamber which is not visible at any other time of the year except with artificial light.  It shows there was a very high degree of civilisation there so long ago.  As many people know, the actual burial chamber is similar to <Col N="2423" /> burial chambers found in some places in central Europe.</P>
      <P>We also have the Boyne Valley and while many of the ruins and old places from Drogheda right out to Trim are perhaps Norman, and later, they are much older than anything the Americans have and are well worth a visit when they come here.  Sufficient emphasis is not placed on this and perhaps the tourist board more than the Board of Works could be encouraged to put more emphasis on it.  We also have Kells.  Last year I asked that the wall surrounding St. Columcille's House&mdash;where the Book of Kells is alleged to have been written&mdash;which prevented photographs being taken, be lowered and I was told it could not be done because it would interfere with the appearance of the house. Since then some work has been done but the wall has not been lowered sufficiently. However, it is obvious that people learn by mistakes.</P>
      <P>We have many old monuments in County Meath.  This is not anti-west but it appears that the Board of Works, the tourist board and everyone else thinks there is nothing worth preserving unless it is in the south or west.  I think it should go on record that there is as much in the way of relics of antiquity in the Boyne Valley, and within range of it, including Aonach Tailtin, as in west and south put together.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made quite a good case about the improvements taking place in Garda stations but, like Deputy Kenny, I feel that the Garda stations throughout the country are, whether we like it or not, the public relations <Col N="2424" /> offices for many who come from abroad and seek information.  If the Garda station is falling down, dingy and in need of paint, it does no good to the country's image or to the health of those who must spend their time in it.  It is like a broken down school in which children must stay all day, with broken windows, the ceiling falling on to the floor and rats coming in.  Thank God not many of these are left but there are still some.  These things should get priority and nobody will ever object to the additional money being made available for them.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle was a bit strict with Deputy Kenny as regards what was covered by the Estimate but since the Board of Works are responsible for carrying out certain work even though it is commissioned by the Department of Education we must refer to it here because the Department of Education were quick to point out to me some time ago that a priority list was in the possession of the Board of Works.  I was in some difficulty regarding a school about which I required some information.  I am still not quite clear whether it was the Department of Education or the Board of Works which decided that a school to be built at Killbeg, County Meath, should be put back and it is now much lower on the list than it originally was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to do so because I am sure he was not expecting this; accidentally I came to this part of my script when he arrived.  When the Board of Works are making additions to schools, particularly pre-fabs, the location of these in a school yard is the responsibility of the Board of Works' engineers.  It is wrong that they should do what was done in Duleek, County Meath, where they put a pre-fab in the middle of a pool of water and nobody could get in or out.  It was with great difficulty that the Board of Works were persuaded to drain away the water. Eventually they did, so the school could be used but then the furniture had not been put in so the parish priest was <Col N="2425" /> blamed for that.  Then it was discovered that nobody had made provision for heating.  One after the other these matters cropped up and while far too many children were in an existing old school the new pre-fab was sitting in the middle of a pool of water for several weeks while somebody was deciding what should be done about it.  The engineers in the Board of Works should ensure that a site is correct before a building is erected.  They should also ensure that arrangements are made for the heating, furnishing and painting of the school before arrangements are made for opening it.  I understand the Board of Works design the schools.  One school in County Meath took two and a half years to build.  One of the walls fell down three times.  The local people said the builder was very bad but when I went to the builder and asked him what he was doing he said that he told the engineer at the beginning that it was bound to fall.  He said the design of the school was at fault. Eventually some compromise was reached and the school was built.  The school is Kilbride, in case anybody has any doubts, and they will find on their records that it took two and a half years to build and that one of the walls fell three times.  It was worse than Jericho.  This just should not happen.</P>
      <P>To go back to the Department of Justice for a moment, recently I asked about a Garda station at Dun-shaughlin. Beside the Garda station there is a ball alley which, I understand, is owned by the Board of Works and there is also a plot of ground.  I understand from Meath County Council that they have been attempting to purchase this plot for the purpose of erecting a fire station.  The Department of Justice say they have no objection but that the Board of Works must give authority and the Board of Works say that the Department of Justice must give authority. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would clear that up for me because it appears as if lines have been crossed and in the meantime the fire engine is rusting away in a leaking shed on the other side of the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather interested in the Posts <Col N="2426" /> and Telegraphs section of the Estimate. One of the headings in the Minister's speech is &ldquo;Amiens Street, Former Sorting Office&mdash;Adaptations&rdquo;.  The estimate was £7,600&mdash;£3,600 was spent last year and £4,000 this year.  I assume that completes the job.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary say what happened to Sheriff Street sorting office? That is the one which was built at a colossal cost a couple of years ago and where somebody who had no intention of ever working in it designed it with glass at the back through which all the sun shone and through which all the coal dust from a coalyard at the back blew in.  Every summer, whether it is warm or not, the workers there have been complaining about dust and heat. Can the Parliamentary Secretary say whether anything has been done to remedy this position?  It was mentioned last year and the year before and it appears to have disappeared.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for the Ballyfermot sorting office is £44,000&mdash; £42,000 was spent last year and £2,000 is to be spent this year.  The best of good luck to the Parliamentary Secretary. If he could not build one in his own constituency where would he have one built?  What has happened in regard to the modernisation at Black-rock? The revised estimate is £5,000 and it is being spent this year.  If I remember correctly, for the last couple of years the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have claimed that they have been looking for a site for a new office.  Indeed, they were talking of moving out of the district altogether to get a proper site.  Has it been found that the existing office can be modernised?</P>
    <P>Item No. 64 is for &ldquo;Castlebar Engineering Headquarters and Garage&rdquo;.  I hope that is not in anticipation of the extra traffic that will be there when the Department of Lands go there because if so it is a waste of £4,000.</P>
    <P>Cavan New Post Office, £63,000&mdash; £20,000 last year and £30,000 this year. I wonder why the extra £3,000 was not put in to finish the job?  They have been waiting long enough.  They nearly got a new one a few years ago because there was a fire next door.  Had it not been for the fact that the fire brigade <Col N="2427" /> were too good the post office might have been burned down.  I see they will have to wait another little while for the new post office in Donegal because the estimate is £68,000 and there was nothing spent on it last year and only £1,000 this year.  I assume this is for the site.  It cannot be much more than that.  How long will they have to wait for their new post office?  The provisional estimate for the Mullingar post office is £50,000; £1,000 was spent last year and £1,000 this year.  Are they to put it up a block at a time? Surely it is derisive to put in an amount so small as that and suggest that it will eventually be a post office?  As Deputy Kenny said earlier, at this rate it will be another 48 years before there is a new post office in Mullingar.</P>
    <P>While it is true that we got the Parliamentary Secretary's brief this evening it took a lot of quick reading and at the same time he has gone into great detail in it.  For this I thank him and the officials who prepared it because it is not alone of great use now but it will be of great use in the next few weeks for reference purposes, particularly with subhead E on its own and numbered.  We can follow the brief and find out at least what the position was as of November, 1971, if we want to check back and find out what is happening.  Even though it was very late it is a great help because it is so easy to read.</P>
    <P>There is the following reference in the brief to the restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham:</P>
    <P>The last of the five items is the restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  The building has been allocated to the Department of Education to accommodate a folk museum and the natural history division of the National Museum. The first stage of restoration, which comprised the north wing, was completed in 1966.  It is now proposed to tackle a further stage.  Planning will take some time and the small provision of £1,000 is for planning expenses.  There is no prospect of any works being done this year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,000 for planning expenses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2428" /> Is this for engineers' or architects' fees or what is it for?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I am also touched by the fact that the picture gallery in Kilkenny Castle is getting attention.  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary at least has trust in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Jim Gibbons.</P>
      <P>For a moment when I looked at item 27 I thought there must be a general election coming because I thought it was a start on the draining of the Shannon.  I see it is not, but that £25,000 is provided this year to start a scheme of general improvements on the Shannon.  Even that is pointing to something because whenever a general election is about to occur somebody prepares a scheme to drain the Shannon and it looks as if it is coming along again.</P>
      <P>During the course of his speech the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>Other harbour works being carried out by the Office of Public Works in Gaeltacht areas are paid for from the Vote for Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>He also stated:</P>
      <P>Provision is also made for improvement schemes at a number of other harbours, including Kilmore Quay, County Wexford; Reen, County Cork; Killala, County Mayo; Burtonport, County Donegal; and Cleggan, Emlaghmore and Roundstone, County Galway.</P>
      <P>What has happened about Drogheda? A few years ago a substantial sum of money was allocated for it, some of which was spent on engineering development, some of which was spent building restraining walls.  Has the grant been completed?  Has all the money been drawn?  There is a substantial plan there for the purpose of switching the harbour from Drogheda town to the mouth of the Boyne.  I am interested to know what is happening about this plan because the new development will be within my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the remarks made by <Col N="2429" /> the Parliamentary Secretary about the Phoenix Park.  It seems to be becoming more of a car park than a park for people to which to take their families. There seems to be far too much freedom for speeding cars.  There will have to be some restrictions in order to ensure that the park remains a people's park.  I am disappointed to find that we seem to be further away from the public golf course this year than we were last year when we were actually quoting the fee to be charged for a round of golf.  Apparently this year we are satisfied about the feasibility of laying out an 18-hole public golf course in the Phoenix Park.</P>

      <P>The fact that bus loads of people living in Dublin, particularly working people, go out to country golf clubs on Saturdays and Sundays in order to get a game of golf is proof that there is a demand for golf clubs around Dublin.  Many golf clubs do not allow visitors at all particularly during certain periods of the year.  If people have to go 40 or 50 miles in order to play a game of golf at this time of the year they will have to leave early in the day in order to get the light because of the shorter days.  I am, however, glad to hear the public golf club is on the way.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made a comment during his speech which I think on reflection he will agree is a rather funny one.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2430" /> ...people in over-populated, over-developed countries so starved of the beauty of nature that they would pay a high price not just to own but to sit and watch for a short time occasionally even a small meandering stream of pure, unpolluted water...</P>
    <P>If they want to see that in this country they will have to hurry up because the way things are going now they will have great difficulty in finding a clear, unpolluted stream.  We are fast reaching the stage at which many of our streams are being polluted either intentionally or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The arterial drainage of the Boyne which we all welcomed is going well. I hope the general tightening of the purse strings which occurred last year will not occur again and when the days get shorter we will not see people being laid off under various guises.  It does not matter for what reason they are laid off, the fact that they are laid off means they are without a week's wages.  I have already expressed the opinion on another Bill today that I consider it to be a very bad economy to lay off somebody from a job where he is earning £25 a week, because he has to be paid £10 or £12 social welfare and he does not have to pay insurance stamps or income tax.  The net result over a period is that everybody loses, including the State and the taxpayer. If at all possible an effort should be made to keep the full staff going on jobs like this, particularly on the Boyne.</P>
    <P>A number of people have complained about the wet land being denuded of wild life because of the drainage.  Last year I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he would consider making a wild life reserve of the estuary of the Boyne.  He said he would consider it.  I hope he has done so although I do not see any evidence that he has.  It would certainly give the bird life which has to leave the wet lands as a result of the arterial drainage some place to go.</P>
    <P>When these rivers are drained quite a number of public and private water schemes are completely dried up.  I brought one particular case in a place called Bective, Navan, to the Parliamentary <Col N="2431" /> Secretary's attention.  May I pay a compliment to the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials because as quickly as they could they made arrangements with Meath County Council to have something done about it?  This was not, however, very successful because even though it is almost winter the water has not yet been restored.  I am not blaming the Board of Works, apparently other people were not able to do what they had promised and the result is that the boring has not been carried out.</P>
    <P>Apparently somewhere in the small print in the Arterial Drainage Act there is a stipulation that the Board of Works are not responsible for any wells or other water supplies which are affected by arterial drainage.  If this is the position it was a sneaky sort of thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in 1945; I was not around then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They were as tricky then as they are now.  It is a terrible thing for 20 or 30 families who have invested all their life savings in a water supply to find, because the Board of Works have drained the river, that they have no water.  The Board of Works have no responsibility and merely refer these people to a section of the Act.  If that is not the position perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will say what can be done in such cases.  He did agree in the Bective case that he would give assistance but he told me he only did that because he felt the people had been badly treated by having a very expensive supply taken from them.  If they have any redress I should like to know what it is because a number of other instances have occurred and the number is growing daily.  The Parliamentary Secretary will have to do something about this particular problem.  In some cases the local authority are involved but in other cases it is a private water supply. In one case it was almost a public supply, it was a group scheme, and everybody in the group has lost the water supply he had.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot simply shove the <Col N="2432" /> matter aside.  He must do something about it.  He was helpful in regard to the one case brought to his notice.  I have written to him about another and I await his decision.</P>
      <P>There are many other problems created by the draining of these rivers. One of these is the question of soil disposal.  There have been many complaints in this regard from people in the West of Ireland where major schemes have been carried out.  I understood that when the Boyne drainage was taking place special arrangements were being made to ensure that there would be no spoil left along the banks of the river, particularly in the Boyne Valley.  As a result of a court action the problem has been overcome to some extent and the portion of the river from Navan to Drogheda is being scoured only and not sunk but from Navan upwards towards the Bog of Allen the river is being deepened and already very unsightly heaps of spoil can be seen along the banks.  When a small landowner finds that the biggest heap of spoil happens to be on his land while his neighbour, who may have several hundred acres of land, appears not to have any spoil on his land, it is difficult to persuade the smallholder that this must have been accidental.</P>
      <P>My request to the Board of Works would be that they would make some effort to dispose of this soil.  We are now living in the age of the conveyor belt and since there are so many disused quarries throughout the country, it should be possible to use this spoil for filling-in purposes.  Usually the spoil is material upon which nothing will grow and consequently it cannot be spread on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the Boyne, as with other rivers that have been cleaned, problems have arisen in some areas in relation to tributaries that have not been included in the schemes.  Last week the Parliamentary Secretary received a deputation of a group of people from the Summerhill area who believe that the particular stream in their area should have been included in the Boyne drainage.  I was sorry that, because I was engaged in the House, I could not accompany the deputation.  However, <Col N="2433" /> I understand that the reason given for the particular stream not being included was that there are some rare plants growing in the district and these might be ruined by the drainage of the river.  All I can say is that was a very rare excuse because I have been checking since then and have found that these plants have been growing in other places for many years and in fact are very common in County Meath. Apparently someone was chancing his arm and almost got away with it.</P>
    <P>The planning of any drainage scheme takes place over a long period and that being so it is only reasonable that anybody who has a complaint regarding a river or drain in his area which is not being included should recognise that fact when the rivers are pegged before the start of the scheme. If at that stage the drain or stream is not included a person could go along and inspect the plans and if, subsequently, he is assured of the omission, he would have no difficulty in making representations at that point.  I have great sympathy with the people who went to see the Parliamentary Secretary last week but, at the same time, I realise the difficulties involved at this stage when the drainage has almost reached their area.  The inclusion of the stream now would entail a revision of the scheme so as to include a stream which they believe, and rightly so, should have been included in the first place.  I do not know what action the Board of Works will take.  I have a suspicion they will wait until the scheme has gone so far that they can do nothing about it and will tell the people so politely.  Unfortunately that would be no solution.</P>
    <P>Regarding the maintenance of these rivers, the local authorities through whose areas they run have a mandatory demand on them for a certain amount of money in respect of maintenance. Regardless of whether the money is spent, it must be paid. Having regard to a particular case last year, and to what is likely to happen again this year in regard to the Glyde and Dee, it looks as if the amount of money available is not sufficient to pay for all the work and the result will <Col N="2434" /> be that there will be loss of employment. Some system will have to be devised whereby a subvention from the State will be paid because unless the rivers, once drained, are properly maintained, the entire expenditure will have been wasted.</P>
    <P>Depending on which side of the political fence they happen to be sitting, many people for some years have been criticising the Local Authority (Works) Act.  One of the reasons why this act was not as useful as it might have been was that very few people spent either any money or energy in cleaning the rivers each year. Those of us who have knowledge of these matters, particularly rural Deputies, know that because of cattle running along the banks of a river and for other reasons, river banks fall in and if not cleared will cause an obstruction which will result in a short time in the river reverting to its original state.  If the money is not available for this purpose because of wage increases or increased costs, the Department should make up the balance.</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish to refer to is that of coastal erosion.  In my constituency there is very little coast erosion as such but we have the problem of the tide gradually going under walls which are protecting banks and roads.  It is only a matter of time before all the foundation disappears from under these walls.  Once it begins to disappear, it is necessary to take down almost the whole wall and replace it with a new one.  This work is very expensive.  I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us if this can be regarded as coast erosion.  I see danger in my area of roads being affected.  Very near to where I live a concrete shelter that cost almost a £1,000 to erect may be damaged if this particular erosion continues.  Perhaps the Board of Works could make available the necessary money to deal with problems of this nature.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
