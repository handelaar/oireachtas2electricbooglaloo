    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the fact that some of the questions being asked on the census form are of a very personal and private nature; and if there is an obligation on people to answer such questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 1 of 11th March, 1971, I listed a number of questions which are being asked in the 1971 census schedule but which were not included in the 1966 inquiry.  Most of these, however, were asked in a number of earlier censuses.  The only questions <Col N="1523" /> being asked for the first time at an Irish census are&mdash;usual residence at census date and one year earlier; method of transport to work or school and distance from residence to place of work or school; scientific or technological qualifications held; number of motor cars used by the household. These are not of a very personal or private nature.</P>
      <P>As on previous occasions the census of population is on a statutory basis. The purpose of the census is to provide statistical information on the size and structure of the population.  This can only be achieved by collecting all the necessary particulars for each individual member of the population and for each household.  If completion of part of the census form were to be on a voluntary basis the resulting statistics would be incomplete and of little value.  This is why there is an obligation on people to answer all the questions.</P>
      <P>There is also, under the Statistics Acts, a legal obligation on all those involved in collecting and processing the results not to reveal any information about individuals or households to any other person.  All the census forms are returned to the Central Statistics Office and nobody outside that office whether an individual, a Government Department or other body will have access to the individual forms or to the information about specific persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary has given these facts showing that this information will not be available to anyone outside the office but in view of the fact that quite a number of people are a little worried about it and a bit concerned that it is an infringement of their private and personal rights, would the Parliamentary Secretary be sure that the information he will get as a result will be accurate?  The Parliamentary Secretary says they are obliged to answer.  Will they now answer correctly in view of the fact that people <Col N="1524" /> feel a bit concerned at being asked these questions?  There have been some protests to me about it, not just one, quite a few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>They said they were being asked personal questions. Actually I looked at the form and I did not think the questions were so personal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows there are 28 questions on the form but, with great respect to the Deputy, I feel they are very reasonable questions.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the local health authority that, so far, it has not found it possible to provide, in Kenmare, a dental centre capable of providing comprehensive dental care for children from the surrounding district. Under arrangements made by the health authority with local private dentists, children in the town receive treatment in the dentists' surgeries but it is not possible for these dentists to undertake the additional work involved in treating other children from the adjoining rural area.  Consequently, these other children who, as a result of recent school dental inspection were found to be in need of conservative treatment, have been advised to attend the Killarney dental clinic.  I understand that the health authority's staff, who from 1st April will operate under the new Southern Health Board, will continue their efforts to provide a suitable dental clinic in Kenmare for the benefit of children from the surrounding district.</P>

As there is no benefit in the Irish scheme similar to the special hardship allowance under the British legislation its inclusion in a reciprocal agreement between the two countries was not possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment benefit under the Social Welfare Acts is payable only out of the Social Insurance Fund established <Col N="1536" /> under those Acts and there are no other funds available for the purpose. Payment of unemployment benefit out of that fund cannot be made to insured persons who fail to satisfy the statutory contribution conditions for title to benefit.  Where inability to satisfy these conditions is due to the failure or neglect of an employer to stamp the insurance cards of an employee&mdash;whether or not the employee's share of the contributions has been deducted from his wages&mdash; and the employee has lost benefit as a result, the employee is statutorily entitled to recover the benefit so lost from the employer.  I am empowered, on the request of the claimant concerned, to take recovery action on his behalf in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>My Department has taken all action open to it to recover the arrears of contributions due by the employer to whom these questions relate.  Some of the arrears have been collected and civil proceedings have been initiated for recovery of the outstanding balance. The Chief State Solicitor has also been asked to take summary proceedings for offences arising out of the employer's failure to pay the contributions.</P>
    <P>As far as is known at present, four former employees of this employer have been disallowed unemployment benefit as a result of the non-payment of their contributions.  I am having their claims urgently reviewed in the light of amending regulations which were made on the 8th instant to see whether any of these claimants&mdash;two of whom are receiving unemployment asistance&mdash;can be made eligible for unemployment benefit from that date through the grant of credits in respect of weeks for which contributions are outstanding.  As I indicated to the House last week, the amending regulations are an interim measure designed to alleviate this problem of loss of benefits pending the introduction of amending legislation, which I intend to promote at the earliest opportunity, to deal with the situation more effectively.</P>

      <P>Lands awaiting distribution in the neighbourhood of Mace, near Westport, comprise one estate of 29 acres.  Proceedings for the resumption of a 39-acre holding have reached the final stages and it is expected that possession will be taken this Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission are aware that there is acute congestion in the vicinity.  The preparation of allotment proposals for the lands already on hands has been deferred pending examination of the possible acquisition of other lands in the area, so that a comprehensive plan of land settlement can be prepared.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The position regarding lands in the possession of the Land Commission for distribution is subject to constant fluctuation, depending upon progress in intake and allotment.  The list of estates on hands in County Roscommon requested by the Deputy would be out of date in a short time and would, therefore, be largely irrelevant.  This is particularly so at this time of year as Land Commission activities in the allotment of land reach their peak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps, therefore, it would meet <Col N="1547" /> the Deputy's requirements, for the present at least, if I were to say that at 31st December, 1970, there were 4,547 acres of arable land in the possession of the Land Commission in County Roscommon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are normally four types of posts of responsibility in vocational schools: principal, viceprincipal, Grade A and Grade B posts. The number and value of the posts are determined by a points system related to the number of pupils and their age. In regard to the assignment of duties to posts of responsibility it is the practice of the Department to allow the Vocational Education Committees to exercise discretion in the matter.  This discretion in effect is exercised through the chief executive officers and the principals of the schools.  Because circumstances vary from school to school the only realistic criterion is that the duties assigned should be in keeping with the nature of the post and the allowance attaching to it.</P>

Since the school is non-vested the question of transferring the plot of ground required by the county council and the completion of any necessary agreement is a matter for the county council and the school manager.

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will consider amending the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, as it places the dairy industry at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the food industry in relation to the use of additives and the extraction of solids from butter in order to increase its spreadability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The grounds for amending the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, as suggested are not strong enough at present to satisfy me that such amendment would have beneficial effects on the dairying industry.  The position will, however, be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely selling more milk would have an effect on the dairying industry?  Does the Minister realise that the dairying industry is at a serious disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the food processing industry because the latter can use additives, colouring and so forth, to make the product more attractive? The dairying industry is completely hidebound by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the purpose of the legislation is to sell milk and milk products but I do not accept that the best way to do this would necessarily be by selling dairy products which contained additives or were processed in such manner as to change them radically from their original condition.  If one <Col N="1555" /> produced a product that differed from butter as we know it, it does not necessarily follow that the sale of a product like that would improve the sales of milk generally.  However, I agree with the Deputy that it is a matter worth examining and it is being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very rare occurrence.  In practically every case the price offered by my Department is more favourable, based as it is on-the current market value without reference to the result of the tuberculin test, and indemnifies the herdowner against the risks of transport and possible partial or total condemnation of the animal at the factory.</P>
      <P>Of course, if any herdowner wishes to sell his reactor direct to a factory, my Department will readily grant the necessary permit.</P>

They will shortly complete their report on County Cork and this will be followed in a few months time by a report on North Kerry.

      <P>As I stated in reply to a question on 25th February last, I and my Department have had discussions with the management of the company. I said, in reply to the previous question, that I have been assured that, as the company's plans to deal with the situation are being developed, they would continue to maintain close liaison with the Government Departments and State agencies concerned. As the company has already stated publicly, one of the ways by which it is proposed to deal with the situation <Col N="1558" /> is to undertake a programme of diversification.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that I have dealt in some depth with the question of the ambulance service and with the possibility of a doctor travelling with each ambulance to the scene of an accident but I should like to qualify that and to expand a little on it.  What I am proposing is that a doctor travel with <Col N="1572" /> an ambulance to the scene of an accident if the extent of the accident should warrant immediate medical attention.  The doctor would then be able to commence vital anti-shock therapy on the way to the hospital as well as any first aid treatment that might be necessary.  That is all I wanted to say in that regard.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to make is that articles 28 and 36 of the Road Traffic Regulations of 1963 forbid a doctor to have any implement on his car which would enable him to travel through dense traffic to the scene of an accident.  Unless a doctor is permitted to have such a device on his car whereby he could proceed independently to the scene of an accident, it would be necessary to have a doctor on call at the ambulance station so that he could travel with the ambulance.</P>
      <P>I have not very much more to add to this debate except to say that I would like the Minister to publish the report of the commission he set up to inquire into the subject of drug abuse in Ireland.  I did not mention this the last day because I was speaking on the drug situation in a detailed way, but I am sure that the people the Minister has appointed to this commission have compiled some very interesting facts and made some suggestions for tackling this problem.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker compared cigarette smoking with smoking marijuana.  I do not think it is right&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will agree with me&mdash;to compare the known with the unknown. We know that cigarette smoking is injurious to health.  We know that many beds in our hospitals are taken up by people suffering from the effects of cigarette smoking.  These are not limited to sufferers from lung cancer but from many other illnesses.  To compare cigarettes with a drug about which very little is known is not completely accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very little is known about marijuana and conflicting reports come in.  One of the latest reports is from Oxford. No doubt the Minister has it.  According to that, marijuana can be a dangerous substance which could endanger health <Col N="1573" /> and it can be stored up in the body. Their investigations were made possible because of a grant of £10,500 by the Medical Research Council in England.  We have no such research into our drug abuse problem in this country.  We have a terrible problem among younger people here the vast majority of whom are suffering under-lying personality disorders.  There is also an overriding sociological factor in that either one or other of the parents is missing, dead or suffering from alcoholism.</P>
    <P>Following appeals by Deputy L'Estrange in 1966 and by Deputy Clinton in 1968 an effort was made to nip the problem in the bud.  Appeals also are still being made to do something about drug abuse.  In the city of Dublin some effort is being made to deal with this problem but something should be done for the country as a whole because the problem is not confined to Dublin.  It is a problem which recognises neither social status nor creed.  The problem was not fully appreciated in the United States until it emerged from the Negro and Puerto Rican ghettoes into the upper and middle class areas.  In that country there were 1,050 deaths from drug abuse last year.</P>
    <P>We know the efforts made in St. Dympna's Home on the North Circular Road were fruitless.  Out of the total number of patients treated there only one could be described as having been cured.  I do not know if the cure is permanent.  I should like to criticise the efforts which have been made to set up an outpatient treatment centre in this city.  I am speaking of the centre in Jervis Street Hospital.  Here we are repeating what has happened in Piccadilly Circus in England.  This is a central meeting point for drug addicts on a purely voluntary basis.  It is a meeting place at which they can discuss the latest sources of drugs.  The service is inadequately staffed and no adequate treatment is available.  Verbal advice is available there but no concrete medical treatment.  It is an information centre and it is a centre for passing drugs, similar to Piccadilly Circus.  Numerous people who attended there stated that and are not impressed by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that in this city there are many minor sub-culture migrant groups which form the major part of the drug taking section in the population.  We also have information, or there are indications from drug abusers, to the effect that LSD is being manufactured in this city.  I should like the Minister to tell me in his reply whether there is any law against the manufacture of LSD in this country or whether there is any law against the growing of marijuana in this country. It is only a short time ago since the only law which prevented one person from selling drugs to another was the lack of a 5s hawker's licence.</P>
      <P>The majority of teenagers who were treated in St. Dympna's clinic were between the ages of 14 and 19.  These minor sub-cultural migrant groups could in a way, as has been mentioned to me, be compared with an organisation similar to the resistance movement. They will travel from country to country and help people of their own sub-cultures who have got into trouble with the law, who have gone into hospital and who are in some way affected by our social standards.</P>
      <P>The hippies of this country, which the gardaí recently confirmed exist, use two main types of drugs&mdash;marijuana and LSD.  Both of these drugs are readily available in this country.  Recently it was reported to me that a certain individual walked into a public-house with over £100 worth of LSD tablets in a matchbox.  The reason he had gone over to peddling LSD instead of marijuana was that he could carry £100 worth of LSD in a matchbox but for the equivalent amount of marijuana he would have to carry a big brown parcel under his arm.  It is not for me to say what the dangers of LSD are They are well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a tragedy the Minister has not given a grant to a team of responsible people composed of a psychiatrist, a psychologist and some lay person, duly qualified, to do some reserch into the drug addiction problem <Col N="1575" /> here instead of tackling it in the amateurish way in which they are forced to do it because they have not got the funds to launch any good investigation.</P>
    <P>There are a reported 2,700 addicts in the North of Ireland.  Down here, where we have over twice the population, the reported number is something in the region of 300 to 400.  I would like the Minister to set up a register of drug addicts not that it will give us any true statistics but at least it will keep us in line with other countries and we will not have people going around saying there is no drug problem here.  I hope we will never adopt the indifferent attitude which the British adopted some time ago when they reported that they had only about 400 drug addicts and now they have reported that almost 40,000 people in England are habitual smokers of marijuana.</P>
    <P>There are only two countries which have come to grips with the problem of drug addiction.  Russia introduced the death penalty and inside of two months they had completely reduced their drug problem as an undermining factor of their society.  Japan introduced compulsory imprisonment for drug pushers and drug users.  Inside a year the admission to hospital of drug abusers dropped from 200,000 people in one year to only 300 the following year.  In South Africa they are taking steps in their Department of Justice to deal with this problem.  But here we have little or no legislation and what we have is totally unsuitable to deal with the ruthless drug pusher who initially came here as a draft dodger from the US or from England and has begun to push these mind polluters and hallucinogenic drugs amongst our teenagers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come to something which has been occuring over the past two years in the Ballymun area.  The incidence of admissions to casualty departments of women suffering from overdosage of everyday tranquillising drugs has increased fourfold. I believe we are not far away from having a new, defined syndrome in our medical textbooks, the Ballymun syndrome, when these women are unable to cope with conditions prevailing in their society.  Perhaps it is only a gesture when they take these over-doses but it has resulted in increased admissions to north city hospitals and also resulted in an increase in emotional diseases in families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that it is tragic that we have more gardaí involved in tracking down poteen distillers than in attempting to track down drug pushers.  I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 13th January, 1971 that the gardaí are helpless in the drugs crisis and that Ireland is in the throes of an alarming new outbreak of drug smuggling and peddling on a big scale.  Evidence has been compiled showing that there are five drug pushers in the city of Dublin, located in Dalkey, Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Whitehall, Finglas East-Cabra.  Their names are readily available to the gardaí but in many cases they are powerless to act. In many cases it is fruitless to act because apart from the new compulsory unit opened in association with Dundrum Mental Hospital in the old residence of the medical superintendent, there are no facilities.  This is the only suitable clinic we have after practically a five-year campaign.  Apart from being urgently needed this clinic is totally inadequate if the drug abuse crisis continues. There is one way of stopping it and that is to impose a life sentence or a death sentence on a person who is completely normal, physically and mentally, and who has no defects and <Col N="1577" /> is not addicted himself to drugs but is doing this solely for cash.</P>

      <P>This is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health.  My constribution is directed towards the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  I will have further to say when the report of the commission on drugs is put before this House.  Perhaps the Deputy will then learn something of the problem. It is unfortunate to see elected representatives who do not appreciate that we have a very severe problem in this country in regard to drug abuse and that no effort is being made to tackle it.  We have more gardaí involved in the detection of poteen than we have in tackling the drug problem. Poteen itself is not nearly as harmful as some of the drugs which have been peddled around this city, particularly among the workingclass people, whom I am particularly concerned about.  The rich people can buy themselves out of trouble but those other people cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the other end of the scale, namely the aged people in our society for whom there is inadequate accommodation and facilities.  I would like to see an increase in the number of geriatric hospital beds which would give those people an opportunity of living out their lives in some peace and contentment and not in the bitter frustration in which many of them are now forced to live.  In the rural areas many of those people are forced to end <Col N="1580" /> their lives in country homes and in Dublin they have to end their lives in psychiatric homes.  They are becoming bitter with us and with the world.  It is not right that those elderly people should have to form queues for this, that and the other.  I hope the Minister will release the report which the drug commission have brought in as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, first of all, that I was shocked and amazed when I saw the report of last week's Dáil Debates in the papers where Deputy Dr. Hugh Byrne referred to the drug problem and exaggerated it out of the imagination which he undoubtedly has got.  He said there was widespread drug abuse in the Dingle Peninsula.  I want to refute in the strongest possible way what the Deputy said.  I want to put on the record of this House that there is not such a problem in the Dingle Peninsula.  It is very wrong of a Deputy to come into this House and make unwarranted and unfounded allegations against harmless people in the Dingle Peninsula.  Those allegations have already done untold harm to that area.</P>
      <P>I may be moving away from the Supplementary Estimate but I want to tell the people of this country, and particularly the people who send their children to the four Irish colleges in my area, that we have no drug problem in that area and there are no drugs grown there.  The gardaí have already confirmed this.  When people are elected to responsible positions they should not come into this House and abuse people. It is about time that Deputy Byrne stopped hounding people.  He should not have mentioned that there were two hippies living in Annascaul who were growing this drug.  Those are innocent people who have come in to the Dingle Peninsula and are not doing harm to anybody.  They live their own way of life and have been accepted by the neighbours there.  It is wrong for anybody to point a finger to them and say they are suspicious people, that they are undesirable, when they are more or less integrated into the community. We should live and let live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the papers will give this short speech of mine the same publicity as they gave when they highlighted the <Col N="1581" /> speech of Deputy Hugh Byrne last Friday.  If people have a weakness for drugs it is sympathy they should get not death penalties or anything else. It is a sad state of affairs in an Irish Parliament when we hear the death sentence being suggested for people who for some reason of their own have strayed off the straight and narrow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said that when the film &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo; was being made in the Dingle Peninsula this drug abuse started.  It is a well-known fact that Deputy Byrne visited the people engaged in the filming of &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;.  He mixed with those people and if he saw drug abuse going on at that particular time, two years ago, that was the time to go to the gardaí and tell them that this drug abuse was going on.  It is very easy to say two years after, when all those actors and actresses, who were so happy in our Peninsula and who gave so much employment, have gone away, that the drug abuse began when they were here.  I hope we will never again witness such an unwarranted attack on people who have no chance of defending themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing here today a Supplementary Estimate for £6,575,000.  I want to say that this is due to the inflationary policy of the present Government through the years. As far as the health charges and the rates are concerned the Government seem to be standing idly by.  I was on a deputation to Dr. Ryan some years ago and he told us that the new health services would put only a few shillings in the £ on the rates.  We know now that in many counties the health services have put more than £2 in the £ on the rates.  I also remember in 1965 when we were told by the then Minister for Health, when the White Paper was introduced, that the charge on the rates for health services was being stabilised.  The blame for all this, as I said, lies in the inflationary policy of the Government.  They were standing idly by taking no action.  If this is allowed to continue, the health service may collapse.  The Minister and his officials have pointed this out in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when Mr. Lemass was <Col N="1582" /> Taoiseach he stated that if in the future the charges increased the Government would cut taxation and they would try to live within their means.  Are Fianna Fáil prepared to make any promise at times in order to get votes?  They made promises in the past but immediately they got back to power they completely forgot the promises they made to the people to get them into power.  In his Budget speech in 1969, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, at column 125 of Volume 240 of the Official Report of 29th April, 1969, said:</P>
    <P>The cost of the health services is rising so rapidly that it is necessary to consider alternative methods of finance in order to reduce the amounts now charged on the taxpayer and the ratepayer.  A detailed examination in being undertaken of the feasibility of introducing an insurance or contributory scheme to finance at least part of the costs of the services available to the middle income group. </P>
    <P>This Budget speech was made before the general election and we know it was made to get votes at the election.  Have Fianna Fáil sunk so low that they are prepared to make any type of speech before a general election in order to get people's votes?  The moment they get back into power they conveniently forget all the promises they made.  We should ask if those promises fell when the Minister fell off his horse.  A promise was made and I quote, &ldquo;to consider alternative methods of finance in order to reduce the amounts now charged on the taxpayer and the ratepayer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since that speech was made instead of reducing the tax on the taxpayer and the ratepayer there has been an increase of over 60 per cent.  Is that how Fianna Fáil keep their promises to the ratepayers and the taxpayers?  The Minister went on &ldquo;A detailed examination is being undertaken of the feasibility of introducing an insurance or a contributory scheme to finance at least part of the costs of the services&rdquo;.  What has happened to the detailed examination that was being undertaken then?  We are entitled to ask that question and I <Col N="1583" /> think the Minister should answer it.  We have been fooled so often in the past with White Papers and statements like the statement made in 1965 about stabilising the rates and a similar statement by the Minister for Health in 1969, but so far nothing has been done. The burden on the ratepayers is becoming very unfair.  They are being crushed with increasing rates, much of which are due to increases in the health service and the inflationary policy of the Government.  If, for example, a doctor gets an increase of £6, the ratepayers pay £3 of that and £3 comes from the Department of Health, but in a month or two the Department of Finance get back 42s in income tax so in reality the State is only contributing 18s and the full burden of £3 falls on the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>We are also entitled to criticise the minimal amount of help given recently to the ratepayers despite the hopes held out by the Minister and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There are grants to help the new health authorities which are known as regional health boards.  Even though I am a member of the local authority I am sorry to have to say that I think the regional health boards a disaster.  As far as the health of our people was concerned, whether it be mental hospitals, pay for nurses, pay for doctors, or anything like that, in the local authority politics were immediately forgotten; all worked as one and, in their own small way, did the best they could for the afflicted section of our community.  But what have we now in the regional health boards?</P>

      <P>It is a Supplementary Estimate of £100,000 and other speakers have spoken at length on it. I am entitled to say that instead of there being a homogeneous unit they are divided.  In my area we held a function at which the Minister and the boards were brought together.  They have met on numerous occasions and we in our region were assured that there were excellent headquarters in Offaly.  After voting us down we find that they had no headquarters, but they had to pay £30,000 to erect new headquarters.  They will have to purchase land, service it and fit the building out and I would say this would cost at least £70,000.  I want to appeal to the Minister to override the decision that has been taken because we in Mullingar can provide them with excellent accommodation at St. Loman's Hospital.  It is ridiculous, with ever-increasing rates and taxation, for an extra £70,000 to be spent in this region.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of the Department and, next year, they will be looking for even more.  If the aim is to deal with the afflicted people in our community we are entitled to find out if that is the aim because on 12th February, 1969, the Minister for Health sent a circular to all local authorities asking that each health authority should examine critically their forecasts of expenditure for the coming year and endeavour to achieve substantial reductions in their projected expenditure.  With the present state of health finances and the demands made on them it would be ridiculous for the Minister to allow expenditure of £70,000 in a region where the facilities are already available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Minister on that, and I think he is to be congratulated on his decision. Deputy Dr. O'Connell raised the question last week of whether a doctor is legally or morally bound to attend an accident.  Within the last fortnight in my own county an accident occurred and of the three doctors who were called two were not available and the third refused to go out and said he was not legally or morally bound to attend. His wife mentioned that they were seldom paid for accident cases.  Apparently there is a snag in the law, and if any person is unfortunate enough to meet with an accident either today or tomorrow no doctor is legally bound to attend to that patient.  I claim they are morally and ethically bound and it is time some arrangement was made by the Minister such as the arrangement whereby doctors are paid a free and in return can be called on by the Garda.  This is something which should be attended to immediately.  In the accident I have mentioned a young English chap was killed and when his friend came to the inquest he was insulted and ordered out.  We are supposed to be a great Catholic country. Some, unfortunately, seem to be more concerned with filthy lucre.  There seems to be little Christianity or charity.  I am sorry to have to say that here.  From 60 to 80 per cent of the medical profession do their work diligently and conscientiously; it is the minority 20 to 30 per cent who err.  Four or five years ago I came on the scene of an accident; a girl had been knocked down by a car.  I called on the doctor and he said he would not go to the accident because he would not be paid.  I had hot words with him and he did come out and attend to the girl.  She was taken to hospital and her life was saved.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately it is not.  I should love to agree with the Minister, but I have known three or four cases in my own county in the last few years in which doctors refused to come out.  The wife answers the phone and says the doctor is not in.  If you ask those involved in accidents how many times they had to phone before they could get a doctor you will find that this kind of thing is happening all over the country, a country that prides itself on its Christianity. It is happening far too often.  I do not like saying these things here, but they must be said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell nearly a year ago raised the question of pillboxes.  I also raised it.  I myself had the experience of seeing a wife put the wrong lids on boxes.  Her husband was suffering from heart disease and, in my presence, she took the lids off the sleeping tablets and the other tablets and replaced them on the wrong boxes.  I took them from her and corrected her mistake. That man was admitted to hospital the next day and was dead within the week.</P>

      <P>That would be a solution.  It was stated recently that 50 per cent of deaths are due to heart disease.  That is a very high mortality rate.  This disease is becoming a scourge.  It is said that we are too lazy, that we do not take enough exercise, that we do not eat the proper food and that we drink too much.  It should be <Col N="1587" /> brought home to the people that it is essential to take sufficient exercise and eat the correct foods.</P>
      <P>Over the years, under successive Ministers, our hospitals have undergone a steady transformation.  Instead of the grim survivals of Victorian days we now have bright new hospitals, fitted with up-to-date equipment.  The Ministers and the Department are to be complimented on the transformation. The only criticism is that waiting-rooms&mdash;this is true of dispensaries also &mdash;are drab and dreary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Byrne dealt with the drug problem.  This problem is worldwide. I was the first to raise it here away back in 1966 and the Minister at the time, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said that he had no responsibility for hysterical newspaper reports or hysterical Deputies. Had something been done then the problem might never have reached its present proportions.  Drug addiction and drug abuse are on the increase.  It was suggested here a year or so ago that there should be a register of drug addicts and that the register should contain photographs.  That could be of tremendous help to both doctors and pharmacists.  Drug addicts are very clever people and they have been known to forge prescriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great precautions were taken a few years ago to deal with foot and mouth disease and all credit is due to those responsible for the steps they took to keep our country free of this scourge. We are faced with a crisis again now but it relates to the destruction of people and not the destruction of cattle. This is a problem which should be tackled by everyone, parents, priests, teachers and all who are interested in the welfare of our society.  Every effort should be made to apprehend the drug pushers and bring them to justice.  I do not recommend the death penalty, but I certainly recommend a salutary prison sentence.  I doubt if enough is being done.  A committee was set up round 14th January, 1969, and on 13th February, 1969, the Minister for Health informed me that, in setting up this working party, he had to ensure that it was of optimum size to enable it to carry out its task efficiently and <Col N="1588" /> quickly.  I think the committee is unduly long in arriving at recommendations. Other countries have dealt with this, America and England.  If they went over to England they could learn from what happened there.  Remember that in 1962 it was stated in the British Parliament that there was no problem there, just as it was stated in this House in 1966.  Unfortunately, this problem is with us and the Minister will get all the help of each and every one of us on this side of the House in trying to adjust these maladjusted people.  The Minister is aware that there are drug parties being held in this city.  People know of them and it should be the duty of anybody who hears about them to give this information immediately to the proper authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate started to be a full-scale debate on the Department of Health, and if every Deputy who had something to say were to speak in the House we would have been here for days and days.  I do not propose to answer all the questions that have been put to me in cases where full answers have come through questions in the Dáil.  Many questions were asked of me and have been answered in the course of the last <Col N="1589" /> six months through Dáil questions.  I see no point in taking up the time of the House when there are many other important Estimates to be considered, matters that are just as vital to the future of the country as are the health and hospital services.  I am trying to keep some kind of consistency in the use of time by representatives of this House in confining my speech to some essentials.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to speak on the financial position that relates to the Supplementary Estimate.  I should like to point out that, for the first time, in the year 1970-71, the Supplementary Estimate included all the increases of remuneration that occurred during the year and that, whereas in former years, that portion that would be paid by the health authorities was transmitted to them and notified to them and formed a debit balance carried over in the ensuring year, on the present occasion the Government have undertaken to pay the whole of the huge increase in remuneration, part of which was due to the twelfth round.  One particular element of it which is non-recurring in the sense that it will not repeat itself on the same scale, was the increased status pay for nurses which I think was well merited and the reduction of hours of work from an 85 to an 80-hour fortnight, which cost £1,150,000.  I might add this forms part of any balance in the accounts for the whole financial year.  If the Government had not taken that action the rates would have gone up another 3s in the £ on average, so the Government did save to the country an increase of 3s in the £ consequent on making this unusual arrangement of taking on itself to pay for the whole of the increased cost of the remuneration.  That is one of the reasons why this Supplementary Estimate is so large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the passing year the Government have contributed about three-quarters of the total cost of the health and hospital services, that is, after making allowance for the grant towards the voluntary hospital deficits.  These payments relate to the taking care of people in voluntary hospitals where the costs are not met through capitation grants from local authorities; the contribution <Col N="1590" /> made by the Minister for Finance for the relief of agricultural rates in respect of the agricultural rates relief required to meet the health portion of the local authority expenditure.  Along with the State grant towards the health services we are paying for three-quarters of the total hospital expenditure.</P>
    <P>That is no comfort to the people who have to pay very high rates.  I am merely mentioning it as a fact, and it really is an illustration of the enormous cost of the health and hospital services in this and every other country. In the passing year the health services will be costing the community something round about £22 per head of the population or, shall we say, for a married man with a family of three children, £110; and although this sum is collected by taxation which bears obviously more heavily on those who are wealthy than on those who have no income, it, nevertheless, presents an enormous burden to the community. No matter how it is paid for whether by rates or by taxes, whether by a 50 per cent contribution from the State, a 55 per cent, a 60 per cent or a 63 per cent contribution from the State, it is an enormous cost.  One of the reasons is the very rapidly growing cost of the hospital services that total between 70 and 75 per cent of the total cost of the health and hospital services combined.  We in common with some other modern European countries are now taking one out of every ten of the population into an acute care hospital other than a mental hospital for some period of the year, long or short, and the numbers of persons going into hospitals are increasing at the rate of 4 per cent per annum.  We do not know when the ceiling will be reached.  I wanted to mention those facts because the position, naturally, is very serious.</P>
    <P>As Deputy L'Estrange pointed out, one of the major reasons for the huge increase in the cost of health and hospital services is just sheer national inflation, and the staffs of the hospitals and the health service cannot be expected not to receive the same increase in remuneration as other sections of the community.  Nevertheless, the situation in regard to this service is highly inflationary because the labour content is about 71 per cent.  A good deal has <Col N="1591" /> been said about inflation in the last four years.  I myself have made many speeches about it, and although all the leading economists and people of all reasonable viewpoints have pointed out over and over again that incomes should increase only at the same rate as productivity, we and other countries have disobeyed the rules.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy L'Estrange I do not know of any democratic country that has been able permanently to control inflation save by agreement of the people and by the consent of the employer and trade union section to moderation in the growth of incomes. There was a compulsory Bill enacted in Great Britain with the provision that salaries and wages should rise by only 3½ per cent and they rose 7 per cent.  When this compulsion ceased there was an enormous out-burst of demands for increases in wages and salaries that have gone on ever since, and the British and ourselves share the melancholy privilege of having, of all European countries, the highest increase in wage costs per unit of output.  We are at the very top of the table.  It is a pity we copy the British in respect of one of their worst habits of life.  It would be good if we could become at least independent of them in that respect.  If the rate of inflation which we have experienced here and which has been experienced in Great Britain and, spasmodically, in other countries, continues for the next eight years, the cost of health and hospital services will double in that time without any increase in the volume of service and without any better services being provided for the people.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the trade unions and employers that when they come together in 1972 to negotiate a new agreement they would examine the indirect effects of grossly excessive increases in wages and salaries on all services.  My Department or the Department of Finance will be quite willing to inform the ICTU and the Federation of Employers at the beginning of 1972 of what are to be the likely effects on the taxes and rates that will be <Col N="1592" /> levied on everybody, very much less on the people at the lower end of the medical card group and very much more on the rich, as a result of any particular specific increase in salaries and wages, having regard to the growth of the economy.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the cost of hospital services will double in eight years if the present rate of inflation continues but we would be in line with respectable countries in Europe if, at the same time, we had completely normal conditions but we could not expect a greater growth in gross national product than something between 4 and 5 per cent per annum.  It is obvious that we simply cannot continue to have huge increases in remuneration that bear no relation to the growth or the cost of production.</P>
    <P>May I add also that the Government are now considering legislation for a contributory insurance scheme.  When this legislation comes before the House, it will not solve the problem of inflation. No matter what we do to replace the form of collection of taxes and rates for the health services to a partial extent by some form of contributory insurance, there will be no difference whatever in the burden that will be placed on the community if inflation continues.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were raised in relation to the health boards.  Now that we have eight regional health boards instead of 27 health authorities, it will be the duty of my Department to ensure that there is sound budgeting procedure.  If we have a smaller number of health boards, it will be possible that budgets be prepared properly and it will be possible for the health boards themselves to control expenditure because, covering a larger area, they can have more specialised officials concerned with finance at the head of the health boards.</P>
    <P>What has been said by a number of Deputies is absolutely correct in so far as that, having faced this enormous inflation, while wanting to provide the best possible service to the community, it will be essential for the health boards to consider how they can avoid unnecessary extravagance and unnecessary cost and how, over a period of <Col N="1593" /> time, they can ensure that the beds available for all classes of patients are used to the best advantage without, in any way, diminishing the human attitude to patients and without diminishing the character of the services offered. This will be the duty of the regional hospital boards, for which regulations will come before the House later, working in conjunction with the health boards.</P>
    <P>I am setting up, in my Department, a work study unit to enable the regional hospital boards to give assistance to hospitals with a view to their keeping their costs as low as possible by reducing, if possible, the amount of movements required of nurses around the hospitals, improving the facilities for nurses and improving the facilities for ancillary staff and, if possible, in order to see whether we can possibly control the cost of hospital services by introducing productivity pay schemes. These have now been introduced in Great Britain for the ancillary staff of hospitals.</P>
    <P>I was asked a question about expenses in connection with the health boards.  The supplementary provision of £100,000 relates to the fees and expenses of McKinsey and Company, the management consultants, which amounted to £63,500.  It also relates to the salaries and expenses of the chief executive officers and the other staff who are being recruited for the new boards and who had to begin their work before the beginning of the new financial year and before the boards come into operation legally on the 1st April.  This amount was £25,000.  The rest of the expenditure is of a minor and unimportant character.</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne raised the question of our attitude towards cigarette smoking. As this matter relates to an item in the Estimate to the extent of £25,000, I wish to say a few words about it. We are studying all the implications of the report prepared by the Royal College of Physicians and we are examining all the recommendations of that report.  Personally, I am pessimistic as to the effect of any large-scale advertising for adults in trying to reduce the incidence of cigarette smoking. When advertising ceased in the United States, a report came through <Col N="1594" /> to the effect that the cessation of advertising did not seem to have had any measurable effect on the consumption of cigarettes.  In a number of the more advanced civilised countries, the consumption of cigarettes is levelling off.  There has been an increase in their consumption by young women but there has been a decrease among other sections of the population.</P>
    <P>I still believe it to be essentially a problem concerning the young.  We must see what can be done to prevent people from smoking in the earlier years of their lives.  I did note from the report of the Royal College of Physicians that some 83 per cent of men who are now smokers began smoking between the ages of 15 and 20, whereas only 40 per cent of the women smokers of today began while they were still within that age group.  The report shows that women began smoking at a later age.  I do not know what the reason for that was. Nevertheless, we intend studying the report.</P>
    <P>The House, and in particular Deputy Dr. Browne, will be aware of the recent statement by the British Minister for Health in relation to examining the possibility of making a formal declaration as to the comparative tar and nicotine content of the various brands of cigarettes being purchased in Great Britain, this having been done already in the United States. We would be unable to do this until somebody had evaluated the research that has been carried out by the Tobacco Council and until some respectable body validates the research on the same brands being smoked here. Obviously, we would have to consider action of a similar nature, drawing the attention of the public to the brands in which tar content is high, but that would be a matter for examination. I mention this as one of the further decisions on the part of the British Government.  It would be impossible for us to do anything about it until such time as we could be certain that the tar and nicotine content of each cigarette relates, in some way, to the danger of smoking.  This will be examined along with all the other proposals of the Royal College of Physicians' Report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> I should say, too, in connection with what Dr. Browne said, that compared with alcohol or the dangerous drugs, nicotine is not a dangerous drug in itself but people die from physical diseases arising from excessive consumption of cigarettes.  That is the challenge that we must meet in so far as we are able.  In addition, it is intended to draw the attention of parents to the example they are setting by smoking, when we are asking their children not to start smoking.  I hope the House approves of the latest campaign to induce young people not to smoke.  Deputies no doubt have seen the first examples of it on television. We have asked people who are famous in the sporting world and who do not smoke to point out the value of not smoking as a contribution to better health and better athletic ability.  The £25,000 is being spent on propaganda largely appealing to young people. There is quite a problem among young people.  In one county, which I shall not name, one in every 12 boys of the age of 12 is a confirmed smoker and one in every three boys of the age of 16 is a confirmed smoker.  I am quite sure this is simply a prestige business. It is just smart to smoke.  I do not believe they are smoking because they are addicted to nicotine.  I do not believe it reaches that level until much later on.  This indicates the importance of getting at young people in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Somebody suggested that the allowance for disabled persons which is paid by county councils is totally inadequate. The increase in the amount for allowances for disabled persons, £400,000, was decided at the last Budget and it represents an increase of about 11 per cent in one year.  Of course we would all like to raise the social services as rapidly as possible but an 11 per cent increase in one year in this disablement allowance at least is a help.  At a later stage, whenever it is financially possible, I hope to introduce into the Dáil a measure to exclude the income of anyone but the husband and spouse in a household in assessing the means for allowances to disabled persons.  That will have to be done when the financial <Col N="1596" /> position is more satisfactory but at least the total vote was increased by 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also raised the question of alcoholism as did other Deputies.  We have shoved this under the carpet for far too long.  We have the second highest record of alcoholism in Europe.  There again it is very difficult to know what we can do about it.  I have asked the Department to ask the National Council for Alcoholism to collaborate with the new health boards and to appoint for every health board a very highly trained social worker whose sole responsibility will be to give lectures on the subject of alcoholism, to bring Alcoholics Anonymous branches, the doctors, the existing social workers, the public health nurses and the whole community into closer contact with each other and to give lectures to any association that asks for them, to get them to speak to industries, with the consent of the trade unions to speak to the workers and to point out the enormous sum lost in wages and productivity apart from the misery occasioned in homes.  I hope these social workers will be able to do good work aided by all the existing associations that can be found in every part of the country that are preaching temperance or preaching teetotalism of one kind or another, that the social workers will act as a liaison between all those who want to consider this subject.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously we must take this question from under the carpet.  I hope all the Deputies of this House when they meet somebody who will say to them: &ldquo;So-and-so is not looking after himself too well&rdquo; will say that this is a very human way of putting the truth but that it is time we stopped talking like this about people who are alcoholics and will immediately draw attention to the appalling social evil that alcoholism constitutes in this and in every other country.  It is a very serious problem and this easy attitude, exemplified in that simple phrase, which no doubt carries a very human association with it, means that people are not looking at the realities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne asked about the Professor of Forensic Psychiatry.  I <Col N="1597" /> am doing my best.  I hope the Local Appointments Commission will report on what they intend to do about the appointment of the Professor of Forensic Psychiatry as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to start a State ambulance service and I do not intend at the moment to ensure that a doctor travels with every ambulance to the scene of an accident.  I do not think it is a practical scheme.</P>

      <P>I will not reply to any of Deputy Dr. Byrne's questions to me. Deputy Dr. Byrne has been speaking in the manner of a cheap novelette and I hate to criticise people in the House. His exaggerations, his innuendoes, his inaccuracies are just to me utterly woeful.  A great deal of what Deputy Byrne said should be immediately communicated in the form of facts to the Garda Síochána or in the form of facts to the local health authority and he should get his facts properly examined before he comes to this House with his ghastly nonsense.  I will not reply to any of his questions.</P>
      <P>I replied to Deputy Dr. O'Connell on the thalidomide question.  If there is any change in the situation he can ask me a question again.  I also replied in the Dáil on the subject of visiting hours in hospitals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell referred to hospital development.  He perhaps did not recall a speech I have made on a number of occasions in which I said that the regional hospital boards should be responsible for research and evaluation of what requires to be done for the reorganisation of the hospital system and for co-ordination and integration between voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They will also be serviced by the elaborate survey now being prepared by the medical social board, a hospital in-patient survey from which we will learn fairly accurately the numbers of persons suffering from every malady in every hospital in the country, the length of time they stayed there, the length of time before investigation, and other facts that will enable us to see how we can deal with growing specialisation and how we can utilise to the best of our ability the modern techniques and modern paramedical equipment.</P>
      <P>The regional hospital boards will naturally have to be in touch with the health boards.  The regional hospital boards will also have to report to me on the siting of those general hospitals proposed in the FitzGerald Report where there is some doubt or where there is some element of controversy. Mercifully for myself the location of these general hospitals in the western part of the country is quite evident&mdash; Letterkenny, Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee.  The development of Galway Regional Hospital was self-evident and the development of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda was self-evident. Apart from that there is a great deal of controversy about where the rest of hospitals should be and I will have to get advice from these boards in regard to this matter before making the correct decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dr. O'Connell that it is absolutely essential to develop out-patient clinics on a more elaborate basis, to increase the out-patient consultant service in the hope of keeping people out of hospital with a consequent saving of cost and far better health for the community.  We are also examining in that connection whether the cost benefit analysis involved gives a favourable answer to the question: if you could construct, in connection with hospitals where there is a space around, inexpensive hostel accommodation for out-patients and provide therein a service which would be much less expensive than the elaborate service <Col N="1599" /> required in a hospital where people are actually undergoing treatment, whether you could not save a great deal of money for the community and at the same time ensure an even better service for the patients concerned.</P>
    <P>I have given full particulars of the child health service and if any Deputy would like to have a fuller statement about it I would be glad if they would ask me a question.  I have admitted quite publicly that the dental service in my view is a low priority, that it is slowly improving, that it is still deficient and I have already told the House in reply to parliamentary questions the number of extra sessions that have been provided each year and the number of extra full time dental officers that have been appointed to the health boards.  I have informed the House that the salaries paid to the full time dental officers now compare reasonably favourably with those paid in England but that there are vacancies that have not been filled in various parts of the country and we are going slowly ahead with the dental service.  I am absolutely frank in saying that it is not a high priority this year either even if I were able to get dental officers to serve in districts where appointments are vacant.</P>
    <P>If anyone feels the inspection of food premises is defective in any particular place I should be glad if they would ask a question about it in the Dáil.  I am told the health inspection system is reasonably efficient.  I have to decide appeals in Dublin and as a result I read a great number of cases in which premises have been found defective. It seems to me that the rules of the Dublin Corporation inspectors are reasonably strict.  I am not sure if we could do better; it is partly a question of getting necessary staff.  I think there has been a big improvement but if Deputies feel the system is defective in any way they have a duty to question me about it, either privately or in the House.</P>
    <P>We are negotiating with the Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union on the choice of doctor.  We have examined the analysis of reasons why there was a contrary vote in the <Col N="1600" /> ballot on the proposals.  We are taking some of the reasons which seem most important, subjecting them to examination and negotiating with the association and the union.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange asked what we were doing about heart disease.  The Irish Heart Foundation is doing splendid work, as Deputies know, giving lectures throughout the country which have attracted great interest.  I hope to do some publicity out of the token Vote provided for publicity in the next financial year on this subject.  We are developing health education and the total amount to be spent on it in the coming year will be a record figure. As the House knows, there is the Mediscan experiment which is extremely valuable and in which volunteers are asked to go before a team of doctors to find if they are prone to coronary thrombosis.  I am very interested in this research and if anybody could prove to me that three years later a considerable majority of the people who were warned on their condition were keeping to a regime, I should have to consider if we could find the money to make the screening service a national one.  There is still a good deal of controversy about this in research circles but the Mediscan experiment is bringing out the facts about what percentage of the population is prone to coronary thrombosis. Later we shall learn whether people who are warned are physically and morally sufficiently strong to keep to the proposed regime because otherwise the screening would be a ghastly waste of public money.</P>
    <P>Because of Dr. Byrne's ludicrous talk about drug abuse in this country and his exaggeration of it, I want to say in conclusion that I have accepted all the proposals of the Working Party on Drug Abuse in the interim report and I shall examine the remaining proposals, the most important of which relate to education and publicity, as rapidly as possible.  I think I have answered every question not already answered in the form of answers to parliamentary questions in the past six months.</P>

I agree we probably shall need a health education council eventually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people certainly seem to be concerned about the use or abuse of this institution at present. I do not say it is true but some people have suggested that Dundrum is a dumping ground for criminals or people the State want to put away quietly.  It is suggested that people are sent there as a matter of convenience and, like Deputy Barry, I should welcome a statement from the Minister on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happened to see the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme.  I do not want to criticise those in charge of the institution <Col N="1602" /> but to me the people in charge seemed to be past their best years of service.  In this institution which deals with many different types of people I think younger, efficient doctors and people in charge are required, people who would use more efficient and up-to-date methods.  As a member of the health authority in Westmeath, I find a great difference in the methods of doctors.  In an example we had last week we found one old doctor over retiring age had 550 patients, medical card-holders, and his bill was £225.  In an adjoining area a doctor who had 70 more patients had a bill for £2,400. The younger doctor makes better and more efficient use of the newer drugs on the market.</P>
    <P>Many people are very concerned about the number of escapes recently from Dundrum and many old people, especially women living close to the institution, are in fear of their lives. There have been two escapes in the last two months, I think.  After the first escape &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; published a photograph four days after the escape showing the rope ladder by which the patients escaped still dangling from the wall.  There is something wrong there. The Minister explained the last escape very fully to the House and it was due to some builders leaving a ladder against a wall.</P>
    <P>A few moments ago the Minister dealt with inflation.  We are faced in this Estimate with the same problem and in all other Estimates.  The ratepayers and taxpayers have limited resources. Many are at their wit's end. All these increases, as the Minister knows, are affecting the growth of the economy.  The ratepayers and taxpayers are punch drunk.  They are grievously affected by increasing taxation.</P>

We have here money for wages and we are entitled to give our opinion.  I think those at the top of the ladder should stay where they are for the present and allow those at the bottom to get a greater share of the national cake.  I think I am entitled to say that the percentage increases given to certain officials are completely wrong in my opinion.  If you give a 10 per cent increase to a man with £4,000 he gets £400 a year, bringing his wages up to £4,400 and if you give the same increase to a man with £1,000 a year he gets only £100 bringing his wages up to £1,100.</P>

Due to the fact that they are not giving this example taxation and rates are increasing year in year out in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This institution has been in existence for a hundred years. Comments were made about it in the Report of the Commission on Mental Illness in 1966.  The comments were universally unfavourable.  This hospital should serve a remedial or rehabilitation function for people who are there. I believe the Department of Health, who are directly responsible for this institution with the Department of Justice, have been particularly neglectful and completely complacent in their failure to implement the recommendations of the commission in regard to this hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessors have frequently dismissed the need to make any change in this hospital on the plea that when the joint authority took over it would then be a matter for the Dublin Health Authority, and the regional board.  That shows an extraordinary lack of responsibility by the Department of Health because the recommendations were the recommendations of a very authoritative body of <Col N="1605" /> distinguished psychiatrists from this country and abroad.  I gather from reading the commission's report that there was a very definite sense of urgency in regard to the need for changing the conditions in the Dundrum Central Mental Hospital but no significant changes have taken place.  I want to emphasise in relation to the therapeutic standards in the hospital that I do not suppose they are any worse or any better than those in any of the other prisons or custodial institutions in the State.  I am not inferring any criticism whatever of the three psychiatrists who are in charge of the hospital.  I simply say that they have not been provided with a team of specialists, trained psychiatrists in forensic psychiatry, psychologists, psychiatric social workers and nurses with special forensic nursing training.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why these remedial changes have not taken place since 1966.  The Minister has repeatedly said that people would not take the posts advertised.  He seemed to feel that because it is taken over by the Dublin Health Authority in some remarkable way this will all be changed and people will go to work there.  I should like to know his reasons for this assumption because he knows the very great difficulty about recruiting psychiatric service personnel at the present time. The institution is staffed to a dangerously high level with temporary psychiatrists who move around frequently, who certainly have no sense of continuity in their work and that is particularly important in this sphere.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this are well known to the Minister.  There is dissatisfaction with the conditions of service generally.  The Minister must also know that matters are coming to a head between the medical union and himself and between the association and himself.  Both bodies are very disturbed at the continuing deterioration in the quality of service in the mental hospitals generally.  It is very difficult to get people to work in this kind of hospital.  The work is of a type which will not appeal to many people for obvious reasons and, therefore, the Minister will probably have to make a special case for the Dundrum Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> Why is it that the Minister was unable to take the same action in regard to anticipating the take-over by the regional board which he took in regard to the setting up of the drug centre at Dundrum?  He went to some trouble to have staff recruited for this drug centre so that there would be no delay once the take-over and the amalgamation took place.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department appear to display apathy or indifference to the conditions for people in this hospital.  It is because of the absence of remedial therapeutic facilities there&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;remedial&rdquo;&mdash;that I have protested here on a number of occasions about a young man, and the Minister knows to whom I am referring, who is in this hospital on charges of incendiarism, and if he is to stay in Dundrum, in fairness to him and his unfortunate family, he should have access to whatever services might help him to recover from the illness from which he is suffering and allow him, when he does leave the place, to be normal in every way.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that if he is to go through the long and difficult machinery of the Local Appointments Commission to make appointments, it will be a long time before he will have a staff in this hospital.  Has the Minister any specific plan or have any recommendations been put to him which would give us some hope for these unfortunate people in this hospital?  I take the view that they are all people who are ill&mdash;I do not accept the concept of criminality at all&mdash;and need medical help.  The longer this is delayed the more difficult it will be to help them.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say a little bit more as to precisely what kind of person will be kept in this hospital. For instance, I am rather doubtful about the idea of drug addicts being sent to Dundrum.  The whole project seems rather vague.  Apparently they will go there and even though they may be admitted as voluntary patients they may be kept there.  I am not quite clear about the conditions under which they may be kept there.</P>
    <P>The Minister must know enough <Col N="1607" /> about drug addicts to know that if they do not want to stay, unless they are on a temporary form of committal, they simply cannot be kept there.  What proposals does the Minister have for seeing that a drug addict who is considered to require this kind of custodial care, but does not opt for it himself, receives it?  If the Minister decides to make a person who comes in voluntarily a temporary patient in the hospital, which means the person would not have the right to leave if he wished to do so, the Minister is interfering with the very important principle of voluntary admission to a mental hospital.  It is very important to maintain the certainty that a person who voluntarily goes into a hospital may leave if he wishes to do so unless he is either homicidal or suicidal and must be kept for that reason.  It is essential to maintain a patient's right to leave, even with this legally debatable right to hold him for an additional 72 hours after he has given notice that he wishes to leave.  The Minister must understand that what are involved here are the two approaches to the question of drug abuse in society, whether one tries to encourage people to come for treatment by making conditions of treatment so attractive, which is very difficult, because drug addicts usually do not care so long as they get their drugs, but certainly conditions should not be unattractive so that they will continue to undergo whatever care or treatment is required to make them well again.  A number of States in the United States tend to isolate the drug addict in his own interests and the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>The difference between these two approaches is that in the second the illness is driven underground.  The youngster makes certain he is not caught and consequently the problem becomes a particularly difficult one.  In relation to the people who try to encourage drug addicts to come for voluntary care the hope is that they will not be frightened underground and that the relationship between the psychiatrist treating the drug addict and the addict is a trusting relationship rather than the psychiatrist acting as a kind of jailer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> This brings up the question of registration and whether one accepts that the addict&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to point out to the Deputy that the drug addiction unit in Dundrum hospital does not come under the Central Mental Hospital Vote and I am not briefed today to deal with it.  The Deputy can ask a question after the Recess on what exactly the treatment will be.  I am not briefed to deal with the drug addiction unit in the Governor's house at Dundrum.  I am only dealing with the Central Mental Hospital for persons who have been committed either by the Minister for Justice or by myself under the relevant parts of the Act.

I would like to know that he is clear in his mind about the risks he may start if he goes ahead with this idea. I was hoping he would be able to tell us much more about the question of the drug addiction centre because there are serious dangers: the question of one of the youngsters deciding something and word getting around misrepresenting the reality; the fact that the Minister has a number of voluntary centres where he is going to treat drug addicts, and word might get around that a drug addict will be sent to Dundrum for six months if he goes to Jervis Street or Uusher's Quay for treatment.</P>

He must make up his mind whether he is going to adopt either the cumulative approach or register drug addicts and give them their drugs, maintenance doses and so on, as adopted in Great Britain.  The Minister, I think, owes us some explanation or some indication of what he has in mind for the hospital.  Now that its status is going to be altered will it take in the same kind of patient under the same kind of conditions or will the Minister change the status of the patient in line with the change in the status of the hospital?  Heaven knows, he has had long enough to make up his mind.  The recommendations were made in 1966.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £8,730,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants. </P>
      <P>The original Estimate for my Department for the current financial year amounted to £64,158,000.  This Suppletary Estimate for £8,730,000 now before the House is required to provide for the cost in the current financial year of the extensions and improvements in our services announced in the 1970 Budget and enacted by the Social Welfare Act, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total estimated requirement for social welfare for 1970-71 is nearly £73 million.  This represents only the amount which the Exchequer must provide <Col N="1610" /> to meet its share of the cost of social welfare services.  To arrive at the total cost of these services it is necessary to take into account the estimated expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund, the Occupational Injuries and &ldquo;Wet-Time&rdquo; Funds and certain expenses incurred by other Departments in the administration of our services.  The total for the current year then comes to more than £115 million, which is a very substantial expenditure indeed.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the amount to be voted this year is nearly £73 million.  This is £13,380,000 more than the total voted, including Supplementary Estimates, for 1969-70.  The main reason for the increase is, of course, the cost of the 1970 Budget improvements which included increases in payment rates and the introduction of new services.  In addition, extra cost arises from the fact that the 1969 Budget increases operated for the whole of the current year as against part of the year 1969-70 and, finally, there is a continuing upward trend in the numbers qualifying under the various schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be interested in the progress of new social welfare schemes introduced during the year.  The new scheme of social assistance allowances for deserted wives came into operation on the 1st October, 1970.  The allowance is payable to a woman who has been deserted by her husband, is under 70 years of age, or, if under 50 years, has at least one qualified child, satisfies a means test and a simple residence test.  The scheme generally is modelled on the scheme of non-contributory widows' pensions, the rates of the weekly payment and the means tests being the same under both schemes. The conditions which must be satisfied before a woman can be regarded as having been deserted by her husband have been laid down in regulations. The scheme is designed to deal with cases of well-established desertions when the wife is unable to obtain any support from her husband.  Further, it provides primarily for deserted wives with families and those who by reason of age cannot readily obtain employment.</P>
    <P>My Department has, so far, received <Col N="1611" /> a total of some 1,850 claims for deserted wife's allowance of which approximately 1,150 were successful and some 400 were rejected for one reason or another&mdash;means in excess of the statutory limit, failure to satisfy the prescribed conditions concerning desertion or being under 50 years of age and not having a qualified child residing with her.  As I said, when the Social Welfare Bill was before the Dáil last year, it was originally intended that the new allowance would cover only mothers of families which had been deserted, and elderly deserted wives without dependent children, who may find it difficult because of their age to obtain employment.  However, the operation of the scheme is being kept under review with a view to its improvement in any way which experience may indicate is desirable.  I have particularly in mind the question of the qualifying age limit of a deserted wife without a dependent child.</P>
    <P>The retirement pensions scheme for insured persons who have reached age 65, who satisfy prescribed contribution conditions and who have retired from employment, also came into operation on 1st October, 1970.  The contribution conditions are similar to the conditions governing the old age (contributory) pension scheme but are applicable at an age five years younger.  The scheme allows a pensioner although retired from full employment to engage in noninsurable employment, for example self-employment or employment of inconsiderable extent.  For persons aged 70 or over no restriction in regard to engaging in employment applies.</P>
    <P>Some 5,000 retirement pension claims have been received to date, of which almost 3,000 were successful.  About 550 claims were rejected because of failure to satisfy the contribution conditions and in 750 cases it was found to be more advantageous financially for the claimant to continue claiming one of the other benefits available to him.</P>
    <P>Invalidity pension is payable to an insured person who is permanently incapable of work and who satisfies the contribution conditions.  The rate of invalidity pension is the same as the standard rate of disability benefit and <Col N="1612" /> increases are allowed in respect of an adult dependant and children up to the age of 18 years.  The number of persions to whom invalidity pensions have been awarded since 1st October, 1970, when the scheme came into operation is over 12,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have recently seen an announcement in the newspapers that the European Code of Social Security was ratified on behalf of the Government. The Code is an international instrument which was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1964 with the object of setting higher standards of social security protection than those set by the 1952 International Labour Convention concerning Minimum Standards of Social Security, which has also been ratified by Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the Code the prescribed standards of protection are of two kinds: benefits must be available to prescribed classes constituting a minimum percentage of employees or residents and the levels of benefits must be not less than defined minimum standards.  For ratification, compliance with minimum standards is required in at least six branches of social security. Ireland has accepted the obligations of the provisions of the Code relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, old age benefit&mdash;which counts as the equivalent of three branches&mdash;family benefit and survivors' benefit.  We are the eighth of the seventeen member countries of the Council of Europe to ratify the Code, the others which have already ratified it being Belgium, Britain, Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of this sum of £8,730,000 has already been spent. While the increases to which the Minister referred were given to social welfare recipients last August and October they have unfortunately been eroded because of inflation, spiralling prices and a rising cost of living.  The impact of these on social welfare recipients has been particularly severe. Before the forthcoming Budget is introduced the Minister should consult with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to ensure that he will get <Col N="1613" /> much more money for the less well-off sections of our community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann being conscious of the grave hardships being suffered by widows because of the quite inadequate social welfare services available to them and their orphan children, calls on the Government to take immediate steps to provide a comprehensive social welfare code for widows and their families so that their standard of living will not be lowered by the death of family breadwinners. </P>
      <P>We who signed this motion perfectly understand that the State cannot be expected to provide lavishly for everyone. We recognise fully that funds are not unlimited and that budgetary consideration cannot be ignored.  However, we also recognise that many of the 126,000 widows with their families in this country are living at starvation level.  There is an urgent need that their case be investigated fully.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of going into details about the grief and loneliness that is unfortunately the lot of Irish widows.  Undoubtedly it is hard on them when they lose the breadwinner of their family, but very often they have young families to rear and the loneliness and the hardship is not helped by the benefits given to them under the social welfare code.  When a man dies and leaves a widow with five or six children we immediately have a great deal of sympathy for that family.  Very often in those cases the funeral is a very big one and sympathy is displayed all round.  Unfortunately for the widow and her children this sympathy does not last long and they have to face a hard, stiff world when the funeral is over, depending on the entirely inadequate benefits the State provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the poverty and the agonising pressures these people <Col N="1614" /> must undergo.  Under the present code a widow with eight young children&mdash; and this is not uncommon&mdash;is given an allowance of 22s per person per week.  Is it possible in these days of spiralling costs to exist on 22s per week or 3s 2d per day?  Everybody in this House and in the community will undoubtedly come up with the same answer, that it is certainly not possible to live on that allowance.  The pity for those people is that we are all allowing that situation to continue. We are all part of the community that allows it.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party have put down this motion so that we might do something to ease the appalling hardships that these people suffer.  I do not wish to overstate the case here but wish merely to put the facts clearly and plainly before the Minister so that not only would he be convinced but that he would be able to convince the Government and particularly the Minister for Finance of the hard struggle of this section of our people for survival.</P>
    <P>In regard to the non-contributory widow's pension, a widow who is childless and who has no income receives only £4 5s per week.  If she earns more than £4 15s she will get no pension at all.  It does not do any credit to the Government or the country to ask an unfortunate person to live on such a miserable pittance.  If that widow has children she has an allowance of 15s per week for each child.  Having regard to the fact that childhood in this case extends to the age of 18 years, can anyone tell me how a person is expected to live on that 15s a week?  This is expected to cover all their expenses. I do not see how it can be done.  Only God knows how it is done.</P>
    <P>Then in regard to the non-contributory pension, there is also this anomaly of the means test, so that if the widow with eight children to whom I referred earlier earns over £9 per week she gets no pension.  This is the most appalling aspect of our social welfare code.  When she tries to supplement the assistance given by the State to provide a reasonable living standard for herself and her dependants she is penalised in this way.  The first step is <Col N="1615" /> to have this penal provision abolished from the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>If we look at this another way it should be easy for any Minister for Social Welfare to make a case to his colleague for a vast improvement in this allowance.  Is it not true to say that if one of these children were put into an institution&mdash;and it is easy to imagine several reasons why the children in such circumstances should be put into an institution&mdash;it would cost the State over £8 a week?</P>
    <P>We should give serious thought to this problem, and that is why I raise it in this House in a calm, cool and collected way without blaming the Minister or the Government or anyone in the House.  We are all to blame for allowing this state of affairs to continue. As well as Members of this House, each person in the community must share a certain amount of responsibility for not having insisted many years ago that this should be improved.  I suppose the only reason that the people have not so insisted is that they did not bother to stop and think.  I must confess that it was only after I had been asked to act as spokesman for this party in matters relating to social welfare that I took any personal interest in those problems.  We discussed this matter within Fine Gael and it was decided that we, as a party, would support benefits that we believe to be long overdue to this unfortunate section of our community.  That is why this motion is on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>Many widows who qualify for contributory pensions have young families. They are not, therefore, in a position to take up work but the pensions they receive are inadequate by any standards. Another anomaly that should be removed from the social welfare code is that a widow who is in receipt of a contributory widow's pension but who goes to work even on a part-time basis has her pension added to her income for tax assessment purposes.  The sooner that provision is deleted from the social welfare code, the better for everyone.  Yet another anomaly exists in regard to widows drawing contributory widow's pensions in that if these widows go to work and stamp a card, <Col N="1616" /> they qualify for only half sickness and other benefits.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question some weeks ago with regard to improving the plight of widows, the Minister for Social Welfare gave what I believe was a near record in so far as the length of the reply was concerned.  This was a long and monotonous recital of what the Government have done and we got the hackneyed information that there is a limit to the public purse.  We were told that not only have pensions kept pace with the cost of living but that they are ahead of it.  It is naive to suggest that widows and orphans are getting enough money on which to exist.</P>
    <P>Widows are the most deprived section of the community and because they are so deprived, their children also are. The social welfare code as it applies to them is morally unjust and that is why we are calling for a comprehensive code that will allow for the fair and just treatment of that section of our community.  Recently an association of widows was formed and, possibly, it is that association that has directed the minds of people all over the country to the hardships that many widows must endure.  They are conducting their campaign in a responsible, democratic and intelligent manner.  The Government as well as Fine Gael and Labour must listen to them and the legislation must be changed so that widows can live in some kind of frugal comfort in their own country.</P>
    <P>There are other Deputies who wish to speak on this motion.  Therefore, I shall not detain the House any longer except to say to the Minister in conclusion that if when the Budget is introduced in a month's time, the Minister is able to point to a particular sum of money in that Budget for the benefit of widows, there is no one in this House or, indeed, in the country who would grudge one penny of that money to this very deserving section of the community.</P>
    <P>However, the matter should not rest there.  Having known the present Minister for a number of years, I believe him to be very sympathetic in this matter and I appeal to him, having succeeded in getting increased <Col N="1617" /> benefits in the Budget for widows, to introduce, in the not too distant future, a comprehensive social welfare code that we can all discuss and which, when agreed upon, will ensure that widows and their dependent children will no longer have to endure the hardships that they must endure today.</P>
    <P>In recent times, it is difficult enough for a mother and father together to rear a family but it is very difficult indeed for a mother to do so on her own.  I hope that this problem will be tackled, not in a political way, but in a way that will best serve the interests of widows and their children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  It is a motion that I believe will be considered in a sympathetic manner by Deputies on all sides of the House.  As Deputy Barry pointed out, this is an area of social welfare where reform is very urgently needed.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out also, widows are the most deprived section of our people.  The present level of allowances and pensions in respect of widows is a reflection not only on the Government but on all parties which comprise this Parliament.  This problem must concern every Deputy.  Certainly, it must have led to an examination of conscience by any Deputy who has any social conscience.  Successive Governments have failed to realise the magnitude of this problem and it was not until recently when the widows of this country were compelled to take democratic action and form an association so that they might be in a position to fight for their rights that we woke up to a full realisation of the gravity of the situation.  This problem is a serious one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has come as a shock to most people to find from recent newspaper articles and statements from the widows organisation that there are 126,000 widows in this country.  When this figure of 126,000 was broken down on a regional basis we found that in the city and county of Limerick there are approximately 6,000 widows.  In Wexford one out of every five is a widow.  It is frightening to realise that statistical forecasts show that 72 per <Col N="1618" /> cent of all married women will be widows.</P>
    <P>What are we doing for the 126,000 widows?  We should have a look at the present situation and decide on the areas where we can effect immediate improvements and areas where we can effect long-term improvements. Statistics show that there are 40,000 widows in receipt of contributory pensions and a further 19,000 in receipt of non-contributory pensions.  The contributory pension is £4 10s a week plus 18s for each of the first two children and 13s for the third and subsequent children.  The non-contributory pension is £4 a week plus 15s for each of the first two children and 10s for each child thereafter.</P>
    <P>In this day and age nobody will deny that the present level of widow's pension is totally inadequate.  I am sure every Deputy and every public representative throughout the country is only too well aware of the sad plight of many of these widows, who are compelled to eke out a miserable existence and are living on the rim of starvation.  I can quote numerous examples from my own constituency.  I am sure Deputy Dick Barry, Deputy Dr. O'Connell and, indeed, the Minister for Social Welfare can quote numerous examples of the hardship, the stark poverty, the difficulties with which widows have to contend.  We have begun to realise the national problem that confronts us in this Parliament. The widows of this country have, perhaps, remained silent for far too long.  It is time the conscience of this nation was awakened to the problem and the dire need for immediate attention to this serious social problem. It is time the Government woke up and took appropriate action.  I hope, now that we have an opportunity of discussing the problem and of ventilating the just grievances of these people, that the Government will take whatever action they can take.</P>
    <P>I believe the pensions paid to widows at present are morally unjust and are a scandal in a Christian democracy.  If we have any concept of social justice at all, irrespective of what party we belong to, we must admit that something will have to be <Col N="1619" /> done and that the resources of the nation will have to be reallocated in such a way as to ensure that this most deprived section of our people will get a fair deal.  I believe we have a duty, as elected representatives, irrespective of our party affiliations, to ensure that all sections of our people are entitled, as a matter of right and not of charity, to an adequate standard of living.  I also believe that we have a duty to ensure that this standard of living is not depressed as a result of family bereavement, unemployment or sickness.</P>
    <P>When we apply this concept of community responsibility for social welfare to the situation of the 126,000 widows we see in a dramatic way how we have failed in our responsibility and how the Government in particular have failed in their responsibility to these unfortunate people.  I know the Minister for Social Welfare will point, as he did in a recent very lengthy reply to a Dáil question, to the improvements in the allowances and pensions payable to widows that have been effected under various Fianna Fáil administrations.  The Minister has said that the Government have done their best to give the maximum allowance possible at each Budget.  In my opinion, and I think this will be the opinion of any person with any sort of social conscience, in this particular case what the Minister regards as being &ldquo;best&rdquo; is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barry said, I suppose it is better to approach this in a realistic, factual and unemotional manner but it is very difficult to speak without emotion in relation to the hardship, poverty and difficulties with which these unfortunate widows have to contend. Can any Member of Dáil Éireann in the year 1971 with the colossal inflationary spiral we have been living with over the past couple of years say that £4 10s or £4 5s a week is adequate to provide a reasonable standard of living for any person?  Of course it is not.  On the contrary I believe that this miserable pittance of £4 odd a week is just barely sufficient to keep body and soul together, barely sufficient to keep these unfortunate people from starvation level.</P>
    <P>I hope in the not too distant future <Col N="1620" /> this Government or some other Government will abolish once and for all our existing social welfare code and will introduce a realistic, modern social welfare code which will meet the basic norms of what should be the social policy of any Government in a Christion democracy.  Under our existing appalling social welfare code the widow is the victim of numerous rank injustices. If she is in receipt of a non-contributory pension and goes out to work to supplement it, and if she is a widow with a number of young children she has no option but to go out and work, her small pension is assessed for income tax purposes.  This is an absolute disgrace.  It is totally indefensible and there is no justification for continuing it.</P>
    <P>Again, if a widow who is one of the 19,000 receiving a non-contributory pension goes out to work her position is still worse in that her pension is reduced for every £1 she earns and when she goes over £4 15s a week her pension ceases altogether.  It is time this Government and this Parliament woke up to their responsibilities as regards the underprivileged sections. No section is more underprivileged than the section to which this motion refers.  I have never believed, while I am a Member of the House, in being merely destructive but facts must be stated.  I also like to be constructive and I want to make some suggestions. While I may be out of order in referring to the Minister's statement on the Estimate for Social Welfare I presume I can make a brief comment on the paragraph which is specifically relevant to this motion.  Towards the end of the speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Deputies may have recently seen an announcement in the newspapers that the European Code of Social Security was ratified on behalf of the Government... Under the Code the prescribed standards of protection are of two kinds: benefits must be available to prescribed classes constituting a minimum percentage of employees or residents and the levels of benefits must be not less than defined minimum standards. </P>
    <P>Here is the important point:</P>
    <P>For ratification, compliance with <Col N="1621" /> standards is required in at least six branches of social security. Ireland has accepted the obligations of the provisions of the Code relating to sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, old age benefit&mdash; which counts as the equivalent of three branches&mdash;family benefit and survivors' benefit. </P>
    <P>I presume widows would come in under this category but when the Minister is speaking I hope he will clarify this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We are the eighth of the 17 member countries of the Council of Europe to ratify the Code... </P>
    <P>If we have ratified this Code and if ratification means that we are to bring our social benefits, particularly benefits for widows, into line with European countries, the Minister has a long way to go and a big task to undertake to gear up widows' pensions and other social welfare benefits to European level.</P>
    <P>Now that we are on the eve of the Budget, as Deputy Barry said, the motion is being debated at a good time.  I hope the Minister for Social Welfare will be able to prevail on his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to make the necessary money available to effect at least some alleviation of the hardships, privations and problems with which widows have to contend. In relation to non-contributory pensions, particularly, it is time to have a realistic reappraisal of the means test and bring it into line with the cost of living.  At present a widow receiving £4 15s a week does not qualify for a non-contributory pension.  Out of this amount she must pay rent, provide for food, clothes, light, heat, house maintenance, insurance and so on. This cannot be done.  The first and most important step the Minister could take would be to amend the means test.  Every time I think of that test and every week when I meet a half dozen or more people who are being refused on technicalities in regard to the means test and are having their pensions reduced, it makes me furious. The means test is diabolical and should be abolished.  If the Minister cannot abolish it immediately I hope he will take steps to amend it so as to enable <Col N="1622" /> a reasonable allowance to be paid, particularly to widows.</P>
    <P>There is another problem.  Working widows paying full contributions and in receipt of contributory pensions on their husband's contributions should receive full sickness and unemployment benefit due to them on their own contributions. At present I understand they receive only 50 per cent of the maximum despite the fact that they themselves are paying contributions.  Having looked at welfare codes in Britain and some continental countries I note that in many cases there is provision for a special allowance for widows in the period immediately following the husband's death when the need is greatest. A temporary special allowance is paid for six months after the husband's death to help tide her over what is perhaps the worst period.</P>
    <P>I do not want to monopolise the time of the House.  Deputy Barry has outlined the case pretty well.  I hope the Minister&mdash;this is something he can do immediately&mdash;will look again at the means test in relation to non-contributory widows' pensions.  The Widows' Association of Ireland have submitted a memorandum to the Taoiseach, to the Minister for Social Welfare and to various other Ministers.  They have made representations to Members of this House, including myself.  I do not wish to go into detail about the memorandum but I want to put on record the fact that the association has placed its views before the Taoiseach.  I am sure the Taoiseach has passed on the memorandum to the Ministers most directly involved, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance.  Until we reach the stage where we will have a proper, comprehensive national pensions policy we shall have a continuation of hardship and suffering, not only for widows but for many other categories of pensioners also.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this motion and while he is working out the possibilities of introducing a comprehensive social code for widows and their families to do his utmost to ensure that he will get from the Minister for Finance the maximum amount possible and that he will be enabled in the coming Budget to do <Col N="1623" /> something for the 126,000 people on whose behalf we are pleading here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I say that we most definitely support this motion.  The only criticism we might have is that the motion does not spell out exactly what we want for widows.  I remember that the first question I asked when I came into this House in 1965 concerned widows.  I have been on every year since then about the problem of widows.  As a family doctor I had been aware of the problem of widows for many years before I came into this House.  I have seen widows make sacrifices which people would not think possible.  Widows have been discriminated against and there is no use saying we are all at fault here.</P>
      <P>I indict the present Government for the discrimination against widows in this country.  I asked the Minister for Social Welfare in 1965 if he would introduce an amendment to the Social Welfare Act to provide for widows on the contributory scheme who went out to work.  In the case of those widows who go out to work, if they become ill they get half payment, or if they are unemployed they get half payment.  I saw this as an injustice for years.  The widow with children who goes out to work, if she becomes ill cannot remain ill.  She has to go back to work when she is not fit to return to work. I asked what could be done about this. If a married woman, whose husband is working, goes out to work and becomes ill she gets full benefit.  I asked the then Minister for Social Welfare if there was any provision for this.  He said there was not.  When I asked him why we could not do it he said it would involve changing the 1932 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I brought this matter up again and again but still nothing has been done about it.  Only the Government are in a position to change this.  They have the power to do something about this, but are not prepared to do it.  Those widows are being discriminated against. If any one imagines that widows and their families are living normal lives, I say they are liars.  I have seen those children whom one would regard as deprived <Col N="1624" /> children.  I have seen the medical and social consequences of their plight. When a woman decides to stay at home to mind her family she decides to live at or below subsistence level.  If this widow decides that her obligation to her family is to mind them herself she must make the sacrifice to live at below subsistence level or depend on charity or public assistance.  If she decides that her children must be minded by someone else, she will provide them with their physical wants but she will deprive them of the emotional rights and the emotional security which are due to normal children.  Those are the decisions a widow must make on the death of her husband.</P>
    <P>When widows go out to work to provide for the physical needs of their children those children are emotionally deprived or undernourished.  We talk about human rights in this country, but yet we deprive widows in this way. The Association of Widows is a marvellous thing because it will do more than we do in this House.  You need pressure groups like this.  They should be in force outside the gates of this House, demanding that the Government introduce a proper social welfare code for them.  We in this party who are aware of their problems are crying in the wilderness because our cries are falling on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>We treat widows as second-class citizens, people we do not want to know about.  Their problems can be anybody's problems.  Those people can find themselves overnight in this terrible predicament when their husbands die. We can all salve our consciences by going outside the House and saying, after we have spoken about the plight of widows in this House, &ldquo;We have done our part for them.&rdquo;  This is not good enough.  It galls me to hear the Minister saying, &ldquo;We are all concerned about widows.&rdquo;  If the Minister is so concerned about them he should put pressure on the Minister for Finance and get some money to do something for them.  When I asked the Minister if he would bring in legislation to give the widows a decent living he had a cynical smile but did not do anything.</P>

      <P>This is a motion I <Col N="1625" /> thoroughly agree with.  I am certain all of us are conscious of the hardship and suffering which widows and their families are caused by the inadequacies of the present rates of payment to widows.  The Department of Social Welfare is not giving them the proper status.  This Department is not considered worthy at present of having a Minister in sole charge of it.  This is a Department which requires the attention of a full-time Minister, a Minister of vigour, energy and of the highest intelligence.  People in this country regard the Department of Social Welfare as a Department which is a comfortable one, which can be looked after easily enough, one which can run itself. We must get our priorities right if this country is to be held in the esteem in which it should be held.  The Department of Social Welfare must be one of the key Departments.  We pride ourselves on being a Christian country but the Department of Social Welfare is not afforded the attention it requires.  If the Government do not provide sufficient attention, care, energy and resources to help people in unfortunate circumstances then the country as a whole is failing in its duty.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare requires one of the best Ministers in the Cabinet.  When the present Minister was looking after the Department of Labour as well as the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Social Welfare was thought to be able to look after itself, but this is not so; the Department of Social Welfare needs a Minister to look after it all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in communication with the Department about a widow's pension and the case has dragged on for nearly four months.  The widow in question, whose husband died suddenly, has eight children and she was left without a pension for almost four months.  I received numerous replies and acknowledgments that the matter was being looked into: &ldquo;Fuaireas do litir agus táimid ag feachaint isteach sa scéal,&rdquo; but it took four months to get the matter finalised.  During that time the widow had another tragedy. One of her children was badly burnt.  Fortunately the child lived. <Col N="1626" /> That incident shows the hardship she has had to suffer.  During that time Offaly County Council and the St. Vincent de Paul Society contributed towards keeping this woman and her family together.</P>
    <P>I realise that delays can occur in a Department which has such a vast amount of correspondence and that it takes time for officials to investigate each individual claim and decide whether or not a person is eligible for a particular pension, but I cannot understand how delays of four months can occur.  A complete overhaul of the Department is very necessary.  I do not want to criticise the Department for their failure in this particular matter, but this is not an isolated case.  I know of many cases of delays in administering pensions and payments by the Department of Social Welfare, and some of these delays may be due to insufficient staff.</P>
    <P>A widow who does not receive her pension has to seek credit from shopkeepers until her case has been settled. The strain of living like this must be intolerable.  Her position is bad enough when her husband dies but it is made much worse by having to provide food and shelter for her children while waiting for her claim for a pension to be considered.  The Department should investigate the reason for these long delays and if extra staff is required, the officials should explain the position to the Minister and more staff should be provided.</P>
    <P>With ever-increasing costs the present widows' pensions are not sufficient to keep body and soul together. I recently purchased some meat in a butcher's shop and I was amazed at the price I had to pay for it.  With a pension of £4 5s and approximately 15s for the first and second child it would be impossible for a widow to purchase meat for her family.  It is impossible on the present scale of non-contributory widows' pensions for a widow to buy clothes and all the other things a mother has to buy for her family. A pension of £6 or £7 would be more realistic, but it would still be barely sufficient to keep a widow and her family above the bread line.</P>
    <P>It it a matter for each local authority <Col N="1627" /> to decide whether or not a widow is eligible to pay rates.  I may be somewhat irrelevant in referring to rates but I recently came across a case of a widow with two children, living in a county council house, paying £6 a year rates.  I asked that the rates in her case be waived but I was told that the rates were roughly 4s or 5s a week and this was not a very big sum.  I raised the matter at a local authority meeting and I was told that this woman occasionally worked for a neighbour and she was not therefore entitled to have her rates waived.  Widows with children attending school should not have to pay rates.  A sum of £6 a year may be relatively small in the eyes of Members of this House and others outside it but, to someone living on an income of £200 or £300 a year, £6 can be a lot of money.  Rates should be waived.</P>

      <P>If, in the forthcoming Budget, it is proposed to increase <Col N="1628" /> taxation to alleviate the lot of the weaker sections of our community I want an assurance now from Opposition Deputies that they will vote for that increased taxation, vote with us and not against us.  I make the point now because of our experience in the past.</P>
      <P>I would like to see everybody looked after properly.  I would like to see the standard of living of our people improved.  If I had my way, and our resources could afford it, I would like to see every widow with at least £10 per week and not just the £6 advocated by the last speaker.  We have always bent over backwards to help the weaker sections of our community but we cannot move any faster than our resources will allow us.  We are responsible for introducing widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances, waiver of rates for widows and many other benefits. In County Dublin widows are assisted by the Dublin Health Authority. We do not want to see anyone in our society hungry or in need.</P>
      <P>We are a Christian, democratic party concerned with the welfare of all sections, irrespective of class or creed, and we will continue that policy.  If we fail in that policy our failure will be irretrievable.  I have met a number of widows and I have great sympathy with them.  A woman who loses her husband suffers a very big loss.  If she has no family she is all the lonelier.  These are matters we take into consideration.  It is easy enough in Opposition to say that we will do this, that and the other. I trust our resources will be sufficiently buoyant to enable us to give more assistance in the Budget to those who need assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The waiver of rates has been helpful in the case of a number of widows. Officials may administer the scheme a little stringently but they have to do their job and they are subject to auditors, to the manager and everybody else.  I have made repeated representations for a waiver of rates in the case of widows, old age pensioners and others, not always successfully. Nothing can be done if there is a child working.  The Act has to be administered, but it was a break through in legislation designed to help <Col N="1629" /> the weaker sections of our community. We have done a great deal for widows in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Opposition now that they will support increased taxation for the benefit of the weaker sections of our community.  A widow who works and, having finished working, draws unemployment benefit gets a very small amount because she has a widow's pension.  It would be a great help to her if no reduction were made.  There are details I have discussed at our party meetings, but I do not want to detain the House with these. Both the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan, are giving very serious thought to all these problems.  I admit that in certain cases there may be delay in granting pensions.  This is understandable in a huge Department like this.  The only suggestion I can make is that perhaps more inspectors should be appointed in order to enable the investigation to be carried out more speedily.  The Minister is a humane man and I know he does not wish anybody to suffer unnecessarily.  In County Dublin if we find there is delay in providing a pension for a widow, with or without a family, we try to help her through our welfare society.  I want to take this opportunity of thanking the very efficient staff of the Dublin Health Authority for the humane way in which they consider all these cases, not withstanding the fact that they have to do their duty under the Acts.</P>
    <P>In regard to the employment of widows, the placement officers do an excellent job in placing people in employment. If a widow is living on her own and is unemployed, especially if she is rather young, time hangs very heavily and she would be better off working.  Some of these people get employment themselves and others depend on the placement officers in the Department of Social Welfare to help them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to say that we on this side of the House are all for improving the lot of the widows in so far as the resources of the country allow it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Paddy Burke has inadvertently put his finger on the nub <Col N="1630" /> of the problem.  He seems to think&mdash; and I expect he is speaking for Fianna Fáil&mdash;that if a widow gets home assistance then she is all right.  I know he has a kind heart and I reminded him it would be an unusual thing to have a debate about widows in this House when he would not be present: I met him in the Library and I am glad he came in here because he has made a contribution which has helped to put the matter in the proper perspective.</P>
      <P>What is wrong with the whole code in regard to widows is that the people who have drawn up this code that is in existence and those who are administering it over the years do not seem to understand or do not seem to be anxious to try to understand that there is a very big difference between a widow, particularly a widow with a small family, and any other social welfare recipient.  Deputy Burke's comment that Dublin County Council and the Dublin Health Authority were very generous, were giving home assistance and therefore everything was all right, seems to be the attitude of the Government to this problem.</P>
      <P>Where there is a growing family, where the father is working with a small wage and they are just keeping their heads above water, as so many thousands of families are in this country, and then suddenly the husband dies, apparently it is not understood that, apart entirely from the fact that the source of income ceases, there is another very important aspect which must be considered, that is, what will the widow do to start life again?  If she was employed before she was married, has some experience of employment and has somebody to look after her children, then she may be able to work after a while and at least earn some income which, added to the miserly social welfare benefit which is being paid, may enable her to pay her way; or if she has been working when her husband was ill, as so many of them are, to try to keep the home together, then she will continue to work and still try to keep the family together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, she is suddenly faced with the problem, if she has a family, of trying to rear that family in the way in which youngsters do require to be <Col N="1631" /> looked after, and to bring in enough money to pay for what they need. Goodness knows it is impossible to tell children, particularly those who are used to getting a reasonable amount of good food and fairly good clothing, that suddenly the whole situation is changed and that after a few months when they require a replacement of clothing or shoes, the money is not there to buy them.  The State does not seem to understand that the small amount of social welfare benefit given is not the answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>If, as Deputy Burke says, the widow is older and has no children then most likely she has gone past working or she may be in a part of the country where work is not easy to get; she is then left with a much smaller amount of social welfare benefit.  If her husband was insured then she gets a contributory pension and if she is able to earn a few shillings she can keep it.  If her husband was either self-employed or for any other reason was not insured, then she gets a non-contributory pension, and the gentlemen whom Deputy Burke says he wants more of, the inspectors, will appear.  I do not know why he wants more of them.  I would suggest to the Minister that they should be removed altogether from the scene, because the bane of the widow's life is the inspector who goes around to count the chickens, to find out if there are apples on the apple trees, if by any chance she is earning a shilling more than she said she was earning, to see if she got a spade and dug the garden and put down a hundred plants of cabbage for her family or planted some potatoes.  Then she must have a reduced amount of pension paid to her.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is shaking his head, but I have given instances in this House of this happening and we will produce them again if they are required, because I am sick and tired of looking at the antics of these people who themselves are quite comfortably off and therefore do not require to worry about whether, when they go home, there will be enough food on the table.  It is a disgraceful situation in a so-called christian country that this sort of thing is <Col N="1632" /> allowed to continue, and it is continuing. The widow goes out to work. She has not worked before and she is doing something which she normally would hope she would never have to do.  She earns a certain amount of money and then there is a check-up to find out if what she is earning brings her income over what the State says she is entitled to earn before her pension is reduced.  Therefore the pension is reduced.  If she falls sick or is unemployed&mdash;again Deputy Burke was quite correct&mdash;she pays the full amount for social welfare stamps but she can get only half the benefit because she has a widow's pension.  Again the State says it would be too awkward to have two different rates; it just could not get around this and therefore everybody must be charged the same.  Could anything be more ridiculous?  Does the State not understand, if somebody who is paying 13s a week could get away with half of that, the difference that 6s or 7s would mean to the family at the end of the week?  People who have a good deal of money never seem to understand that there are hundreds, yes, thousands of people in this country who, if they have not the cash with which to buy something, regardless of how important that item may be, must do without it.  At least one Minister expressed surprise here some years ago when I pointed this out to him.  He tried to give the impression that if somebody was short a few pounds, he could go to the bank and get money.  He did not seem to understand that not everybody goes to the bank.  Maybe he had been looking at a Dutch film that was produced some years ago in which parents pretended they had money in the bank so that their children would have a sense of security.  Many people are restricted to a very tight budget.  Perhaps it is unfair to blame the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary for the situation because, on the face of it, they are doing what they think is right. They are merely following in the footsteps of those who went before them.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question some days ago, the Minister emphasised that when increases were given percentage-wise widows received more than was required <Col N="1633" /> to cover the cost of living increase. In effect, what the Minister was saying was that a widow who received an increase of 12 per cent was better off than a worker who, working full-time, received an increase of £2 from the 1st January which amount represented 10 per cent of his wages.  What the Minister forgot was that this was 12 per cent of a very different sum of money.  It is this sort of thinking that is behind the present system of social welfare benefits particularly as they relate to widows and orphans.  The same situation arises in respect of employment. Even in the Civil Service, a widow who goes back to work and who may be doing exactly the same work as her male counterpart, is paid the same salary as a single girl.  Whereas the man who is working beside her will be able to claim for his children, she will not because she is a widow and is regarded as a different sort of human being altogether.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to feel smug after he has given 15/- or £1 extra this year to social welfare recipients and to say that that is much more percentage wise than they would require to meet any increases in the cost of living.  Rather, I would ask him to consider whether the present code is right and, if he decides that it is wrong, then let his name be written in the history of this State as the man who so decided and who took the necessary steps to have it changed.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Burke talked of increases being given within the amount of money available.  We talk about the amount of money that is available for anything but everything depends on whether we want to spend that money for a particular purpose.  If we want to spend it for a particular purpose we must take the necessary steps to get that money by means of taxation or otherwise.  As Deputy Ryan said, it is untrue to say that the Opposition parties have voted against increases for widows or for anybody else.  Many years ago when I first came here, I saw the present Government party voting against the Budget but nobody accused them then of voting against increases for people who were in receipt of social welfare.  Down through the <Col N="1634" /> years, it has been the practice to vote against certain items in the Budget but during the last couple of years in particular when it was stipulated that certain increases were for the purpose of covering social welfare benefits, nobody voted against these even though the taxation required in order to provide that money was considered to be excessive.</P>
    <P>It is unfair that anybody should try to make political profit out of this problem.  It is not a political issue; it is a matter that affects every Deputy. There are widows in all constituencies and these widows vote for various parties and will continue to do so regardless of what decision is reached here. Therefore, it should be quite easy for all parties to agree on a code for widows.  People who are ill or who are unemployed will normally be able to return to work after a period of time but widows, regardless of whether they are young or otherwise, are likely to be dependent on the State for the remainder of their lives.  Not enough interest is taken in this problem by people who are outside this House.</P>

      <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities must find it remarkable that if an applicant for a house happens to be a widow, somebody will say: &ldquo;You know she is a widow and the rent is fairly high,&rdquo; as if the mere fact of her being a widow should necessitate her being treated differently from anybody else.  Very often a person capable of paying a high rent is given the house.  This approach is wrong.  Again, if a widow who has a couple of young children applies for a job, she may not get that job because of the thinking on the part of employer that she would not give the necessary attention to her work.  It would appear there is a bias against widows in our society.  This attitude is bad enough in private employment but it is much worse when it permeates State or semi-State employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there seemed to be an idea that the bar against the employment of widows in certain State or semi-State institutions was being removed. <Col N="1635" /> I could never understand why such a bar existed particularly in cases where there was a shortage of staff with particular skills or qualifications.  Many years ago somebody got the idea that this bar was good in that the opportunities for young girls were not reduced. This argument has been continued to be used by unscrupulous employers and also by people in State employment.  Another aspect of this matter which concerns me is that widows are often employed as temporaries to do work for which permanent employees are receiving higher wages or salaries.  This arrangement seems to suit everybody except the unfortunate widow.  Therefore, if she is continued on a temporary basis everything is grand.  I would ask the Minister again to look at any statistics he likes with regard to payment to widows in this country and he will find that there is no other class of persons who are treated so badly nor will he find in any of the Western European States any widows who are treated as badly as the widows of this country are.</P>

      <P>Before I reported <Col N="1636" /> progress I mentioned that while it is true that the social welfare recipients got increases in their allowances last August or October it is also unfortunately true that those increases have been eroded largely by the spiralling increase in the cost of living.  I know that all these Supplementary Estimates must be passed by tomorrow so I shall just ask the Minister a few questions in a friendly way.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that most of the claims made by deserted wives were attended to.  When the Social Welfare Bill was going through this House some months ago it was pointed out that the definition of deserted wife would take some time to settle satisfactorily. I wonder if this has been done.  I wonder too whether the Minister's fear and mine that the allowances to deserted wives might prevent reconciliations has any foundation.</P>
      <P>I said before and it has been borne out that our social welfare priorities here have been upside down for many years.  We all admit there has been an increase in wealth in this country over a number of years and when there is an increase in wealth it should be equitably distributed between the haves and the have-nots.  I wonder what the position of this country will be if and when we join the EEC because according to my knowledge of social welfare conditions in the EEC countries our social welfare code here will need drastic revision and improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children's allowances are much lower here than in other countries.  I have always claimed that in this country where the families by and large are much bigger than in other countries we have been very niggardly in our payment of children's allowances. I have been looking at a document in regard to family allowances in the EEC countries and I have discovered that in Belgium for the first child there is 80s paid; in France 99s 8d; in Italy 65s 4d; in Luxembourg 77s 9d; in the Netherlands 59s 6d; in the UK nothing is paid for the first child, for the second 34s 8d and for the third 43s 4d. We all know what it is in Ireland. The average living standards in Italy are not much higher than in Ireland <Col N="1637" /> but family allowances are 2½ to 6½ times greater than ours.  I believe our whole social welfare code should be revised forthwith.  If the present Minister or any Minister for Social Welfare brings a Bill to this House with that end in view I have no doubt it will be debated sensibly.</P>

      <P>The Minister understands my feelings.  In about a month's time the Budget will be presented here and I hope there will be something in it that will give us reason to congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare on having such an influence with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>With regard to free travel for certain categories I think the exclusion of widows of IRA pensioners was absurd and indefensible.  I would ask him at the first opportunity to make an order &mdash;that is all it requires&mdash;to include a small section of people.</P>
      <P>In regard to unemployment assistance I have only one thing to say. The Minister may be annoyed at my mentioning this again but he will be no more annoyed than the people who have to wait seven, eight and nine weeks for the payment of unemployment benefit.  It is my experience that those delays still take place, happily not as much as formerly but they still take place and I am asking him to see to it if at all possible that this annoying irregularity will be eliminated.</P>
      <P>Insurance contributions to social welfare workers is something that has been advocated in the House.  In my view the contributions and the benefits should be on a graded system and the sooner that system is introduced the better.  While the money provided for the benefits is welcome it is unfortunate that inflation has taken such a toll of it.  I hope that in the context of the Budget social welfare recipients will be thought of more kindly by the Government and the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start off by saying that I consider the civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare the most humane group of civil servants <Col N="1638" /> in this country.  Over the years I have always found them very anxious to co-operate and to ensure that benefits, where due, were paid.  Unfortunately, over the past 12 months I am afraid the position has deteriorated very much not through any fault of the officials concerned but apparently because of the fact that for one reason or another the number of civil servants available for this type of work is dwindling.  It may be because of the fact that particularly girls now are not prepared to accept the amount of money which they are offered as juniors in the Civil Service because they have to pay practically all of it for digs.  Those of us who travel around the country know of this because we find them attempting to thumb lifts home at the week-ends because they have not got the bus fare.  This is one of the reasons, I understand, why the number of junior civil servants has been reduced and this has resulted in a very indifferent service being given now by the Department of Social Welfare.  We find such cases as people sending in certificates over a number of weeks and if there is anything wrong with the certificates instead of being returned with a request that they be put in order, they are simply put in a tray pending attention. Only today I found seven such certificates were wandering around. Everybody seemed to have the wrong number except one person in Social Welfare; even the insured man himself had given the wrong number.  This was the reason given for his not being paid but the number in the index in Social Welfare was the same number as this man was using.  Yet he could not be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was the case of an old man who was drawing unemployment assistance.  Last October he realised he would be 70 on 30th December. He wrote in asking if he would be entitled to a non-contributory old age pension.  It was assumed&mdash;I do not know who is responsible for this&mdash; that it was a retirement pension he wanted and it was decided he was not entitled to such a pension.  A week after Christmas his unemployment assistance, on which he and his wife lived, ceased.  I tried to find out why <Col N="1639" /> he had not got the pension and I was told that the social welfare officer in the district had got the case two months ago but apparently had not time to check up on it.  I do not know what the man has lived on but these things should not happen.  If the Minister has not sufficient staff, he should get them.  There is no use telling people waiting for benefit that the staff are not adequate to deal with their claims; they cannot understand that.  I know that the senior officers down the line to those a long time in the service and still on a fairly low grade are doing everything possible but if they have not sufficient help they cannot meet the demands.  Something must be done to improve the service at that level.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister propose to do in regard to persons who fail to stamp insurance cards for employees? On 8th March this year the Minister made an order as a result of which the waiting period for benefit was eliminated and, provided the card was stamped, the applicant got credit for the previous year.  But where somebody has not stamped a card for two or three years and there is an application for benefit, the failure to stamp is discovered, particularly when a number of people are involved, and the employer is compelled to stamp the card at that stage.  Three or four years later somebody else becomes sick and it is discovered that no card was stamped in the meantime.  When that happens those responsible in the Department of Social Welfare should ensure that a person who has defaulted once will not get away with it a second time.  I have come across in the past couple of weeks a number of instances where this has happened.  It is very hard luck on the person who believes he is stamping a card and paying the contributions for the stamps over this period to find that the stamps have not been put on.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the fact that he has changed the law in regard to the waiting period will help; apparently, it does not help in every case because I know a number of cases where so far the insured person has not received the benefit due.  Something has arisen <Col N="1640" /> to prevent him getting it.  I ask that the necessary attention be given to this matter so that everybody who, through no fault of his own, fails to stamp his insurance card will get benefit as in the case of an occupational injury claim.</P>
    <P>In the case of occupational injuries I think it is wrong that if somebody meets with an accident on the job, applies for benefit and a form DB 5 has to be sent to the employer to determine if the accident occurred at work, and if the employer does not return the form the person may wait a considerable time before benefit is paid.  Usually such a person can be paid disability benefit but I found recently a number of cases where disability benefit was not paid and insured persons who were out ill got nothing.  This is not good enough.  I know there is a good reason &mdash;the shortage of staff&mdash;but it is little use to the employee whose wife goes to buy something in the shop because if she has not the money she will not get the goods.  The onus is on the Department to ensure that applicants are paid promptly.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be prepared to admit, in view of the fact that we now have over 70,000 people unemployed and a further 3,000 that he says are put on retirement pension&mdash;otherwise there would be 73,000 unemployed&mdash;that is part of the reason why extra money is required.  Apart from what Deputy Barrett said about making provision for improved payments in the coming Budget, the Minister should try to impress on his Cabinet colleagues that they have never attempted to introduce full employment.  Every man or woman out of work costs the State money through benefits, if they get benefits, or through not stamping cards and not paying income tax.  I had a discussion on this issue with the Minister for Lands the other evening and even forestry workers who had been employed for years and are now laid off will, in fact, in some cases get almost as much as if they were working. The State loses; the taxpayers lose.  The State's right hand does not know what its left hand is doing.  People who would prefer to do a full week's <Col N="1641" /> work for the benefit they are getting are told there is no money available. It is not available in the Department of Lands; it is available in the Department of Social Welfare.  This is cockeyed thinking and the Minister should use his influence on his Cabinet colleagues to have it rectified before the next Budget.</P>
    <P>A rather clever trick was used in the last Budget in regard to the increase for the unemployed insured person without a corresponding increase for the wife.  The Minister would be amazed &mdash;or perhaps not&mdash;at the number who were taken in.  They felt that as the rule had been an increase for the insured person and the wife that if they had got 10s&mdash;to use the old term&mdash;it would mean 10s for the insured and 10s for the wife, £1.  When they found they were getting 17s 6d they thought it meant 17s 6d each but they found afterwards it was less because it was 17s 6d which, although the Department did not say so, had to be divided between the two people; it takes as much to keep one as the other.  The amount given last year was rather miserly because, even added to the amount of benefit these people get, it is a very small sum.</P>
    <P>The Government especially talk a good deal about Common Market conditions and what they propose to do when we enter the Community.  Have they given any thought to what they must do in regard to Social Welfare benefits when we go into the Common Market?  The crunch will come then and they will have to find money somewhere. It is extraordinary, but if money is required it will be found.  If a war were declared tomorrow the defence budget could be multiplied by ten overnight and the money would be found.  During the world wars we know that defence budgets of other states increased tremendously and the money, apparently, came from nowhere. It was said that after the war these countries would never rise again but they are all doing nicely now while we are still dragging along although we were not involved in either world war.  We do not seem to be able to get enough money to pay our sick, our unemployed, our widows or our old <Col N="1642" /> aged enough to keep body and soul together.</P>
    <P>I know other Deputies are anxious to speak but I wish to add to the appeal that Deputy Barrett made on the question of travelling.  The wife should be allowed to travel free if her husband has got a free travel voucher.  Why could it not be issued in such a way that the wife also could use the voucher?  It is rather awkward if the husband is sick and his wife has to travel a distance to collect something for him, whether it is a bottle of stout or an ounce of tobacco and she finds she has to pay her way whereas if he was able to get up and travel with her it would be all right.  Those are little things which might be changed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take a look at the question of old folk living alone.  One of the old people dies and the other is living alone and has to bring in a married daughter or a son's wife to look after her.  Whether that person stays in the house or not she should not disqualify the old person from getting whatever benefit she is entitled to nor should she be debarred from getting whatever is allowed for looking after the old person.  As it stands at the present time the mere fact that the daughter or daughter-in-law has a husband to support her is considered to be good reason why she should not be entitled to get any benefit. I am quite sure this is as true in the Minister's own county as it is in mine and he must know that where there is nobody to look after the old people they finish up in the county home where it costs about four or five times as much to keep them as it would if they got the small allowance which they could get and which it would not break the State to give them. This is something which should be considered when the new Budget is being framed.  It would have the effect of relieving a lot of distress and allowing those unfortunate old people to have a little comfort at the end of their days.</P>
    <P>I referred in the debate on the widows earlier to the question of the inspection carried out by the officers of the Department.  The Minister assured me on more than one occasion <Col N="1643" /> there were no specific instructions issued to officers that they were to be very strict.  My opinion is they are very stringent and since they all seem to be branded with the one stick it would appear they must all have received the same instructions.  They are doing a job and while they are paid to do this job they feel the onus is on them to do it properly but in doing it properly they investigate everything that has to be investigated.  Somebody who takes extreme measures to try to prove that some unfortunate old person is not entitled to something which he or she is entitled to is going outside the bounds of what he is expected to do.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that those people will not lose their jobs if they do not bring home a few scalps attached to their belts every time they go out, if they do not succeed in disqualifying half a dozen people on their tour of duty to ensure that the State will not have to pay some benefit which those people have applied for.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary is as interested as I am in the question of payment to the girl who has been working in insurable employment, who gets married, who subsequently has a baby and who signs for unemployment benefit afterwards but is refused.  There has been a consistent refusal by the appeals officer to grant the appeal of that person, no matter who the person is.  One of the funny things about it is that the usual stock question is: &ldquo;Who will look after the baby?&rdquo; There was a period when if a mother or mother-in-law was brought in and was prepared to do that job it was sufficient for benefit to be paid but that is no longer so.  The mere fact that the question is asked is quite sufficient to debar the person from drawing benefit, whether the mother or mother-in-law is available or not.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful situation.  I had a case last week&mdash;the appeal came up the other day&mdash;where a person had not alone been working until she got married but was working after she was married.  When the baby was born her mother looked after the child and she went back to work but when slackness occurred in the employment she was laid off.  She was debarred from getting <Col N="1644" /> employment on the grounds, I assume, that there was no one to look after the baby.  The Minister assured me that there were no specific instructions issued that this was to be done.  Perhaps he would tell me when he is replying, if specific instructions have not been issued, why have they consistently carried out this particular policy that when a girl gets married she should stay at home whether or not enough money is coming into the house to pay the outgoings.</P>
    <P>With regard to the non-contributory widow's pension would the Minister try to arrange that the widow who is working and who is sick or unemployed either gets the full rate of benefit or else the payment for stamps in her case is reduced by half?  The Minister cannot have it both ways and he has had it both ways for a number of years. This is a reasonable thing to ask the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have brought those points to the Minister this evening because I feel it is necessary occasionally to jog his memory.  I would like the Minister to comment on whether he still considers that the 73,000 persons he now admits are unemployed in this country are unemployable.  He may remember some months ago when I asked him why he did not train some of the then 60,000 who were unemployed, his reply to me was they were mostly unemployable.  I would like to know if he still considers those people are unemployable and unfit to train for any type of skilled work.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that we have to try to get the Supplementary Estimates through as fast as we can I will not spend much time on this Supplementary Estimate.  I am sorry Deputy Tully has gone because he said many things which I would have said myself.  I agree with him that old age pensions and all the other benefits should be increased as fast as possible but there are cases where even the question of increasing them would be of little significance because the position would be that the local reporters would take all possible steps to ensure that the person seeking the increase would not get it.  Unfortunately, at everyone's <Col N="1645" /> back door there is always a neighbour who is prepared to prevent a man or a woman from getting something to which he or she is entitled according to departmental regulations.</P>
      <P>I have brought up the question of deserted wives at our own party meetings. In all the cases that have come to my attention the position has been that the neighbours have told the pension officers that these women would not let their husbands back.  I know many of these husbands and certainly, if I were a wife, I would not go within hundreds of miles of them.  I have asked the Minister to accept a certificate from the parish priest or the home assistance officer to the effect that a woman is deserted.  Such certificates should serve as ample proof that a woman has been deserted.</P>
      <P>A woman can be employed for 20 years and can have paid full rates of insurance all that time but, unless she buys 26 stamps when she gets married, she cannot draw any benefit.  This is about the most stupid rule that was ever made.  Is it a disgrace to get married?  Is there anything wrong with getting married?  Why should a woman be penalised because she gets married? No one in his right senses would accept that rule as being either sane or reasonable. I am sure Deputy Tully will agree that it must be one of the most stupid regulations ever introduced. Even Pontius Pilate, daft as he was, would not have had anything to do with such a regulation.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace to get married, is it? At one time in Ballycroy couples had to get married at night because it was not thought proper to get married during the day.  If a woman does not get married she can send in fake certificates for the next 40 years but if she gets married she must put up 26 stamps after she is married in order to receive benefit.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>An unmarried woman can send in fake certificates for years and get all the benefits she wants. <Col N="1646" /> The Minister knows the set up in all areas, especially the western areas, and I would ask him here and now to change this stupid regulation.  It is quite possible that he has not been asked to do this up till now.  It is, in fact, extraordinary that the Labour Party have not come in here long ago to raise this problem.  In fact I do not know why I have not raised it before, but it has only just occurred to me.  How can any sane person&mdash; there are not many in this House at the moment&mdash;tolerate this?  I am sure no one will agree with me quicker than the Minister in this.  I am sure Deputy Corish will agree that I am right in this.  I am sure the Opposition generally will agree that married women should be treated in the same way as single women.</P>
      <P>There are many old age pensioners who have no near relative to look after them and they are looked after by local girls or women.  These girls or women should get the allowance of 55s a week just as the relative gets the allowance.  I do not see any sense in the present position.  If necessary, there could be a certificate from the parish priest or the home assistance officer to prove that the girl or woman is looking after an old age pensioner.</P>
      <P>It seems grossly unfair that a woman can be deprived of an allowance because a neighbour sends in a false report or something like that.  That has happened.  It is still happening. This was discussed at one of our party meetings.  Again a statement from the parish priest or the home assistance officer should be accepted.  It is grossly unfair that those entitled to an allowance cannot get it because of the interference of a neighbour.  I knew one lady who said she was divorced because she thought that she would get the allowance more easily.  Of course, we have no divorce laws here but she thought this was a quick way out.  She lost her allowance because of this statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should examine all these anomalies.  Where an old age pensioner is entitled to free travel his wife should be allowed to travel free also.  It is ridiculous that, if a woman wants to travel free, she must bring <Col N="1647" /> her husband with her.  These wives should be given entitlement to free travel on their own.  Those over 70 and the wives of IRA men get free travel.  All wives of old age pensioners should get free travel.  I ask the Minister to have a look at this and to ensure that this small relief is granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who are the concern of the Minister for Social Welfare are not people who are able to mount a massive political pressure campaign in the way many other groups can who are seeking improvements in their conditions.  This is the reason why social welfare payments have to some extent fallen behind in the race.  I notice here&mdash;and I am working from rather out-of-date figures &mdash;that during the '60s the proportion of our total current public expenditure which was devoted to social welfare was falling steadily : In 1958, it was 23.7 per cent of total current public expenditure; in 1968 this was down to 21.4 per cent.  This is indicative.  I am sorry that I do not have figures for 1970.  I am fairly confident that they are probably somewhat better than those figures, but I would like to have the comparison all the same from the Minister when he is replying.  I would remind the House that Fine Gael projected from 1972 that 25.6 per cent of our total current public expenditure would be devoted to social welfare.</P>
      <P>The reason for the reduction, as I say, is that the people concerned are essentially unorganised; they are the forgotten people, people who do not know one another; they do not work together; they do not have occasion to meet one another.  Hence they are not able to organise and are not able to mount pressure to get action.  I am not saying the Minister or any of the parties in this House are unsympathetic to the needs of these people.  However, I think the same is true of politicians as of everybody else, that their social conscience will get them so far but a certain element of pressure is also required to bring about what is really needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made these general remarks I would like to ask a few specific <Col N="1648" /> questions.  I asked a question some time ago, of which I have not got the record with me now, about understaffing among the junior staff in various sections of the Department of Social Welfare.  I remember being told of quite a large number of vacancies which were unfilled at that time. I would be grateful if the Minister, when replying, could give the House some indication whether the trend has improved since then and if these vacancies have been filled.  It is important to realise that if there are vacancies in the Department of Social Welfare there are fewer people to get the job done and therefore there will be greater delays.  Every Deputy will have some complaints about delays in this Department.  They will also know from talking to officials that it is certainly not because of lack of willingness on the part of officials that these delays take place but rather, as was demonstrated by the reply I received, because of lack of staff.  I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to make the terms of employment in the Department sufficiently attractive to ensure that adequate staff are available to eliminate all delay in the processing of claims.</P>
    <P>I also asked a question some time ago, of which again I do not have the record with me, about the introduction of computers in the Department of Social Welfare to deal with some of the routine work which at present has to be done by members of the staff. I know people will hold up their hands in horror at the thought of computers deciding whether a person is eligible for a certain benefit.  That is not what I have in mind.  There is certain routine work which could be done more quickly by computers.  The introduction of these computers was mooted some time in the early '60s. I may be wrong but in my recollection there was a recommendation that this should be done but I do not believe that as yet these computers have been introduced.  I would be grateful if the Minister would let me know what progress has been made in this area, because again this is something which would mitigate the delays which are a frequent source of complaint in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> I would draw the Minister's attention to the Budget in Britain which has given substantial increases of £1 across the board for widows' pensions, old age pensions and so on.  The British economy is linked very closely to ours and if standards of living and increases in inflation in Britain require such an increase it is fair to say that a similar increase is required here, and I hope the Minister will try even to better it when our Budget is introduced.</P>
    <P>I would like also to ask the Minister about a question I had down today in relation to the special hardship allowance in the industrial injuries code. The Minister has told me that this is something they have in Britain and which we do not have here.  As a result of this an Englishman who came to live here was unable to receive this special hardship allowance because it was not included in the reciprocal agreement on industrial injuries.  We do not have this provision here and if any Irishman went to Britain he would not be paid.  I would ask the Minister to let me know when he is replying whether he proposes to follow Britain in this regard so that people will not be left without this special hardship allowance.  I do not claim to know very much about the background to this allowance but as Britain has it, and apparently has it for some time, it is something we should contemplate here, too.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I have frequently drawn the Minister's attention is retrospective payment for people who may be out of work through disability for over 12 days in respect of the three waiting days for which they are not paid at the moment. I understood from replies I received from the former Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Kevin Boland, that his thinking just before he vacated office was definitely tending in favour of such a scheme but, judging from the replies I have heard from the present Minister, I think he is moving against it.  This is something he should reconsider. This approach of not paying people for the first three waiting days when they have been out of work for a very long time can only be described as niggardly.</P>
    <P>I would like to echo the point made <Col N="1650" /> by other Members of the House that a wife should be allowed to avail of free travel which is granted to her husband if he is an old age pensioner.  This is in the interest of promoting family unity.  Possibly financial considerations are a bar but I cannot see that the amount involved would be very great because very often the places are available on the buses anyway.  It is probable that the wife would want to travel to do shopping in the middle of the day when there would not be a great rush and there would not be a large number of people on the bus.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Parliamentary Secretary had quite a large coverage in the <i>Irish Press</i> in talking about the initiation of a pay-related system of benefits and contributions under the social welfare code, that this was in line with European practice and something we intended to introduce here.  In fact I think it is in line with practice all over the world and I would like to know what progress has been made in regard to its introduction.  I cannot imagine the homework involved would be all that great prior to the introduction of the scheme once it has been accepted as Government policy, because there has been so much experience in other countries in operating such a scheme that we are not exactly pioneering and I cannot see there is justification for the delay which is apparently taking place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the old age care allowance, as the House is aware, this benefit is not payable in respect of a female relative who is partly supported by her husband.  So far as I know&mdash;I am subject to correction on this&mdash;the means of the husband are not taken into consideration so that even if his means are very scant, she is not entitled to any benefit while looking after an old age pensioner.  Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This allowance should be extended to cover such people.  We should encourage, through our social welfare code, that families remain together in so far as possible instead of people having to go to county homes.  The present scheme whereby <Col N="1651" /> an allowance is paid to a female relative while she is looking after an old age pensioner is a good scheme but, as I have suggested, might be extended to include women whose husbands are still living but who are not in receipt of very much income.</P>
      <P>Again, I should like to support Deputy Lenehan in relation to what he said regarding married women having to have 26 stamps after marriage before qualifying for benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is a Supplementary Estimate, I do not intend speaking on it at any great length. In the two opening paragraphs of his speech the Minister appeared to be trying to give the impression that we were spending a formidable amount of money on social welfare.  I suppose it does appear to be formidable especially when the Minister mentions that in the year 1970-71, the total expenditure, excluding anything paid into the Social Welfare Fund or the Wet Time Fund, is in the region of £73 million. Of course, this figure is impressive but it is not an indication of the living standards of those people who find it necessary to have recourse to the various benefits and forms of assistance administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We only have to look at this very useful little booklet which is distributed generally and, particularly to Deputies, to know that there are persons who are living on very low incomes.  It will be seen that a widow receives £4 5s a week provided she has no other income. There is also the idea that was introduced by Mr. Kevin Boland whereby where one owned one's house, it was regarded that that person had means and the weekly allowance was reduced <Col N="1652" /> to £4.  I have no wish to delve into all these matters but it is only necessary for anyone to read through this book to see that amounts of £4, £4 5s, and £4 10s are given to different people who are dependent on those benefits. Therefore, it will be seen that the £73 million that is being expended this year is no indication of the appallingly low standard of living of some of these people.  I am not saying that in all cases the standard of living is very low because some of them are members of a family and draw from the family income by way of food and clothing. However, there are widows who live on their own and according to the regulations of the Department of Social Welfare, the widow who is eligible for £4 5s per week benefit will find that that amount will be cut immediately by 5s if she goes to work and earns even only £1 in any week.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the ratepayers of this country are facing up to the responsibilities that have been placed on them by this parliament&mdash;particularly, the responsibilities placed on them by the Public Assistance Act of 1939&mdash;of ensuring that people who need additional moneys in order to allow for a minimum standard of living, should get that money.  There is the appalling situation throughout the country in which the local authorities have fixed a certain amount of money beyond which they will not go regardless of how many children there may be in a family.  I had the case the other day of a woman whose husband was unfortunate enough to be sent to jail for some offence he had committed. That woman had five children but the maximum amount that she could receive from her local authority is £5 a week.  That is why I have advocated here and still advocate that, pending any other changes that may have to be made within the foreseeable future, we should have a form of State or public assistance administered by the Department of Social Welfare and contributed to by the ratepayers and the taxpayers in order to ensure that a woman such as the one I have mentioned will be able to get more than £5 per week for herself and five or six children.  May I reiterate our broad idea of a social welfare code in so far as payments and <Col N="1653" /> contributions are concerned?  We agree, and it is part of our policy, that there should be a scale of rates for contributions and a graduated scale for benefits. This would be the fairest system and it would be more equitable than the present system.</P>
    <P>I believe also that we should think in terms of a separate Budget, not necessarily for the social welfare services but for the health services also. There should be a Budget contribution to this fund.  A system could be devised whereby health and social welfare would be merged and paid for out of a separate fund.  This could be designed as a scheme to relieve rates, a big portion of which go to the health services at present.  As most speakers have said, if the taxpayers were aware that additional taxation on particular items was going to benefits for widows, orphans, old age pensioners and deserted wives, we would not have nearly as much cribs or criticism in relation to taxation that we now have because these people would be aware that their money was being devoted to those who were less well off than they themselves.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost sympathy with the Department of Social Welfare.  Perhaps this stems from the fact that I had something to do with that Department for almost three years.  I am aware of the criticisms that are levelled at the Department.  Perhaps it is one of the most vulnerable Departments because it is the Department which, above all, is dealing with individuals.  A Department such as Industry and Commerce or Agriculture deals with big matters while the Department of Health deals with the general financing of health but I have the greatest sympathy with the Department of Social Welfare in the type of administration in which it engages.  However, I do not think we should leave it at that and condone any errors that may be made by the Department of Social Welfare.  I suppose I am typical of other Deputies when I say that of all the approaches made to me during the weekend in my constituency and of all the letters I receive, the greatest number of individual complaints relate to social welfare.</P>
    <P>There is no week I come to Dublin <Col N="1654" /> on a Tuesday morning or a Monday night that I do not have a couple of dozen queries for the Department of Social Welfare.  I must say in fairness to them that any time I approach or have somebody approach the Department of Social Welfare on my behalf, whether it is in connection with a sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, widow's pension or old age pension, they are as helpful as they can be and they do their job as quickly as they can.  I suppose the biggest number of complaints would be in regard to the payment or the non-payment of sickness benefit.  I fully appreciate the difficulties that there are because applicants make lots of mistakes.  Only today I had two cases where the wrong number was quoted and I suppose there were one or two officials of the Department racing around and spending a half hour or an hour trying to trace these people who had given wrong numbers.  However, I think there has to be an effort by the Minister to ensure that there will not be as many of these complaints and there will have to be an effort locally also. There should be some assistance locally, in some office attached to the Minister's Department, to ensure that forms are filled in.  It amazes and appals me to hear on inquiry from the Department of Social Welfare that a person who had applied for sickness benefit forgot&mdash;and mind you the form is pretty big and he could not miss it &mdash;to mention that he has a wife and six children.  He approaches somebody like me and he says: &ldquo;I only got £4 10s last week and I have a wife and so many children.&rdquo;  He is not at all surprised when I write back to him and tell him that he forgot to claim for his wife and his other dependants.</P>

    <P>May I say this and perhaps the Minister would comment on it: no ordinary individual or few ordinary <Col N="1655" /> individuals seem to get a reply from certain sections of the Department of Social Welfare.  It would be far better to make an announcement to the effect that some sections of the Department will not answer letters or there should be an attempt to answer them.  Many people tell me: &ldquo;I wrote to the Minister. I wrote to the Department.  I wrote to the Secretary three times and never got a reply.&rdquo;  I wonder what happens to these letters.</P>

      <P>I do not know what happens to them but any citizen of this State who writes to a Department is at least entitled to a reply.  The Parliamentary Secretary will not mind my saying that I mentioned this to him in private a few times.  Maybe the same thing happened in my time, I do not know, but people should not be treated like that.</P>
      <P>I must confess I have not the same experience entirely as Deputy Tully with regard to referees or the chairman of the courts of appeal.  I find them humane and understanding and most helpful towards any of the appellants with whom I ever appear in my constituency. I find that most of them bend over backwards in order to help.  Social Welfare Officers have a very unpleasant task in that there is so much there for non-contributory, old age and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance and I suppose there must be somebody who must direct them into some sort of arrangement to ensure that there will not be overspending.  If this is the case I do not think it is right.  I believe they should be as liberal as they possibly can and if there is underestimation the Minister I am sure need have no fear in coming into this House looking for a supplementary sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what sort of liaison the Minister has with his counterpart in Great Britain.  I merely know that the British Minister for Pensions and National Insurance visits this country once or twice a year and has certain discussions with the Minister&mdash;it is <Col N="1656" /> mainly a social occasion&mdash;but his permanent secretary has official discussions with the officers of the permanent secretary of our Department of Social Welfare.  I wonder if there is any possibility of the Minister and his Department trying to induce his counterpart in Britain to transfer insurance records to this country.  There is an extremely long delay in the matter of the transfer of insurance records from Great Britain.  I appreciate that the post office strike was the main cause of this but I do not think they are too speedy in getting the information that is so urgently required not so much by the Department of Social Welfare as by the people who come back here from Britain and who want to claim for sickness or unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister is considering the question of the qualifying age limit of the deserted wife without a dependent child.  I trust that when the Budget proposals are announced or in some social welfare legislation he will correct the situation whereby there is an age limit below which a deserted wife without a dependent child cannot claim for that allowance.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Bruton who raised questions with the Minister in regard to the last paragraph of his speech where he tells us that we have ratified the European Code of Social Security which was adopted in 1954.  I suppose we ratify dozens of things from the ILO, the Council of Europe and the United Nations and a particularly interesting one from the United Nations which we may be referring to at some future time.  Deputy Bruton asked and I should like to ask also how do we rate in the matter of social welfare as far as these other countries are concerned and particularly the EEC countries are concerned.  I note with interest that of the six members of the EEC two do not seem to have ratified this European Code of Social Security. France and Italy are not included. Perhaps the Minister would tell us what our obligations might be or what sort of codal standards might the people of this country expect if we become a member of the EEC?</P>

      <P>I should like to advise my colleagues that if they want to get results from the Department of Social Welfare it is much more advantageous for them to write in rather than to go down personally unless they have a very complicated case.  I find the Department of Social Welfare do everything possible for Deputies.  What makes it very difficult in making a written requisition to them as I often do is when one has not got the number of the insured person concerned. In Wexford anyway quite a number of national health insurance officers&mdash;there was one in Gorey up to a few years ago&mdash;were available.  An insured person writes to a Deputy and of course he hardly ever gives his number.  Prior to this one was able to go to the local office and get the number and send that to the Department of Social Welfare.  This more than halved the work of the officials tracing the case.  I have asked the Minister questions on this subject on several occasions and he has assured me that there are more social welfare officers in the country than there ever were before.  That is perfectly true.  There is more social welfare work now.  With 70,000 unemployed it is natural that there would be a good deal more work. There may be more social welfare officers but they are not as convenient to the insured persons; they are not as national health insurance officers in the different centres.  As they retire or go to other jobs they are not replaced. It would be financially desirable that the Minister should replace them in that it would impose far less work when the local Deputy or those concerned would be able to get the necessary data from the office which they cannot get very often from the individual. We get, perhaps, a half dozen letters about social welfare daily.  We have not the full facts and we have not time to go to each individual.  If you write back more than likely you get no reply; it is as much as the man can do to write one letter, perhaps, but if there was a local officer you could get <Col N="1658" /> the information by telephone with tremendous saving to the Department and the Deputy concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the reciprocal arrangement with Britain.  Many of our people are working in England.  Others work there for some years then return and find insurable employment here. You often find a case where a man has been insured up to, say, the middle 50s, then must go to England until he is 65 and then return to Ireland.  There appears to be no collective arrangement under which the two periods of insurance can be covered for all available benefits in whichever country he ends up.  Many Irish people return here out of benefit.  They had to emigrate through no fault of their own and they had to insure in England and even where they are entitled to benefit I understand they only get, on British insurance stamps, six months benefit which is not very much good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Sickness benefit is six months and unemployment 26 days.  It is not a satisfactory reciprocal arrangement and the Minister should go to Britain to see his opposite number, Sir Keith Jones I think, at present, the Minister for Social Service and discuss this matter with him with a view to working out a better scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the section dealing with the reciprocal arrangement between the UK and Ireland is in Newcastle and that everything goes through that office. The delays are almost interminable; I have known delays of three to six months and the fault was not on this side.  It took long enough to get a reciprocal agreement between the two countries and it should be re-examined now.  I might point out that unless there is a big improvement in economic and social conditions here it is likely that there will be a far greater volume of reciprocal work to be done between the two countries.  We are now carrying about 70,000 unemployed and as far as I can judge, unless there is a great change, the figure could go still higher which would mean that many more <Col N="1659" /> people would emigrate and that emigration which has been falling would increase.  Consequently, there would be a great escalation in the number of people insured in Britain and here.  The whole code needs clarification. The Minister should take steps as soon as possible to get this work accelerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect the debate to range over such a wide field on a Supplementary Estimate related mainly to increased rates and new services provided in the last Budget.  I see no harm in accepting the motion which is completely in accordance with everybody's desires.  It is really part of what we have pledged ourselves in the past to bring about.  I do not see a need for a comprehensive social welfare code for widows and their families since such provision could be brought in under the general code and any improvements arising from time to time in regard to the position could be incorporated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate for £8,730,000 covers mainly deserted wives, retirement pensions and invalidity pensions.  By and large, the debate referred very little to these things, apart from complaints about the general social welfare code.  The fact that 1,150 deserted wives who did not come under the social welfare code before are today receiving allowances and the fact that there are 3,000 retirement pensions being paid and 12,000 invalidity allowances is something worthwhile.  I am not here to make propaganda out of these things. Deputy Byrne, I think, said these people were unable to exert pressure and this was one reason why they were not better paid.  This is certainly not correct because every Deputy is forever advocating better pensions and an extension of the code because this is a sensitive area which is emotive. People are all the time saying: &ldquo;That <Col N="1660" /> was not bad, but it should be better.&rdquo; Every time we introduce a new scheme there is an immediate demand for its expansion.  The free travel scheme was a complete innovation when brought in and we have extended it twice.  In fact, virtually all pensioners over 70 now benefit as well as Old IRA medal holders.  We are now being pressed to allow wives who may not have reached 70 to travel free alone.  While I shall definitely give sympathetic consideration to these claims, originally free travel was not intended for wives of pensioners under 70 who wanted to go shopping: the intention was to allow the pensioner to travel.  It was later extended to allow his wife to accompany him because it was pointed out that in some cases he might be feeble and only able to travel when accompanied by his wife.</P>
    <P>No matter what scheme is introduced there is a natural demand for its extension.  The prescribed female relatives scheme which I brought in some years ago was rather limited in scope at the outset, applying only to persons who left insured employment. It was then extended to persons who were not in insured employment.  It was originally intended to cover the case of a girl who had to remain at home to care for parents who would otherwise be alone.  We are being pressed to cover every conceivable situation now and it would virtually amount to granting 55s per week extra to all old age pensioners.  One must consider priorities.  We would like to do a great many things in social welfare.  There are a great many things we must and will do but we must get our priorities right and take the section to which we can apply additional resources and bring them into the scheme and improve rates and extend the scope of the scheme as time goes on.  My time is up but if I am allowed a few minutes it would not be necessary to come back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say in a general reference to the Common Market and the social welfare code in so far as it relates to the different countries that this is something which any Deputies who do their homework must have found out for themselves that no two of them has anything like the harmony which is mentioned in the Treaty of Rome.  There may be a tendency towards harmonisation but certainly there is not much harmony there as yet.  The amount of harmonisation we can bring with us on our entry into the Common Market will be as close to anything they have got as yet.  I have not any real worries on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are frequently asked for percentages and given misleading figures in comparison with other countries with regard to the total amount we are spending on social welfare.  Whatever figure suits the particular speaker at the time is usually the one which is quoted as percentage of gross national <Col N="1662" /> product spent on social welfare, the percentage of tax revenue spent on social welfare, the percentage of the total public estimate.  One may quote the figure which, at the particular time, is most advantageous for whatever purpose one has in mind.  If anybody looks back on the upsurge in the Estimates, in the appropriation of money towards social welfare in the last ten years, if he is honest, he must admit it is, percentagewise, the most spectacular increase in any Estimate in this or any other country over that period.</P>
    <P>Those who advocate better rates and extension of the scope must be satisfied to look back on that rate of progress and to glean from it the fact that if that rate is maintained in the years ahead we will have caught up very significantly and will have arrived at a very significant claim in the matter of our social welfare payments.  We have payments in this country which compare favourably with those in the United Kingdom.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with that but it is no harm for those people who are always denigrating the efforts we make in that respect to know that.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am called on to deal specifically with many of the points raised but I will answer a few of them.  Deputy Tully says that the Minister would be better employed getting his colleagues to devote more money towards full employment and thus obviate the necessity for paying many of the increased benefits.  That is a naive statement.  It is not as simple as that for any Government to tackle the problem of a rapid advance towards full employment.  It is just not something that could be done overnight. I believe we are devoting as much money to the provision of employment in this country, as a percentage again of our total revenue, as any country in the world.</P>
    <P>We had the usual complaints about investigations.  Deputy Tully and Deputy Corish did not quite agree there.  Deputy Corish was referring to one particular type and Deputy Tully to another.  I get those complaints too I may tell you.  I get many complaints about investigation officers.  Deputy Corish referred to deciding officers and <Col N="1663" /> appeals officers who handle cases very well.  The one complaint I get most frequently is that our investigation officers are so quick to find out when some recipient of pension or some other benefit, has got some emigrant's remittance in her own name sent home by her family, or that she has got some improvement in her means, whereas they are so slow to get out to investigate a claim when it is made.</P>
    <P>Those are complaints which are put to me quite frequently.  I want to say in reply to that that there are no instructions to that effect given to investigation officers.  I want investigation officers to regard themselves as people who have benefits to distribute to the community and that their approach should be accordingly.  There should not be any sort of harsh demanding questionnaires.  They have a duty to perform, as prescribed in law and as prescribed in statutory regulations.  I would hope they perform that duty in such a way that they convey to the claimants that they are there to help them to make a claim rather than to harass them.  That is the only message at any time we have a desire to get across and there are no instructions to the contrary sent out to those officers.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Corish what our relations were with the UK.  I can assure him they are perfectly cordial. We have yearly contacts and officials have them more frequently.  We get nothing but the best of attention whenever we have occasion to discuss matters in relation to reciprocity.  We have no reason to complain on that score.  I admit the transfer of papers from Newcastle-on-Tyne to here may incur some delay because very often the information which is given on the original application is inadequate.  This was borne out by an ex-Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Corish.  This can very often be the cause of many delays which provide a great deal of fodder for persons writing to newspapers and otherwise ostensibly as doing a job for what they regard as the harassed public.  Our Social Welfare Department gets an undue share of those complaints.  There is not a single case for which there is not an adequate <Col N="1664" /> explanation.  I would need to set up a new section, and indeed will have to provide some sort of public relations section, to keep explaining the reason for delays for which in the main we are blamed.  I am not taking the part of the Department at all but I had occasion to investigate many complaints which had been blown up publicly, and sometimes in the House here, and have found from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; the Department had dealt with them as quickly as the information at their disposal would permit them to do.</P>
    <P>I may be delaying the Minister for Industry and Commerce but I am glad of the opportunity of winding up this debate although I am not dealing with points in the same detail as if I were dealing with the main Estimate.  I am conscious of the fact that I will have an opportunity to go into this matter fully when the main Estimate comes before the House.  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Corish in what he said about the matter of public assistance. This is one of the fire brigade services that we have under the code.  It is the one which is always capable of providing on-the-spot relief and without delay.  We are rather concerned about the control of that service and about making it into a more efficient and ready to use service within the social welfare code itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde asked about the number of investigation officers.  He was confusing national health insurance agents with investigation officers and social welfare officers throughout the country.  It is well known to the House that what was formerly known as the national health agent has continued working for the Department but when he dies, retires or resigns we do not replace him and payments are made direct from the office instead of being sent through the agent.  I honestly think that it has not caused any great upset.  It has tended towards a more rationalised system than before.</P>
    <P>I would assure Deputies that I am conscious of the spirit of the motion, whether it is intended as a piece of timely propaganda or not.  We are on the eve of a Budget and every year when the Budget takes place I suggest <Col N="1665" /> to the Government what further steps I think we should take in going further forward in the social welfare code.  I make my case and have to accept what the Government collectively agree is in keeping with the resources available to us at a particular time.  I am fully in agreement with the spirit of that motion and I could have that motion related to every other section of the social welfare code as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £250,000 be granted to <Col N="1666" /> defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1971, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid. </P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet excess expenditure on certain subheads of the Vote which could not be foreseen when the original Estimate was framed.</P>
    <P>The sum of £57,000 provided under subhead A is required to meet the twelfth round pay increases over the year for the staff of my Department.</P>
    <P>The excess of £13,500 on subhead B is mainly due to increased travelling in connection with industrial promotion particularly in East European countries and in connection with our application to join the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The excess of £8,200 on subhead D is due to the long delay in delivery of some equipment ordered in earlier years.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £41,500 is required by the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards to meet twelfth round pay increases over the year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Industrial Development Authority the original estimate in this case was prepared before the enactment of the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  The sum of £187,500 includes additional expenditure of £41,500 for salaries, in respect of the twelfth round increase, £77,000 for office equipment and expenses, £19,000 for rent and rates and £50,000 for consultancy services.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £8,400 is needed to cover increased costs attributable to the twelfth round pay increase for the Irish National Productivity Committee.</P>
    <P>Since the start of the Buy Irish Campaign, it has been mainly dependent on State funds.  The grant towards promotional work was at the rate of £20,000 a year.  This was reduced in the current year to £10,000 in the hope <Col N="1667" /> that the campaign would be selfsupporting by contributions from industry.  This hope has not been realised and a further grant of £10,000 will be necessary.</P>
    <P>The House is already aware of the circumstances of the Government's involvement in the operation of Castlecomer Collieries Limited.  The problem created by the closure was that of workmen's compensation to some 40 workers who had sustained injuries or contracted illnesses in the course of their work before the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966 was enacted.  It was necessary to provide £57,000 to meet these payments, which were fixed by court order, as only £21,000 was available from the assets of the company.</P>
    <P>In relation to appropriations-in-aid the receipts from the Minerals Development Acts under subhead S (3) are now expected to yield £477,000 because of an improvement in metal prices during the current year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I point out that the gross amount required in this Supplementary Estimate is £333,100.  Off-setting savings on other subheads of the Vote amount to £83,100 and bring the net requirements to £250,000.</P>

      <P>This is a Supplementary Estimate and the arrangement is that we shall be brief and allow the money to pass so that work can go on in the Department.  I presume the debate is intended to end at 10.30 p.m. and I propose to share my time with the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the Department of Industry and Commerce transcends all the other things we have been talking about in this House for the past few weeks and all the things which bishops have been talking about outside it.  All these things are of little importance compared with the employment of our people.  We do not have to go very far to realise that it is only in industry that new jobs will be found. We now have an unemployment figure <Col N="1668" /> of 70,000 and we headed the league again in the number of work days lost. It was 900,000 odd in the previous year; it is now 1,000,000 work days lost.  There should, of course, have been a Minister for Labour long before that Ministry was established.  When the Minister for Labour and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, come to ponder their stewardship they must wonder whether or not there were, in fact, faults on their and their predecessors' side as well as on the side of those directly involved.  That is something we must seriously consider in this Supplementary Estimate.  It would be wrong to generalise but it would be equally wrong not to advert to it.  Taking the various subheads it is quite in order, in my view, to advert to these particular facets of our industrial structure which are creating a situation in which there will be no more new factories this year and a decrease in industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>The position is that we have galloping inflation.  The figure given for last year is 10 per cent.  The average for European countries is exactly half that. Inflation is the robber of the poor and the feeder of the rich.  Anybody with bricks, stones, mortar, green fields or holdings in industry merely waits for property to appreciate as cash values deteriorate but the poor man, the man who has no property, has to go on existing on the shilling in his pocket. That is why inflation is the robber of the poor.  Inflation in this country has been absolutely savage.  As I say, it is double the rate of anywhere else in Europe, with the exception of Britain. Mark you, Britain is a country in which, perhaps, there may be the most dire cutback as far as work and jobs are concerned, apart from ourselves.</P>
    <P>The party of which I am proud to be a member&mdash;a party which, in my view, will take over before many more political moons have waxed and waned &mdash;will see to it as a first priority that the work of the prices section of the Department will be streamlined and legislation passed to ensure that that body is really effective.  If the job is mine I shall see to it that that body does its work.  I do not say that by way <Col N="1669" /> of reflection on those involved but merely to give notice that the responsibility for prices rests with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and there is grave necessity to ensure that prices do not rise too high and that jobs are not put in jeopardy because of impotence on the part of a section of a Department.  If a section is impotent that is the fault of the Minister and the fault of the Government.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has not been very long in the job.  I believe that the prices section of his Department is impotent largely because of ineffective legislation.  There is not the proper control that there should be.  In cases in which it is vital that there should be an increase in the price of a commodity so that jobs will not be imperilled there is inordinate delay and that delay can be laid at the feet of the Minister and his predecessor.  So hopeless has the position been that ordinary working people have had to make decisions to go back to their employers and seek more wages, more paper money, because increases are eaten up in inflation. Sometimes the position has been that the employer could not grant an increase because of the price of the commodity he was producing.  There is the person who needs a price increase, can indisputably prove his justification for such an increase, but cannot get that increase and thereby loses his profits.  On the other hand, there is the unfortunate consumer who is mulcted. How could any woman going into a gown shop say that the price of a frock had been increased by £3 since last year and she will report that increase to the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce?  The same situation exists in regard to shoes and everything else.  Can the Minister say he would pay this year the same price that he paid last year for an identical suit?  These are the things that are causing galloping inflation, an inflation that is so difficult to correct, an inflation that may cause grave unemployment. It is certainly causing grave unrest.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Industrial Development Authority, there is a serious discrepancy in the level of grants to <Col N="1670" /> existing industry and to new industry. Looking through the report one notes that certain industries, perhaps, industries with a high female employment content, get huge grants while other industries get minute grants.  One realises here that the Government have been a little politically activated in the grants system.  They have been very happy to see the local TD at the opening of a new factory, having a ball of malt with the Minister&mdash;not with this Minister, of course, because in his case it would be Club Orange&mdash; calling attention to the new jobs, jobs which may mean more votes.  But there is more to it than that.  Existing industry must be looked after.  It will be the policy of my party that where an existing industry has made a major development&mdash;I do not say it should be 50 per cent of the capital employed &mdash;we will give grants at the same level as those given to new industry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to develop this into a general debate, but I must advert to one self-evident fact.  I have been sitting here for some years now listening to Ministers for Industry and Commerce reading their briefs and none of them has ever adverted to one self-evident fact.  The reason we are becoming the highest cost country in Europe is that the east of Ireland, through indirect taxation, through PAYE and, generally, through the volume of taxation from the large number of people living in the east, has had to provide the minimum infrastructure for the rest of Ireland, for the poor areas, the areas denuded of population.  The minimum infrastructure of hospitals, roads, Garda barracks and everything else has meant that the people of the east have had to bear a level of taxation unparalleled anywhere in Europe.  I put it to the people of the east of Ireland that they have got to realise that, if the other areas in the country do not develop and expand at some reasonable rate, then the level of direct and indirect taxation and rates that must be levied upon them will mean that we will be the highest cost producer in Europe.  If that situation develops we will reach the point of no return.  My definition of the economic point of no return is where you take a county or <Col N="1671" /> half a county, an industry or an individual company and decide, after a dispassionate examination of the prospects, that there is no hope for it.  I could give the Minister areas&mdash;and if he campaigned in the Donegal-Leitrim by-election he could give me the same areas&mdash;where there is no hope.</P>
    <P>The people of the east of Ireland must at last be made to realise that the only way in which a reasonable price level and a reasonable living can be attained for the ordinary working man is in the development of the designated areas.  We industrialists must be encouraged to go further than Dublin.  Otherwise, because of that infrastructure I have mentioned, the State taxation by way of rates, rents, taxes indirect and direct, on the people who are producing and who are in large number on the east coast will result in Ireland having the highest cost economy in Europe.</P>
    <P>I am proud again to say that we on this side of the House were the first to produce a policy which faced up to that self-evident fact.  The job I am trying to do tonight, before I move to the various items of the Minister's speech, is to sell to the people of Ireland this fact that it is no good for the NIEC report of 1962 to tell the Government that there should be growth centres specified when the Government, in case they would lose votes, will not act on it and we are left with Galway, Waterford, Shannon, Sligo and a couple more areas.  In 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966 we should have been designating our growth centres, building our advance factories, looking at our complete national infrastructure, building roads that were fit to carry our heavy goods from the particular places where our factories should have been.  We should have been telling the truth but, unfortunately, we are ruled by a Government who think only of their own political future.  I often think that, perhaps, the proudest moment of the political existence of the father of the leader of Fine Gael&mdash;and the people opposite did not believe it was possible&mdash;was to hand over the machinery of State having been defeated in an election.  His <Col N="1672" /> proudest moment was when by so doing he proved he had instituted democracy in this country without as much as a blow being struck or a gun discharged.  That is not what we are here to discuss tonight, but I do want to impress upon the Minister the necessity for a policy of growth centres, advance factories, of stating where we are prepared to allow factories to be built, of giving that flexibility whereby, if a chamber of commerce or an organisation in a small western town produces a project, we will give them a grant to make a feasibility study and that we will tell them the truth and lose votes if necessary.  We in Fine Gael were always ready to do that; perhaps that was one of our political mistakes.  Having done that feasibility study, it is our policy to help those who are prepared to help themselves in the establishment of a factory in that small town, which might not be in the growth centre or which might not be at the location where the advance factory was built.  That is our policy.  We have also a &ldquo;first&rdquo; in that the empty railway wagons and the empty CIE lorries returning from these areas will get subsidised freight rates and that people in Mayo will be encouraged to produce goods in Mayo knowing they will get a subsidised freight rate or no freight rate at all depending on the decision of the cost of bringing the goods to the east coast for export and for selling to the people who live in what is now referred to in copying London, as Greater Dublin.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is introduced at a time when the attack on profits by the Government is unprecedented. I must not go into too great detail but I want to advert to the fact that we are talking on the various subheads here about encouragement for industry, about providing grants for industry, about providing salaries for people to issue grants to industry to do all these things.  Not many months ago there was introduced in this House a package deal.  That package deal was the Prices and Incomes Bill, 1970, and the Finance (No. 2) Bill of the same year.  In the Prices and Incomes Bill that was introduced there was the abhorrent provision pegging wages, which is not practicable anyway, as <Col N="1673" /> everybody knows.  There was the pegging of rents for furnished flats, furnished homes and so on which, in my view, is extremely desirable, from 31st December, 1971.  There was the pegging of prices and various other provisions.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government had to do something else.  They said: &ldquo;We have been very rough on the working man.  What will we do with the big fat business magnates who will still get their profits?&rdquo; They produced the Finance (No. 2) Bill which increased company taxation to the staggering figure for a small nation like this of 58 per cent.  Faced with the utter impracticality of pegging wages they removed the Prices and Incomes Bill <i>in toto</i>; they did not amend it and remove the abhorrent features from it. It must be remembered that in that Bill they did not peg rents.  I had to advert &mdash;indeed some of my friends will not thank me for it&mdash;to the dreadful situation in Drogheda town in regard to the charging of rents for furnished homes to unfortunate people who found themselves without a corporation house in which to live.  They then created a situation whereby, at 58 per cent taxation, industry is being pressurised to the stage at which it is not worth while any more to work in industry.  There is no longer the profit motive and existing industry that is not exporting or is exporting an old export as distinct from a new export is giving 58 per cent, on average, of its profits back to the Government.  Then the people who derive some income either through dividends or salaries from a company or an industry pay their personal tax after that again.</P>
    <P>Where is the incentive?  Why have we done this?  The political correspondent of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> told us last Sunday week that in round figures the Budget will turn out with a deficit of £30 million, that revenue has increased by £58 million and that expenditure has increased by £88 million. The reason given for this extraordinary and incalculable loss in the development of Irish industry and the loss of Irish jobs was that in the year ending 31st March the extra revenue therefrom will be £3,500,000 and in a full year it <Col N="1674" /> will be £6 million.  Because of this high level of taxation we are forcing out of this country people who might have developed their industry further.  We are forcing out people who have not got new exports.  This is absolutely against expansion but at the same time we are giving out millions of pounds in grants to create new jobs.  The thinking in relation to all this is inexcusable and what is needed is a powder keg in the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I shall refer now to the Buy Irish Campaign.  The Minister said he hoped that existing industry would put up £10,000 towards this campaign but he now finds that he must provide the full amount of £20,000 himself.  Why should industry, having been treated so shabbily, put up anything?  The fact that they have not done so is a measure of their confidence in the Government. One of the first things done by Mr. Faulkner in Northern Ireland was to discontinue the campaign aimed at attracting industry to the north at a cost of £100,000.  He did this because he knew that while there were disturbances in that part of the country, no campaign would succeed in attracting industrialists.  Is it not an insult to the Minister and to his predecessors that the many industries in this country, some of them employing thousands of workers, would not, between them, contribute 100 subscriptions of £100 each?</P>
    <P>In relation to the east European countries, I can tell the Minister that our efforts in this direction are a waste of money.  I have some little experience of dealing with these people.  They will sell to you if they want hard currency and they will buy from you if they have not got the particular commodity themselves but they will buy them of the lowest quality and at the lowest price possible in any part of the world. They will not live up to the spirit of their bargaining.  Therefore, we would be far better off intensifying our efforts towards exporting to Britain.  We would be far better off searching, as I am searching at the moment in respect of one particular factory in my constituency, for a country in western Europe who, via the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, are anxious to <Col N="1675" /> get their goods into Britain and who can send partially manufactured goods here to be completed or who could have goods produced under licence at their plant here.  These industrial goods could then be sent to Britain.  If we did this we would not have to go behind the Iron Curtain and make asses of ourselves.  All I could do in my dealing with these people was lose money.</P>
    <P>Deputies have been asking questions about the imbalance of trade between east European countries and our own country.  From time to time they have said we should force these people to do this or do that and that if we buy £100,000 worth of goods from them, we should ensure that they buy goods to the same value from us.  They are not interested in doing business in that way.  Trade pacts have been made with Britain and can be made with America. They can be made, too, with the traditionally governed countries but there is not a hope in so far as these east European countries are concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Castlecomer collieries, I am not sure that enough has been done.  I remember hearing a very helpful comment in this House from Deputy Crotty's late father when first there was trouble in relation to these collieries.  This party was firmly behind any efforts made to mitigate hardship or displacement of workers in the area. I hope that matters will go well in so far as the Ballingarry collieries are concerned. I know that the people down there are doing their best.  They are decent people.  So far as my party are concerned every help will be given to them.</P>
    <P>Under the subhead for geological survey, there is merely an indication that machinery was late in arriving. There is not much point in referring to this except to say that I hope the most energetic efforts will be made in relation to geological surveys and that we will keep abreast of all mining developments as they occur.  In this regard, I might say that the debate on the Adjournment the other night was interesting.  The Minister acted wisely. The proper procedure was adopted in <Col N="1676" /> relation to Tara Mines.  The Minister was courteous and his approach was fair.  That is what I would expect from a Minister whom I believe to be an honest man.</P>
    <P>The appropriations-in-aid remind us that we now have royalties accruing from mineral exploration.  The Minister mentioned the other evening that he expects greater royalties from the present strike which is the subject of some comment.  My view is that the Minister is entitled to these and I hope he will approach this in a business-like manner, in a manner in which nobody kills the goose who lays the golden egg but where, at the same time, one expects to be in a position to pick the golden egg from the nest and leave the goose to lay another the following day.  It is my belief that the Government have acted correctly in this instance.  Since this matter is <i>sub judice</i> at the moment I suppose it is not right for us to discuss it in detail but I would say to the Minister that he is entitled to seek extra royalties and I wish him luck in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let the appropriations-in-aid increase. Any ratepayer in this country knows how much he must contribute. Therefore, it is necessary that there be an equality of the carrying of the burden and in this regard, royalties accruing from mineral strikes are necessary and proper.  I am sure this is international practice.  The extra money for the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards I am pleased to see included in the Supplementary Estimate.  I am aware of the work of this institute.  It is good work and I hope it will be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Productivity Committee are spending quite a bit of money and sometimes I wonder as I wondered at one stage in relation to the Agricultural Institute and still wonder sometimes if the work of that body is related in a commercial way to the benefits that the country can enjoy.  I would hope that there would be a less academic approach than there might be and a more practical approach.  I will say no more about that except that I would hope that practical benefits would be emerging and that we would not be <Col N="1677" /> paying money without getting something back.  I think we are not but at the same time it might well be that a more practical approach might be possible.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I shall sit down because this is but a Supplementary Estimate.  I have made a general case in brief which I shall expand upon on the main Estimate.  The Minister is facing a most difficult time in industry. Most of the difficulties spring from the economic and fiscal policies of his own party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well then the Minister is in a most difficult time at this moment.  This difficult time is largely the result of the economic and fiscal policies of his own party.  As a Member of the Cabinet he must try to change that.  In his position as Minister for Industry and Commerce he must change that.  All we are waiting for is a chance to do it for him much better than he could do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot refrain from commenting on Deputy Donegan's last sentence.  There is nobody in this country who knows the difficult position the Minister is in better than the Minister himself as a representative of Laois-Offaly.  He knows all about it and he does not try to hide it at all. It is always on his mind.  I shall allow time for Deputy Crotty to speak on this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is relatively small compared with other Supplementary Estimates. Just look at the figures for this Department over the last three years: £10 million for 1968-69; £16 million for 1969-70; £23½ million for 1970-71; £24 million now.  If I wanted deliberately to create inflation and destroy the currency of a country that is the way I would behave.  I shall take an example, that of the IDA.  Its expenditure on administration was about £260,000 in 1968-69.  This year it will be £1,037,000, four times as much.  That kind of thing goes to my heart.  The salaries, wages and allowances under the Department itself are not so bad <Col N="1678" /> but the travelling and incidental expenses are up from £22,000 last year to £36,000 this year.  How does Industry and Commerce do that kind of thing?  Of course, I enjoyed myself thoroughly when I was in the Department of Finance.  I was constantly stuck in them.  I had the greatest contempt for that Department when I compared it with the Department of Agriculture which at that time had serious problems which the Minister's own Department has now.  At that time the Department of Industry and Commerce had nothing whatever to do with exports.  There were negligible exports and the Department had nothing to do with them but now they have and they will learn very quickly.  I hope they will change and become more like what the Department of Agriculture was 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>The expenditure on the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards&mdash; Deputy Donegan approved its work, I am sure it is doing excellent work&mdash; since 1967-68, that is in three years, has more than doubled.  The other one quadrupled in two years, a most absurd and ridiculous situation.  I shall have a few very trenchant words to say about the people in the IDA in a moment.  That is what they are capable of, quadrupling their expenditure on administration and staff in two years.</P>
    <P>The corporation profits tax here is now 58 per cent.  It was cut to 40 per cent in Britain today.  We have fabulous grants to foreign companies who get them only for export and they are hardly here six months when they are coming to the Minister's Department looking for the right to sell inside this country.  You have not yet felt the kind of breeze in our industry that will hit us if any international depression occurs.  Continuously the Government talk about creating employment.  This game is rather like creating credit.  These two phrases are not used in sophisticated countries.  We are constantly given to them and no Department more given to them than the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the report of the Industrial Development Authority since there is so much money in this <Col N="1679" /> Supplementary Estimate for that body. I think it is discreditable on the part of the two men who signed this report and I repeat the word &ldquo;discreditable&rdquo;&mdash;John H. Donovan, Chairman&mdash;no credit to the name if I may say so&mdash;and Michael J. Killeen.  You would think from this report that the IDA was established in 1952.  Every word in it suggests it.  I went over to the Library and got out a book of fairy tales entitled: &ldquo;Éire: Achtanna an Oireachtais. Acts of the Oireachtas, 1950.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some interesting things came to light.  No. 29.  Industrial Development Authority Act, 1950. Mind you when the Fianna Fáil Party came back into office a man who was not a leprechaun at all but was the best administrator the Fianna Fáil Party has ever produced, Deputy Seán Lemass, said the first thing he would do would be to demolish this.  When the Act came into the House he said he would abolish this authority when he came back into office.  He did not do it then.  I think it is discreditable on the part of these men to approach this thing in the way they did, in this dirty manner, this filthy dirty way.  They start off with the Industrial Development Act, 1969, and go on in and out of the thing in every way they can except to tell the simple truth.  If they had even put in one paragraph I would say: &ldquo;Fair enough&rdquo;, but, according to them, it was all done in 1960; nobody did anything before 1960 and nobody thought up anything before those who thought up the idea of inflation, of getting this country heavily in debt.  Let me read out one section of this Act of 1950, section 3:</P>
      <P>The Authority shall be an autonomous body with the following functions:</P>
      <P> (i)  to initiate proposals and schemes for submission to the Minister for the creation and development of Irish industries;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  to survey possibilities of <Col N="1680" /> further industrial development and advise the Minister thereon;</P>
    <P>(iii)  to advise the Minister on steps necessary and desirable for establishing new industries;   </P>
    <P>and so on.  It is all there: it is just in different language in this Industrial Development Authority (Ireland) Review, 1952-1970.  Why 1952?  It has no significance in this context except pull and I know what the pull is; it has nothing to do with the IDA.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the nature of these enormous grants given for new industries.  I shall not decry these new industries although I could quite easily in regard to a couple of counties.  I could take them one by one and tell the truth about their present position but I want to talk about adaptation grants.  I can understand adaptation grants being given to companies that are not enormously wealthy corporations but let me read these names picked at random from pages 82 onwards of this report.  I took the big ones: to Gateaux Limited, Dublin, for confectionery, so far, £93,000; to Arthur Guinness and Company for malting&mdash;that was not the only one for malting; I noticed others&mdash;£147,000 up to the present; to HB Ice Cream Limited, Rathfarnham, for ice cream, £201,000; to Irish Biscuits, Limited, Dean's Grange, £163,100.  That is the new factory.  What is the adaptation money for?  All I shall say about Rowntree-Mackintosh is that whether they would subscribe to Deputy Donegan's scheme to buy Irish or not I think they would be very unlikely to give a subscription to the Minister's party in an election campaign.  I would reckon that many of those who would not subscribe to the Buy Irish Campaign gave large sums to the Minister's party in all elections in the last decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might also be throwing out a sprat to catch a salmon in certain cases.  There is also P.J. Carroll and Company, Dundalk.  I have the greatest respect for the company <Col N="1681" /> but that is not what I am talking about. They got £183,400 for cigarette and pipe tobacco.  Robert Usher and Company, Drogheda, got £89,000; Albatros Fertilisers Limited, New Ross, £250,000.  There is nothing deliberate about the way I picked these people; it was the idea of giving such companies adaptation grants.  What standards have we?  I know how it happens. Rules should be drawn up so that such people would not get adaptation grants.</P>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach a question recently.  I wanted a list of the documents submitted by people exporting minerals.  I am glad there is something relevant in the Supplementary Estimate about this, an additional sum for appropriations-in-aid arising from mining of £50,000.  This is not bad; I am all for it.  I asked the Taoiseach for a list of documents submitted when companies are exporting mineral ores. I did not get anything, not even the statement that it was the ordinary bill of lading.  I wanted to know what check was made on the accuracy of these documents.  I was told it was done by the customs men who passed them to the Central Statistics Office who then checked them&mdash;I suppose to make sure the arithmetic was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a question of the Minister the other day.  He gave me a long answer but no information in which he said that prospecting work programmes are carried out under the general supervision of the &ldquo;Geological Survey of my Department&rdquo;&mdash;which is also in the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;&ldquo;which is also responsible for checking on results reported&rdquo;.  We were not born yesterday.  I take it the Minister has been reading about Australia. I have myself occasionally read examples from South Africa.  We must be very careful on this matter because the greater part of the income of South Africa depends on mining.  The Minister said that it would not be appropriate for him to comment in detail on the checking system.  I had asked: &ldquo;What checks if any were made on behalf of the State?&rdquo;  I merely wanted him to state the checks.  He is not prepared to do that.  I did not want detailed comment.  He then said: &ldquo;I can assure the Deputy it is adequate to <Col N="1682" /> test the accuracy of the claims made for mineral quality of cores from bore holes.&rdquo;</P>

I asked the Minister: &ldquo;What checks are made on behalf of the State on the accuracy of the claims...&rdquo; I wanted to know what the checks were.  I did not want to be told that the Geological Survey does it.</P>

I do not regard it as nearly as important as the Industrial Development Authority aspect of this Supplementary Estimate although it could be very important on <Col N="1683" /> another occasion.  I could say a lot more about the amount of money the Industrial Development Authority are spending this year.  You could do what the present Government are doing, borrow large sums of money abroad, spend a good part of them here and add to the GNP for one year and you get a most wonderful result.  Of course the truth is there was supposed to be a one and a half per cent growth this year.  This Industrial Development Authority Report is full of this GNP thing.  This is one of the greatest frauds ever.  I do not think officials should laugh when a Deputy is talking in this House.</P>

      <P>This GNP thing is the greatest fraud which was ever perpetrated in any part of the world, this business of creating arithmetical superstructures.  In fact what they are doing is inflating through the destruction of the currency and nowhere has it been more than in this country where at the moment we are borrowing large sums abroad and the only good sign is that our exports went up last year by a larger percentage than our imports. They went up absolutely by slightly more than imports and percentagewise they went up quite sizeably.  That is the only good sign I see in this country at the moment.  All the other signs, particularly those illustrated by Deputy Donegan, are unfavourable, unfortunately.</P>

Of course it is very relevant as far as the Department of Industry and Commerce are concerned, and as regards the questions raised by Deputy O'Donovan, as to the basis on which those calculations are made.  It is totally unnecessary to have officials of <Col N="1686" /> the Department going around checking and ensuring that the statements put out by the various mining companies are correct.  That is not a function of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am sure all people who know anything about the industry would agree with me in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond raised the point that the mineral rights of Ireland are owned by the people of Ireland.  Of course they are.  They are vested in the Government on behalf of the people of Ireland and nobody denies that fact.  That is stating the obvious.  The Department have obligations from the point of view of ensuring that all commitments entered into are honoured, that where a prospecting licence is issued and when a company complies with all the regulations and to the satisfaction of the Minister that company should automatically get a mining licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something I do not want to raise in the House any more because the more talk there is at this stage about this particular mining venture the more harm it may do to the company itself.  However, it is very important from our point of view here that we ensure that justice is done and is seen to be done because as far as I am concerned this could have repercussions on a vast scale as far as the industry of this country is concerned. I know the Minister is very concerned with the type of repercussions that could occur if any opportunistic deals were pulled off on this particular occasion. I read today in the <i>Financial Times</i> where one of the biggest United States corporations is thinking of coming into this country to prospect.  The great thing about this is that we have those people coming over here getting to <Col N="1687" /> know Ireland, getting to know the people in Ireland, getting to know the various officials in the Department. The potential for the future industrialisation of the country, outside the mining industry, is tremendous if we look after those people properly.  I do not have with me the figures of the amount of money which the IDA spends in trying to attract industry to this country but here is a heaven sent opportunity to put our best officials in contact with the directors and executives of some of the biggest companies in the world. This is an opportunity which should not be lost.  We must satisfy these people who are investing in this country that we are prepared to honour every one of our commitments.  We must show them we mean business.  We must welcome these people and hope they will give good employment to our people.</P>
    <P>When I raised the matter of the mining industry on the Adjournment I said I did not want to discuss the present rate of royalties or whether or not there is merit in the present system of royalties.  I do not think we should enter into this issue at the present time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's visit tonight will have been worth while if he has learned something about the mining industry even though it was not in order to discuss it.  This party have <Col N="1690" /> always been committed to the industrialisation of the rural part of the country.  South-west Cork has benefited enormously from the enterprise and activity of the IDA.  Five industries have been established in Bandon in the past two years bringing tremendous sources of employment and ensuring that we no longer have emigration from this area.</P>
      <P>I can remember when an industry in a rural area was unique but I am glad to say it is becoming the norm. The IDA are doing a tremendous job attracting industry to this country.  I know the type of competition they are up against in trying to get industries to establish themselves here.  I know the size of the grants and the locations for industries offered by other countries but despite this competition the IDA have risen to the occasion and we have got our fair share of the number of industries available.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to influence the IDA to a greater degree to send more industries to rural areas instead of putting them in the cities.  I realise that the cities are probably much more attractive to the incoming industrialist, but the problems of providing housing, sewerage and all the other facilities necessary are far greater in the city than they would be in the country.  The young fellow growing up in the country is very well equipped to become a successful industrial worker because from a very early age he probably has been on the farm, meddling with machinery, getting used to fixing the tractor and other machines and, as a result of that, he has had a good basic training in behaviour in precision industry.  We are, I am glad to say, getting this type of industry.

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate: SDA Loans Interest Charges.</Title>
    <Col N="1691" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise what seems to me, as it must to other Members of this House, to be the retrograde decision by the Government to raise from 9 per cent to 10 per cent the interest charges on SDA loans.  On 22nd March the Minister issued a circular to local authorities stating that the new interest rate would be 9½ per cent loan charge and ½ per cent administration costs, making a total of 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>I regard this as a unique decision on the part of the Government and I am sure I am not alone in that view. This will mean a still further escalation in housing costs particularly for those in the lower and middle income groups. For those in the lower income groups who might wish to avail of this type of financing for the purpose of providing themselves and their families with homes it represents what I regard as a wholly unnecessary extra imposition. An applicant for a maximum loan of £3,300 will have to meet a substantial increase in repayments in the region of an extra £2.15 per month.  Repayments at the moment range from £6 to £7 or £8 per week.  In the case of loans in the region of £3,000 it will mean an increase of 1s per £100 borrowed per month or 30s per month increase in repayments.</P>
      <P>This added impost should seriously concern this House.  No account is taken of the chronic escalation in rates. It is reprehensible of the Minister to take this decision at this particular juncture in view of the fact that building societies in the private sector have decided not to make a comparable increase in their interest rates.  They have stated that publicly.  It would appear there is a double standard in operation.  Instead of the State adopting a policy of incentives to ensure cheap loans for houses it is doing the exact opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are behaving deplorably.  The result of this short-sighted policy will be to put houses outside the reach of those most in need of them.  On the basis of the old interest rates a borrower would pay back <Col N="1692" /> £8,000, or thereabouts; under the new rate he will pay back £9,000, a substantial increase from the point of view of interest and capital repayments. Admittedly, it is possible to avail of a rebate in income tax throughout the loan period, but this is not an argument of substance because the benefit to those concerned is nil.  There was considerable scope for the Minister to exercise the collective imagination of his Department in suggesting amending legislation in respect of income tax relief and perhaps in redefining the loan period of 30 or 35 years.  There are a number of things he could have done, as have been suggested to him down through the years by a number of organisations like the NIEC and the Commission on Income Taxation.  Had their advice been heeded it is reasonable to say that capital would have been conserved for house loan purposes much more effectively than is now proposed by the Government. Rather than introducing a blanket penal rate of 10 per cent, irrespective of income, irrespective of family size and irrespective of the social needs of the applicant, there could have been a much more sophisticated sliding scale system related to people's needs.  This could have been done by the Government but they seemed to be much more preoccupied elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Government must stand condemned for giving a unique and unexpected incentive to the dear house loan.  The Minister will have noted that the various housing co-operative organisations have reacted strongly against the Minister's decision.  The Minister will certainly note that the South County Dublin Housing Co-operative Society, a responsible voluntary organisation, and also the National Housing Co-operative Trust and other voluntary housing co-operatives in that area, where housing is almost completely beyond the reach of the lower or middle income group family, even with the £3,300 loan, have condemned in the strongest possible terms the raising of interest rates on loans to local authorities by the Government.  These organisations have pointed out that the Government's decision has increased the cost of buying their own homes for many couples who were already bearing <Col N="1693" /> an enormous financial burden related to their income prior to the latest increase.  Unless the Minister reverses his decision many couples will be prevented from providing homes for themselves for a considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city there are 5,000 families&mdash;and one should multiply that by the average number of persons involved in each family, which means 15,000 persons&mdash;in need of housing. These people will have no option now but to avail of local authority housing with no alternative of local authority loans open to them.  Likewise in the County Dublin area there are at least 1,500 families who again will have to rely solely on local authority housing. One might say the incentive to them to opt for tenant purchase is very small at this stage.  It would be very difficult to suggest to a housing applicant, say, in the Ballybrack area of South County Dublin that he should pay £6 10s a week for a three-bedroomed local authority house, plus rates; admittedly there is remission there, but he may well have to pay up to £7 or £7 10s which is an extremely high amount to pay out of an income of £18 to £22 a week.  Therefore I would urge the Minister to reconsider this matter so that further distress and anxiety will not be caused to the families concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made by Deputy Desmond for the Minister to try to do something to alleviate what will be a very great hardship for very many people unable to bear such hardship.  This increase will affect a section of the community that is not affluent, a section of the community from which the greatest pressures come in terms of looking for increased wages.  This decision by the Minister to increase the interest rate will act as an inflationary agent and will make a difficult situation much worse.  It will affect, as I say, the type of wage earner who up to now was looking to the local authority to house him.  This person was, because of the recent increase in wages, housing himself with the loan under the Housing Acts, that is, the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts and their successor. Because these people are being reduced <Col N="1694" /> in number they will be putting pressure on the local authorities to house them, and the local authorities, in turn, will be putting pressure on the Minister to provide what is a very scarce commodity at the moment, capital for housing.  The decision is also contrary to the policy of the Department of Local Government who have been urging the formation of co-operatives so that people may provide their own houses, as a third arm in the housing drive, by means of these housing loans. Therefore the Department of Finance, by this interest rate increase, are thwarting the wishes of the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>However, in the overall financial position in which we find ourselves at the moment the worst feature of this decision is that it will act as a further inflationary pressure.  In the serious inflationary situation we are experiencing&mdash;and it is not becoming less&mdash;every action of the Government should be directed to seeing that it can be at least maintained.  This action has a contrary effect because the people who want to buy their own houses but who have found themselves that few pounds or few shillings short in their budget will be driven to look for wage increases to make up that gap.  It is also psychologically bad from an inflationary point of view in the sense that the double-figure interest rate of 10 per cent has now been made applicable as far as the man in the street is concerned and has set a most undesirable norm.  Up to now we heard of the 10, 11 or 12 per cent only in the province of the finance companies and the moneylenders.  Now the Government are establishing a norm of 10 per cent in the important matter of the provision of housing for the lower and middle income groups.  This again will have a very unsettling effect because it will be taken by other sections as an indication that 10 per cent is now acceptable so that if they impose 10 per cent in their dealings, it will not matter because the Government have already done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say that I regret very much the necessity for increasing this <Col N="1695" /> rate of interest.  It is, however, notable that Deputy Desmond and Deputy Cooney made no reference to a very relevant factor&mdash;the cost at which the Government borrowed the money advanced to the Local Loans Fund.  It seems to me to be a little strange to talk about this being inflationary when, clearly, what has happened is that the rate of interest at which the Government must borrow money is related directly to the inflationary situation in which we have found ourselves and to the inflated interest rates which are being paid today.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that the most recent long term borrowing effected by the Government was at a rate of almost 10 per cent.  The rate of interest now chargeable on money advanced by the Exchequer to the Local Loans Fund is 9½ per cent and, as Deputy Desmond pointed out, one half per cent is added to that for administrative costs, giving the house purchaser a rate of 10 per cent to pay on the money he borrows.  So far as the Exchequer is concerned, the rate is almost 10 per cent on the most recent loans and when a half per cent is added to that, the actual rate would be in the region of 10¼ or 10½ per cent so that the economic lending rate would be thereabouts and the rate of 9½ per cent that we are charging is about three-quarters per cent below what would be regarded as the economic rate.  I am making that point because I want to make it clear that the Government are very conscious of and very concerned with the effects on house purchasers of these interest rates.  To that extent we are subsidising interest rates on these loans to the extent of approximately three-quarters per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I had hoped that interest rates would have started on a downward curve and that it would have been possible to avoid this increase but that has not happened.  If we were to fail to take action towards closing the gap&mdash;not closing it completely&mdash;it would, I think, be an indication of an approach by the Government to the general financing of the Exchequer which could well lead in course of time to the non-availability of any money <Col N="1696" /> for loans because we must show that we are making some reasonable attempt to manage our finances and to make provision for repaying the people from whom the State borrows every year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the impact of this increase, I would point out that the increased gross cost to a borrower on a loan of £3,000 is about £27 per annum and since these interest payments qualify for income tax relief, the net cost in the majority of cases is less than £20 a year.  In that connection, I would point out that figures available show that the average loan approved by all local authorities for new private houses purchased in each of the first three quarters of the year ending 31st March, 1971&mdash;I have not got the figure for the last quarter because it is not yet available&mdash;was, in the first quarter, £2,688, in the second quarter £2,789 and, in the third quarter, £2,747 so that the impact on the average increase is less than I have indicated.  By that, I am not saying that the impact is of no importance to those who are borrowing but I am saying that we should keep in perspective what is the impact.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out also in regard to housing generally that there is a number of items in the Government programme in regard to assisting people who wish to purchase their own houses.  The first item is the increase in the private housing grants under the Housing Act, 1970.  Expenditure on these grants for this year is estimated at £2½ million.  Secondly, the provision of capital to local authorities for the payment of supplementary grants is estimated to cost £1½ million this year while the provision of capital for the Small Dwellings Act is estimated this year to cost £9½ million.  In addition, there is rates relief for these grant-aided houses over a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>I mention this to point out that the State is doing quite an amount to assist the purchasers of private houses and, even with this increased interest rate, is in practice subsidising the interest rate to some extent.  Deputy Desmond referred to this as a unique decision but, of course, this is not so. Rates have been increasing steadily <Col N="1697" /> down through the years and it is a reflection of the inflated interest rates being paid for money which we borrow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond quoted a figure of 5,000 families as being in need of housing in Dublin city.  Of course, the majority of those people would not be affected by this increase.  When interest rates begin to decrease, we will ensure that the Small Dwellings Act interest rates will reflect this increase.  It is true that the rate now payable is higher than that charged by the building societies, as was stated by Deputy Desmond, but the Deputy will be as well aware as I am that for a very long time this was not so.  He will know also that the building societies' rates very, whereas the Small Dwellings Act rates do not vary.  This may be no great help to those who are now paying <Col N="1698" /> the high rate but it has been in the past and will be in the future a considerable benefit to those who are borrowing at a lower rate of interest because the rates will go down eventually. People who borrowed under the Small Dwellings Act scheme ten or 15 years ago are now in a happy position compared with those who borrowed from building societies.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again express regret that this increase was necessary but failure to increase the rate of interest could in the long run lead to the non-availability of capital.  It is a decision which had to be made but a decision that will be reversed as soon as it is possible to do so.</P>
