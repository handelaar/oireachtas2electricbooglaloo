    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like for a moment to turn to the philatelic service. I am very pleased to see the Department giving increased attention to this.  I am sure the House would like to hear the most recent figures this additional business has brought to the Post Office.  I was pleased recently to see the number of special issues which will be available this year.  The Department are to be commended on this but these are only the first steps and the Minister should give increased special attention to what is obviously a very lucrative business. It is ridiculous to talk about postal losses when there are thousands of pounds to be picked up on this.  The imagination and the enterprise is there but I doubt if they have been given sufficient scope.  Business interests are very alive to the philatelic interest and the Department seems to be leaving it to them to scoop the pool in the matter of first-day covers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department used to print its own cards and envelopes and, in conjunction with the Arts Council or the Kilkenny Design Centre, or some other body, surely it could design and issue special covers on the appropriate days? I understand some thought is being given to this.  I believe it should get very urgent attention.  In the United States of America the P.O.'s best seller &ldquo;Postage Stamps of the United States 1847/1967&rdquo; sells at $1.25 per copy. It illustrates and describes every United States stamp of the last 120 years.  This idea could very well be taken up by the Department.  There is no reason why it should prove less successful here than it has proved in the United States.  I believe it would be a tremendous best seller.  It would be a very suitable souvenir for those who visit the country.  I remember being on the Parliamentary conference in India when the Gandhi stamp was issued.  I admit there was a special reason for it but we brought a number of our stamps with us and there was tremendous interest <Col N="329" /> in them and that interest has continued.  I do not think we make enough of this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>The design has improved very much recently.  Many of us were disappointed with the type of stamps issued over a number of years.  Some of them could only be interpreted by those who were very highly educated; to them they might represent something very special but unfortunately, to too many, they did not make sense.  They did not represent anything.  To outsiders the confusion was even greater.  An effort should be made to have a more easily understandable design of a better colour. Our stamps are too dull.  I do not think the Post Office should stick to black ink for cancelling firstday covers.  Now that it has become colour conscious new ground might be broken and colour cancelling adopted.  If the super-markets were in this business they would certainly have been doing this a long time ago.</P>
    <P>Recently a very successful coin display was mounted in Dublin and Telefís Éireann did an excellent programme on it.  It would be worth considering a similar venture in regard to stamps.  Every encouragement should be given to such an exhibition especially if it were of an international character.  I do not see any reason why it should not be tried.  I am sure the Minister has enough initiative to ensure it would get a fair trial.</P>
    <P>With regard to the telephone directory&mdash;somebody did something which is quite understandable because, with such a large quantity of printing, it is not unusual to find mistakes made; in this case a number of pages were omitted and it is regrettable that that should happen&mdash;it is on the whole a very good job.  It is a vast improvement on the old directory.  What is going to be done about the Golden Pages?  I was very critical here a few years ago about an attempt by an outside firm to cash in on the Golden Pages.  They sent people around visiting business interests and suggested to them that they could be included in the Yellow Pages on the payment of a certain sum.  They did not tell them that they would be included whether that sum was paid or not.  All they were getting for their <Col N="330" /> money was their name printed in heavier lettering and this resulted in a great deal of confusion.  The State should do it themselves.  It should not be farmed out to business interests.  Is there any reaon why coloured advertising could not be tried?  It is doing very well in the newspapers and I am quite sure business interests would be prepared to pay substantial sums for a coloured advertisement in something like this.  I should be glad if the Minister would think it over.</P>
    <P>I am going to be rather critical about telephones.  For one reason or another the equipment required for extending the telephone service is not available and it is costing much more to purchase it now than it would have done a few years ago.  The demand for telephone extensions far exceeds the ability to supply them.  I cannot understand why, when exchanges were built a few years ago, the Post Office did not carry out a survey to find out present telephone needs and ascertain future telephone needs.  Our exchanges, like some of the new schools built in recent years, are far too small.  It seems ridiculous to have to explain to people who urgently need a telephone, and they are asked to pay enough for it, particularly in country districts, that the new exchange which they saw built a few years ago is almost out of date and they cannot get an extension because there are no lines available.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the system of priority.  I have mentioned this to the Minister on one occasion.  It appears that although there is a heavy demand for lines and lines are there, they are being kept for a priority reason.  When one checks on who the extension was finally given to one finds a rather surprising result.  I had one or two cases recently where it was proved, as far as telephones are concerned, that all men may be equal but some are more equal than others.  It is rather odd to find that somebody who would be entitled to priority living within half a mile of the exchange is not given a line, whereas someone living a mile and a half from the exchange is given a line.  There must be another reason apart from priority and this is something which should not be allowed to <Col N="331" /> continue.  If lines are available in an exchange they should be given out. The question of reserving lines for a particular priority leaves itself open to abuse in more ways than one.  In places where there are heavy demands for lines, increased lines should be made available without delay.  In view of the heavy financial payments that have to be made, the lines would be paid for in a very short time.  Is it a shortage of equipment or is it a shortage of staff?</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the unions, technicians were trained a few years ago but it appears there is a shortage now.  I was recently asked to recommend a man, who had come into the country and married an Irish girl, for a job as a technician.  Even though he was properly trained for the job, I was told he could not be employed. The Post Office cannot be short of staff on the one hand and refuse to employ a trained technician, who having married an Irish girl is an Irish national, on the other.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, as the Minister knows there was a row over the use, by a contractor to the Government, namely the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, of imported French labour for the purpose of carrying out work which it is claimed could be done by Irish personnel.  I should be glad if the Minister would make a statement on that when he is replying to the debate. It is one thing to employ people no matter who they are in order to get the work done but if Irish people are available outsiders should not be brought in until we reach a situation of full employment and that is a long way off.</P>
    <P>Another thing with regard to telephones which is causing trouble is the question of repairs.  A friend of mine telephoned me a few days ago to tell me that he had changed his telephone. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs had put in a new switch for him but it would not work.  He reported it and it was replaced and the new one would not work.  Are the Department using either substandard material or material which has been used before?  This may be an isolated case.  He was looking for me again this morning in connection with the telephone, so I presume it is still not working. <Col N="332" /> The men who operate the telephone service do an excellent job.  They are called out at short notice if something goes wrong.  There must be another reason for this.  Is shoddy material being used in an effort to keep the cost of the telephone service down?</P>
    <P>Have the Department ever given consideration to extending installations to large institutions such as hospitals?  It would be marvellous for people in bed to be able to establish communication with members of their family.  Telephones are available in most private wards in hospitals but they are not available in public wards.  In Britain I was very taken with the trolley telephone which is wheeled around from ward to ward.  A plug next to each bed is all that is required and any patient anxious to get in touch with a relative was able to make a call. This would be very much appreciated in rural Ireland, particularly with the high cost of travel at the present time, and patients would not feel they were so isolated from their families.  The extension of subscriber trunk dialling should help to make this proposal at least worthy of investigation.</P>
    <P>When is it proposed to extend subscriber trunk dialling?  We will probably be told that either the equipment is not there or it is too costly and this is what is holding it up.  I can understand that but I cannot understand the mentality of people who, when they cannot dial a number, ring up the local exchange and if they do not get an immediate reply, are inclined to be abusive to the telephonist.  This is very childish.  People do not seem to realise that the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling meant that the number of telephonists in particular exchanges was drastically reduced.  This was one of the objects of the exercise.</P>
    <P>Some people have the impression that telephonists sit drinking tea and do not bother to answer the switch at all.  If such people worked on a switch for a while, as I did, they would understand how difficult it is to try to keep calls attended to in the order in which they come in.  If one has difficulty in getting a connection for one caller, there is no point in connecting someone else and telling them to wait a few minutes, because the telephonist <Col N="333" /> would have to go right back again and he might have to do this a dozen times during the course of one call.  The telephonist tries to follow through one call and when the connection is made he takes the next call in line.  People should be a little more patient.  We are not a patient nation and those who are accustomed to using dial telephones are very intolerant about any delay in getting calls on the occasions when they have to seek the services of the telephone operator.</P>
    <P>I am only too well aware of the fact that in order to become established civil servants postmen must pass an oral Irish test.  Technical and professional grades can be absolved from this requirement and perhaps the Minister would explain why it is necessary that postmen must do the written and oral tests.  There appears to be a practice of dividing the staff and telling the lower grades that they must conform with the regulations when others do not have to do the same.</P>
    <P>A postman cannot become established unless he passes an oral Irish test, even though he may have passed the written test.  If he is dissatisfied with this situation&mdash;as he might well be &mdash;he can go to England and, simply by clocking up service, he can get an established post in that country.  One can well imagine such a person's feelings about democracy in this country. It certainly is no way to encourage a love of the Irish language and I am utterly opposed to this regulation.  To deny an established post to a worker in this country simply because he cannot pass an oral Irish test&mdash;a language he has little contact with in his ordinary work, other than the odd letter&mdash;is absolutely ridiculous.  The big business people in this country cannot speak Irish&mdash;at times they find it difficult to speak English that can be understood. They get fat on the sweat of Irish workers but nobody criticises them because they do not know Irish.  Yet a postman must know Irish and English, he must pass written and oral Irish tests, before he is allowed to deliver letters.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that the oral Irish requirement is abolished for the lower grades.  If it is retained for promotional purposes <Col N="334" /> for the higher echelons in the Civil Service I will not quarrel with that, although I do not think it is a good idea.  However, it is absolute rubbish to make it a qualification for the man who is earning £12 or £15 a week.</P>
    <P>Last year, and the year before, I asked the Minister the position in relation to the proposed new post office in Donegal.  I am aware of difficulties that can be encountered.  Donegal seems to be unfortunate and perhaps the Minister will let us know when he expects to be in a position to invite tenders and commence operations.  I hope there will be consultation with the staff so that the architects may get the benefit of their suggestions.  I would draw a parallel here with the housewife who has not a voice in the design of the house in which she will live.  There should be some arrangement whereby the views of the housewives might be considered in the matter of house design.  Even where people are building their own homes they frequently have difficulty in getting the architect to design the house to their satisfaction and in accordance with the lay-out they prefer.</P>
    <P>In the case of post offices, it is not unreasonable that people who work in these buildings should be asked for their views.  Their views may not be accepted but at least they should be asked how they think the building should be laid out, having regard to their work.  If the Minister encouraged this practice he would get very helpful suggestions from the staff.  It is not sufficient merely to show the plans to the staff, they should be explained and discussed by professionals with the local staff and in this way each side could learn of the other's difficulties. Valuable contact would be made in this way, which would be to the advantage of all.  This type of joint consultation may be something new but I do not think the Minister is afraid to try out a new venture.  Perhaps some professional eyebrows might be raised but if people are paid to do a job they should be prepared to take advice.  There should be more in joint consultations than sermonising and highfalutin discussion about certain subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that when <Col N="335" /> economies are decided on in building projects the amenities of the staff should not be the first target.  This has happened on more than one occasion and it brings me back to Sheriff Street. The Minister must be aware that in that instance, in the interests of economy, it was decided to remove certain items from the original plan without consultation with the lower echelon of staff. The items removed included dustextractors and arrangements to prevent dust from coming into the building, also ventilation and car parking arrangements. In each case these matters affected the workers.  I appreciate that a great deal of money was spent on erecting the building but it is a pity that arrangements were not made to ensure that dust did not continually enter the building.  One would imagine that the installation of an air-conditioning plant was essential but this was omitted as part of an economy drive.</P>
    <P>Originally, the charge for the air-conditioning plant may have appeared to be large and perhaps the experts decided that it was one large item that could be omitted.  Whoever was responsible for the exclusion of this plant should be obliged to spend the rest of his life with the staff working there&mdash; it would be a fair punishment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should let us know what progress has been made in rectifying the defects.  I am especially interested to know what has been done with regard to the elimination of the coal dust problem.  It is no answer to say it is hoped some time in the distant future that the coal yard will be moved, because there is no possibility that this will happen.  This matter must be rectified before the summer.  The windows facing the coal yard cannot be opened, and, as there is no ventilation, in the summer the place is like a furnace. Even with the windows fully closed, coal dust seeps in and people who have been working in the building for a period tell me that they taste coal dust. I spent one night perhaps in every week on guard duty down at the Pigeon House during the Emergency and it would not matter what you ate for weeks after that it tasted of coal dust.  Just imagine anybody who spent his life under those <Col N="336" /> conditions.  I do not know of any cases of pneumoconiosis.  Claims in respect of this ailment will be made.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say whether arrangements have been made to acquire a premises at Ballsbridge?  I realise that the purse strings are limited and the commercial interests are quick to complain about the postal services but the inevitable situation will have to be faced.  Four or five years ago a suggestion was made that it was not possible to buy a site in this immediate area and that the post office would have to be moved.  It is lunacy to suggest that by waiting two, three or four years a site can be acquired cheaply.  Site costs are going up every year.  I appeal to the Minister to make a start on this problem.  Perhaps the Minister should have compulsory power in regard to the acquisition of sites for postal services which serve the whole community.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say what has been done about the postal premises in Mullingar?  In a busy provincial town like Mullingar the premises should be reasonably good.  The Minister might consider building a premises which would accommodate various Government agencies.  The Government are at present renting accommodation from outside interests.  A new post office should be built.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to rural postmen. I asked a question recently and in reply the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that I would be getting information shortly.  I asked the Minister if he had details of the overtime worked by rural postmen attached to each head office.  The Minister said in reply that he was having the information compiled and would forward it to me.</P>
    <P>That information has not arrived. Last year I also raised the point and the Minister who was then in office was quick to say that he had already got the information which I had asked for and that there were only seven complaints. The Minister will find that there are far more than seven complaints this year.  I have advised the people concerned not to complain to me or to their union but to ensure that their complaints were sent in in the normal way.  Around Christmas-time&mdash;even <Col N="337" /> though there was a big drop in the posting of Christmas cards this year&mdash;the postman who reports at normal time at his post office will have to wait until the delivery comes in, and in many cases the people coming with the post have to deliver letters on their way and are held up at the head office by sorting or on their journeys by deliveries.  Having arrived, they have to sort their own letters and then they must start out, no matter what the weather is like.  Very often these men are working from 7 a.m. until 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.  They work through their lunch hour.  There is no way in which they can get lunch because they are not allowed to go into a house or hotel carrying mail.  They continue around the district until perhaps 9 o'clock at night, although they should have been finished at 2 p.m.  A postman may not get anything to eat until 10 p.m.  A departmental inspector, who never got wet feet delivering letters, will only sanction one hour's overtime instead of seven or eight hours overtime saying that the area is entitled to only one hour's overtime.</P>
    <P>If this matter is not dealt with adequately this year I would advise the postmen to deliver what post they can during the official hours and to bring the remainder back to the post office. This will result in the Christmas mail not being delivered.  I can see no other way of dealing with the situation where people who work hard without too many complaints simply get &ldquo;walked on &rdquo; by people who themselves ensure that they will get whatever is going. This is a petty, pennypinching policy which should be attended to by the Minister himself.  The Minister should ensure that this does not happen again. The amount involved is not very large. It is not amusing for a postman to find his overtime cut after the Christmas is over.  This happens every year.</P>
    <P>Last year I tried to find out whether there was a limit on the overtime or not.  The Minister should not ignore this question.  It is embarrassing for me to be asked questions, having raised this matter in the Dáil, and to be told now by people that nothing was done about this problem.  If there is a limit, how is it arrived at?  Is it on a purely <Col N="338" /> mathematical basis which does not take into account the variations of what happens on different deliveries at different times?  The weather, terrain and exceptionally heavy post are all things which must be considered.  Who sits in judgment on these claims?  Is this done by someone who knows nothing about the difficulties?  I recall asking previously that a number of posts be selected in different parts of the country and tests made.  Occasionally inspectors go on a test run, usually on a very fine day in the summer when there is no rush, except in a seaside resort with extra mail at that period.  The inspectors should choose a day some other time of the year in that case.  It would be a good idea if one of these gentlemen went out two or three days before Christmas with a substantial amount of food and a few flasks of tea to find out what really has to be done by postmen at this particular time.  To the best of my knowledge this has never been done.  I cannot understand anyone who does not know the circumstances sitting in judgment.  There may be an occasional case of overclaiming.  This is human nature but the fact that somebody is suspected of overclaiming, perhaps through no fault of his own but because he was delayed, is no reason why the Department should look for so many hours of free work during the Christmas deliveries.  That is the fairest way to put it.  I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this and to have the matter dealt with.</P>
    <P>Arising from the reply I received last year, I put down a question and the Minister said he would give details. I hope he will do so even though I have spoken now on this debate.  In cases of disputes about overtime would the Minister arrange to have the post tested at Christmas and have the matter judged properly once and for all?</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made at last on the question of gratuities for unestablished postal staff and part-time staff.  I am concerned about cases of hardship among people reaching the age limit.  What criteria are applied in judging these individual cases?  The Press seemed to take incorrectly a point I made last week.  I said that I was glad that the Department were giving <Col N="339" /> small gratuities.  I still hope that, ultimately, like other State services they will reach the stage of giving pensions as well.  The Press seemed to think that no gratutity was given.  I do not want to be unfair to the Department and it is only right that I should mention this point.</P>
    <P>Another matter which causes a lot of trouble in so far as postmen are concerned is the system of naming streets by local authorities.  For instance, the first street in an area may be, say, Limerick Street, the next one may be Limerick Crescent and the next Limerick Drive and so on.  I am only mentioning Limerick because of the Minister's associations with that particular part of the country.  Is there any reason why this system should be used. When writing letters to friends, many people might be aware that these friends live in Limerick something or other but they cannot remember the exact address.  It should be easy to think of different names for the different streets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that some effort might be made to deal with this matter. Even in this city there are a number of streets which bear the same name.  If the name of the area is added to the address, the place will be easy to find but lots of people are not good at remembering the details of addresses. For instance, originally my address was: St. Columbas Villas.  Laytown East, Drogheda.  I decided that this address was much too long so I decided on a short name for my house. I called the house &ldquo;Iona&rdquo; but I was amazed to find shortly afterwards that I was receiving letters from local authorities addressed to me as &ldquo;Iona&rdquo;, St. Columbas Villas, Laytown East. Drogheda. If there had been a dozen more words they would have been added. <Col N="340" /> This sort of thing causes a lot of confusion. There is no reason why the name of a street should be repeated over and over again particularly since the names are sometimes meant to be in memory of people whom we would be glad to forget.  For instance, there are a lot of Mountjoys.</P>
      <P>This must cause delay in the handling of letters.  This question could be borne in mind particularly when streets and roads in new estates are being named.  Local authorities might also help by putting name plates on all streets.  In general that is done in the city but in the towns and villages throughout the country, the local authorities are parsimonious in this matter. The few pounds they would spend on erecting name plates would be of great help in many ways both to visitors and to the postmen.</P>
      <P>Last week when referring to the question of letter boxes I forgot to mention that, while it may be quite easy for a young student to reach down and insert letters into a letter box that may be only six inches from the ground, a postman who might be more than 40 years at the job would have great difficulty in doing this.  There is no reason why letter boxes should be placed so low down and I would ask the Minister to consult with the Department of Local Government as well as with the design people to see whether a letter box could be produced which, first of all, will not trap one's fingers and cut the tops off when letters have been pushed in, and secondly, that the boxes will be placed in such a position that they can be reached easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on the good work they have done in the provision of postmen's uniforms.  These are much smarter than the old uniforms.  However.  I cannot understand why all the uniforms were not issued at the same time.  There are still some postmen who are wearing the old type uniforms.  It is no answer to say that there are still supplies of these in stock because the Department of Defence had a big supply of their old uniforms and they got rid of them very easily.  I am sure the Minister is aware that somebody spent three weeks cutting buttons off new <Col N="341" /> uniforms and burning them in the belief that they were old ones.  I am not suggesting that some of the garments that have passed as uniforms down through the years should be burned but they should be sold or got rid of in some other way and new uniforms supplied to all postmen.</P>
    <P>Staff representatives must have a headache trying to answer questions as to why these uniforms have not yet been supplied in all cases.  There is probably a problem because of the stocks of cloth still on hand.  I suggest that these stocks are not used to make new uniforms for postmen.  Also, I hope that postmen's uniforms will continue to be made in this country and that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will not take a lead from the Department of Defence who had uniforms made outside the country on the grounds that it was a little cheaper to do so.  These uniforms should always be made here.  This question of saving a couple of pence on big orders is nonsense if people at home are thrown out of employment as a result of this because the ultimate cost of the articles plus the payment of unemployment benefit would be very much higher than the cost that would be involved if the uniforms were produced here in the first place.</P>
    <P>We still hear complaints as to ill-fitting garments.  Is the Minister satisfied that the complaints are not justified? If he is not so satisfied, he should endeavour to have some inspection carried out in this regard.  He must remember that postmen as well as counter clerks and telephonists make up the face of his Department and that, therefore, they should be smartly dressed because if somebody is wearing an ill-fitting uniform, even if that uniform is new, he will not look very smart.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider issuing shirts and ties to match the uniforms?  He might do this on a repayment basis.  This is a matter that could be discussed with the unions concerned. Since the Department would be buying in bulk, the cost should be reasonable.  I have mentioned this matter before and I should like to know from the Minister whether any consideration has been given to it.  This <Col N="342" /> might also be of help to some of our industries who are experiencing lean times.  Shirts and ties have been issued in the case of certain State industries. Of course, I am not suggesting that only one shirt should be issued to each person concerned but that a couple would be issued.</P>
    <P>I should likke to mention, also, the dark-coloured raincoat that is worn by driver postmen.  This is the worst possible colour.  It is a danger not only to the driver but to anyone who might happen to be driving past him on a badly-lit street.  Most other authorities who employ drivers have changed the colour of the coats and are now using coats in a colour such as, for example, yellow.  The Minister might also consider this matter.  They should at least be given some visible material which can be seen in the lights.  The armbands worn by some of the cycling postmen did not come before their time, but it would be a pity if the Department was to wait until there was some serious accident before taking action on the drivers' coats.</P>
    <P>A good job has been done on the vans in spite of the fact that someone commented here the other day that he did not like the colour.  I do.  I think the nice, bright colour is quite attractive. I would compliment the Minister on what he and the Department have done in this way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the giving of bonuses or awards for accident-free driving, CIE have a scheme and have gained publicity from it.  The Department have a fairly extensive fleet.  Some recognition should be given to drivers who have accident-free records.  I know there are a great many of them.  The Department employ good drivers, but I do not think the Minister should merely present certificates, although I would not be against that.  Good driving records should be recognised in some more tangible way.  A financial bonus should be given at the end of a year of accident-free driving.  I know some local authorities do it.  They give the bonus, which comes from the insurance scheme for accident-free driving, direct to the driver.  I suggest that should be done.</P>
    <P>Another sore point is the duplication <Col N="343" /> in the arrangements for the testing of drivers.  The Department have special arrangements for training drivers for the Post Office using specially trained, qualified and selected men.  However, notwithstanding the the fact that the Post Office have passed a man who has qualified in the driving course, the same man must still undergo a test by the Department of Local Government.  Is this not ridiculous? Can the Minister not speak to his colleague in Local Government and suggest to him that if his Department have gone to the trouble of training a man, and have satisfied themselves that the man is a good driver, he should not then have to take another test.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that a man could be failed for some flimsy reason, by the Department of Local Government tester even though the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were satisfied that he was a good driver and could do the job for which he was trained.  If that does happen it means that a long time must pass before the driver can pass the second test.  In addition the long period of training is completely lost.  I suggest that this is something which requires urgent attention.  So far as I know the garda and the army are exempt from this test.  The army were not exempt a few years ago but I understand that they are exempt now.  I see no reason why the same arrangements could not apply to the Post Office and, thereby save Local Government testers' time.</P>
    <P>To finish, I wish to touch on two very small points: first, the question of telephone kiosks.  For years I have been the advocate of the erection of telephone kiosks outside country post offices, not inside.  It seems to me ridiculous that a public telephone should be made available in a country area, yet when the post office closes at 5 o'clock&mdash;or at 1 p.m. on Saturdays &mdash;no public telephone service is available to the people of that district until Monday morning.  Is there any good reason why kiosks of a simpler type&mdash; not the sort which apparently costs a lot of money and is subject to vandalism&mdash;should not be erected in the country districts outside post offices thus <Col N="344" /> giving the service at very little extra cost?</P>
    <P>I had a question answered some time ago.  I wrote to the Minister subsequently in regard to Grianán, Stamullen, County Meath, where a local post office&mdash;together with its telephone &mdash;which was housed in a vested county council cottage&mdash;was closed down about three years ago.  That telephone is still there; the lines are still in the house; but the telephone has not been available since the post office was closed.  I asked whether it could be made available and the Minister replied that it was not included in the five year plan and was, therefore, out scrap this five year plan or scrap sthe of the question.  I suggest that he should scrap this five year plan&mdash;or scrap the five year plan of one of his predecessors who might not have had the same ideas about priorities as he has&mdash;and try to do something to regulate this matter, to provide telephones where lines or telephones are available, and to erect kiosks near houses so that they can be protected as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked a question about Donnycarney which needed a telephone because of the large number of old people living in the area.  A number of them came to me and said that they would be prepared to guarantee the protection of a kiosk in case vandals attempted to interfere with it. I got the same reply&mdash;that it was not included in the five year plan and, therefore, the Minister regretted that it would not be possible to install one.  I do not think that is good enough.  I think that the Minister should attempt to have my suggestion at least looked into.</P>
    <P>Sub-postmasters around the country have, for a number of years, been making representations about rates of pay hours of work, and commission they receive on various things.  They provide an excellent service.  There is the old story about sub-postmasters and subpostmistresses who discuss the business of everybody going in and out.  I think that has gone, if it ever existed.</P>

      <P>I speak only about the areas I do know.  I know some decent people in Galway.</P>
      <P>The Minister should review the rates of remuneration for those employed in the sub-post offices.  They are doing an excellent job.  They are providing premises and attendants and are handling a substantial amount of money at rates which, I think, were established 30 or 40 years ago and which have been amended slightly a few times over the years.  I know that they have an active association looking after their interests at the present time.  But one of the things I find wrong with this sort of situation is that, when an organisation makes a claim, it is dealt with by a group of people who tend to deal with it as they see it and the human side of it is seldom brought to the fore.</P>
      <P>I said at the start that I considered the Minister, being new to the job and a young man, was entitled to have new ideas and have a fresh approach to this whole matter.  I suggested that he should include something else in any new approach he has in mind.  He can be assured that the people on these benches are prepared to listen.  All we ask him to do is his best.  He will get the full co-operation of us all.  So far he has made a fairly good start.  I am very grateful to him for the way in which he handles questions in this House, because we had got a tradition growing up in the House of surly answers to simple questions.  The Minister is, in his own way, attempting to change that and to produce a courteous way of dealing with the questions. If he continues to do that, as I am sure he will, I will be glad to co-operate with him at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to thank the Minister for the elaborate statement he made and for the material which was furnished to Deputies some time ago.  I should also like to congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success. <Col N="346" /> As we all know, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are one of the largest employers in the country and therefore merit serious consideration in this House.  This Department employ in the region of 20,500 people. The standards that obtain in that Department and the relationship between the Minister, the management, and the employees, are of vital importance. Otherwise, it would be difficult to see how such a large concern could operate.  Not alone is it one of the largest employers, but it also provides the public with a very responsible service. The Department affects the lives of all of us and it plays a very important part.  By and large a good relationship has existed.</P>
      <P>The granting of political rights to all employees of public bodies was adverted to by other speakers.  If I am a postman, or employed in any other capacity in the Post Office, I should not be denied the right to show my political feelings or to be affiliated to any political party.  We always encourage people to ventilate their feelings and I do not think that trying to stifle political feelings among State employees leads to a good society.  I hope the Minister will look into that aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>By and large, we get a good service from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It has many varied activities. The first one that comes to mind is the postal service.  We could not ask for better than the postal service in Dublin.  The efficient way in which deliveries are made in Dublin city is a credit to the Department.  It is a complex matter to deliver letters in many of the Dublin streets.  Deputy Tully referred to this matter some time ago. There are many streets with similar names in different parts of the city. I understand from the Minister's speech that 90 per cent of the letters are delivered the following day.  This is a great achievement and we can congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also see in the Minister's statement that we have a sub-post office for every 1,300 people.  This may be true in the country but I doubt that it is true of Dublin city.  I know regions like Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Crumlin <Col N="347" /> and I would imagine that the figure in those areas would be nearer 5,000 than 1,300.  It is difficult to allocate a sub-post office to every 1,300 people. I wonder are the people in these sub-post offices overworked.  In some of the built up areas I think they are overworked in proportion to the size of the post office and the numbers employed. Some of them have to work long hours. They played a very important role during the recent bank strike.  If it had not been for the sub-post officer, and the Post Office generally, the situation would have been very serious as regards the flow of money when the banks were closed.  We fell back on these people and we owe them a debt of gratitude.  I wonder are they properly paid.  The Minister should have a look at their remuneration.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a person in a sub-post office recently and he mentioned the changeover to decimal currency. He pointed out that the banks were allowed to close for two days but the sub-post offices were expected to carry out this operation in a half-day.  This was a very short period in which to exject them to change over to decimal currency.  That may be a valid point and I should like the Minister to have a look at it to see if there was a real grievance.  I believe there was.  I know how complicated a matter it is to change over from the old currency to decimal currency.  I know how difficult it is in business and how much more difficult must it have been in a public office where you were handling a lot of money and you had to change over to different types of stamps and postal orders in one half-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> At any rate, they play a very important role in society and they deserve our sympathetic consideration from the financial point of view.</P>
      <P>Many new stamps have been issued, some of them of excellent design.  My only criticism, if I have any at all, is of the shape of the new stamps.  Some of them seemed to be very long which made it difficult to put them on envelopes. This is a very minor criticism. I also see that there is a big improvement in our telex system, this new system which was inaugurated a short time ago but which is expanding every year.  This service is of vital importance to our business community.  When we enter the Common Market more and more use will be made of it and we will be able to make business contacts with commercial firms in Europe and America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The telephone service is a very difficult service to operate successfully. It is not the Minister's fault that many of our public telephones are out of order for a considerable length of time.  It is due to downright vandalism by young people who have no respect for public property and no respect for the service these public telephones provide. It is tragic to see kiosks destroyed especially in built-up areas and in areas in which the people do not have a great number of private telephones.  How this can be checked I do not know. These young people, and sometimes not so young, are to be condemned.  I have seen kiosks which had been repaired and two or three days later they were destroyed again.  Education in civics should be given in the schools to teach children where their responsibilities lie and to teach them respect for public property.  I do not know how much repairs cost the Department but I am sure the figure is pretty substantial. Very often these telephones are out of order when an emergency arises, when people require an ambulance, a doctor, the fire brigade or anything else. Replacing kiosks must be an expensive business.  The existing ones contain a great deal of glass.  If less glass were <Col N="349" /> used repair might not be quite so costly. I have seen new designs recently which, I think, will prove more serviceable.</P>
    <P>There is a big demand for telephones. We now accept the telephone, like the ESB, as part of our daily lives. We often wonder how we managed without it.  There is delay in certain parts of the city but this is probably due to overloading.  When sufficient cables are laid an increased number of calls will be carried without delay. Because the telephone has become such an integral part of our daily lives the number of applications is increasing all the time.  The service is a very useful one.  The day will come when the service will be a paying proposition. That is shown by the Minister's statement. Investment in telephones gives a good return.  Perhaps an independent loan could be floated.  The return on capital invested is quite substantial.  In the year 1969-70 the interest rate was 8.9 per cent.  With that kind of return on capital invested the Post Office will pay its way.</P>
    <P>There has been difficulty in the change over to decimal currency and there are some who are using the new penny piece to operate public telephone kiosks.  The sooner the kiosks are changed the better it will be.  There has been an increase in postal rates.  That was inevitable as a result of the twelfth round.  It does put a burden on business people.  I do not know if that could be avoided.  The twelfth round had to be covered and there was no way of finding the money except by increasing postal rates.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial increase in Post Office savings.  There was a substantial increase during the bank strike.  I hope that those who availed of the Post Office Savings Bank during that strike will continue to do business, or some part of it, with the Post Office. It would not surprise me if a certain amount of those savings remains with the Post Office.  Investments will be encouraged only if the rates of interest are right.  The Minister for Finance in the last Budget encouraged such investment. I am sure that the present Minister will continue on the same line.</P>
    <P>When we come to Radio Telefís Éireann practically everyone has his <Col N="350" /> or her own version of what he or she would like on radio and television. Television plays a very important part. It is one of the most powerful communication media we have.  It is important that the material sent into the homes should be balanced, being both entertaining and enlightening.  It is an important media for the transmission of information.  By and large, Telefís Éireann are doing a reasonably good job with the amount of revenue available to them.  Over 60 per cent of RTE's revenue comes from advertising. I should like to see this figure reduced. Any money given to the RTE authority would be money well spent.  I am informed that the phasing out of cigarette advertising will cost in the region of £300,000.</P>
    <P>In view of the health hazards o cigarette smoking, it is only proper that cigarette advertising should cease I do not believe the public by and large would refuse to give the authority additional money if it becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>Too many advertisements can spoil a programme.  It has been suggested that advertisements be shown at the end of programmes but advertisers very often want their advertisements to appear at specific times.  The Authority should see if it is possible to put advertisements on at a time which is not so annoying to viewers.</P>
    <P>The duty of television is to inform and allow for the airing of views and the Authority are performing this duty as well as they can.  I believe that all sections of the community have an equal right to express their views irrespective of what their views are. However, some groups in our society seem to be getting more than their fair share of publicity on television.  Television invades the privacy of our homes and it is important, especially where children are concerned, that the material on it is of the highest standard.  Minority groups are entitled to express their views on television in proportion to the people who share their views.  We must be careful that minority groups in our community are not over-glamorised and made to look as though this were the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo;.  These people have a technique of getting themselves on television. <Col N="351" /> It is probably not the intention of the TV cameramen to show these people as often as they do but they are so conspicuous that it would be difficult to avoid them.</P>
    <P>Current affairs programmes are very popular and the interviewers on these programmes operate in a balanced way. I heard someone once say that an interviewer took sides on a particular issue. It would be wrong to set a style for interviewing; each interviewer should be allowed to use his own techniques. In this way we get more enlightened interviews.</P>
    <P>I should like to see programmes giving information to social welfare recipients about the benefits they are entitled to.  Perhaps there could be a monthly or a bi-monthly programme on the workings of the Department of Local Government outlining to people where their priorities lie as regards housing.  It is unfortunate to see people who do not even qualify for the waiting list queuing up outside Dublin Corporation every morning for two or three hours.  If there was such a programme on television people would know whether or not they qualified for inclusion on the housing list without having to wait in vain outside Dublin Corporation.  This type of programme would be very useful to society.</P>
    <P>There are many good programmes on the radio especially in the morning. A gentleman named Éamonn Nolan has an excellent programme between 11 and 12 each morning and the volume of information he acquires is fantastic.  This programme is appreciated by housewives and people confined to their homes.  I listen to it and I just do not know how he succeeds in getting such a volume of different information every morning.</P>
    <P>Television and radio play an important role in our lives.  Any remarks I have passed are of a personal nature and may not be shared by others.  My reason for making the remarks is that television, being such a powerful medium, can exert a tremendous influence on young people.  By and large, Telefís Éireann have done a good job and <Col N="352" /> the staff carry out their work in an efficient manner.  If we critise them at times it is done in a constructive manner, in the hope that better programmes will result.  We appreciate that RTE are limited by the finances available to them.  They have not the tremendous financial resources of the BBC and some European stations but, having regard to the amount of money available, RTE are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>In Dublin communal aerials are being erected in the majority of new housing schemes.  This is an excellent idea and is an improvement on the old type of aerials.  It was most distasteful to see the vast numbers of old type aerials throughout the city and I hope that in time the entire city will be served by communal aerials.  The advent of the communal aerial presents a challenge to RTE because it is possible now to obtain much improved reception from the BBC and Ulster television.  RTE must maintain programme standards if they are to retain their viewers.  In this matter there is also the possibility that advertising revenue will diminish because Irish firms may transfer their advertisements to other stations if they find that viewers are not tuned to RTE.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement.  I wish him every success in his office.  His Department employs 20,000 people and plays an important role in the life of the country.  The Minister should ensure that standards are kept at a high level, that there is a good relationship between management and staff and that his employees are recognised and treated as human beings.  I realise that in such a large Department it is easy to become impersonal but I know the Minister's attitude in this matter and I am sure he will do his utmost to ensure that there are good relationships between management and employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Estimate has covered a wide field.  We have heard about hidden cameras, television bugging and &ldquo;television spongers&rdquo;&mdash;we did not hear about phone tapping but perhaps we heard enough on the topic during the year.  The Seven days Inquiry has been mentioned but I shall not go into that matter. <Col N="353" /> Vandalism has been mentioned many times and all Deputies who spoke have condemned it.  We should try to decide on the approach to adopt in dealing with this matter.  In the case of interference with public telephones. perhaps some system of alarm bell that would ring on the outside of the booth and thereby attract attention would be worthy of consideration. This would not be required in every phone booth but only where there have been repeated attempts to destroy the kiosk.  Perhaps it could be arranged that the alarm system would be connected withm Garda stations&mdash;as is sometimes done by firms for sacurity purposes.</P>
      <P>I should like to see greater efforts being made to install telephones in Galway city.  The staff in Galway are doing an excellent job but the area is developing rapidly and telephonic communication plays an important role in this progress.  If standards in this regard are not high, progress can be impeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned on many occasions the matter of privacy in post offices, especially in sub-offices.  Frequently there are long queues, whether for children's allowances or other business. In many instances old people might wish to deposit a few shillings in the post office but it is difficult for them to do this when they have inquisitive people breathing down their necks in an effort to find out how much money they are lodging.  I would compare this inquisitive type of person with Minnie in the television serial &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; and this kind of person is found in every post office queue.  They try to find out every detail about the business being transacted as, for example, how much money a wife might receive from an absent husband and very frequently they render it impossible for people to conduct business in the post office.  The Minister should do everything he can to ensure that it is possible to conduct business with a reasonable degree of privacy and in this connection he might consider the provision of some kind of shuttering.  I raised this point in regard to the General Post Office in Galway.  That was appreciated.  If the Minister wants <Col N="354" /> to hold the money which he got into the post office during the bank strike he should provide for greater privacy. The big tycoons would not bother, but the people with a few shillings to save would use the post office if they had privacy.</P>
    <P>Many post offices and sub-post offices around Dublin have been robbed.  I mentioned the vandalism in phone booths.  Robbery is a worse form of vandalism.  In post offices there are often old ladies who do a good job but who are not fit to deal with these attacks.  I doubt if hefty young lads could do so either.  Money should not be left on the counter where it can be easily grabbed.</P>
    <P>In this House there should be more telephone lines to the Department of Social Welfare.  This Department is used to the full by every Member of this House.  More lines are needed to that Department.  The staff there work hard and are cheerful at most times.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of postal addresses.  The older postmen know the local areas and everyone in them. Around Christmas the staff is augmented and it is hard on the temporary people to find the houses. This is really a question for the Minister for Local Government and he should see that name plates are put on housing estates.  Th numbers should be put on gate-posts and not on the hall doors.</P>

      <P>I did not like the way in which the local elections were handled by certain interviewers at the time of the last local elections.  We experienced one particular case where a Fine Gael man headed the poll but because of the way in which the interviewers concerned talked about the other two people who were elected, one would be left with the impression that the Fine Gael man was an &ldquo;also ran&rdquo;.  It is about time that we had proper presentation of programmes on these elections at the time of polling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I refer to tourism, I hope that I shall not be ruled out of order because <Col N="357" /> in this context television can play a major role.  I am not advocating colour television but since, I understand, we are to have it, it could be used to portray the many shades of this country. Our country could be shown on the screen when it is at its best.  The only patches of green that lots of Dublin people have ever seen are in the Phoenix Park because they may not have ever left Dublin to go on a holiday&mdash;although, of course, they might have been to Glasgow, Liverpool and such other places.  If such areas of Ireland as the beautifuly Shannon area or the golden west could be highhighlighted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While we are on this question of colour television it would not be any harm to make some people aware of the actual colours of our national flag&mdash;green, white and orange, whether we like it or not, is for the Orangemen.  There are about 40 shades of green groups scattered throughout the country.  I am not talking now about the Green Property Development Company but about the 40 shades of political parties in the country.  In so far as our national flag is concerned, we tend to forget the orange but it is about time that we let the Orangeman know that he, too, has a say in our flag.</P>
      <P>From the little I have seen of cross-Channel television programmes I would say that our station can hold its own with any of them, especially when one considers the great financial backing that these concerns across Channel enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to news broadcasts, I would suggest that a synopsis of the news be read on television at the end of the main bulletin as is done in the case of radio.  That would be helpful at times.  While I do not always agree with Deputy Dowling, I am in agreement with him in relation to what he said about the publicity given on television to dissident groups.  We have the Danny the Reds, the Lily the Pinks and others highlighted on our television medium.  We will not mention the Ard-Fheis <Col N="358" /> at this point but I suppose some of the people to whom I am referring got into the RDS.  However, these people are given publicity to the extent that would indicate they were standard setters in our society but they are not wanted in this country.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister is to provide a radio station for the Gaeltacht. Beidh Fáilte le sin.  This is to be welcomed but I hope that the station will not fall into the hands of the party hacks or their well wishers.  I see a lot of them lined up and ready to take over but I will name them in this House on the day they take over RTE in Connemara. These are people who have not the slightest idea of what will be required. Those who are put in charge of this station should be people who have a deep love of our national culture.  I would hope, also, that we would not have &ldquo;ya-ya&rdquo; type of music on this station.</P>
    <P>Interviewers, at times, are very aggressive in their approach.  I mean aggressive in the sense that they do not wait for a person to answer the questions they have put before going on to the next question.  All the time, they are trying to highlight themselves.  This is irritating not only to the people who are being interviewed but also to the viewing audience.  I might say at this point that some of our best interviewers are now with the BBC.</P>
    <P>Television programmes cannot be expected to please all of the people all of the time and they should not be designed to do so.  That would be the rock on which they would perish.  However, a good job is being done. Although we hear people time and again condemn <i>The Late Late Show,</i> we see them rushing home, Saturday after Saturday, to be in time to view the show and that in itself must be a tribute to it.  I wish the Minister luck with the work he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few brief words with regard to my experience with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  First of all, I am glad to note that business is growing extensively throughout the country, particularly in the borough areas, but, unfortunately, the Department have not provided for the amount of business <Col N="359" /> that has accumulated.  On at least a dozen occasions we, in the city of Limerick, have submitted legitimate claims for sub-post offices.  We are an expanding city due to the hard and efficient work of the Limerick Corporation and we have built our houses well in advance of any other area in the country.  But, while we have done that, no provision has been made to give these people in the corporation estates any kind of post office service. Not only that but in some of these estates we have only a daily delivery. I took that matter up with our local postmaster some six or eight months ago and it is still under consideration. There is one particular estate which I have in mind, the O'Malley estate.  There are at the moment about 1,000 houses and there are no post office facilities.  Adjacent to that estate we have the Kennedy estate, giving us a total of about 2,000 or 2,500 houses.  These people have to come into the city of Limerick, particularly the old people, to collect their widows' and old age pensions, and all the other social benefits that are paid through the post office.  No provision has been made, despite the recommendations that have been sent to the Department over the last two or three years.  I would ask the Minister to apply himself to this alarming, as I call it, situation where these unfortunate people are asked to come three miles to the local post office to collect their old age pensions and all the other essential benefits paid through the post offices.</P>
      <P>I think that while telephones pay their own way, and make a substantial profit as they should, the delay in the installation of telephones is something I cannot understand.  Furthermore I cannot understand the deposit required from an applicant for a telephone.  I know there have been defaulters; nevertheless the demand made by the Department for installation is excessive. I would ask the Minister to reconsider the deposits demanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the rural areas a night service is provided.  Six to ten people benefit from the night service; the doctor, the veterinary surgeon, the priest, and <Col N="360" /> other local people, who all share the same line.  If I wish to call one of them all the telephones ring because they all share the same line.  This should not happen because any such call is more or less a private one and our neighbours can know about it by listening in on the call.  Deputy Coogan has already said that we do get inquisitive people who want to know everybody's business and forget about their own.  I would ask the Minister to try to rectify the night service.  If so he will be doing justice and a good job for the people in these areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to be constructive about telephone kiosks.  I know these present a problem.  In one night in Limerick, within the past four months, 12 or 14 kiosks were damaged.  This represents a problem because detection and follow-up are very difficult.  However, I am sure that local shopkeepers in such areas, or maybe a private householder in one of these estates, would, for a small fee, allow a public telephone to be operated on his premises.  That would obviate the temptation and the opportunity for larceny.  I know these larcenies are rampant everywhere.  The public telephone kiosk represents a temptation to a man or a group on the prowl at night.  These larcenies are general in Limerick.  From my experience, what I have suggested would present the best solution.  I hope the Minister will avail himself of my experience.</P>
    <P>Telephones are more essential at the present time than the morning post. Any business man depends more on a telephone than on anything else, not only at his place of business but at home.  A new Minister has taken over the Department.  I have said here before that I have received a greater service from him than from any of his predecessors with regard to the installation of telephones.  Let me place that on record.  I am the first to say it. However when a man is in business he also wants a telephone contact at home.  I think the installation of telephones should be speeded up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers told us years ago that the equipment for kiosks was coming from Sweden and elsewhere and that that caused the hold-up.  But the hold-up has been going on for years and years. <Col N="361" /> Surely someone in the Department must be making an assessment, or they should be.  If they are not, then they are not doing their duty.  They should see the phenomenal developments which are going on, particularly in Limerick, in connection with house-building. Although we must provide services for the people in the corporation estates, we must also provide them for people in business and industry around places such as Limerick and Shannon.  They need telephones as much as they need anything else in their homes.  The Minister should get his Department to work providing these things, which are necessities in any man's work today.  We all know that a man without a telephone is like a man without a limb.</P>
    <P>Concerning commemoration stamps, the Minister has commemorated people from all over the globe, so far as I know.  I just glanced through the Minister's speech because I had not intended to speak on this Estimate.  I find that people from all over the globe have been honoured by us with commemorative stamps.  Last year when I was in the position I was in, which got me into a lot of trouble&mdash;however, we battled out of that too, and we will battle again&mdash;I suggested to the Department that a stamp should be issued to commemorate the brutal murders of two former mayors and a volunteer in Limerick.  The three of them were brutally murdered on the same night.  This is the 50th anniversary of their murder and the President is honouring them next Sunday by coming down to participate in the unveiling of a memorial which we have erected to honour those three men.</P>
    <P>I am not taking from Tomás MacCurtain&mdash;no greater man ever lived, I suppose&mdash;but he was commemorated. Kevin Barry was commemorated and other.  If I could find the names of the people who were commemorated the Minister would realise that his predecessor was very unfair with regard to our claim for a commemorative stamp for those three murdered men in Limerick.  I hope the Minister will make a statement promising that this commemorative stamp will be issued next year.  I know these things cannot be done overnight.  The <Col N="362" /> Department got timely notice.  I was hardly a week or a fortnight in office when I gave them notice.  It was the first thing that struck me because I had a connection with one of the murdered men.  He was taken out of the house of an uncle of mine on that night.  Therefore, I had a personal interest in this.</P>
    <P>Now I find other people from other countries have been commemorated but there is no commemoration for the three greatest men Limerick ever produced. As I say the President is coming down to Limerick next Sunday to honour these three men, no doubt at great personal inconvenience bearing in mind the weather and his age.  I would ask the Minister to rectify something for which he is not responsible, because I do not blame him for this.  I know that if he occupied the position then which he occupies now something would have been done.  I am sure of that.  I hope the Minister will promise us this in his reply so that the people of Limerick will realise that the Minister wants to honour these men with a commemorative stamp.  This will allay the fears and grievances we have in Limerick about this matter.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to touch on is withdrawals from post offices.  The people who invest their money in the Post Office are generally the small investors. A day may come when they will want an instant withdrawal for one reason or another.  It could be for a funeral or anything else.  There is a delay of two or three days, or perhaps more.  A person can walk into a bank and write his cheque and there is no more about it.  The money is handed out to him.  This should apply also to the Post Office book.  If a person goes into a post office with a Post Office book, if he is not known by the official at the counter, it is very easy to have him identified and he should get his money.  Instead, the application has to come up to the GPO, down again, and up again, and down again, with the result that he has to wait for two, three or four days for the withdrawal. I see no good reason for this.  He should have the same facilities as he would have if the money were lodged in a bank.  As a matter of fact, he should <Col N="363" /> get better facilities because when the book is produced the post office official immediately sees what is to his credit.  That does not apply in the case of bank withdrawals.  If there is any question of identification that should be the only hold up in relation to these withdrawals from the Post Office.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of confusion at election times with regard to the register.  We all know that the registers are produced in a slap-dash fashion and that they are not compiled as they should be.  As we all know, they are handed over to rate collectors, and the rate collectors sub-let them or subcontract them to somebody else, and give them so much per thousand to collect the names of people who are eligible to vote.  Nobody is better informed than the local postman.  I do not want to put extra work on him but I think he is the man to do this job.  He should be paid accordingly, instead of the local rate collector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making this suggestion in relation to the postman who goes to the letter box, as Deputy Coogan says.  I do not know where else postmen could go anyway.  I suppose that is his way of saying it.  Every cripple has his own way of running. The postmen are the men for this job. If they were properly remunerated on the same basis as the rate collectors we would have a more concise and up-to-date voters list.  We all know the confusion that arises two days before an election: &ldquo;I have no card.  I have no vote.  I have been living here for four years.  What will I do?&rdquo;  That is caused by the slap-dash methods which prevail at the moment.  I would ask the Minister to discuss this matter with the Minister for Local Government.  I think he is the man in charge of it. He should see that this exercise is transferred to his Department thereby avoiding all this confusion on polling day with people thinking they have a vote but the lazy or incompetent rate collector has not got them on the voters list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about the <Col N="364" /> engineering section of the Department. It is highly technical and it is becoming more technical every day.  I have experience of the engineering section.  I have been through it and I know the work these men have to do and the training they have to undergo in order to qualify as Post Office engineers.  I would suggest to the Minister that there should be special classes in vocational schools to cater for this demand.  The scholarships are good enough in their own way, but any man who has his group certificate, or his intermediate certificate, which is the same thing, who wants to undergo this training should be catered for in the local vocational school.  It is intricate and highly technical and it takes years to qualify.  I would advise the setting-up of these classes. May I mention Limerick once more? If the Minister gives us the green light we will make provision in the vocational education committee in Limerick for the setting up of these classes.  I shall raise this matter at a meeting of Limerick City Vocational Education Committee to-night and suggest that a recommendation should go out to the Minister for the establishment of an engineering class in the vocational school which can be tapped by the Minister if and when he requires trained personnel.</P>
    <P>Decimalisation has created a problem from the point of view of telephone coin boxes.  There are people who are using the new penny piece instead of the old sixpenny piece.  This should have been foreseen and provided against.  There was a lack of foresight in this respect.  The businessman who has a coin box on his premises is now required to make good the deficiency when the coin box is collected.  That sort of thing should not have been allowed to happen.  One has to give credit, I suppose, when one finds someone smarter than oneself but it would want to be a very smart fellow who would outsmart the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some people have been critical about radio and television.  This is a highly skilled and technical matter.  It takes tremendous organisation.  Anyone who has contributed to programmes knows how meticulous the staff are in having the correct coverage.  I know the way <Col N="365" /> in which these people work.  In my own experience in Limerick they were excellent in their approach and in their organisation.  There was not a single hitch.  Everything was timed to a split second.  That takes some doing.  A good job is being done on both radio and television and I pay tribute to the staff for their work.  One is kept abreast of events practically all day long on the radio.  On television there could be a greater emphasis on our own culture and tradition instead of all the canned programmes.</P>
    <P>I have given the Minister and his Department the benefit of my experience. Outside of the eastern seaboard people have no choice of programme though they pay the same licence fee and the same price for their television sets.  I would ask the Minister and his Department to rectify that position and to treat the west and the midlands in the same way as the east is treated.</P>
    <P>I have not come in here to criticise. I have come in to help.  I hope what I have said will be noted by the Minister. I congratulate him on what he has done in the short time he has been in the Department.  He has been most cooperative and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has become an occasion for criticism of both television and radio. According to a newspaper commentator the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs and for Agriculture are the two debates in which most Members participate.  Does this mean that RTE is of equal importance with agriculture, which is our major industry? There is no need for me to go into the relative importance of State Departments here.  Suffice to say we are now dealing with the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>I find the appearance of the announcers and the continuity personnel quite satisfactory.  This is true of both men and women.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins fault some of the male announcers.  She found their appearance offensive.  I think they show excellent taste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment now <Col N="366" /> the relationship between RTE and our most important industry, agriculture. As agriculture is our major source of wealth it contributes to the upkeep of RTE.  Does RTE do enough for agriculture? Is RTE constantly and consciously aiding and promoting agriculture? Those responsible for programme planning must always be on the look-out for ways and means of helping the farming community.  If the Authority were asked if it is always doing what is best to promote agriculture the answer must be a definite &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; they would be foolish to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sometimes&rdquo; because if agriculture fails we will all fail.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; is an entertaining programme and seems to be going down well in rural areas.  Does it do enough to bring home to the ordinary citizen the basics of agriculture?  Some rudimentary farming information is contained in it which should help to enlighten those people who are ignorant of the basics of agriculture.  It is my contention that every person in this country should know something about the basics of farming, if not from a practical point of view in theory anyway.  We are an agricultural country and places like Dublin, Belfast, Limerick and Cork are served by the agricultural hinterland.  The bulk of our industries have an agricultural base.  It is my belief that RTE programmes on farming should enlighten the ordinary citizen.  We often hear people ask the difference between a ewe and a ram.  The ordinary man in the street should know a great deal more about farming.</P>
    <P>RTE should devote much of its energy to educating the practising farmer. There are some programmes which benefit the practising farmer but much more could be done in this respect.  I should like to know how often inter-Departmental talks take place between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in relation to the programmes to be broadcast on television.  I think there should be frequent meetings between these Departments and co-operation on programmes.  Such meetings would <Col N="367" /> be bound to improve the content of the programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>If programmes for the young and middle-aged farmer were broadcast on television, ordinary working class people living in towns would be able to see what is involved in agriculture.</P>
      <P>The greatest contribution RTE can make to the community is a cultural one.  A recent programme on Clara gave a completely wrong impression of the people and workers in Clara.  I come from Clara and I know that the majority of Clara people have never once thought Clara was doomed.  For generations, indeed, since Grattan's Parliament, Clara people have experience of industry.  Clara knows what it owes to the Fianna Fáil Party for keeping industry going there through very difficult times.  The people of Clara are confident that the redundancy we now have will be rectified.  We had a programme on television which tried to portray Clara as a doomed town. It is alarming that our national television is so interested in showing pictures of doom and dismay with no regard for the whole truth, whereas in most cases the future is bright and there is plenty of hope for the future.</P>
      <P>I saw the programme in relation to Clara and I remember that it wound up with a scene of a cemetry.  The programme did not show the true picture.  As a Deputy for the area it is my duty to point out to the people in Montrose who were responsible for producing the programme that it conveyed a false impression of the actual situation.  When I say this I am speaking for most of the people in Clara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> RTE should always try to give the facts of the situation and in the case I have mentioned the production was anything but true.  People were interviewed on that occasion who were supposed to be workers from Goodbodys, the company concerned.  One of the people interviewed may have worked in Goodbodys five or six years ago but another person who was interviewed did not work in the company at any time.  It should be brought to the notice of the Minister that this programme conveyed an entirely false impression of Clara.</P>
    <P>In regard to education RTE could play an important part.  There are educational programmes on television that could be of great benefit to the children.  However, many of the programmes are not shown at times when the children are in a position to see them and in this respect some inter-departmental consultations are necessary. Educational programmes can be of great benefit, but it is essential that they be screened at suitable times for the children.</P>
    <P>RTE have a vital role in the matter of adult education.  We are on the fringe of entry into the EEC.  We should see to it that educational programmes which would benefit all sections of the community&mdash;farmers, professional people, business people and tradesmen &mdash;are given sufficient coverage on our national television station.  With foresight and thought this could be arranged and television is the most appropriate medium to use in this regard.  Middle-aged citizens did not have the benefit of the facilities now available to our younger generation and they should not be deprived of the benefits of adult education at this stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the appeal being made by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann to have more traditional Irish music on the national station.  Perhaps those in authority consider that there is a sufficient number of such programmes now on the air but against the fierce competition of popular music our native music needs some advantage. Only the best in our Irish culture should be produced by RTE and this should be done more frequently and more professionally.  Irish dancing and <Col N="369" /> music is rather like hurling in that it is essential that any programmes on these matters should be produced in an efficient and disciplined manner&mdash; otherwise they do not come across very well.  The emphasis should be laid on professionalism in regard to Irish music and dancing.  The Irish viewer is anxious to get more such programmes. I do not know why RTE do not arrange for more such programmes.  There is at most an hour's programme of Irish music and dancing each week.  Rural Deputies will agree with me when I say that there should be a half-hour daily devoted to such programmes.</P>
    <P>Violence is shown on the screen.  The greatest culprit in this respect is the news.  People regard our teenagers as more violent than those of 20 years ago.  This is incorrect.  We cannot blame television if they are violent.  The younger viewers seem to be bored by the news items.  Our news programmes seem to portray violence all over the world.</P>
    <P>There is a diminishing return from advertising on television.  Where are RTE to get further finance?  We will have to pay more for our licences.  This is not a popular thing to say.  If our programmes were geared to educate people television could do much.  The ordinary man in the street would not mind paying extra in such circumstances. If he had proper programmes for himself and his family he would not begrudge an extra £1 or £2.  We should all contribute to the upkeep of our radio and television facilities.  The State makes a contribution.  What contributions are made by others such as semi-State bodies and huge corporations? Everyone in our land could benefit from vibrant programmes on RTE.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that our pensioners are exempt from paying for television licences.  This is of immense value and importance to them.  It is a comfort to know that our senior citizens can relax and look at television at the expense of the State.</P>
    <P>The people in Montrose could do much more if more finance was made available.  Those who downgrade the efforts of the people in Montrose should come forward with a plan for <Col N="370" /> increasing finance and ways and means of getting round the problems.  If we pay an extra fee then certainly we are entitled to more enlightening programmes.  Entertaining programmes are also necessary.  The Eurovision Song Contest will be shown on television shortly.  This is an opportunity for exposing our culture to EEC countries. This is an opportune time for RTE to portray the Irish people in the true sense through advertising.  There will be intervals during the programmes and millions of Europeans will be watching.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increased stamp prices I wish to say that the postal services are second to none.  We cannot have an excellent service without paying for it.  If any Deputy criticises the postal service as inadequate he should look at the facts and figures and point to any country in the world where there are not daily complaints.  Complaints about the telephone services happen everywhere.  In the US there are thousands of complaints daily about the telephones and they are better geared than we are.  We are doing a fairly good job in this regard.</P>
    <P>Getting back now to the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; Inquiry which we had, I must say that if there was no inquiry, if the inquiry had not been held, there would have been criticism but, since it was held, there is still a lot of criticism.  The Opposition roared for this inquiry but, in fact, they groaned after it had taken place.  The main lesson to be learned from the inquiry is that newsmen should always be objective.</P>
    <P>In this context, I might recall a programme which I saw on television some time ago in relation to coursing. That particular programme was very much anti-coursing.  On a subsequent programme, when the people concerned in the production of the programme were subjected to questioning, their replies were very evasive; they did not answer properly the questions put to them.  I am not here to discuss coursing but I am a coursing enthusiast.  On that particular programme, we were shown one course a number of times and, as it happened, the hare had been killed on the occasion concerned.  It is not right that RTE <Col N="371" /> should portray this image in relation to coursing.  Coursing is essential to our greyhound industry, an industry which is important to our economy.  The programme I have referred to, because of the way it was presented, could have done a great deal of harm to this industry.  I suppose we might say that the camera cannot lie but it can be made to lie.  In other words, the cameraman can lie.  Therefore, I would stress the importance of there being more responsibility on the part of programme producers.</P>
    <P>In regard to other aspects of the Department, I would remind the Minister that telephone kiosks are essential in remote parts of the country where, as a rule, there is no other form of communication.  There may not be a motor car available in the event of an emergency where a priest or doctor would be required.  Therefore, regardless of cost, telephone kiosks should be erected in remote areas.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to commend the Minister on the activities of his Department and I would ask him to consider carefully the views I have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, it is only fair that, as a fellow Limerick man, I should congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Also, I thank him for the courtesy, help and consideration that he has extended to me on all occasions on which I have made representations to him.</P>
      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been regarded down through the years as a kind of Cinderella Department, a kind of limbo or state of punishment where some souls suffer for a time before proceeding to higher ministries.  However, with the colossal advances in science and technology and the rapid development of communications, &ldquo;Posts and Telegraphs&rdquo; is a misnomer and is an entirely inadequate title.  I would prefer that the Department would be regarded as a Department of telecommunications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the present Minister for Health was Minister for Transport and <Col N="372" /> Power, he suggested the setting up of a department of telecommunications. In the modern world, communications play a vitally important role and now that we are contemplating entry to the EEC we should be very much aware of this.  I have studied inter-transport in relation to the EEC and this has made me very much aware of the vital role that communications can play in a modern economy.  It is important for the future development of Irish industry, agriculture and tourism that we have an efficient communications network.</P>
    <P>For that reason I was interested in the report of a study undertaken by the Confederation of Irish Industry into the question of communications in relation to industrial development.  They have expressed some criticism of the telephone and telex service.  I am not competent to comment on the accuracy of that service, but there is a considerable amount of food for thought in the report.  I am sure the Minister has seen the survey and will take note of what I have said.</P>
    <P>The telephone and telex services have a vital role to play in national development in all sectors of our economy.  That is why I hope that during this breathing space we have before we become members of the EEC every effort will be made, and the money will be made available, to ensure that telephone and telex services are comparable to the services in European countries.</P>
    <P>Concerning the activities in connection with the tourist industry, I have had the opportunity to see the telex service in operation.  The telex is an absolutely necessary piece of equipment for the tourist industry and the travel trade.  I have heard adverse criticisms of the efficiency of the Irish telex service.  I have seen many examples which illustrate the efficiency of the service between Britain and Ireland.  The same goes for the telephone service.  There seems to have been a tremendous improvement in the last couple of years in telex and telephonic communications between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are certain problem areas in relation to the telephone service.  I <Col N="373" /> hope that the extension of the automatic service all over the country will eventually lead to a situation where we have efficient telephone services. Rather than deal with minor criticisms of the telephone service in particular areas I would prefer to look at this whole question within the broader field of communications.</P>
    <P>In the future the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have an increasingly important role to play in our national development by ensuring that our communications network is all it should be.  Concerning the question of the demand for telephone service, and the speed with which that demand is being met, like every other Deputy I have frequently made representations to the Minister on behalf of constituents who are waiting for telephones. I have expressed my appreciation of the Minister's kindness on those occasions and his prompt response to any representations I make.  The demand for telephone service, particularly in the rural parts of Ireland, is going to increase.  The telephone has made a tremendous difference to life in rural Ireland and has helped to make farm life more attractive because no matter how isolated a farmhouse may be, if it is connected to the telephone service, no one&mdash;particularly the young farmer&mdash;feels isolated.  It is a vitally important piece of equipment and I know there is a tremendous increase in the demand for telephones from the farming community.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to speed up the supply of telephones and reduce the present backlog to the point at which people seeking telephones will be able to get them within a reasonable space of time.</P>
    <P>There have been tremendous changes in the postal service over the past few years.  We have seen the transition from postmen on bicycles to postmen in motorised transport. When this change took place a couple of years ago I expressed concern in the House about the problem of the auxiliary postmen made redundant who did not qualify for pensions, <i>et cetera.</i> I hope that any future cases of this nature&mdash;where auxiliary postmen are made redundant&mdash;will be <Col N="374" /> dealt with as sympathetically as possible by the Minister.  The past generations of auxiliary postmen were, in fact, temporary postmen: for 30 years they were auxiliary postmen, unestablished. That situation was unsatisfactory and unfair.  On the whole those men were badly treated.</P>
    <P>When the change came from foot to bicycle and then to motor transport delivery, there were a number of complaints from people that they were receiving their mail at a much later hour.  That is inevitable.  A postman driving a van will cover an area formerly covered by five or six postmen on bicycles.  Thus the last people on his round will not receive their post until the afternoon perhaps.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that the motorised service has become more efficient.  The postmen operating the service, after a year or two of experience, become very efficient and able to effect much speedier deliveries than formerly.  The position should be kept under review because the ways and means of speeding up delivery and ensuring that people receive their mail earlier are vitally important.</P>
    <P>The five-day week was inevitable and had to come.  There was no great argument in favour of having postal deliveries, outside Dublin, six days a week.  The five-day week must come and will eventually be applied to the whole country.  A five-day postal delivery service is an inevitable and logical follow-up of the five-day week in commerce and industry.</P>
    <P>Speaking earlier, Deputy Coughlan, who comes from the same constituency as myself, referred to the commemorative stamps.  I should like to endorse what he said regarding the special stamps to commemorate the former martyr Mayors of Limerick, Clancy, and O'Callaghan, and Volunteer Clune. I do not wish to put the Minister in an embarrassing situation, because he is a Limerick man.  I know the Minister will be in full agreement with me and will be delighted to have a stamp to commemorate that event.  As Deputy Coughlan pointed out, there will be a very special commemoration at Limerick next Saturday and Sunday attended by the President of Ireland <Col N="375" /> and other State dignitaries.  We are somewhat disappointed that the Minister did not find it possible to issue a special commemorative stamp.  He explained to the committee, when representations were made to him, and to public representatives from Limerick who had discussions with him, that there were certain technical difficulties in the way.  Perhaps before the year is out it might be possible for him to issue a stamp commemorating those martyred men.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion during this debate on Radio Telefís Éireann.  Various viewpoints have been put forward and many Deputies have adopted the role of programme critics.  I do not propose to do that because, like many other Deputies, I very rarely have an opportunity of watching television.  Occasionally I have an opportunity to listen to the radio in my car.  I do not propose to be critical of individuals or individual programmes.  I prefer to take a broader viewpoint and to look at the role of radio and television in our national life.  It is important at this stage&mdash;our television service has been in operation for ten years now&mdash;that we should take stock of what our television service has done for the country.  In what way has television influenced national thinking and the national life?  This is a vital and fundamental question, a question which should be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about it.  Television is a very sensitive area so far as politicians are concerned.  We have to admit this.  During this debate various Deputies from different sides of the House were for or against television programmes because they reflected their own viewpoints or did not support their party policy.  As I said, I am more concerned with looking at the broader picture.  What influence has television had on the national life and, from the point of view of a member of Dáil Éireann, what influence has it had on the political outlook of our people? What part has it played in bringing home to the people the role of Parliament in our national life and the work of Deputies?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> When I was a very new Member of this House in 1961 or 1962, speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the first time, I said that I looked on television as being a very powerful medium with a very great potential for making people, and particularly our younger people, aware of the role which Parliament plays in the life of this country.  I expressed a second view which is more important still and more significant.  I said that television properly used could do a tremendous job in inculcating in our younger people a proper respect for and a proper consciousness of our Parliament and a proper appreciation of what Parliament is all about.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves what influence television has had on the political outlook of our people.  I am not talking about party politics but about the political views and feelings, and the political education if you like, of our people.  I must confess that I am sadly disappointed.  So far as politics is concerned and portraying our Parliamentary institutions and the role and responsibilities and performance of Deputies to the people of Ireland, our television service has fallen down very badly.  I would go further and say that it has done a good deal of damage.</P>
    <P>What I want to get across here is that, so far as straight reporting of the Dáil proceedings is concerned, the Parliamentary reporters employed by Radio Telefís Éireann are second to none in this or any other country.  The Parliamentary correspondents who give short sketches of the happenings in the Dáil at news time are absolutely superb at their job.  Without exception these reporters are consistently unbiased and unprejudiced and they are remarkable for their brevity and the concise manner in which the picture is painted.  I want to pay tribute publicly to the Parliamentary reporters employed by Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>On every occasion on which I have spoken on this Estimate I have referred to one particular programme.  I suppose it is really an extension of the Parliamentary reports.  I am referring to the programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; which is transmitted on sound radio.  I <Col N="377" /> stated here on previous occasions that, in my opinion, this is the outstanding political broadcast transmitted on either radio or television.  It is an outstanding programme because it gets across to the people of Ireland&mdash;the Deputy who spoke before me advocated that they should be told the truth &mdash;what Deputies and Ministers have said and not what some so-called expert or commentator thinks they said. This is very important.</P>
    <P>I suggested to two of the Minister's predecessors that it would be a great idea&mdash;and from inquiries I have made I think there would not be any technical obstacle in the way&mdash;to have &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; transmitted on television. The tape would be available and it would not be a difficult job to devise an attractive way of presenting this excellent programme on television.  Like the short sketches on the news, this programme is totally unbiased and everyone gets a fair crack of the whip.  A very accurate picture is presented each night of the most important proceedings in the Dáil during the day.  I would ask the Minister to look into ways and means of transmitting &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; on television.  I am informed by a most reliable technical expert that there would be no difficulty about that.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Deputy Briscoe, a member of the Minister's party, has advocated this on a number of occasions.  I have heard people say what a pity it is that this programme is not beamed on television.  It is vitally important that Parliament should be projected to the people.  RTE has fallen down badly on the job. Those responsible for producing certain programmes with a political content seem to forget that everyone of us who has the honour and privilege of being elected to this Parliament has been sent here to represent the electorate and we have to account for our stewardship every so many years.  The gentlemen who devise these programmes on television seem to have overlooked this fact.  If they think this has gone unnoticed they are living in a fool's paradise.  I warn them that some of us have caught on to the tactics and to what they are trying to put across <Col N="378" /> on certain current affairs programmes. Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins adverted to this.</P>
    <P>Certain people have been trying to put across a certain political philosophy and have been trying to ram that philosophy down people's throats. It is being done in a subtle way, a way they think has gone unnoticed.  In attempting to put this philosophy across they have consistently used on their programmes a select group from the Members of the Oireachtas.  There is a tendency to expose the same few Members all the time.  I am not now talking about any particular party.  I am talking about the tendency to expose certain Deputies continuously to the people.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that those who get the most exposure are those who represent the political philosophy that certain people in Telefís Éireann have been trying to put across.  If our radio and television service&mdash;television in particular&mdash;is going to dabble in politics, to present political programmes, to portray Parliament and Parliamentary proceedings, it is vitally important that the programmes should portray Parliament as it is and the Members of Parliament as the representatives of the people, representing the whole broad spectrum of the nation, the philosophies, the different outlooks and so forth.  All Deputies should have an equal opportunity of putting forward their points of view.</P>
    <P>We are not all television personalities and I have no desire to go on television. I am talking quite objectively. It is absolutely wrong that only a select few, a certain type of public representative, should be put forward as representing the Dáil.  On the one hand, there is the continuous exposure of what might be called the intellectual, ultra-sophisticated progressives and, on the other hand, you have the exposure of way-out Members with extreme views.  They are entitled to their views and I respect them but, in between, you have the broad majority of Deputies on both sides who also represent the people and I think the time has come when the whole approach of television programmers from the point of view of political and <Col N="379" /> current affairs programmes needs to be radically altered.</P>
    <P>The political broadcasts some years back may not have been very sophisticated or up to the standards of the intellectuals in our community but they were enjoyed by the ordinary people.  &ldquo;Open House&rdquo; was an interesting programme and it gave the people in the various constituencies an opportunity of seeing and hearing their own Deputies.  It was thoroughly enjoyable. It is time now to have a look at the whole question of political broadcasting to see if some new formula could be devised which would make it possible to have political broadcasts next winter.  I am very keen on the idea and very conscious of the role television could play in all aspects of national life.  I am more conscious, however, of the role it could play in giving people a proper understanding of Parliament and the part Parliament plays.  Making people aware of what goes on here is the only way to engender a respect for our Parliamentary institutions.  This can be done very effectively through the medium of television. To sum up, I believe that political broadcasts and current affairs programmes in so far as they deal with political matters should reflect Parliament as it is, a representative assembly representing all sections, all classes and all creeds.  All are entitled to portrayal on our national medium.</P>
    <P>It has been announced that a Gaeltacht radio service is to be initiated. I hope this will prove to be successful. I must confess I am very sceptical about the wisdom of introducing this particular service because, unfortunately, the Gaeltacht areas have been depopulated.  I regret that special recognition was not given to the Gaeltacht many years ago.  While every effort should be made to preserve the Irish language we have to face facts. There is no use talking about preserving the language and preserving the Gaeltacht by means of radio unless we can provide ways and means of keeping people in those areas.  It is an interesting experiment and I hope it will make the contribution we expect it to in relation to the preservation of the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> In view of our vast overseas population of emigrants and missionaries people have often asked me why we do not have a short wave radio station so that these people could maintain some contact with their homeland.  This is a recurrent topic, but it was brought home to me recently when I received a letter from a priest in South America who said that short wave radio was the one thing he would strongly advocate. While the cost may have been prohibitive in the past it might be possible to look at this now in a realistic way.  Apart from the fact that we have some obligation to our emigrants in Britain and America and our missionaries in the five continents a short wave radio station could be an effective means of promoting tourism.  It would help to project an image of Ireland abroad and it would be a means of promoting exports and industrial development and of attracting industrialists to this country.  Now that it is possible to introduce a special Gaeltacht radio service it might be possible to have a short wave radio station in order that our exiles abroad, particularly our missionaries living in isolated places, could maintain a link with their homeland.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Eurovision Song Contest is being held in Dublin this year.  It was a tremendous achievement to get this to Dublin.  I have no doubt that the expense will be justified when one realises that it will be broadcast to hundreds of millions of viewers.  Deputy Crowley yesterday made a suggestion in relation to the programme which, having thought about it since, I think was a very good one.  He suggested that during the interval Bord Fáilte might be able to show a short film.  This will publicise Ireland as a tourist country in a way that would otherwise cost millions of pounds to do.  I hope entertainment, apart from the actual singing of the artists representing different countries, will also be provided.  I trust that any groups asked to perform will be top notch performers.  I heard within the past few days that among the groups who will be appearing are the Bunratty Castle Singers, a group of which we are all proud.  If the Bunratty Castle Singers are on that programme <Col N="381" /> no one will be more delighted than I. I have no doubt they will live up to their international reputation and project a proper image of Ireland and make hundreds of thousands of tourists all over Europe want to come and partake of our medieval banquets at Bunratty Castle.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies have complained that there are too many canned programmes on television and that more programmes of Irish music and so forth should be shown.  One hears this criticism very frequently up and down the country.  People complain there are not enough Irish programmes, I do not mean programmes in the Irish language, but programmes of Irish culture. With the vast amount of musical talent there is in the country it should be possible for RTE to devise one or two programmes a week to give an opportunity to the tremendous fund of latent talent available.  I do not think the cost would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Those are the only points I have to make on the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an innovation in the Minister's Estimate this year and that is the inclusion of a graph which gives a fund of information on the workings of the Post Office.  The Minister must be complimented on this. The Minister with his comprehensive review has given us plenty of material for discussion.</P>
      <P>Sub-post offices throughout the country are painted a dark green and inside most have a Victorian atmosphere about them.  I am not sure if, so far as decor is concerned, this is under the Minister's direct control.  I should like to see sub-post offices, particularly in rural areas, as places where people could obtain information not only on matters relating to the post office but on facets of the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>The post offices pay pensions and various types of relief and, whilst most of the personnel in the post offices do their best to answer any queries from their customers it would be desirable that we should have an information centre, or perhaps a kind of ombudsman who would give information that might be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be helpful if sub-post <Col N="382" /> offices were painted in a distinctive colour.  The post office vans have been painted what I call a flame colour and, although this may not be to everybody's taste, it has the advantage of being distinctive. If sub-post offices were painted in a distinctive colour it would help many old people who have trouble in locating the offices at the moment.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction the high ratio of post offices in this country.  According to the Minister's statistics there is one sub-post office to every 1,300 inhabitants. In Britain the ratio is one sub-post office to every 2,200 inhabitants; in Austria one to 3,100; in Italy one to 4,000.  However, even with this high ratio of offices it is quite common to have to wait for a considerable time in a busy post office in this city.  We must be thankful for the fact that we have a high rating in the matter of the provision of post offices and hope that the small improvements that have been mentioned may be carried out.  I am particularly interested that provision be made for the supply of information persons may need in regard to social welfare matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us detailed statistics in regard to the telephone service. Every Deputy has received representations from his constituents at some time regarding the installation of telephones. An applicant must take his place on the waiting list, which is the only fair way of dealing with the matter.  At the same time we should consider the possibility of increasing the rate of installation and clearing some of the backlog.  A telephone is an essential item for a man who may wish to start up in business; it is also essential in rural areas where people may be far from the services of hospitals and doctors.  We have passed the stage when the telephone was regarded as a status symbol; it is now an essential service and everything possible should be done to reduce the backlog in the provision of telephones.</P>
    <P>There is also a tremendous demand for public telephone kiosks.  In Dublin one is saddened by the destruction that is being caused to kiosks by vandals. The fact that a public telephone is not in working order may have serious <Col N="383" /> consequences for a person who wishes to make an urgent telephone call for medical help.  It is our duty to stop this vandalism.  Perhaps the engineers in the Minister's Department would examine the possibility of installing telephone kiosks close to houses.  The ESB do this with their transformer stations.  They are often installed quite near a house, with the permission of the owner concerned.  If the same course of action were pursued in the siting of kiosks it might have the effect of reducing the vandalism.  I realise that frequently kiosks are erected quite a distance away from houses in an effort to facilitate as many users as possible but there is little use in erecting kiosks if they are wrecked by vandals.  The destruction of kiosks is not confined to any section of the city&mdash;it occurs also in the more affluent areas of Dublin. It is little consolation to know that similar destructive acts are carried out in many other countries throughout Europe.  We must do all we can to prevent these outrages.  If there is a breakdown in any part of the public service we do our best to seek a remedy.  A telephone service is part of the public service and we must try to improve the situation in this regard.</P>
    <P>It can be said that, by and large, the staff in the post offices are reasonably well looked after.  There are few more popular figures in our society today than the postmen and it is essential that these men should be adequately paid and their service appreciated. However, in recent times, in the Dublin area there has been no postal delivery on Saturday mornings.  I appreciate the fact that the postmen like the rest of us want a five-day week and they have got this now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether a person who voluntarily seeks treatment for drug addiction may be sent to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin, for custodial care for his addiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of those suffering from drug abuse and drug dependence <Col N="386" /> is being dealt with at three different levels.  In co-operation with the Dublin Health Authority the Jervis Street Hospital authorities operate a clinic and advisory service in that hospital. The Dublin Health Authority at its new adolescent unit at Usher's Island will provide treatment for those who can be dealt with in an &ldquo;open&rdquo; environment.</P>
    <P>The new drug unit in the grounds of the Central Mental Hospital will provide services for unstable cases who cannot be treated in an &ldquo;open&rdquo; unit. The decision to provide this security unit arose from the experience of the authority in attempting to treat such cases in a residential unit at St. Dymphna's, North Circular Road, where a large proportion of the patients were found to be unmanageable.  I am satisfied that the steps as detailed will provide a comprehensive service and that the services being provided at Jervis Street and Usher's Island should encourage young persons to seek early treatment.</P>
    <P>Voluntary patients will be accepted for treatment at the Dundrum unit which, however, as I have already explained, is primarily intended as a security unit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean that if a person goes in voluntarily as a patient he can be forcibly detained at Dundrum? Is that permissible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think that under the Mental Treatment Act a person may voluntarily ask for a stay in a mental hospital under compulsion for a period of six months if such person is addicted to drink or drugs.  He may voluntarily ask to be placed under security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that we are still only touching the tip of the iceberg of this problem? People are alarmed at the increasing incidence of drug abuse in Dublin at the present time.  Is the Minister aware that there is no compulsion on people to make them take treatment and only two of every hundered people treated for drug addiction in the last year or two have given up drugs, according to a newspaper article recently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would get a much more authoritative statement than mere rumour from the Working Party on Drug Abuse which has presented its final and full report to me.  I propose to publish a summary of the findings of that report soon and to publish the full report at a later date.  We are completely up to date about the amount of drug abuse.  We regard the steps we have taken up to now as sufficient.  There are some further steps to be taken including possible amendment of the law and including the question of education as to the risks.  That is a matter of very great difficulty because it is now known to the public in general that some experiments in a crash campaign in a certain part of Great Britain have resulted in an increase of 15 per cent in the intake of drugs by schoolchildren so that anything which is done publicly must be done with the greatest possible care.  The committee have suggested a course of action to me in their report.  I will now examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In a mental hospital one is particularly careful about the voluntary patient and if he wants to go he is allowed to go unless he is a person who is suicidal or homicidal, or something like that.  The suggestion is now that a person could come in for treatment voluntarily and find himself in a place like Dundrum for six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask another question about this.  The position is that a person can come to the health authority, or to a psychiatrist and say &ldquo;I want to be cured and I do not want to be let out.&rdquo;  The Deputy is right in saying that a person would have certain rights to be let out if he said &ldquo;I do not want to stay&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not adverted to that point.  The question of drug addiction is so serious that a person wanting to be cured should be prepared to go into the new unit at the governor's house in the central hospital.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of our taking action against practices of a dumping nature within the enlarged Community has not been abandoned. The Deputy's question does not, therefore, arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the document which the Deputy received, as a result of discussions between the Irish delegation and the Commission it is our understanding that if difficulties should arise for Irish industry after the transitional period, as a result of practices which would not be dumping but which would be of a dumping nature &mdash;the Deputy understands that there would not be dumping in a Common Market&mdash;recourse could be had to certain Articles of the provisions of the EEC Treaty, Articles 7, 85, 86 and 92.</P>
      <P>With regard to possible dumping from third countries after the transitional period, we discussed with the Commission the circumstances in which an Irish industry would normally qualify for treatment as a community producing industry and for which special provision can be made under the EEC anti-dumping regulations. In the light of the information we received we do not consider it necessary to pursue further in the negotiations the question of possible practices of a dumping nature after the transitional period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if the Government's ready acceptance of these explanations means that if a case occurs which we can, for the sake of simplicity, describe as dumping, between ourselves and another Community country after the transitional period we could, under these Articles, be able to take immediate unilateral action in the first instance so as to justify it after the event?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

There will not be different and separate markets but one market.  The Deputy might just as well say that dumping in Donegal is not dumping in Dublin.  There are provisions to protect us.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the cross-Channel services operated by Aer Lingus are, on the whole, geared towards feeding the transatlantic services and that it is a well-known fact that there are numerous complaints from the people I mentioned regarding the unsuitability of these services?  I am amazed that the Minister for Transport and Power knows so little about the unsuitability of these services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, neither Aer Lingus nor Bord Fáilte have received complaints from travel agents in regard to this matter.  There was one complaint last year but it transpired that the company concerned were satisfied that Aer Lingus had met their requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus are increasing the frequency of their services in 1971 from Great Britain to this country according to the character of the services. I do not know whether the <Col N="395" /> Deputy had the experience which I and my successor have had in meeting those who were concerned with the marketing arrangements in Aer Lingus on which a total of about £4 million was spent including £1 million advertising.  I would say they are among the most dynamic marketeers I have ever met.</P>
    <P>The idea that they are not taking every opportunity to develop services of all kinds, wherever they can be economic, is quite absurd.  Aer Lingus is a company with, comparatively speaking, short haul services both across the Atlantic and to Europe. Therefore, the overheads, expressed as a proportion of total cost, are larger than those of almost any other international airline of note.  In spite of that, Aer Lingus is able to put aside profits for further development of both services and company, which is proof of the efficiency of the company.  I know they can always be more efficient.  I know they make mistakes.  But they are certainly one of the most dynamic marketing organisations I have ever encountered.</P>

      <P>(a)  The Manchester/Shannon service was inaugurated on 31st May, 1965.</P>

I agree with the Deputy that the reason why it has not been able to get off the ground properly is that the money which it was originally proposed to invest in the company was not forthcoming subsequently. One of the difficulties that arise is the recession in sales, irrespective of the type of produce that was to be produced there.  The fact is that there was a major difficulty in having it marketed.  It must be appreciated that the grant allocated to this industry was allocated on the basis that it was geared for exports.  During the past month the bulk of the marketing was on the local market which, in fact, is already pretty well overloaded.  There would be no point in advancing further moneys to keep this industry open if its only purpose was to produce for the home market with resultant unemployment or disemployment affecting other firms.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in recent months some of this produce was marketed on the home market because capital was not coming forward from abroad and the company found itself in a very tight cash situation?  Since the company got into difficulties it has had offers from three people to invest a further £30,000 in it.  One man made an offer to the extent of £15,000.  At least these three people have faith in the future of this company.  The Government are only being asked to advance twice as much as these three people together and to protect the jobs of 76 people.  Does the Minister know that this company recently appointed a sales manager for England who left another firm in this country because he is confident that the new firm in Cobh will be considerably better than the one he has left?</P>

    <P>On Sunday, 21st February, 1971, the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre was informed by the Garda Síochána at Miltown Malbay that the body of a young man had been washed ashore near Fintra, County Clare, and also that the wreckage of a small boat which could have been a ship's lifeboat, had been washed ashore near Spanish Point, County Clare, on the previous day.  The maritime duty officer discussed the matter with the commanding officer, Haulbowline.  After consideration of the evidence available, the maritime duty officer decided that further action on the part of the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre was not called for.  On Monday, 22nd February, 1971, the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre was advised by the Garda Síochána at Miltown Malbay that a second body had been found at Mutton Island and that wreckage of planks, onions and oranges were being washed ashore <Col N="414" /> between Miltown Malbay and Lahinch.

      <P>Every effort has been made to expedite a decision in this case.  The Deputy must be reasonable. As I have said, the contract documents&mdash;the estimated cost of the scheme being £17,400&mdash;were approved in June and a loan application to <Col N="422" /> finance this scheme was submitted on 30th October.  The scheme is held up pending receipt of the tender for approval and the other question that has since cropped up in relation to the foreshore licences which the local authority were seeking to enable them to establish a point in regard to the outfall of effluent from the sewer.  The fisheries division of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries had to be consulted; Bord Fáilte and all of these bodies were asked for their views on the question of the outfall.  A final decision cannot be made until these views are available.  We have expressed our anxiety to get the information from these bodies and thus be in a position to make a decision on the matter as quickly as possible.</P>

There was no question of confining cyclists to certain streets.  They are entitled to use streets on which bus lanes are marked but for their own safety they were specially requested to use public transport on those streets for the present week.  In order to encourage cyclists to avail of public transport on the bus lane routes a cycle park was made available at Fairview and a special appeal was made in the schools in the area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Restrictions on parking in Dublin are governed by the Dublin Parking Bye-Laws, 1969, made by the Garda Commissioner after consultation with the local authorities concerned and with my consent.  These bye-laws provide for the control and regulation of parking by means of traffic signs.  Any alteration, therefore, in parking restrictions in Dublin city would be a matter for the Garda in consultation with Dublin Corporation and would be effected by the alteration of the appropriate traffic signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that it would be a good idea for his Department to get in touch with Dublin Corporation and the Garda Commissioner and ask them to bring the no-parking signs to within 20 yards of the corner, thereby giving an extra 30 yards at each end of the street?  This would allow parking space for an extra 40 cars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a little too facile.  When one is dealing with streets that are not of the same length or width, and which have different conditions operating in each of them, a <Col N="425" /> figure of 20 yards could not be applied overall.

The operation of the system in Dublin is a matter for Dublin Corporation or the Garda, depending on whether notices are issued by traffic wardens or by the Garda, and I am not empowered to interfere with their exercise of that power.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that parking prohibitions or restrictions do not apply while goods are being loaded or unloaded even though the vehicle involved is parked in a place where parking is prohibited.  Also, a goods vehicle may be parked for 30 minutes, or longer at the discretion of a traffic warden or a member of the Garda Síochána, in a loading bay for the purpose of loading or unloading and may be parked for 30 minutes for the same purpose in a meter parking place without paying the meter fee.

There are 418,000 rated holdings of agricultural land but only 36,000, or one-twelfth, of these benefited from the employment allowance. <Col N="431" /> The average employment allowance paid in the year 1969-70 was only £16.32.  It is clear that an increase in the allowance would be of no benefit to some farmers because they do not qualify for the present allowance.</P>

They also prescribe that a person shall not use a vehicle in a public place so that it emits smoke or oily substances which could be prevented by the exercise of reasonable care.  Compliance with these requirements can assist in reducing air pollution by vehicles.  In reply to an earlier question, I mentioned that CIE are doing research on this problem in relation to buses.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was speaking about the damage to public telephone kiosks in this city and I expressed the hope that the Post Office engineers would make every effort to ensure that the city and other parts of the country would have an adequate public telephone service.  The position appears to worsen each year. We can only ask those who can bring an influence to bear on the culprits to discourage them from committing these acts of vandalism.</P>
      <P>I mentioned also the question of no postal deliveries in the city on Saturday mornings.  We realised that postmen, as did others, sought a five-day week so I do not know what the answer to the problem might be.  If a person should miss the post on a Thursday, it is likely that the letter will not be received until Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The increases in postal charges which were effected some time ago were not very popular.  The graphs of rising expenditure bring home to us what a tremendous State industry our postal service is.  There was a time when the postal service was not running at a loss but that day has gone.  Of course, the Post Office services are much better now than what they were before.  The charges are higher and these charges bear very heavily on most sections of the community.  They bear particularly heavily on any persons engaged in the work of charitable organisations. Will the Minister consider the position of recognised charities when he comes to give concessions as regards postal charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new stamp designs have a high standard.  The name of the country is printed in Irish on them.  Foreigners have the idea that it refers to the Twenty-six Counties.  The name of Ulster could be equated with that.  Would the Minister consider having a bilingual stamp?  It might correct any erroneous impression that the other six counties are excluded. The English version of the constitution gives the name of Éire as &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and it might be difficult to get it all on the stamp.  Perhaps the Minister <Col N="437" /> could look into this matter.  People throughout the world who receive our stamps could be shown that the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; covers the whole country and not one part of it.</P>
    <P>We know it is easy to criticise the radio and television services.  What do we expect of them?  Sometimes they have got to be all things to all men.  Very few of us will agree on a programme to look at all the time.  We want the service to provide information, education and entertainment.  In the educational sense the service has tremendous power; it could be run at a reasonably low cost, yet reach millions of our people.  Other countries have universities of the air, utilising radio and television in an educational way.  We have done the same thing with Telefís Scoile and educational programmes, but they have never been co-ordinated although they are quite good.  RTE should have an educational division whose sole duty would be to prepare or acquire educational programmes to be transmitted after working hours to benefit people wanting further education.</P>
    <P>The radio and television media have a glorious opportunity to become a part of the national scene, which has not happened so far.  This station is not the property of any group inside or outside the RTE : it belongs to the people.  So far it has failed to reflect the national aspirations.  When the television service was opened ten years ago it was said that people would not compare Telefís Éireann with foreign stations.  It is now only a struggling babe.  Given a few years it will come up to the standard of the outside stations.  Telefís Éireann has not got the resources to put on such lavish programmes as the others.  It is ten years old.  In some ways it has succeeded; in others it has failed.</P>
    <P>I should mention the Saturday night Late Late Show.  It has a crude vitality. Plenty of hard work goes into it but the subject matter leaves a lot to be desired.  Late on Saturday nights people turn away from that show and switch on English soccer matches.  The BBC puts on two soccer matches, after which people can see two further matches from Belfast.  Four soccer matches in one night is too much. <Col N="438" /> People do that, having chosen the lesser of the two evils.  They either look at the Late Late Show for one and a half hours or they watch four soccer matches in succession for nearly three hours, which is a pity.</P>
    <P>Up until March last year the wireless and television licences of 40,000 households were not renewed.  I do not know if these people cannot pay or whether they have got rid of their radios and television sets.  We looked forward greatly to having our own television station.  The people are now not using it as much as they might have done.  I am trying to be quite fair to the people in RTE.  I appreciate that to turn out programmes every night of the week, hour after hour, takes some doing.  If their audience reaction measurement is giving the right feedback they will realise that the people want programmes which are wholesome and which reflect our outlook on matters generally.</P>
    <P>We are aware that there may be some people in RTE who want to put over some kind of philosophy which is not subscribed to by the majority of the people.  If they want to do that on the streets, that is their privilege in a democracy, but there should not be any attempt to put over a socialist programme, or a capitalist one for that matter, under the guise of amusement, entertainment or education.</P>
    <P>Last year an outside broadcast unit went to Berlin and made a programme contrasting life in East and West Berlin.  It was heavily weighted in favour of East Berlin, despite the fact that some of the pictures we see every day show that the standard of life is much higher in West Berlin.  I protested to a member of the RTE staff and he admitted that he had received other protests.  If I want to think about Berlin or Germany, I want to do my own thinking on it.  I do not want to have it done for me by somebody in RTE.  This programme was slanted.  It may be considered that I am not very liberal in my views on this matter, but a member of the staff of RTE admitted to me that they had received other protests that the programme was slanted.</P>
    <P>If we are to look to the national television service to raise the quality <Col N="439" /> of our national life, we have the right to demand that this should be done. We have the right to demand that the taxpayer who is paying the piper calls the tune and that we get a fair service on matters political.  There was some criticism of the programmes dealing with the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis. I have no fault to find with the programmes or with the cameras on that occasion.  If there are happenings and the cameras show them, it is the duty of the cameramen to show them.  Telefís Éireann were criticised for showing films of the northern troubles from 1969 up to recently.  It was suggested that they had inflamed the troubles there.  In fairness to the staff of RTE who went to the North, and who were in danger of great violence and injury at all times, they went in there and they brought back the pictures of what was happening in the North.  They did not fake the pictures any more than they faked them in Dublin.  It has been suggested that this aggravated the trouble.</P>
    <P>The point is that any programme on Telefís Éireann may aggravate some situation.  I will not criticise them for it.  If there have been happenings here and in the North which they reported without any gimmickry or trickery I will stand by them.  Let them show what happens and let the viewers make up their minds on the rights or wrongs of the situation.  We do not want any group in Telefís Éireann presenting a philosophy to suit themselves.</P>
    <P>In a democracy, means of communication, especially radio and television, must be watched very vigilantly all the time.  The medium must be the servant of the people and not their master. We hear television sets referred to as the one-eyed monster.  We can appreciate that unless there is a balanced approach both inside the station and outside it we could create a frightful monster which would try to mould the minds of the mass of the people.  To prevent this we should have a completely free television service and when I say &ldquo;free&rdquo; I mean that it should be free from any influences which might tend to colour the picture presented. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance <Col N="440" /> and the price of a really free and independent television service is that it must be watched all the time.  Otherwise some day we may regret that we were not more watchful.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I look to the television service not only to entertain and educate and instruct but also to try to improve the quality of life so far as possible.  We see discussion programmes and interviews with individuals which are presented very well indeed and in a fair manner, both by the interviewed and the interviewers.  One can see the greatly improving standards of the interviewers.  This is as it should be.  Whether we belong to the Fianna Fáil, the Fine Gael, or the Labour Party, we should be the watchdogs of the people and, while we are entitled to our political viewpoint, we are not entitled to shove it down the throats of others.  A State service must not be allowed to become a kind of political monster.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said from the Fine Gael benches that some politicians dominate the national screen.  I do not know if that is true because I am not the most avid television viewer.  I have very little time to watch television. There seems to be a suggestion that if you admit you are not a television viewer this gives you a higher status. The in-phrase is: &ldquo;I heard it on the radio&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;I saw it on television&rdquo;. If one is an RTE viewer one must endure the advertisements from which the station gets a very big slice of its revenue.  I suppose that is understandable. Watching some of the advertisements, and particularly the advertisements for detergents, I often feel that I could be watching television in Leeds or Blackburn or somewhere in Lancashire because they all seem to be foreign made.  Nothing is left to the imagination of the housewife who uses these detergents.</P>
    <P>Time after time they come on. Surely we could be given a respite of an hour perhaps from these.  We used to attack the drinking advertising on Telefís Éireann.  I suppose it is still worthy of comment but I wonder what the plans are for recouping the losses which will be incurred when cigarette and tobacco advertising is <Col N="441" /> phased out completely.  This advertising must contribute a huge amount of revenue.  We must face the fact that this is coming to an end.  Are we prepared to pay a higher licence fee for such very mediocre programmes on the national grid?  It has been proved, I think fairly conclusively, that chest troubles and lung troubles may well be checked by phasing out this kind of advertising.  If that is so what we lose on the swings we will gain on the roundabouts.  At the same time we will have to find enough money to keep the station going.  I doubt if people will be prepared to pay higher licence fees unless they can tune in to a station the outlook of which is more in keeping with national aspirations and a better reflection of our national culture and traditions.  The station should be such that we would realise it was our own national station and not some pale reflection of a cross-channel station.</P>
    <P>Television viewing may become more widespread with the development of piped television.  However, this carries a threat to RTE, because in many parts of this city and elsewhere in the country one can receive quite good reception from outside the country.  I am informed by those canvassing for piped television that, when it is installed, there will be very good reception from outside stations.  I do not know whether or not this is true but, if it is true, I can see RTE facing fierce competition.  The people will pay their licences but I doubt if RTE, while collecting the fees, will be entirely happy with the idea that the people who are paying them are not looking at RTE programmes.</P>
    <P>Piped television will mean the disappearance of aerials and for this we must be grateful.  It will also bring more competition from outside stations We can only hope that in the near future we will see a great improvement in our programmes on both radio and television.  It is very tempting to import films and I am told it is a very cheap method of producing a programme. It must be doubly tempting to an authority which has not got all the money it would like to put on first-class programmes.  Like all of us the authority must cut its cloth according <Col N="442" /> to its measure.  They have to work within their resources.  I bewail the fact that we do not have more native drama but I understand this is very costly. With the co-operation of Equity and the theatrical profession generally I think some scheme could be worked out whereby we would have drama twice a week at least.  We have many dramatists of our own.  We have an occasional drama programme, not as often certainly as we would like.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a call for more traditional Irish music.  There is a great demand obviously for this type of music.  It is not possible, of course, to please everybody but I think the authority will have to stand back and take a serious look at itself to see just where it is going.  The figures the Minister gave show an unhealthy development. There has been an enlargement of radio programmes and this is welcomed by housewives and by girls working in offices and factories.  Radio has done some good work, but we cannot divorce the two and the authority will have to have a serious look at itself.  If it does not do that I predict that we will have an even bigger number of unrenewed licences next year.  The number of licences dropped by 40,000.  Even deducting those who died or left the country there must be a tremendous number who decided they would not or could not afford the licence fee.  There is food for thought in that for Telefís Éireann.  If RTE does not face the challenge I can see them receding out of the picture.  People will not bother to look at the home-produced programmes. That may sound gloomy but I base my argument on the figures the Minister has given us.  These were prepared by the Minister's Department with the co-operation of RTE.  I trust the Minister will continue the good work he is doing.  Most Deputies will thank the Minister for the grants he has given.  This is an innovation.  I hope next year there will be more innovations and a better service.</P>

      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a non-controversial one and from a Ministerial point of view it must be an extremely interesting Department, for many <Col N="443" /> reasons, particularly for the reason mentioned by Deputy Moore, the indirect control of the television service.</P>
      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is an interesting Department because it is a State company which has existed since the formation of the State. The Department provides an essential service but a high element of social service is also involved.  A postal, telephone and telegraph service cannot be provided purely on actuarial grounds which would appeal to the business mind.  Private enterprise would find it would not pay to deliver letters to people in remote areas of Connemara, Donegal, Galway and even Wicklow. On the whole the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has ploughed a fairly careful line between the actuarial and the social demands of a service of this kind.  Generally speaking the community is reasonably satisfied with the service given over the whole ambit of operations which the Department is responsible for.  I gain a certain amount of satisfaction out of this because it was the establishment of the principle in which, of course, I have complete belief, that the State is competent and capable of organising the most complex operation extremely efficiently and when social considerations are involved the State is much more thoughtful than private enterprise would be.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said he is going to set up a committee to investigate the postal services generally.  I welcome this because while I admire many of the provisions of the Posts and Telegraphs service and the general principles underlined there, I believe a very rigid bureaucratic machine has been established in the Department.  This, to me, is an undesirable development because it leads to inefficiency in the ultimate and in relation to the people working within the system it leads to a great sense of frustration and helplessness.  It also tends to destroy initiative and reduce the enthusiasm which people down the line have for carrying out their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticisms I have just made are legitimate criticisms made by conservative politicians and social theorists about the dangers of the establishment of State bureaucracies in a socialist <Col N="444" /> society.  Because an organisation of this kind provides both a functional and social service I should like to know if the Minister is aware that a fairly rigidly structured bureaucracy exists in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. If I were in his position, and I know the Minister does not share my views on socialism, but as a person concerned with the efficiency of the organisation I should be anxious to investigate and destroy this with the purpose of creating in some way a greater sense of involvement down the line in the Department, essentially centering around the general principle of achieving a devolution of power from the centre to the periphery.  This would lead to a greater sense of efficiency, concern and involvement of the people in the service, and probably a reduction in costs and happier and better working conditions.</P>
    <P>Because this Department has existed so long and because it is fairly predictable in its demands on the community and Minister it would be a relatively easy Department in which to try to establish different forms of control so that there was greater autonomy throughout the system.  A very superficial example would be the right of a postmaster down the country to decide whether or not to make any physical changes in his office without having to refer back to the Department. The Minister knows that an attempt is being made to regionalise groupings, expenditure and budgets in relation to the health services.  If the Minister could devise some remedial action to deal with the bureaucracy that exists in his Department it might be of help to other Departments.  It would be easier to do this in the Minister's Department because of the flexibility of the demands of the services provided by his Department throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I hope this investigation will be wide ranging and that all interests will be represented.  I do not believe in abusing the Civil Service as an intractable, close-minded, rigid group of individuals, who are incapable of making any change.  There is a tendency for any bureaucracy whether it is a local authority or a central authority to become rigid in its attitudes because from <Col N="445" /> time to time it feels let down by people at the periphery either because it makes stupid decisions, corrupt decisions or improper decisions.  As a dedicated democrat I am always anxious to see that decision-making is pushed back down towards the periphery rather than centralised as it appears to be centralised in this particular Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to this committee, will the Minister make sure that it is not composed predominantly of civil servants who may have a vested interest in retaining a system they know how to operate and which, if it was to be changed in any fundamental way, would make greater demands on them? I should like to see the inclusion of persons who have been concerned with some of the other semi-State bodies such as CIE, the ESB, Bord na Móna and Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann as well as persons in business, including efficiency experts.  There should be enough disparate elements of training and business and administrative technocracy to ensure that there would be a useful cross-fertilisation of ideas.  In this way the various interests would learn from one another and the end product of their work would help the Minister in his task of providing an efficient service at the lowest cost to the community.</P>
    <P>References to the bank strike have been made by practically every Minister. This is understandable because this dispute caused an enormous upset to business, to Government Departments, to local authorities and to private individuals.  All people were inconvenienced by the bank strike, particularly as the banks have a monopoly position in the community and there was no serious alternative to the banking system.  Many people now find themselves in trouble for one reason or another, because of the misuse of cheques and so on.  The housing programme was affected and there were very damaging consequences of the banking dispute.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I asked the Minister in a parliamentary question if he would give serious consideration to the establishment of a post office giro system. This system is used extensively throughout <Col N="446" /> Europe and it is a matter we will have to consider as a member of the Common Market.  Such a system has the advantage of providing us with an alternative should the banks once again get involved in a dispute with their staffs.  It would provide the competition one hears so much of from those who believe in the private enterprise system and also has the advantage of operating the international credit transfer system.  Employers can pay out slips through the giro system, employees can make payments into the post office and the system can also carry out transactions for individuals as in the more up-to-date banking system.</P>
    <P>The giro system was introduced into Britain recently.  It had a difficult time in the beginning because naturally the banking concerns resented the introduction of the system which is non-profit-making and is in competition with them.  Britain is very slow with the development of these more forward-looking projects, and we are even slower than the British.  Many countries in Europe have been using the post office giro system for many years and it has proved extremely efficient. The system has the added advantage of holding up an enormous reserve of money.  Instead of this money being loaned out by the banks at considerable interest rates, it can be used by the various Government Departments or local authorities for social work of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would have another look at the giro system and consider seriously its introduction in this country.  He should do this not because we are negotiating for entry into the Common Market; I consider this an absurd reason for carrying out any reforms.  Any improvements should be carried out because they are in the interests of our own people and not because we want to enter the EEC.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will resist any attempt to break up the components of his Department.  One hears much about the attempt to hive off different services and I sincerely hope the Minister will not do that.  The efficient ones will become more efficient but the inefficient <Col N="447" /> services will become even worse and the public will suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>I liked Deputy Moore's comments regarding television, particularly his references to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis. The television service is interesting in its own way.  As a person who has held a minority viewpoint for nearly all of my public life, I know well that in our national newspapers a rigid censorship is exercised in regard to a minority point of view.  Not only in Ireland but in most of the so-called democratic countries the newspapers are used to suppress the non-conforming view.</P>

      <P>So far as the democratic countries are concerned they profess to be able to present both sides of the problem.  I could make a case for not presenting both sides.  My objection is that they protest that both sides of the problem are presented by the democratic societies when, in fact, I know they are not.  Everybody knows that.  Anybody working in politics, particularly the kind of politics which I hold, in any of the democratic communities knows that there is widespread and uncompromising censorship everywhere in relation to the national newspapers.  That does not surprise me.  The national newspapers are operated and controlled in the interests of those who own them, who are the very wealthy people who want the kind of society we have here to continue.  It is understandable in our terms that they do not allow a point of view which might undermine their position to appear.  We then have suppression of the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always been interested in the problem of the alternative to this control by small groups within the community of this very important medium of communication, the newspapers. Obviously an independent authority, <Col N="448" /> such as the television authority, is a sort of a pattern which could be adopted and which has been adopted in the use of television which is probably much more powerful than the newspapers. Everyone will say that the television is more powerful.  It is a frightening medium.  In Government it must be particularly worrying not to have control of television because of its extraordinary power to influence ideas.  Deputy Seán Moore is right to be worried about any suggestion that there should be censorship of what some people might not like, such as a row in the Labour Party, in Fianna Fáil or in Fine Gael.  Whether we like it or not, it would be a dangerous precedent to say that it must not be shown and to rationalise that suppression or censorship by saying that such showing would only cause a row next year. That would be dishonest rationalisation essentially.  It would lead to suppression of one kind or another.  I have no illusions about RTE.  I feel, in fact, that it does exercise its own pressures.  RTE exercise their own forms of censorship, and evasions, of the real issues.  That is common to human nature.  Very few of us can be objective about these things.  On the whole the service provided has done more good than harm.  That is not much of a compliment but for what it is worth I think that the service has probably done more good than harm, particularly in the education of the public on the great social and political issues of our time.</P>
    <P>One very useful stimulant in regard to Radio Éireann is the fact that there has been competition from the outside, both from the north and from the BBC. This competition is to be found in many different outlets for alternative entertainment.  For that reason the quality of the service and the quality of presentation, of a reasonable degree of objectivity and a reasonable degree of contentiousness and serious debate is affected inevitably.  It is said that the function of the artist is to mirror society.  One of the sad conclusions which I have come to about much of the television in Ireland is that it does, I am afraid, mirror, in the kind of programme which it produces, the demands of the community it is serving <Col N="449" /> and clearly the general level of the programmes&mdash;particularly the canned programmes&mdash;and this is such a truism that it should not be repeated&mdash;and the fact that these imported American pictures are shown endlessly and monotonously is an astonishing commentary on the minds of our unfortunate people.  It is clearly a product of their education that they should bother to look at these silly detective and cowboy pictures which are utterly unimaginative, repetitious and banal. The banality of them is a tremendous achievement on the part of the people who keep turning them out without ending up under psychiatric care somewhere. I suppose there is some national arrogance on my part, but I feel we can reach a very high level of artistic capacity through the members of our existing society, our theatres, and our dramatists and our musicians. We should be able to produce the Kenneth Clarke type of programme which he did so well for Britain. Surely something like that can be done for Ireland?  We have traditional music. <Col N="450" /> We could have documentaries about famous people.  The Connolly one was a particularly good one.  In fact, I do not think there is any doubt that no matter how bad our own home programmes have been&mdash;and many of them have been of a very high standard and I am not knocking them, but only the canned ones&mdash;this petty Chauvinism on my part makes me feel that they were far superior to the programmes imported into this country.  Our people would be prepared to accept a home-produced programme even if it was not always as ambitious as it happens to be at times.  The people would prefer home-produced music of the traditional type.  The Minister knows that more than I do from his Tam ratings but surely people must be growing tired of the very poor levels of the programmes.</P>
