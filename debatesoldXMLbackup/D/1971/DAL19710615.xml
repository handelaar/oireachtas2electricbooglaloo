    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the widespread alarm caused by the announcement from British army headquarters in Lisburn that the British Ministry of Defence is considering the formation of a full-time army battalion within the Ulster Defence Regiment, the Government will now take effective steps to bring home to the British authorities the dangers inherent in such a move; and if he will make Britain aware of the growing resentment in this country at some of the policies and actions of the present British Government in relation to Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any information has been received from the British authorities concerning the proposed new full-time army battalion within the Ulster Defence Regiment which would be under the control of the British Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if there have been any recent discussions with the British Government concerning the proposed reorganisation of the Ulster Defence Regiment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether any communication has been conveyed to the British Government on their proposal that a full-time force should be raised from amongst the present UDR; whether any such proposal was raised by the <Col N="1408" /> British Government in previous meetings with the Government; and whether he will state the Government's attitude to this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the considerable concern over the reports that a new battalion is to be set up in Northern Ireland, he will seek assurances from the British Government that such a force will not be a para-military one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardLynch" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley  Mr. G. Lynch Mr. G. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Begley</b> asked the Taoiseach if he has had any discussions with the British Prime Minister regarding the proposed formation of an army battalion in Northern Ireland within the Ulster Defence Regiment; and, if so, if he will give details.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the proposal to form in Northern Ireland a special army battalion within the Ulster Defence Regiment; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Government does not favour the establishment of a full-time army battalion within the Ulster Defence Regiment and have made these views known to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate precisely the manner of communication to the British Government and disclose the actual wording of the message sent to the British Government? Would the Taoiseach not agree that the proposal to establish a full-time army battalion within the UDR, the proposal and request made by the British Government to the EEC to maintain the Safeguarding of Employment Act, the slowing down in the pace of reform and a number of other matters seem to indicate that this &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach to the British authorities is not working and that they are not paying the attention to representations from the Irish Government which, I am sure, the Taoiseach considers should be paid in the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Col N="1409" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I referred also to the policies and actions of the British Government in relation to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy and the House that our views were conveyed at a very high level, in a very direct manner.  I do not intend to disclose the wording of the communication.  So far as the other matters of which the Deputy complains are concerned, we have made our views known about the suggestion that the Safeguarding of Employment Act should be extended into the transitional period of membership of the EEC.  Also we have indicated very clearly that we want the pace and quality of reforms increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach noted the feelings of certain Opposition members in the North that our communications with the British Government are acquiring a rather perfunctory flavour and that they have expressed their dissatisfaction with the communications procedure at present operating between the Dublin Government and the Government at Westminster? Would the Taoiseach not agree it is time that a more clear expression of our views and the manner of our communications with the British Government were made public? There is much dissatisfaction that the British Government are beginning to treat all representations from the Dublin Government as a routine gesture on the part of Dublin and in Northern quarters they are beginning to think that our representations with the British Government no longer have any effective impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I want to make it clear that we would deprecate any development that in any way would increase community tension in the North or would endanger in any way the implementation of the Downing Street declaration.  I might say to the Deputy that responsible opinion in the North has indicated satisfaction with the manner in which we are indicating our views on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say if it has been made clear to the <Col N="1410" /> British Government that this is an attempt to revive the B Specials under another name and that we object to it in that form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I might agree with the Deputy to this extent that it could create a sectarian force out of what is now, at least to some extent, a non-sectarian force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that there has been some change in the British approach in recent times? In the light of this apparent change, would he consider warning the British Government that any effort by them to use the North of Ireland as a pawn in their own domestic politics to acquire Unionist support in the Westminster Parliament on the EEC vote could trigger off an explosion which could have disastrous consequences in Ireland and in Anglo-Irish relations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Tories came to power, in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what would be the Unionist approach in Westminster towards the application of the United Kingdom to join the EEC.  I do not know if the British Government have taken account of it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply in which he referred to the satisfaction he claims responsible opinion in the North has expressed about his approach to this matter, would the Taoiseach inform the House whom he regards as the spokesmen of responsible opinion in the North at the present time?  It is important that the country should know this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can claim that I have access to responsible opinion at least as much as has Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach states his views were conveyed in a direct way at a high level.  To whom were they conveyed?  To the British ambassador?  To the British Foreign Secretary?  To the Prime Minister, Mr. Heath?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the people in the North feel they are being let down by the present Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the purport of my views will have its effect.  At this stage I do not propose to say to whom these views were conveyed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the House an assurance that our views have been conveyed forcefully and effectively. I cannot prognosticate what pattern future British policy may take but, as far as we are concerned, we are making sure British policy will conform to what we want to see done in the North&mdash;that is, the maintenance of peace there and the acceleration of equality of treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one final supplementary.  In the British Parliament yesterday a representative of the British Government said that only once in the last year had they received representations from the Irish Government about the situation in Northern Ireland.  How does the Taoiseach reconcile that with his statement here today that he is perpetually making representations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have conveyed our views on frequent occasions during that period.  I do not know on what basis the gentleman in the British Parliament made that statement.  I am making my statement categorically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the conflict between the statement the Taoiseach has made here today about his communications with the British Government and the statement made in the House of Commons very recently about representations by the Irish Government&mdash;these two statements do not <Col N="1413" /> agree with each other&mdash;would the Taoiseach not reconsider his reply and his refusal to tell us the mechanism of his communications with the British Government?

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my custom to express the Government's views on the North, on North-South relations and on Anglo-Irish relations at times when I think it appropriate.  I do not propose to vary this practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, in the interests of communication, to put it at its lowest, between North and South when the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland makes a speech which includes strong criticism of certain important features of life in the Republic, the Taoiseach should reply correcting the errors he may feel are implicit in the speech?  Would the Taoiseach agree that it is extraordinary, remembering that he has unilaterally made several speeches about the situation in the North in recent months, that he should now ignore the occasion on which Mr. Faulkner, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, makes a most important <Col N="1414" /> speech declaring his Government's whole approach to several important features of life in the Republic?  Is it not extraordinary that the Taoiseach would not consider it worth replying to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) that £209,000 is needed by St. Laurence's Hospital, Dublin, as a stop-gap measure to meet the growing demand on its vital national services; and that if the hospital is to continue expanding at its present rate there is now a need to prepare plans for a new enlarged hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.  Proposals for improved facilities, including new theatres and X-Ray department, at St. Laurence's Hospital have already been approved.  I hope to be in a position to allow work on these improvements to commence later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the shape of longer-term developments in north Dublin, I am surprised that the Deputy has not, apparently, had regard to the recommendations in the FitzGerald Report which have been the subject of discussion and negotiation between the parties concerned for some time past. These proposals envisage the concentration of north side general hospital and specialist services on two sites&mdash; the Mater and James Connolly Memorial hospitals.  Significant progress has been made in the case of the James Connolly Hospital project through the setting up of a board under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961 to manage the hospital and develop it as a general hospital.  The board is composed of representatives of the former Dublin Health Authority, the Mater, St. Laurence's and Jervis Street hospitals and they are setting about their task in a purposeful and energetic way.  A feasibility study has been undertaken in regard to development <Col N="1418" /> on the Mater site and I hope that clarification of the full picture of north Dublin development will emerge in the course of the next few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Mater Hospital site is adequate to provide the expanded services and is it his intention to allow services at St. Laurence's Hospital to run down?  Would he not agree there is duplication under the present system when it is realised that three national services are provided at St. Laurence's Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Eventually some of the acute medical care services would run down but, as the Deputy knows, it takes about five years to build a hospital so that the matter is not one of urgency.  It was considered that it would be feasible to build a hospital on the Mater site but negotiations still have to be undertaken in regard to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the urgent need for the provision of adequate accommodation and education facilities for mentally retarded children in County Mayo; and what steps he proposes to take to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Residential accommodation is not provided on a county basis and the special centres accept children from all areas.</P>
      <P>There are at present schemes, under construction or in planning, which will provide about 1,500 places in the special residential centres for the mentally handicapped over the next few years.  This programme of building, which includes 360 additional places in Galway and Sligo, will, when completed, meet the target set by the Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap for residential accommodation for severely and moderately handicapped persons in need of such care.</P>
      <P>There are at present some 165 mentally handicapped children and adults from Mayo residing in the special centres and I have recently recognised for capitation rate purposes a small new residential unit established by the Western Care Association at St. Clare's, Castlebar, for the care of severely handicapped children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of educational facilities is one for the Minister for Education but I understand that there is a special day school at St. Anthony's, <Col N="1420" /> Castlebar, catering for some 80-90 mildly mentally handicapped children and that agreement has been reached for the building of further similar schools at Ballina and at Sligo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is still a very large waiting list in Mayo, that voluntary bodies in the county are doing very useful work trying to help these children, and despite that parents are still very worried about the children who cannot get accommodation in institutions?  Could the Minister give the House an assurance that something will be done to ease the position and ease it more speedily than is being done at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making progress in this matter year by year and as the Deputy knows the Western Care Association propose to provide a hostel in Ballina for some 20 children at a cost of about £24,000.  I am prepared to give capitation grants for these children.  The actual number of places now available for handicapped persons from Mayo represents 4 per cent of all the beds in the country and Mayo's population is 4 per cent of the country's population so that there is no disregard of the needs of Mayo as compared with other counties.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In view of the fact that the Minister says he is not dealing with this matter on a county basis will he agree that over the country as a whole there is a waiting period which runs into years? Does he agree that is unreasonable?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am in order, arising out of the Minister's reply, because the Minister proceeded to deal with the matter on a national basis.  We agree that on a <Col N="1421" /> national basis there is a delay of years in these cases and something should be done to shorten that delay.  Something in the nature of a crash programme in this very personal sphere is necessary to deal with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it perfectly clear on many occasions in this House, and I have been absolutely frank about it, that it will take two or three years to complete this programme in relation to the planning by the religious orders who are doing most of this work and the training of teachers and the designing and erection of the buildings.  I can give no assurance that any crash programme would be possible having regard to the organisations doing this work for us, who are dedicated and devoted people.</P>

The accommodation is limited but some parents in County Mayo, to which the question relates, are, I am sure, unable to get their children admitted to homes even though their classification may be more acute than some of those admitted.  I should like to know what is the position in Mayo so far as the selection of children for admission is concerned.</P>

      <P>That is one of the difficulties in relation to the areas in which they are placed.  We must make quite sure that if proposals are made for an institution it will be in an area where suitable staff can be obtained, because in the case of severely and moderately handicapped children the staff must operate on a 24-hour basis. Therefore, we must have regard to the staffing position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two sets of recommendations are referred to in the report of the Working Party on Drug Abuse&mdash;those summarised at pages 55 to 58 of the report and certain recommendations which the working party submitted to me in September, 1969, in regard to matters on which they considered that action need not and should not be <Col N="1424" /> delayed pending completion of their deliberations; these recommendations are referred to at page nine of the report and are appended to the report on page 75.</P>
    <P>The recommendations summarised on pages 55 to 58 of their report are of a comprehensive nature and their implementation concerns not alone my Department but also a number of other Government Departments as well as other bodies.  Consequently I am not in a position at this stage to indicate when the recommendations as a whole will be implemented.  As far as I am concerned I am anxious that there should be no avoidable delay in dealing with the recommendations and my Department are already in consultation with the other Government Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>However, I had already taken prompt action regarding the recommendations submitted to me in September, 1969, and the following is a summary of the main measures taken:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  In December, 1969, I introduced regulations for the control of amphetamines, after consultation with the medical profession and pharmaceutical interests concerned.  The regulations prohibit generally the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of amphetamines and preparations containing such substances.  Since the implementation of these controls the abuse of amphetamines has ceased to be a problem.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Health (Possession of Controlled Substances) Regulations which I made under section 78 of the Health Act, 1970 in May, 1970 made the unauthorised possession of certain classes of drugs not covered by the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, for example, amphetamines, barbiturates and LSD, a punishable offence.  These controls enabled the Garda to deal more effectively with drug offenders.  The controls are intended as an interim measure pending the enactment of legislation <Col N="1425" /> containing more comprehensive provision for the control of drug abuse which is at present in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>(c)  Additional personnel (including a Ban Garda) were assigned to the Drug Squad.</P>
    <P>(d)  Special measures were taken by my Department to alert health authorities, drug manufacturers, wholesale and retail chemists, hospitals, <i>et cetera</i>, regarding the need for stringent security against drug thefts.  These measures appear to have been successful and thefts of drugs are not generally a significant problem at present.</P>
    <P>(e)  The measures to combat the smuggling of drugs have been intensified following consultation between my Department and other Government Departments concerned.  This matter remains under constant review.</P>
    <P>(f)  My Department arranged for the issue of special notices, through the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to all retail pharmacists alerting them regarding forged prescriptions and suggesting the steps which might be taken where prescriptions presented to them for dispensing were suspected of being forged.  Arrangements were also made to alert doctors through their medical journals as to the danger of forged prescriptions.</P>
    <P>(g)  In addition to the out-patient advisory and treatment centre provided at Jervis Street Hospital, a special &ldquo;closed&rdquo; residential unit is being made available by the Eastern Health Board for the treatment of persons dependent on drugs.  The board also propose to use new premises at Usher's Island as an adolescent centre which will include services for drug abusers who can be treated in an &ldquo;open&rdquo; environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if any correspondence exists between the Department of Health and the equivalent <Col N="1426" /> Minister in Britain in view of the fact that there is some smuggling of amphetamines?  On the question of the new centre at Island Street, has a director been appointed yet?  Is there provision for hostels for those seeking rehabilitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy all the information I have.  Any other matters to which he referred are being examined.  We are in touch with all the information available on this problem from all sources.  I might remind the Deputy that the conditions are not the same here as elsewhere because drug abuse is not as great.  We are in touch with the World Health Organisation and we have received information from American and British sources.  We have also had information from those who have been in charge of drug abuse in the north.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this drug problem is escalating at an enormous pace and that we have not enough personnel to control it?  Is he aware that people going to the pop festival in Sligo in buses and trains were smoking pot? Is he aware that pushers in Dublin hired a bus to go there?  Is he further aware that certain doctors are making very harmful statements by saying that marijuana is not harmful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot prevent doctors from expressing their individual opinions on any matter.  In Sligo the Garda Síochána took whatever action they thought advisable.  The Deputy must have seen the newspapers. I want to make it quite clear that dangerous drug abuse here is still minimal by comparison with other countries.  Alcoholism is a much more serious problem and I should like to hear more about that from Deputies.</P>

      <P>Following the negative vote last December on the offer made then, I initiated new discussions with the Irish Medical Association and the Medical Union on 8th March.  At this meeting and at a subsequent series of meetings between my Department and the organisations, a number of matters which seemed to have affected the voting were discussed and clarified. I found myself in a position to make some changes in the proposals.  The main new features of my offer are:</P>
      <P>(i)  an undertaking to establish an arbitration board with open terms of reference to review fees one year after the full implementation of the scheme;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the payment of grants for approved renovations to practice premises ranging up to £750 for individual practitioners with higher payments for group practices;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the provision of a choice of method of remuneration for doctors in specified remote areas;</P>
      <P>(iv)  the payment of a rural practice allowance of £500 per annum where the doctor lives and practices in a centre with a population of less than 500 and where there is not a town with a population of 1,500 or more within a three mile radius of that centre;</P>
      <P>(v)  the making of special arrangements to give a temporary district medical officer who finds himself in a non-viable area an opportunity to transfer to a better practice centre;</P>
      <P>(vi)  the payment of an annual contribution of £100 a year towards the locum and other practice expenses of participating doctors who are not permanent district medical officers;</P>
      <P>(vii)  the holding of a special limited competition for serving permanent district medical officers to provide an opportunity for change of practice centre before the scheme commences;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> (viii)  the revision of the proposed scale of fees to improve certain features of it including the fee payable for services given at the doctor's surgery during normal hours.</P>
    <P>The revised proposals were recently considered by the Councils of the Irish Medical Association and of the Medical Union and I am glad to say that both councils have recommended acceptance of the revised proposals to their members.  The organisations are conducting a ballot and I expect to know the result of this about the end of this month.  Assuming that it is favourable, I would hope to phase in the scheme from about March or April next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would naturally like to implement it as soon as possible but when I look at the general trend and the improvement in the health services since World War II and when one considers the 1947 Act, the 1953 Act and the 1970 Act, whether the choice of doctor scheme begins in 1971 or 1972 is not of material significance because it will be the ending of the old principle of workhouse medical service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs who is responsible for Ireland's negotiations for membership has told the Community that the directives already adopted could be accepted by Ireland, i.e.,</P>
      <P>(a)  land left abandoned or uncultivated for two years, and</P>
      <P>(b)  purchase of land by non-nationals who had worked as farm workers for more than two years.</P>
      <P>This is the present position and the Minister has stated to the Community and in this document that we accept it is all right from our point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will comment upon the criticism of the Irish submission to the EEC on fisheries policy voiced on 7th June last on television and radio by the Norwegian Prime Minister and the Minister for Fisheries; if he will state particularly what discussions took place with the Norwegian authorities before this country adopted a particular negotiating position; and if he will ensure that there are no further unnecessary clashes between this country and other applicants in matters of common concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Each of the four applicant countries put forward the proposals which it considered would best protect its own particular interests.  Norway has not suggested that my proposals were considered damaging to the Norwegian case.  What I am anxious to ensure is that there should be no change in our fishery access regime until such time as the enlarged Community agree on an equitable solution. We are in continuous contact with Norway and the other applicants on questions arising in the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read some criticism by the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Mr. Cappalan, who was reflecting on our negotiating position on the fisheries issue; and having read that other Buntús Cainte production from the Department of Foreign Affairs on the Common Market, it appears to me he was criticising the manner in which the Irish Foreign Minister had conducted our negotiations on the fisheries issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree there is a certain coincidence of interests between their problems and ours?  The fish that inhabit Norwegian waters do not have a different nature from the fish that inhabit Irish waters and there is therefore a great similarity in the problems faced.  By saying that our proposals did not suit their position the Norwegian Minister implied criticism of the defence we were putting up for a similar problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If a view were to be expressed here that the Norwegian proposals did not suit our problems I do not know whether this would be taken as criticism of their proposals, but I understand the position to be that the Norwegian Government in considering its problems put forward certain proposals. Our Government in considering our problems put forward certain proposals.  It is our duty to concern ourselves with Irish problems and the duty of the Norwegian Government is to concern themselves with Norwegian problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, their criticism was that we were accepting the rules and not asking for any change until we got in.  The Norwegian position is that they were looking for changes before they got in.  I would, therefore, think that the Norwegian position certainly affects us.</P>

      <P>No.  What we are seeking is that our present rating would remain until after accession when the whole matter would be renegotiated by the Ten.

Likewise, there are some common problems to be faced, such as the Danish people's concern and ours to ensure that the land policy will not mean that foreigners will purchase land.  All I am seeking is that the Minister should concern himself with those areas of common interest.  We have seen little evidence of this so far.

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The Government reviewed the rural electrification charges in 1968 and arranged with the Electricity Supply <Col N="1442" /> Board for considerable reductions in the special service charges which some consumers were required to pay because of the high cost of connecting them.

      <P>My colleague has already given figures in connection with the last ESB Bill.  The ESB made at various times predictions of the growth in the number of consumers and in general they have been fairly correct but they did grossly underestimate the number of people who applied for rural electrification service who are in the group who would have to pay higher charges.  They underestimated the number by many thousands so, in fact, it does not appear that these higher service charges have prevented people or discouraged people from taking service.</P>

      <P>My amendments arise out of the debate and I think that both Deputy Thornley and Deputy O'Donovan will find them familiar territory as we come to them.  The first one arises out of the discussion on an amendment on Committee Stage.  The Minister was reluctant to accept the amendment put down because it would have altered the order of action and the burden of responsibility as between An tÚdarás and the Minister.  He indicated that it was not his intention to act, to designate institutions, against the wishes of An tÚdarás but that because of the fact that in many cases the institutions that would be designated would be ones of which he would have had some prior knowledge as Minister for Education and of which An tÚdarás would not necessarily have had any prior knowledge he felt that the initiative for suggesting that these institutions be brought within the framework of the Bill should rest with him.  The amendment I had put down was not acceptable because it would have shifted the initiative and left it to An tÚdarás to do this.  I think one could argue on the merits of this.  We did argue on the merits of it but the Minister made his point.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I suggested that we could come back to this again and I put down this amendment to meet the Minister's point in that it is the Minister who will designate the body in accordance with the line taken by him at that time and because of the practical considerations to which he referred.  In accordance with his stated intention in that debate the wording, as now put forward, would make it impossible for him to designate a body if An tÚdarás, having examined the situation, decided that such a body should not be brought within their framework.  Therefore, I commend this amendment to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage and as Deputy FitzGerald has remarked again.  An tÚdarás would have no specific knowledge of the institutions which would not fall within their ambit but the Minister, because of State assistance being made available to these institutions, would have a considerable knowledge of them and would know the institutions that were likely to be acceptable to An tÚdarás for designation. Therefore, the common-sense approach would be that the Minister would consult with An tÚdarás and, having consulted with them, then make up his own mind.  However, to meet the points made by the Deputy on the previous occasion, I am providing the safeguard now of making the provision that the designation of an institution to be an institution of higher education can be done only by way of statutory order which would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am almost at a loss for words because I do not see how this meets the point.  That provision would enable this House to reject the regulation.  It does not in any way enable An tÚdarás to do so.  The whole purpose of the discussion the last day was the undesirability of An tÚdarás finding themselves saddled with institutions which they believed did not come within their ambit.</P>
      <P>During the debate the Minister accepted that he would not so nominate anybody.  My amendment is designed to meet that point.  The general amendment proposed by the Minister&mdash;No. 8&mdash;which applies to regulations made under this Bill, is welcome in itself and we shall deal with it when we come to it, but it does not answer the point that I raised at the time and on which, I think, Deputy Thornley agreed with me.  While speaking on Committee Stage the Minister, in speaking of the reason why the initiative must lie with the Minister, said, as reported at column 263 of the Dáil Debates for the 3rd March, 1971:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would suggest to An tÚdarás what institutions should be designated and, after consultation with them, would then make up his <Col N="1476" /> mind.  I do not think it could happen in a matter such as this that, for local political reasons, as suggested, a Minister would decide on some institution which obviously should not be designated, and I can imagine that if he were to do that, there would be very strong opposition from An tÚdarás.  For that reason I believe that in any instance in which An tÚdarás, having examined the situation in relation to the institution suggested to them by the Minister, decided that this was not a suitable institution, I could not imagine the Minister going ahead and designating it.</P>
    <P>Further on the Minister said:</P>
    <P>If he were to attempt to do what the Deputy suggested might be done &mdash;designate an institution which quite obviously should not be designated&mdash;then the opposition of An tÚdarás would be such that he could not possibly go ahead with it.  For that reason, I could not imagine any Minister trying to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke plainly about this and his objection to the amendment as put on Committee Stage was not to the principle of An tÚdarás having a say in the matter but rather to the method by which this was to be achieved.  The Minister believed that for some reason the initiative should remain with him but he did accept in the plainest possible language that there could be no question, if An tÚdarás objected to an institution being named as coming within the framework of the Bill, of the Minister going ahead.  My amendment is designed precisely to give effect to what the Minister said on Committee Stage. Therefore, I am rather taken aback that, by implication, he should appear now not to accept that and that he should suggest that a totally different provision be put down for discussion elsewhere on Report Stage dealing with the powers of the Houses of the Oireachtas which are no substitute in any way for the rights of An tÚdarás in this matter.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I urge the Minister to think again about what he has just said and to stand by the position <Col N="1477" /> he adopted on Committee Stage and accept that he should not attempt to designate a body if An tÚdarás do not accept that that body is a suitable one.  I do not know if I have ever heard stronger language used in a matter of this kind than that used by the Minister in relation to this matter because the Minister said &ldquo;in any instance...&rdquo; and not in any particular instance where there has been a particular kind of problem.  The only objection the Minister made in his speech was not to the principle that is incorporated in the amendment now before the House but only to the order of events proposed in my original amendment.  In these circumstances I suggest that he accept my amendment which is in line with his own argument.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 36 and 37 and to insert after line 44 the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I accepted two amendments, both of which were moved by Deputy Thornley and which were for the purpose of extending the list of the general functions of An tÚdarás by the addition of two general functions further to those set out in the Bill at that stage.  These additional functions appear at (a) and (e) of section 3 of the Bill as it is now before the House.  This amendment, No. 1, is designed to rearrange the order in which the general functions are set out &mdash;to, as it were, state the functions in what appear to me to be a more logical sequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that the order in which these general functions appear does not establish any one of them as being in any way more important than any of the others, but the function which now appears at (b) of section 3 is, as it were, the overall general function.  The other general functions set out in section 3 are more or less indications of particular considerations that An tÚdarás should <Col N="1478" /> take into account when applying themselves to the fulfilment of this function of the furthering of the development of higher education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this should be transferred from the top to the bottom.  I object to this kind of legislation because there is a suggestion in it that the structure of higher education is not democratic at present.  It certainly is extremely democratic in the three university colleges of the National University of Ireland, as I understand the word though I wonder when I hear words being tossed about nowadays whether the English language has been changed completely. This seems to me to be a criticism of bodies which are, in fact, democratically elected.  I speak of the governing bodies of the National University of Ireland.  They are put together in an extremely democratic manner.  If they are not the structure of the main institutions of higher education in this country, I do not know what the structure is.  I agree in furthering the development of higher education. There is an inference of a similar kind in what the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Kennedy, has been saying over the past few days.  I was asked whether the Parliamentary Secretary had ever been at a university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot feel that it matters very much where this item comes in this particular list.  I can quite understand that people would feel that this item is not the most important thing.  It is important that the structure of higher education should be democratic but this is a subordinate issue when compared with such matters as the development of higher education and the promoting of appreciation of the value of higher education and research. In my mind it will take second place after the promoting of equality of opportunity in obtaining higher education.  Having said that, I must protest against Deputy O'Donovan's statement about the extraordinarily democratic method of election of the governing bodies of the university colleges. There is a system of election <Col N="1479" /> under which 70 per cent of the staff are deprived of any direct voice in electing members of the governing body unless they happen to be graduates and have a diluted vote of 127,000.  That is not a democratic system.  The students have no voice.  It would be hard to devise a less democratic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a good argument because there are 30 people on the governing body and the Deputy is pinpointing a small group of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pinpointing the ones who are not there.  Seventy per cent of the staff in UCD have no direct say and a smaller proportion in the other colleges.  Many members of the staff are not graduates of the college. We are not as inbred as Deputy O'Donovan suggests.  Many of the staff have no vote.  The students by definition are not graduates and they have no votes.  The only kind of vote which exists for 70 per cent of the staff is the one which they have because they happen to be graduates.  They can exercise their votes as graduates on an equal footing with other graduates whose interest in the college is somewhat remote.  It is incorrect to suggest that this is democratic.  It would be wrong to allow that assertion to pass without being commented on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of following Deputy O'Donovan and speaking on the comparative levels of democracy in the different institutions of higher learning.  In Trinity College, Dublin, the extension of the fellowship body to the numerous proportion of its staff, plus the provision of representative facilities for non-fellow members of the staff, has brought at least comparable democracy to the college as compared with that in which Deputy O'Donovan teaches.  Deputy O'Donovan is missing a point here.  I agree more with Deputy FitzGerald than with Deputy O'Donovan.  There is a point I would like to make on democratisation.  Even our relatively democratic colleges think of the democratic structure of higher education as <Col N="1480" /> being totally equatable with internal democracy amongst the staff.  While I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that there is much ground to be made up in achieving this, I should also like to make the point, speaking here more in accordance with Labour Party policy, that I am looking forward to the day when the universities will become democratic not merely in the sense that the governing bodies would be elected by the staff and the students but also where community representation would be more real and where the pupils would ultimately have a greater say in the functioning of the university, and where the taxpayers who provide the money which permits universities to exist would have a greater say in their functioning also.  This is basically an amendment of detail and I agree with the Minister's proposal.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 18, after &ldquo;higher education&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in receipt of moneys from An tÚdarás&rdquo; and in lines 18 and 19 to delete &ldquo;a statement of its financial position&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;financial information&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points here.  I had intended them as separate amendments but if they are agreed together there is no problem.  If they are not agreed together we can take them separately. The first amendment limits the activities of An tÚdarás as regards requiring statements of the financial position in those institutions which are in receipt of moneys from An tÚdarás.  On Committee Stage it became clear that this was the intention but there was some defect in the wording of the amendment designed to achieve this aim. The wording here has been prepared in the light of Committee Stage debate. I think that it meets whatever criticism the Minister had of the amendment put forward on Committee Stage.  It is the clear intention that An tÚdarás should require such statements only from bodies which it is, in fact, financing. It would be curious if its powers were extended to the financing of other bodies to which it gave no financial assistance.  I would hope that this <Col N="1481" /> amendment, being one of clarification and in accordance with what the Minister said, would be accepted.</P>
    <P>The other part of the amendment arises from what was said on Committee Stage.  There was some disagreement as to the best way of defining the kind of information sought. The Minister's wording&mdash;&ldquo;statement of the financial position&rdquo;&mdash;was queried and an alternative was proposed. It was also criticised.  The wording here is &ldquo;financial information&rdquo;.  It meets the criticism from both sides of the House.  I hope that this alternative wording will be accepted.  The &ldquo;statement of the financial position&rdquo; was criticised from various points of view. &ldquo;Financial information&rdquo; covers anything that An tÚdarás could reasonably want.  It does not tie An tÚdarás down to an annual statement.  It means that information can be received whenever it is needed, annually, quinquennially or in the course of a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the first part of this amendment has all the appearance of having been prepared in a hurry.  The fact is that An tÚdarás has no moneys of its own. This is an example of circumlocution. Section 12 of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be paid to An tÚdarás, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such amount for institutions of higher education as may be approved of by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>This means that there is circumlocution here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the <Col N="1482" /> point that the whole way of drafting this amendment is askew.  The Deputy is adding &ldquo;in receipt of moneys from An tÚdarás&rdquo;.  The reality of the situation is that it is this House that provides the money for everybody.  Logically the Deputy is quite right; this amendment ties up with section 12, but, of course, it is section 12 that is all wrong, as Deputy FitzGerald will realise if he thinks it over.  As regards the second part of the amendment:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a statement of its financial position&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;financial information&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have no particular feelings about that, but I have very strong feelings about the opening part of the section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;may annually or at such other intervals as it may determine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In other words, if some institute started squabbling with An tÚdarás.  An tÚdarás could determine that it wanted accounts from it every month, every week or every day.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;they would not do that.  This kind of thing could not happen.&rdquo;  Of course, it could&mdash;and it has happened frequently&mdash;once a situation has been created where strains are likely to arise between these institutions which have been used to doing their own business in their own way and have a long tradition of doing their own business. The whole thing is absurd from start to finish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first amendment by Deputy FitzGerald, the point is that the definition of &ldquo;an institution of higher education&rdquo; is already in the Bill.  It would be a designated institution of higher education and there will be no designated institution of higher education which will not be in receipt of money from An tÚdarás. In regard to the second amendment, as I have stressed previously, An tÚdarás must have full information on the financial position of each institution with which it is concerned if it is to make an objective assessment of the amount of State aid which might be provided for the institution.  This will entail the submission to An tÚdarás of full particulars of its expenditure and of its financial resources.  I feel strongly that this is something which is basic to <Col N="1483" /> the operations of An tÚdarás and I cannot see any reason why it should be watered down in any way.</P>

I would be happy if the wording were &ldquo;an&rdquo; institution of higher education.  Would that not make the point clearer?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1b:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 38, after &ldquo;students&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and staffing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage debate there was an amendment attempting to deal with the problem which I saw here.  It did not meet the approval of the Minister, and, therefore, of the House.  It used the words &ldquo;staff-student ratio&rdquo; and I could see some arguments against introducing that particular concept as a legal requirement into the Bill.  On reflection, it seemed to me that a better way of making the point I was making, which seemed to me to be a valid point, was to use the word &ldquo;staffing&rdquo;, <Col N="1484" /> so that, as I now propose it, An tÚdarás should have regard to the accommodation capacity for students and staffing of each institution.  In all logic, if it is to be ensured that each institution does its job, it must have the necessary capacity and staff for that purpose.  If either the capacity or the staff are lacking, then it is not in a position to provide the standard of education required.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy FitzGerald on this amendment. It is a small point but, in its way, quite an important one.  The problem of providing space and operational facilities for staff is a growing one.  It is not realised by the man-in-the-street just how much this costs.  To many people the provision of staff is, first, not a very important thing and, secondly, one related solely to the payment of their salaries.  Increasingly it has got to be seen that the costing of staff provision takes into consideration office facilities, library facilities and administrative services to sustain the staff in question.  To insert this amendment into the Bill would establish a valid and useful principle.</P>

      <P>In the belief that we shall not get very much from the Minister I should be prepared to accept this amendment.  The reason is quite simple.  There are parts of the different universities which are grossly over-staffed and there are parts of them which are disgracefully under-staffed. The staff-student ratio in the faculty of commerce in University College, Dublin, is one head of staff for every 60 students.  Then the Minister tells me certain faculties are more expensive than others.  I have re-read the debate on Committee Stage and I find, as I pointed out to him, that in the University of Oxford the most expensive part of the university is the faculty of arts, but the Minister spoke <i>ex cathedra</i> and gave the impression that everybody knows that engineering is more expensive than arts.  Everybody does not know it; I do not know it.  As I said in that discussion, every faculty is as expensive as a particular university wants to make it and every section of every faculty is as expensive as the particular university wants to make it. <Col N="1485" /> For example, I could put forward the view, and I think there is a great deal of truth in it, that the social sciences are grievously neglected in universities here in Dublin by comparison with languages, if you compare the staffing and the number of students.  There is no comparison whatever between the amount of work that has to be done by people engaged in the social sciences and indeed in philosophy in UCD, and the amount of work that certain of the people in languages have to do.  The staff-student ratios are completely askew.  This amendment would go part of the way.  You would be unlikely to have one head of staff for every 60 students anywhere in the universities if this amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, we discussed a similar type of amendment to this at length on Committee Stage.  My view here is that the number of students to be catered for is the basic consideration.  If you start listing other considerations after that where do you stop?  We must take it that in making the assessments An tÚdarás, starting with the number of students to be catered for, will take every other relevant factor into account.  I do not think that any of these factors should be laid down in the Bill.  The basic consideration here is the number of students and everything else follows from that.  As I said a moment ago, if we start adding all sorts of other matters which could be relevant in some circumstances, I do not know where we would stop.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 40, to delete &ldquo;all&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was debated at great length on Committee Stage.  Although there was no amendment down at the time, the use of this phraseology in the section was the subject of a good deal of comment.  The fact is that it is extremely bad drafting, unless one is some kind of neo-Fascist, to use this kind of language: &ldquo;An institution of higher education shall supply to An tÚdarás all such information relative <Col N="1486" /> to the institution as An tÚdarás may require...&rdquo; As was said before, are we supposed to supply them with information on the number of toilets per student if An tÚdarás considers that is necessary for the purpose of performing its functions?  It may be said that this is being amusing or that this is not discussing the matter properly, but in actual fact these things happen.  As I said already this evening, the most extraordinary things happen.  There is every likelihood of a collision at some stage, if this word &ldquo;all&rdquo; remains in the Bill, between one of the institutions and An tÚdarás, this existing body, because it does exist.  In spite of this legislation which is going through, it is, in fact, in existence.  It would be very much better if the Minister would accept this amendment and delete the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;.  It would improve the Bill very much.</P>

My attitude towards it was that the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; indicated the comprehensiveness of the information which must necessarily be supplied by each institution to An tÚdarás.  As I said at the time, I considered that, from a legal point of view, the retention of the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; or its deletion did not make very much difference and that being so, I was just as disposed to leaving it in as to taking it out.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 43, to delete &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;amount&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 12 is the most contentious and the most important section in the Bill. As it is drafted at the moment, the Bill still leaves open the degree of earmarking of the money by the Government and this is totally incompatible with the function of An tÚdarás as envisaged ever since the first idea of such a body was put forward in evidence given to the Commission on Higher Education almost ten years ago.  In proposing that the plural &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; be substituted by the singular &ldquo;amount&rdquo;, I would hope to get away from this and make it clear that the Oireachtas will vote a total sum to An tÚdarás which will then allocate it to the different bodies at its discretion and that the Minister's Department will not have a function in its allocation.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  I suspect that we face a frontal clash on this issue, but it is an important one and it would be wrong of us, having failed to persuade the Minister on Committee Stage, not to re-pose the issue here today and give him, shall we say, another chance to rethink this vital issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most disturbing feature of this debate &mdash; much of which has been heartening and some of which has been disappointing &mdash; has been the Minister's insistence on Committee Stage and on Second Stage on this principle of his Department continuing to play a role in the allocation of funds between institutions.  The whole point, the whole purpose in the setting up of this body is to get away from that.  I simply cannot understand why the Minister should seek to duplicate the work of his Department in the form of An tÚdarás while continuing to have the Department playing a role in the matter.  We are setting up this body and financing it and giving it the necessary authority.  We have spent many <Col N="1488" /> laborious hours in this House establishing this body with a view to transferring to it this very function which the Minister, by virtue of the wording he is proposing and by virtue of his stated intention in this House, intends to continue to duplicate in his Department. There can be no justification for this and I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage in the game to reconsider his attitude to this and to have regard to the cogent and compelling arguments put forward on this issue in the earlier stages.</P>
    <P>I know that many of the issues which are brought up for debate by way of amendment by the Opposition are ones on which two opinions are possible.  Indeed, I have been persuaded by some of the Minister's remarks to withdraw some of my amendments on Committee Stage when I heard the weight of the arguments against them.  In other cases, although I pressed the amendment, I recognised that the Minister had a point in the particular instance.  Here there is a very great difference of view and the Minister has failed to persuade me, and the Opposition generally, I think, that there is any case for wasting time and money in establishing this body if, in fact, the question of how much is to be allocated to the different institutions is still to be a matter concerning his Department.</P>
    <P>The function of his Department as envisaged, and as it was envisaged by the Commission on Higher Education in the evidence given and the report put forward, and in the discussions which have taken place since on this subject, would be to decide whether the total sum sought by An tÚdarás after consultation with the universities was reasonable in relation to the requirements of the universities as put forward to An tÚdarás and as interpreted by it.  If the total sum was thought to be reasonable it would be up to the Department to get the money from the Department of Finance, to get it voted and the question of how then it was to be used was a matter for An tÚdarás.  If his Department takes the view that An tÚdarás has not made a good case, that the total sum required by An tÚdarás is more <Col N="1489" /> than is necessary to maintain and expand university education to the standard required in this country, then the Minister would be perfectly entitled to recommend a smaller sum to the Department of Finance and An tÚdarás would have to decide how to make do with that and where to impose the cuts necessitated by his failure and the failure of his successor to recommend the total sum required.</P>
    <P>There is in that approach no room for the Department playing a role in deciding how much is to go to which institution.  It is precisely because of the undesirability of that, because of the unhappy situation that has arisen through the exercise of that power by the Minister's Department that this Bill is here.  The only function of this Bill is to get away from this earmarking to different institutions by his Department and it is inconceivable that having gone to the trouble of introducing this Bill and putting so much time into it, the time should turn out to be wasted by virtue of the Minister's insistence on this provision which makes nonsense of the Bill and really does make me feel that we have been wasting a lot of time if this goes through in this form.</P>
    <P>I can see that An tÚdarás may still perform some kind of useful semi-buffer function.  The more buffers you have I suppose the better the autonomy will be protected but whether, in fact, the amount of buffering An tÚdarás will be able to perform in the situation the Minister envisages by the provision we are talking about now will really warrant the time and trouble involved in setting up this body may even be doubted once this whole question of the allocation of funds to different institutions remains with the Department.  The Minister should have been firm.  He should not have allowed himself to be persuaded by his advisers to leave this power in their hands.  He has in this respect on this issue to date &mdash; one hopes for reform even at this late hour &mdash; not shown the grasp of the basic concept behind the Bill or the kind of firm attitude to any attempts by his advisers to hang on to power that a Minister should show in circumstances like these.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> I am extremely unhappy about the provision as drafted and I would recommend to the Minister even at this stage to accept the amendment and get away from the concept of earmarking by his Department and leave An tÚdarás when set up to carry out this function.</P>

      <P>The fact is this&mdash; and the Deputy does not appear to appreciate it &mdash; that when you set up a body like this which in essence has to decide between different institutions the question always arises: &ldquo;Who is afraid of the big, bad wolf?&rdquo;.  The answer is that everybody is afraid of the big, bad wolf and everybody gangs up on the big, bad wolf.  Therefore, I would much rather leave the power with the Department of Education.  It would be better, of course, if it were left to the Department of Finance.  The circumstances in which it was taken away from the Department of Finance were peculiar.  I happen to know them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I will. An unduly large grant was given by a Minister for Finance to Trinity College, Dublin and then because he thought there was going to be an unholy uproar about it he shifted the Universities and Colleges Vote to the Department of Education a couple of days later.  It was quite simple and straightforward.  I could give the Deputy the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be precise about it.  The Department of Finance was responsible for universities and colleges until the year 1955 and in that year a quite abnormal grant relative to the number of students in the place was given to Trinity College, Dublin and in the belief, the fond belief, that there was going to be an <Col N="1491" /> unholy row, the Minister shifted the Estimate to the Department of Education. As I say, the more remote the place would be which would assign the moneys to the different institutions the more satisfied I would be and, therefore, I have not bothered to look at the composition of this body at the moment.  Since the present chairman is going to determine, I presume, who the members of this statutory body will be, I take it he is not going to pick between one college and another and I assume that there are about twice as many representatives on this body at the moment from University College, Cork, University College, Galway, Trinity College, Dublin as there are from University College, Dublin.  But, who is the big, bad wolf? The big, bad wolf is University College, Dublin.  Therefore, a gang-up is an absolute certainty.  There is not the slightest doubt about it.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he would stick to this and accept the next amendment which I will be proposing so as to make sure, in fact, of the exact opposite of what Deputy FitzGerald wants but I was pleased with one aspect of what Deputy FitzGerald said.  Deputy FitzGerald is now beginning to wonder is this whole blooming thing worth the candle at all. That certainly gave me pleasure.

I have already explained on many occasions that &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; in the subsection are two global amounts which will be shown in the Book of Estimates by way of Grants-in-Aid, one on current expenditure and one for capital expenditure.</P>

      <P>I have already stated roughly my reasons for putting down this amendment.  These are serious reasons.  Members of the House may smile and look on this as a form of argumentation over something that is of no significance but I personally believe &mdash; and I was glad to gather from what the Minister said that, in fact, it is the intention&mdash;essentially when you have done with it, the buck stops here. Where is &ldquo;here&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Here&rdquo; in this context is the council table over in Government Buildings.  That is where &ldquo;here&rdquo; is.  That is where the buck stops when it comes to this kind of thing.  I must say personally I am glad of that.  To make clear what I think of this, I cannot say &ldquo;proposed institution&rdquo; but if I said it is very quiet at present, it is all the more likely that it will behave extremely badly when it gets this kind of legislation under its feet to hold it up and the very fact that it is behaving like a mouse up to the present means that it will behave like a lion once it starts this kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at it in another way. What is the use of our pretending that this body is going to control the money?  When it put up £24 million and when I drew the Minister's attention <Col N="1493" /> to the fact that it was cut to £14 million in the Department of Education, what did the Minister say to me? He said he had experts there who were much better than these fellows and when I asked: &ldquo;Are these the chaps to whom we are supposed to turn over control of the whole of higher education in this country?&rdquo;  The Minister said: &ldquo;calm yourself&rdquo;.  I do not mind admitting that this kind of remark rolls off me.  The Minister told me to calm myself and I pointed out to him that I was perfectly calm.  Here we have proof that those bodies by the nature of their work should be independent. That is the reason they have been so successful in western Europe in the past centuries.  This is what I meant when I made this remark previously but apparently various Deputies thought I was talking about the periods of the Fascist regime in Italy, the Nazi regime in Germany and the present regime in France, although I do not know very much about universities in France at the moment.  When this kind of thing is started it does not matter what name you give it, there will be the usual discussions behind closed doors and so on and the independence of the institutions of higher education will be destroyed.</P>
    <P>This amendment is the opposite to that proposed a short time ago by Deputy FitzGerald.  Not alone should the word &ldquo;amounts&rdquo; be left in but &ldquo;such amounts for particular institutions of higher education as may be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; should be included.  Apart from my catching the Minister on a slight error in the Bill at one stage, he has not listened to anything I said.  The Minister has not heard anything I have said.  I hope he will accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is what appears to me to be the case.  It would mean if it were found after the Estimate had been passed that for some reason the allocation proposed for a particular institution would not be required in full by that institution in the year in question An tÚdarás would not have any authority to transfer the surplus amount to another institution where circumstances might have made the original allocation inadequate.  This could be done only by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  Under the terms of the Bill, the financial provision in the Estimate would be in two global sums; one in regard to capital grants and one in regard to recurrent grants. As has been mentioned already, an addendum to the Estimate would give a list of the institutions, with particulars of the grants &mdash; capital and recurrent &mdash; which it is proposed to pay each institution.  It should be emphasised that this addendum would not form part of the Estimate proper; it would be a statement for the information of the House and others who might be interested.  If An tÚdarás found it necessary to make some changes or adjustments in the grants proposed to be paid as between one institution and another they would be free to do so provided they did not exceed the global allocation for capital and recurrent grants contained in the Estimate.</P>

      <P>Words must mean something.  What each institution should get will be set out in an addendum or appendix to the Estimate and I think it should be so set out.  This will be discussed in very many quarters in the most appalling circumlocutiom for months beforehand, with a resultant increase in paperwork and wasteful administration.  The result will be that we shall have three bodies where one would suffice.  Instead of having one decisive voice, as happened when it was in the Department of Finance, we will have the Department of Finance, the Department of Education and An tÚdarás.  If that is an improvement at present when the Government are scraping the bottom of the barrel &mdash; not only in this country but all around the world &mdash; I have very different ideas about efficient administration than have the Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on a number of other amendments which also affected the autonomy of An tÚdarás. We now turn to the autonomy of the universities.  The amendment is designed to limit the power of An tÚdarás to make conditions as to the manner in which the money given to the universities and the institutions of higher education should be spent.  We had much discussion on this matter on <Col N="1496" /> Committee Stage but it was not a satisfactory discussion.  Whereas on most issues the net differences between the two viewpoints emerge and clearcut issues come before us during the course of the debate, in this case this has not happened.  The Minister has not given any sensible reason which carries conviction for including this power to impose conditions in respect of non-capital sums.  We are all agreed that where sums are provided for capital purposes they must be used for those specific purposes and must not be used for something else.  However, in the running of any institution the money needed has to be sought on a certain basis.  That basis is put forward. Under this particular section, as at present worded, it will be possible for An tÚdarás to insist that the money be spent precisely in the way set out.  This could destroy completely the autonomy of universities and institutes of higher education.  Their power to adjust their spending marginally within the course of the year to meet the kind of situations that arise could be destroyed by these provisions here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister could think of changing the present system.  As things stand, the university or college put forward their request to the Department.  The request is couched in the form of a request for the same amount of money as in the previous year, with certain additions arising out of needs for certain purposes, which may be listed &mdash; higher salaries, more staff, an improvement in staff-student ratio, higher administration costs, and so forth; the total amount required is put forward and the Minister's Department then send back a letter giving half, or one-third, of the amount requested, saying the amount is to meet all needs.  This is unsatisfactory in that the total sum provided is clearly quite incapable of meeting all the needs listed but, at least, when the money comes back the university are free to decide how they will spend the money. Given that they have got only a proportion of what they looked for &mdash; the proportion in recent years in the case of the largest college has been less than half &mdash; they have then to make up their minds, and they are quite free to do so, how they will spend the money.  They <Col N="1497" /> may decide to raise salaries and, therefore, cannot increase staff; they may decide to cut back on current spending on a department, or departments, in order to improve the staff-student ratio in others.  They are free to decide what they will do with the money.  This is the present situation. It is unsatisfactory in that the sums voted may be quite inadequate, but that is a hazard of the financial situation of any democratic country, and no doubt also of undemocratic countries. That is something we cannot cope with, but what we can try to do is to ensure that the introduction of An tÚdarás does not bring a serious reduction in the autonomy of the universities, remembering that the intention in introducing this body was to increase the autonomy of the universities and get them away from possible pressures by Government Departments so that they could run their affairs in a particular way.  That is what this body were recommended for and that is why they were set up.  That was the intention behind it.  Not alone is the autonomy of An tÚdarás being vitiated by the provisions of section 12, subsection (1), with their value greatly diminished, but the Minister is now, by virtue of the wording of subsection (2), taking away the autonomy of the universities with regard to the method by which they spend the inadequate sums given to them and is vesting in An tÚdarás the power to lay down conditions that the money must be spent in accordance with the conditions they may seek to impose, conditions which can be of any degree of detail. There is nothing to inhibit An tÚdarás in any way.  The moneys must be spent in accordance with the conditions they lay down.  This is clearly objectionable and the Minister must see that it is objectionable.</P>
    <P>The value of this legislation, if it had value when first thought of, would be removed completely if the existing autonomy of these institutions were removed by giving to An tÚdarás the power to impose conditions in respect of non-capital sums, a power which does not exist at present and is not exercised by the Department of Education. Frankly, the Minister has given us no reason whatever for giving this <Col N="1498" /> power to An tÚdarás and no reason why we should decide to take away from the universities autonomy in the matter of non-capital spending; their power, in other words, to change their plans in the course of the year in the light of the immediate pressures on them.  The university may be seeking money for the purpose of increasing staff in different departments.  They may be induced by the demands of An tÚdarás for information to set out these requirements in some detail in order to make their case.  Under this subsection An tÚdarás are then entitled to say: &ldquo;Yes, you may have the money, but you must spend it in precisely this way.&rdquo;  If, in the course of the year, it transpired that an extra French lecturer was required because the number of students in that particular subject had greatly increased and it had not been found possible to get a lecturer in Italian, as it was originally hoped to do, then the university would have to go back to An tÚdarás in order to make this small change and employ one lecturer rather than another. This is a diminution in the autonomy, a diminution which did not exist until the introduction of this Bill.  The Minister has given us no grounds for this. The university will need a good deal of flexibility in deciding how to allocate the inadequate sums they get as between the various needs put forward. Any system under which the details of what they spend the money for current expenses on are laid down by An tÚdarás will completely destroy their autonomy.  I cannot see why the Minister could want to do this now.  His Department have allocated money to the universities and they have not felt up to now that there was any particular problem.  The universities have a system with regard to the spending of current sums.  The authority of the Minister for Finance and the Department has been felt to be sufficient because of the power to withold or vary amounts in subsequent years.  The Department did not need the right to impose conditions on the spending of non-capital sums and I do not see why An tÚdarás should now be given this power.  I doubt if An tÚdarás looked for it and I do not know why the Minister is giving it to that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give my strongest support to Deputy Dr. FitzGerald.  This particular subject was extensively discussed on both the Second and the Committee Stages. We are wasting our time in seeking to get the Minister to change his mind in this.  For the purpose of the record, I want to assert my total agreement with Deputy Dr. FitzGerald on this point.  I listened with great attention to the Minister's remarks on both the Second and Committee Stages on this subject and, like Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, I remained totally unconvinced. I read with considerable attention &mdash; it may be in order to mention this because it touches on the point&mdash; the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the seminar of the Irish Federation of University Teachers last Saturday.  These remarks seemed to provide a sort of view of the State's role in education and may I say &mdash; the Minister knows this &mdash; I am probably more in sympathy with his thinking and the thinking of the Parliamentary Secretary than perhaps either Deputy Dr. O'Donovan or Deputy Dr. FitzGerald is.  Unquestionably the Cabinet are the spokesmen of the citizens and it is the citizens who will pay for these institutions.  Unquestionably they retain some residual right therefore to control these institutions, a right against which autonomy is rather vague.  Indeed, it is a concept of autonomy that cannot stand.  Clearly a university cannot be made a capital grant of £500,000 for a computer and spend it on library facilities.  This could not be permitted. If the Minister were to accept Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's amendment he would still retain in his hands and in the hands of An tÚdarás perfectly adequate powers of community control through him and through them.  The powers he is seeking in this Bill seem to me to be potentially excessive to a very high degree.  I say &ldquo;potentially&rdquo; because I do not envisage the present Minister for Education or the Minister for Finance utilising these powers in a wrong manner.  A situation in which a reserve power remains with the authority and, through it, with the Minister to vet current expenditure in every point of detail &mdash; salary, status and conditions <Col N="1500" /> of a particular lecturer, the strength of a particular teaching area in the college&mdash;is a dangerous situation because it contains a potentially dangerous power.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said and, broadly speaking, what the Parliamentary Secretary argued the other day, that an institution of higher learning cannot be permitted indefinitely to continue to produce vastly excessive numbers of graduates in one field in which there is no social need and insufficient numbers in another field where there is such need.  I agree that to some extent this does take place at present.  This is wasteful of public money but if one has to choose between a situation where public money is wasted because academic fashions change slowly or, on the other hand, a situation where the authority by instant directive can boost up or run down a particular teaching area by control of current expenditure, then I would accept the element of social waste in the first instance and the slowness of change which derived from it. The second possibility is to me a frightening one and, little as I care for some of the more extreme academic claims for autonomy, in this instance I think the academics in their suspicious reaction to section 12 (2) of the Bill are perfectly correct.  This particular proposal has provoked more fear in the hearts of academics than any other in the Bill.  In this instance I think the academics are right; they are not always wrong: Deputy FitzGerald was right and I appeal &mdash; I am quite sure vainly &mdash; even at this late stage to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I derived a certain sour amusement from hearing Dr. FitzGerald on this amendment.  He is in general agreement with this Bill and then when the consequences of that agreement are brought home to him he says: &ldquo;No, not that.&rdquo;  I think I am the more consistent: I object to this totally.  There is quite sufficient control by the State of university education at present.  As regards people who say that there are too many graduates in one faculty rather than another my reply is: &ldquo;How do they know whether there will be too many next week or <Col N="1501" /> the week after, not to speak of next year or the year after?&rdquo;  This includes the Parliamentary Secretary.  People who talk like this do not know what they are talking about.  &ldquo;There are too many graduates in Art&rdquo;&mdash;so what? Where is the lack of university graduates at present?  If we think of engineers, for example, I do not think their salaries, if we are to judge by the activities of professional engineers in recent weeks, are excessive.  It is certain that nothing indicates more quickly whether a particular class of graduate is in short supply or not than the market price he obtains for his work.</P>
      <P>We have not made the slightest impression on the Minister in this Bill. We did not make the slightest impression on the Minister for Labour either in his Bill until that Minister fell on the top of his head with the unemployment assistance business.  He came back a very different man.  I think the Minister for Education has fallen on the top of his head in recent weeks. His head must be more solid than that of the Minister for Labour.  In other words, he has a strong head physically but not mentally.  It is a pity that his sad experience in recent weeks over another matter has not made him see reason in connection with this Bill just as experience made his colleague, the Minister for Labour, see reason in connection with the Redundancy Payments Bill.  Remarkable was the change in a few weeks. I commend the reaction of the Minister for Labour to the Minister for his serious consideration.  I shall not delay the House any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my viewpoint clear on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage.  Obviously, we shall not come to agreeing with one another.  This subsection is essential to the Bill.  For example, if an institution seek additional money for a specific purpose which might add up to recurring expenditure for a number of years, An tÚdarás should at least be entitled, if they make the money available, to see that the money is not spent on some other project.  I made it very clear on each occasion that I spoke on this matter that there could <Col N="1502" /> be no question of An tÚdarás exercising day-to-day control over the normal, recurring expenditure in any college or institution but they must be entitled to ensure that if money is sought by a university or college of higher education for a specific purpose this money will not be spent on something else entirely unrelated to the purpose for which it was granted.  It is quite common at present for the universities to seek specific sums for specific purposes and to have it definitely stated when grants are being allocated what sums are being provided for such purposes. I want to re-emphasise that there will not be and cannot be any question of An tÚdarás exercising day-to-day control over normal recurring expenditure in any college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the question which is: why, if this power has not hitherto existed, or been exercised, it is suddenly needed now?  The fact is that the vast bulk of the expenditure of the universities is sought as a general grant.  Reasons are given for this, as I said already; the money is then given and the Department state that the money is given for the following purposes although, in fact, in some cases the amount given is not sufficient to fulfil all these purposes.  They may say, for example, that the money is given in order to enable the 11th round to be paid, in order to enable the staff-pupil ratio to be improved, in order to enable other things of this kind to be done, some of which are vague and unquantifiable but some of which are quantifiable.  It may well be that the total sum given is so much less than that sought that it may be less than is needed for what is quantified specifically, and leaves nothing, or less than nothing, for the unquantifiable items.  That is the system, in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of money being given in this general grant in such a way as to lay down conditions as to how it will be spent.  The universities have resisted that.  There have been attempts at inroads on that in recent years.  Universities in some cases have succumbed to some small degree in seeking money.  We had an instance <Col N="1503" /> recently of one college seeking money for a specific purpose, night courses. In other cases the format of negotiations has been such that some people might try to read into what has happened that there is an end to earmarking. On the whole, the universities have resisted the temptation and on the whole the Department have not attempted to lay down conditions as to how the money should be spent.  Yet the Minister now feels it is necessary to depart from this and to provide a legal power to insist that money should be spent in accordance with the requirements of An tÚdarás.  There is nothing in the present situation to require that; we have managed without it up to now.  There are no grounds for introducing it at this stage.  The Minister has failed completely to make his case on this; I think he knows that. He has been over-persuaded here by the Department as in one or two other cases.  I can only regret that he has not stood up to them on this issue.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I promised to put down this amendment.  Really it puts into words my thinking on the way universities should be financed.  It used to be the case that if you had an institution like UCG with 500 students you could not get £500 a year per student but you could if you were an institution like UCD.  This was unfair to the smaller institutions but, of course, it is no longer the case.  I see that Galway now have 3,400 students, but it is still the smallest.  However, it is much the same size as UCC and is not much smaller than the oldest institution in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will come back to my main point.  I do not trust those people and there is no reason why I should.  There is an old adage to the effect that you do not trust anybody and certainly our whole administrative system has been built up on that basis.

You could use other words, I suppose.  You could use &ldquo;accountability&rdquo;.  That is a great word nowadays &mdash; to ensure accountability. This amendment will improve the Bill.  Before he finished, Deputy FitzGerald asked the Minister to stand up to his advisers.  The fact is the Minister has shown no capacity for this.  In connection with this Bill the Minister has not shown the slightest capacity.  I have a great deal of experience of advising Ministers and when this kind of a debate occurred the Minister concerned invariably paid attention.  When a Minister finds disparate people like Deputies Thornley, FitzGerald and myself, with completely different views, agreeing among ourselves, any sensible Minister would scratch his head, hold his head in his hands, and say: &ldquo;How come these three fellows agree?&rdquo; I regret the Minister has shown this incapacity. Who has tied him hand and foot?  Is it the illegal An tÚdarás &mdash; illegal, non-legal, call it what you like?

I am not talking about the do goodism he displayed in regard to section 3 when he accepted certain amendments, so to speak putting up what would appear to be good to the public.  I am not interested in that. I am interested in the reality of the Bill and the Minister has not shown any evidence of having listened to any constructive suggestion.  Although this has been a prolonged debate, I think the Minister has got away with murder because no Deputy said to the Minister what he thought about this kind of thing &mdash; until the last few minutes, that is, when I have been telling him to grow up and to be his own man.  He <Col N="1506" /> will not get any respect from anybody for bringing in a Bill here, drafted by somebody else, and sticking absolutely on it.  This amendment is plain enough.</P>

      <P>I will return absolutely to the amendment.  It states that when dishing out the money An tÚdarás will have regard primarily to the number of students pursuing studies leading to a degree in the institution.  What other method would sensible people use?  I do not know any other method of doing the job and I do not know how sensible people would do it.  Small institutions with fewer students wanted more money per student to cover their overheads and I agree with this but when these institutions became big they still wanted more money per student and this is entirely wrong; it is an incorrect way of approaching higher education.  There are ludicrous staff student ratios at Belfield of 1:35 in the faculty of art and 1:60 in the faculty of commerce but the present Government is well used to that kind of thing because there are national schools in the city with classes of 60 students and in case anybody is in any doubt I can name a couple of them.

I support this amendment <Col N="1507" /> which seeks in a somewhat different form to do what I was seeking to do at an earlier stage; it is a matter of opinion which is the best way to do it but the things to be done should not be a matter of opinion; they should be self-evident.  Although other considerations have to be taken into account, some faculties and some institutions being of a smaller size may require more favourable staff student ratios but obviously the number of students should be the principal criterion.  I, therefore, support the amendment.</P>

      <P>The permutations and combinations of Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy O'Donovan and myself must stagger the credibility of all three of us in the Minister's eyes but I regret to have to say that I cannot support Deputy O'Donovan on this amendment. For precisely some of the reasons he gave it seems to me there are many criteria for the extent of State funds which would apply to an institution besides that of sheer numbers.  I am not thinking of the comparative method of funding of Trinity College or University College, Dublin, because if I may say so with respect unlike the two Deputies I have mentioned I have managed as a whole to keep out of my contributions to this debate an over-sensitivity to the interests of the particular institution of which I am a graduate and a staff member.  I am thinking more specifically of colleges like University College, Galway, which could for a particular reason require more extensive funding than others for particular reasons.  The educational merit is not always on the side of the big battalions and in this case it is not always on the side of either of the Dublin colleges.  There are many social attractions, attractions of amenity and attractions of status, in some case wrongly conceded status, no doubt, which would cause a student to go to a Dublin college through preference if he could do so; this is quite wrong; it is a stupid snobbery which has no reflection upon the real standards of other colleges.  I can certainly foresee circumstances in which to counteract these better staff student ratios, more <Col N="1508" /> expensive areas of excellence would have to be maintained in a small instituation than in a large one and I cannot, therefore, support this amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage the Deputy asked me to consider amending the section in the manner now suggested in the amendment.  I have explained on a number of occasions and at some length that the moneys available to An tÚdarás each year will come in the form of two global funds, one in respect of capital and the other for recurrent grants for these institutions. It will be for An tÚdarás to fix the allocation of these amounts as between the different institutions in accordance with the general functions given to it under section 3 of the Bill and having regard to all the relevant considerations.  An tÚdarás must, of course, in relation to any institution have regard to the number of students following third level courses of various types but this would be only one of the matters to be considered.  Whether Deputy O'Donovan accepts it or not there are some faculties, courses or branches of study which are more expensive than others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the contrary, the Minister talked to me very much as I talked to him a while ago.  If everything the Minister has said on this Bill about this matter were to be construed it would be found that at one moment he is suggesting that lump sums would be given to An tÚdarás, which An tÚdarás would then divide out to the institutions and on another occasion he is saying the way the moneys are to be divided out would be indicated in an addendum to the Estimate.  Both these could be true because the Department could fix up with An tÚdarás beforehand how the money was to be divided and this is where the Department of Education comes into the picture.</P>
      <P>I still believe this would be a much better Bill if these words were put in at the end of the section.  The section would then read: &ldquo;Any payment to an institution which An tÚdarás makes out of the amounts it receives under the foregoing subsection shall be made in such a manner subject to such conditions as An tÚdarás thinks fit and shall have regard primarily to the number of students pursuing studies leading to a degree in that institution.&rdquo; We no longer have small institutions.  I see constant reference to the fact that University College, Galway is going to be built up to 7,500 students and University College, Cork to the same number.  I used to consider the ideal size for a university, beyond which it became top heavy, was 4,000 to 5,000 students.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 3, to delete &ldquo;at its discretion&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is quite a simple amendment which should commend itself even to the Minister.  The section states that An tÚdarás &ldquo;may publish reports of such studies&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in legislation is mandatory, it really means &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Here in this section it clearly means it may or it may not.  There is no reason why those words &ldquo;at its discretion&rdquo; should be put in.  I know the Minister gave me a completely absurd explanation of this on Committee Stage when he said they might have a small little study and they would not want to publish it.  Nobody expects, if some little administrative study is done inside this body, that it should be published.  There is no compulsion on them to publish it so why do I want to take out the words &ldquo;at its discretion&rdquo;? I simply want to do it because there is an inference in it that they can publish if they like and if something comes to them as a result of an investigation which the members of the body do not like they can bury it, put it in a pigeon hole and forget about it.  If those words were taken out the study could still be put in a pigeon hole.  I fail to see why unnecessary words should be put into the section.</P>

      <P>Once we come to anything serious the Minister digs in again.  The reason for the amendment is quite simple.  An tÚdarás cannot be allowed the power to dismiss its officers or servants without stating the cause why the person is being dismissed.  It is elementary, my dear Watson, in all relations where there is a contract of service that a person must be given a reason for his or her dismissal.  I put the words &ldquo;for cause stated&rdquo; purely in the singular as distinct from Deputy FitzGerald's amendment &ldquo;for causes stated&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between <Col N="1512" /> my amendment and that of Deputy O'Donovan is only in the placing of the words in the sentence. I should like to say, though it appears in the plural, my intention was to have it in the singular.  In fact, on Committee Stage, it was in the plural.  The reason I put it down in the singular now was that there were objections raised to the plural form.  I was not sure that I understood the objections fully but in case they had any validity I decided to put it down on Report Stage in the singular form.  I am completely <i>ad idem</i> with Deputy O'Donovan.  The only question is where you put it in the sentence.  I would urge the Minister to accept this. It would be intolerable to reject an amendment designed to give someone the right to know the reason why he is dismissed.  That is a basic human right which should be given to everybody in public and in private employment. I cannot conceive that the Minister would want to reject that right here.  I urge on him, therefore, to accept one or other of the amendments whichever he finds stylistically preferable.</P>

      <P>I take a quite different view from the Deputies who spoke on this.  To provide in this Bill that there must be cause stated for the removal by An tÚdarás of one of its officers or servants in my view would imply that the cause should be made public knowledge at least if that were requested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly in relation to this and I feel it would be very undesirable that even that type of implication should be there and particularly so from the point of view of the individual concerned.  If the amendment is aimed at protecting an individual against wrongful dismissal one must remember that the power of dismissal rests with An tÚdarás which, as I said on very many occasions during the course of the debate on this <Col N="1513" /> Bill, we must assume will be a body of reasonable people.  They must exercise that power only with the consent of the Minister and, therefore, if a person were to be dismissed without sufficient cause it would require something which would be tantamount to a conspiracy between An tÚdarás and the Minister.  Moreover, a person in such circumstances could also in the normal way have recourse to the courts if any action were taken in his case which was not in accordance with his conditions of service.  I look on this from a completely different viewpoint from the Deputies who proposed the amendments, I have already, as I said, spoken on this particular aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been discussed on many occasions here on different Bills.  There is merit in the Minister's point and there is merit in the amendment.  On the one hand, there are occasions on which it would be better that the reasons for dismissal or removal from office were not made public.  Equally, of course, the right of an individual to know why he is being dismissed is also particularly important. The Minister suggested there would need to be a conspiracy between the Minister and An tÚdarás.  That is not outside the bounds of possibility I am afraid.  However, leaving that aside, would the Minister permit a right of appeal to the Minister against a decision <Col N="1514" /> of An tÚdarás so that somebody who felt he or she had a grievance could appeal against the decision?</P>
      <P>There are precedents for this type of mechanism so that one would have the virtue of both the Minister's attitude of attempting to protect somebody against something that person might not wish to be disclosed, which might not be one the person would be particularly proud of and, on the other hand, ensuring that the person should know and have stated the causes for his dismissal.  I am afraid I do not take very seriously this suggestion about the right of appeal to the courts.  The right to appeal to a court is really rather a fictional one in so far as there is great expense involved and if one takes on such a very powerful body as either An tÚdarás or the Minister they will have far greater resources than a private individual. I am afraid the safeguard of the courts simply is not a safeguard. The safeguard of the unlikelihood of the conspiracy between the Minister and An tÚdarás is not really a safeguard either unless there is a right of appeal to the Minister.  On the other hand, of course, with the right of appeal to the Minister the Minister might simply use the power here to refuse to give a cause also.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the general purpose of the amendments while I appreciate the difficulty which the Minister has put forward here.  It is possible that an amendment could be framed which would allow both positions to prevail, where the person is given a reason which he can then pursue if he wants to in the courts, if he feels aggrieved, while An tÚdarás are precluded from making public, without the consent of the person aggrieved, the reason for which he had been dismissed by An tÚdarás?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply do not accept that the words &ldquo;and for causes stated&rdquo; mean that the cause has to be published.  What that means in law, as I understand it, is that the person concerned must be told the reason. I think the interpretation the Minister has put on it and which Deputy Dr. Browne seems to share is incorrect, but <Col N="1515" /> if there is any doubt about that in anybody's mind to alleviate any such doubt I would be more than happy to modify my amendment to read that &ldquo;An tÚdarás may for causes stated to the person concerned and with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  There is no difficulty about that.  We are quite capable of finding a form of words to meet this, I think, imaginary difficulty but in case there is anything in it I am quite prepared to propose that.  This removes any objection that either the Minister or Deputy Dr. Browne have on that score.</P>
      <P>The other reasons put forward by the Minister do not seem to me to bear on this issue particularly.  Once the position is clear, that the person concerned must be told the reason, then his position is protected, he knows why he is being dismissed.  If he feels that the reason is inadequate he can go to the courts to pursue his right of action for wrongful dismissal.  If, on the other hand, the reason stated is one which he realises has some validity and which, if put forward in the court, would not reflect favourably on him he will not press the issue but he is entitled to know the reason.  I, therefore, put to the Minister, to meet the objection he has made, if it has any validity, whether he will accept a modification of the amendment to read: &ldquo;For causes stated to the person concerned&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is related to an amendment in section 1 subsection (1) put down by Deputy FitzGerald and discussed at some length on the Committee Stage.  Deputy FitzGerald's amendment sought to ensure that the <Col N="1517" /> Minister could designate an institution as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Bill only on the recommendation of An tÚdarás and by statutory authority.  As far as I remember, Deputy FitzGerald was supported by Deputy Thornley on this amendment and they pressed the recommendation strongly in its two aspects, that is to say that the designation should be on the recommendation of An tÚdarás and that it should be by statutory authority.  I did not yield on either of these points but I said that I would be willing to consider an amendment which I hoped might meet the requirements of the Deputies. The effect of amendment No. 8 would be to oblige the Minister to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas every regulation he makes under section 1 subsection (1) (c) designating an institution as an institution of higher education for the purposes of this Bill. It provides, therefore, the safeguard of a formal statutory authority in relation to such designation and I think this is what was sought by Deputies FitzGerald and Thornley.</P>

      <P>At this stage I should like to say how much I object to the contents of this Bill.  So far as I am aware there was no public demand for it.  I suspect that there are some empire builders in the Minister's Department who thought that this was suitable territory to start butting into. I do not agree with them and neither do I agree with the Minister or the Government for having accepted their advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney said that people should not be allowed to spend a lot of public money without there being control over that money.  I agree with him fully on that, but that is a different matter from what is in this Bill which contains many sections that are extremely objectionable.  It gives to this body the power to push around the university institutions in this country. Although it would appear that in this House, at any rate, I am alone in my view on this body, I understand the dangers inherent in setting up this kind of institution, apart from the fact that it provides for an additional institution between the Government and the universities. This is to be regretted.  It would be very much better if we did not have this circumlocution, where people involved in university administration who may wish to have clarified a simple matter, will have to start going around from the Government Department to this body.  If the people who run universities run into difficulties they are under no obligation to make representations to this body.  They <Col N="1519" /> can see everybody connected with the Government, up to and including the Taoiseach, and in particular the Taoiseach. In fact, they are very likely to do so.  I regret that this measure is being passed by the House.</P>

However, it would be wrong to suggest that we are happy with the Bill as it stands.  We can only hope that in the other House more persuasive voices will be heard and that these will succeed in persuading the Minister to make the changes necessary to turn what is in some respects a patchy and even dangerous piece of legislation into good legislation.</P>
      <P>I shall summarise those features of the Bill as it now exists that seem to me to be objectionable.  There are four principle ways in which the Bill diminishes in a manner that is undesirable and unacceptable the autonomy of An tÚdarás.  An tÚdarás are not given any power over the designation of additional bodies or institutes of higher education to be brought within the scope of their authority.  The Dáil has been given some power by way of an amendment passed a short while ago but An tÚdarás have not been given any such power.  On Committee Stage the Minister thought it inconceivable for any Minister to designate such power without the agreement of An tÚdarás.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the provision under which money is earmarked to institutions by Government Departments is something which is going against the whole concept of this Bill.  Its publication in an appendix to the Book of Estimates is an objectionable precedent.  It takes away from An tÚdarás the clearcut role of distributing the sums allotted by the Government to higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, there is undesirable interference in the appointment of An tÚdarás staff.  They are not free to <Col N="1520" /> appoint their own staff but, on the contrary, require the approval of the Government Department concerned for staff appointments, dismissals, conditions of service, rates of pay and so on. Again, this is something that is very unusual, although a precedent can be cited for it.  This precedent, however, is one which also originated in this particular Department.  This shows how, for quite a long period of time, the Department have desired to maintain control of any subordinate bodies to a degree that is not marked to the same extent in other Departments.</P>
    <P>Finally, in respect of the autonomy of An tÚdarás there is the fact that the chairman is appointed or removed by the Government.  The body are not permitted to elect their own chairman. In these circumstances their autonomy is being interfered with in a manner that will limit their value and acceptability to the academic community.  In addition, the autonomy of the universities themselves is interfered with seriously by the provision, on which the Minister has insisted, of giving to An tÚdarás the power to impose conditions as to the manner in which non-capital funds are used.  Again, this is objectionable.  It is a new principle, one that we have done without up to now and that it would have been better for us to have continued without.  I regret that the Minister has insisted on including it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is objectionable is the refusal to agree that the staffing as well as the accommodation should be taken into account when assessing financial matters for institutes of higher education.  The idea that, so long as there is the accommodation, students should be packed in regardless of staffing is one that does not augur well for the future of higher education in this country.  Also, there is the absence of any protection for the staff of An tÚdarás in so far as they can be dismissed without the cause being stated.  The Minister's insistence on refusing my amendment, even when I agreed to meet him on the points, suggests an attitude of mind in relation to the appointment of staff which I find profoundly objectionable. Finally, there is the fact that, while <Col N="1521" /> there is provision for academic members on this authority, there is no equivalent provision for representation of students.  As I argued on Committee Stage and also on Second Stage, there is a strong case to be made for having a relatively small proportion of students on a body of this kind.  There is a case for student representation when one remembers the role that students are now playing in the whole field of research and policy formulation in the field of higher education.  That is something that cannot be denied.  I regret that the Minister did not agree to this.</P>
    <P>There are a number of serious defects in the Bill.  There was no necessity for these because the Bill could have been drafted differently.  If it had been drafted in another way we could have been in the position at this stage of congratulating the Minister on a good piece of work done during the past few months.  I hope the Minister will see fit to change his mind when these defects are put to him in the other House, as I hope they will be.  If the Minister is prepared to accept the proposals that I expect will be made in the Seanad, we could yet have a good Bill.  Should it happen, however, that there are no amendments in the Seanad to the points I have raised, I can only hope that An tÚdarás will operate having regard to the points made in this House; that they will try to avoid the dangers implicit in some of the power given to them; that they will try to mitigate the ill effects of some provisions of the Bill and will insist on maintaining their autonomy in so far as possible even where autonomy is circumscribed in an objectionable way in the provisions I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Briefly, I should like to extend a less qualified welcome to this Bill than that extended to it by Deputy FitzGerald.  In the main it is a good and proper piece of legislation, but I have one or two reservations. It is proper that there be a buffer between the Minister's Department and the universities.  A reasonably effective compromise has been achieved in this Bill in regard to the autonomy <Col N="1522" /> of each of the three groups whose interests could at certain times conflict. We are dealing here, first, with the Executive in general and the Minister in particular; secondly, with the Higher Education Authority, in the middle; and, thirdly, with the universities themselves. As I said at the outset of the Second Stage debate the concept of autonomy held by the proponents of each of these groups would be totally exclusive, if fully implemented, of any measure of autonomy in the authority. This incompatibility and confusion between the autonomous university, on the one hand, and the autonomous Higher Education Authority on the other and also the slightly excessive fear of State intervention has produced confusion at times in the arguments of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and Deputy Dr. O'Donovan.  To me the compromise is relatively reasonable.  I value university autonomy and I welcome the introduction of a quasi-autonomous Higher Education Authority.  Ultimately, the Minister for Education is the spokesman of the community and the buck must correctly stop on the Cabinet table.  This Bill correctly sets out to ensure this.  My reservations are less obvious than those of Deputy Dr. FitzGerald.  It is regrettable that the Minister, who proved quite flexible in some ways, declined to amend section 12 and more particularly section 12 (2).  I can only hope that the Minister's failure to do so will never in my lifetime lead to the dangers which Deputy Dr. FitzGerald and myself see such failure could lead to.  Like Deputy Dr. FitzGerald I am sorry that the Bill does not make specific provision for student representation.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to one last point in regard to section 3.  Deputy Desmond and I were responsible for the two amendments to this section which the Minister accepted.  They were referred to here as &ldquo;do good &mdash; ology&rdquo;.  If I could move away for a moment from the narrow field of the administration of the universities, may I express the hope that the authority will take section 3, as amended, seriously.</P>

      <P>Otherwise it will simply be perpetuating a system of higher education which, although it has improved much in the last 20 years, is accepted by us all as being fundamentally unjust in many respects and fundamentally unsound in its own internal democratisation.  I hope that the members of the authority will not feel that they are simply concerned with the book-keeping of the existing structure of education but rather that they will frame section 3 and hang it on the wall in order to keep it constantly before them.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to deal in any detail with the points raised by the Deputies opposite except to say that I do not accept the assessment of the Bill made by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald.  I believe that this is a worthwhile piece of legislation.  While at times it might have appeared that the discussions on this Bill were going to drag on interminably, we could not lose sight of the fact that we were discussing a very important measure and setting up on a statutory basis a body which will play a very important part in the future of higher education.</P>
      <P>I accepted a number of amendments which I felt improved the Bill.  I rejected other amendments because I considered that they were not appropriate or that they perhaps sought to limit unduly the power of An tÚdarás. As a guideline to An tÚdarás in their operations, I have no doubt that the debate which we have had will prove very useful.  Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the Deputies on all sides of the House for the contributions they have made and for the atmosphere in which this debate was conducted.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in my Budget Statement I proposed a number of changes in the field of taxation.  The Bill contains the provisions required to <Col N="1524" /> give effect to those proposals as well as provisions on a number of matters, notice of which was not given in either the Budget Statement or in the Financial Resolutions.  I shall draw attention to these in the course of the review I propose to give of the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part 1 of the Bill deals with income tax, including sur-tax.  Section 1 imposes income tax and sur-tax at percentage rates corresponding to those for last year, but the reduced rate on the first £100 of taxable income is abolished under section 2.  While this means an increased liability of under £12 a year for some taxpayers, the raising of the minimum earned income relief by £25 under section 6 will ensure, as I said in the Budget, that about 20,000 taxpayers are removed from the tax net and that many others will pay less tax than they did last year. Under sections 7 and 8 the &ldquo;age allowance&rdquo; and &ldquo;small income relief&rdquo; are increased commensurately with the minimum earned income relief.</P>
    <P>Additional tax relief is provided for certain hardship cases and for persons eligible for social welfare benefits. Section 9 enables an unmarried mother who is working full-time and undertakes the care of her child to claim the ordinary &ldquo;housekeeper allowance&rdquo; and section 11 introduces a new allowance of £100 for a blind person and of £200 where husband and wife are both blind. The income limit for the purposes of the dependent relative allowance is raised by section 10 to £243 which is the annual equivalent of the non-contributory old age pension as increased in the Budget; while section 12 allows a deduction for income tax of that part of the contributions under the Social Welfare Acts which is referable to the new death grants and retirement pensions.  Neither of these last two provisions was mentioned in the budget.</P>
    <P>The only other provisions in Part I of the Bill dealing with matters not previously announced are in section 19. Some local authorities have been advised that they do not come within the scope of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, relating to the scheme of <Col N="1525" /> collecting income tax from sub-contractors.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 19 removes doubt in this field by effectively requiring local authorities, housing associations, housing trusts or housing societies who have in fact deducted tax from payments made under construction contracts to sub-contractors since the scheme came into operation on 6th April, 1971, to remit the tax deducted to the Revenue.  Where tax was not deducted from payments made since the commencement of the scheme, the body in question may be required by the Revenue Commissioners to furnish particulars of such payments and must make such deductions in respect of payments made after the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 19 imposes a 1 per cent rate of interest for each month during which tax deducted from sub-contractors after the passing of the Act is not remitted to the Revenue. The same rate applies to unremitted PAYE, turnover tax and wholesale tax.</P>
    <P>I now come to the provisions designed to combat certain avoidance tactics.  Section 3 ensures that, if on the cessation of a trade or profession in 1972-73 or a later year, the actual profits in the two years preceding the last year of assessment are greater than the profits charged in those two years, the actual profits will be brought into charge instead.  Section 4 charges to tax foreign income of an Irish resident which is not remitted here but is applied abroad instead to repay a loan made on or after budget day and enjoyed by him in this country.  Section 14 enables income settled by a parent on his child to be brought into charge where the child is under 21 and unmarried at the time of payment.</P>
    <P>As announced in my Budget Statement, I propose to tighten-up the arrangements for the collection of income tax in arrear.  In this regard, section 15 has three main features: first, the rate of interest on unpaid tax is increased to 9 per cent per annum; second, the interest-free period allowed for payment is reduced to two months; and third, a taxpayer will no longer be allowed an interest-free period up to the time an appeal he has made <Col N="1526" /> is finally determined, unless he has made an agreed payment, or a payment which, while not agreed, proves to be not less than 80 per cent of the tax involved, within two months from the due date and pays any balance owing within two months of the determination of the appeal.  Where an agreed payment was made, section 16 enables repayments of overpaid tax to be effected with interest at the rate applicable to overdue tax.</P>
    <P>Section 17, which is a follow-up to section 15, requires tax due in accordance with a determination of the appeal commissioners to be paid before the appeal is re-heard by the circuit court.  If, as a result of the re-hearing, tax is found to have been over-paid, repayment under conditions similar to those in section 16 will be made.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 17 will come into effect on the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Where it is discovered that tax was undercharged because of fraud or neglect, section 18 enables interest to be collected at the rate of 9 per cent from the date the tax ought to have been paid.  The section will not, however, affect tax chargeable for any year of assessment prior to 1971-72.</P>
    <P>I announced a number of tax incentive reliefs in the Budget and these are also provided for in Part I of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 treats as a business expense the cost incurred in obtaining, for the purposes of a trade, the registration, or the renewal of registration, of a trade mark.  Under section 13, the enhanced industrial buildings allowance of 20 per cent is extended for a further two years up to 31st March, 1973.</P>
    <P>Because of the need to expand the industrial sector of the economy and to increase the opportunities for employment of our people, it is essential to provide a strong stimulus to immediate further investment by all our industries.  I am accordingly making provision, in section 24, to extend free depreciation to the whole country, so that the full cost incurred on acquiring new plant and equipment brought into use within the next two years may be written-off whenever the taxpayer chooses.</P>
    <P>As free depreciation is already available <Col N="1527" /> to the designated areas, I am making special provision in sections 20 to 23 for a 20 per cent investment allowance in respect of the cost of new plant and machinery for use in those areas.  An industrialist in the West will, in effect, be able to write-off up to 120 per cent of such cost in the first year if he so wishes.  The investment allowance will also be operative for two years up to 31st March, 1973.  To prevent abuse, however, it is necessary to provide for its withdrawal if the assets in question are sold either without every being used in the trade or within two years of being brought into use.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill relates to customs and excise.  Sections 25 and 26 provide for the increases already announced in the customs and excise duties on beer and spirits.  The provisions in section 27 and 28 have not previously been announced.</P>
    <P>Section 27 removes the requirement that certain vodka of United Kingdom origin must be warehoused for at least three years before being delivered for home consumption.  This requirement does not apply to comparable Irish-made vodka and the disparity of treatment is held to be discriminatory against vodka of UK origin under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  The United Kingdom have already removed the disparity and it is proposed, under section 27, to take similar action here with effect from 1st July, 1971.</P>
    <P>The introduction of modern techniques in customs control of large numbers of passengers and their baggage, particularly at airports, requires alterations in the existing legal framework which is based on the premise that each passenger coming into the country is questioned by a customs officer.  Under section 28, individual questioning may, in effect, be dispensed with and a &ldquo;self-selection&rdquo; or &ldquo;dual channel&rdquo; system used instead.  The basis of this system is that the passenger may choose to go through a &ldquo;nothing to declare&rdquo; channel, where he will be subject only to a spot check, or to go through the &ldquo;goods to declare&rdquo; channel.  With the ever-increasing growth in passenger <Col N="1528" /> traffic, I am satisfied that the adoption of the dual channel system will facilitate the clearance of passengers without increasing the number of customs staff or opening the door to serious smuggling.</P>
    <P>I now come to Part III of the Bill which deals with death duties.  Section 29 is purely a technical provision designed to remove doubt in relation to the definition of the expression &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; and it does not impose an extra charge on any property or person.</P>
    <P>Section 30 increases the rates of estate duty on estates over £55,000 as announced in the Budget.  It is sometimes alleged that the liability to estate duty may influence wealthy individuals in deciding whether to take up residence here.  Our highest rate was reduced in 1961 from 53 per cent to 40 per cent, as against a maximum of 80 per cent in Britain, but in the past 10 years there has been no evidence of an influx of wealthy persons.  Even with the proposed maximum rate of 55 per cent, the rates on estates over £55,000 in Ireland will be significantly below the effective rates on corresponding estates in Britain.  With the increased abatements of £1,500 for a widow and £750 for each dependent child now proposed in section 38, the rates of duty on estates in any range passing to a widow, whether or not with dependent children, will be much lower than the effective rates prevailing in Britain.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides, subject to certain exceptions, for an increase to 9 per cent, in the rate of interest on death duties in arrear in line with the rate proposed under section 15 in respect of unpaid income tax.  The new rate of interest will not, however, come into operation for a period of four months after the date of the passing of the Act.  The purpose of section 32 is to prevent loss of revenue by ensuring that, in addition to the executor, trustees, beneficiaries, surviving joint tenants and present owners will be accountable for estate duty in respect of property vested in them of which the disceased was competent to dispose.</P>
    <P>Section 41 provides new penalty provisions, in lieu of those referred to in the Third Schedule to the Bill, for <Col N="1529" /> failure to comply with the provisions of the Acts relating to estate duty. The remaining sections in Part III contain anti-avoidance measures.</P>
    <P>Section 33 is designed to prevent avoidance of duty through the exemption for objects of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest, while section 34 tackles the device known as &ldquo;grant and lease back&rdquo;.  Last year, we found it necessary to prevent avoidance of duty through the medium of private companies and, this year section 35 contains further provisions aimed at closing this avenue of avoidance. Section 36 prevents avoidance of duty by devices involving the purchase of land outside the State.  Section 37 abolishes the reduction in the value for duty of gifts made at any time within five years before death and section 39 seeks to prevent avoidance by applying the market value, instead of artificial valuation, to agricultural land which is sold within six years of the death or date of the gift.</P>
    <P>Section 40 restricts the existing exemption from estate duty of gifts made in consideration of marriage.  This proposal has aroused a certain amount of criticism both inside and outside the House.  I should like, therefore, to explain it in the general context of the anti-avoidance measures contained in Part III of the Bill.  As Deputies are aware, the question of introducing a tax on wealth, or on capital gains, has been widely discussed in recent years and I have given it a good deal of consideration. Estate duty is, in effect, the only form of tax imposed on wealth in this country.  Because of the methods of avoiding it which have been devised over the years by experts specialising in this field of taxation, estate duty has been stigmatised as a voluntary tax&mdash; one which you can easily escape if you want to.  I have come to the conclusion that the first step to take in the taxation of wealth is to bring our present rates of estate duty up to a more realistic level and to ensure as far as possible that the tax is fully enforceable.  Part III of this Bill is designed to raise the rates and to close off the avenues of escape which we know are widely used at present.  While these measures are estimated to produce about £¼ million <Col N="1530" /> extra revenue this year and about £1 million in a full year which will, of course, be very welcome, the main purpose of Part III of the Bill is to counter tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>The restriction proposed in section 40 forms part of this general design. The main criticism directed against the proposal is that it is anti-social as it will discourage elderly parents, and farmers in particular, from transferring their property to their children when they marry.  I think this criticism is not well founded.  In the first place, I believe that parents who wish to give their property to their children will do so irrespective of the estate duty position. In the second place, I consider that the unrestricted exemption which at present exists in favour of marriage gifts is not, in fact, as strong an incentive to parents to effect early transfers of property to their children as some people would have us believe.</P>
    <P>Estimates of the numbers of gifts disclosed to the Estate Duty office during the years 1966 to 1968 indicate that an average of 1,000 gifts a year were made and of these 81 only were in consideration of marriage.  The fact that such a transfer, if made within five years before the parent's death, will come within the scope of estate duty should, I believe, encourage parents to make the transfer at an earlier stage than they would in our present situation.  In other words, it should have an effect directly opposite to that suggested by the critics of the section, by encouraging earlier transfers of property from parents to their children.</P>
    <P>In removing the total exemption of marriage gifts and making them chargeable to estate duty if made within the five years before death, I am putting such gifts on the same footing as other gifts of property.  This is, in fact, the situation which obtains in other countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States which have estate duty systems similar to ours.</P>
    <P>I am, however, proposing a special concession in relation to gifts on marriage which in recent years have, as I have said, averaged 81 a year.  The first £5,000 of such a gift made by a <Col N="1531" /> parent or remoter ancestor to a child or remoter descendant, will be totally exempt from estate duty irrespective of the time at which the gift is made. This exemption will also apply to a gift from one party to a marriage to the other party.  The first £1,000 of a gift made by any other person in consideration of marriage will likewise be exempt from estate duty.  As the bulk of gifts made in consideration of marriage do not exceed £5,000, I consider that these exemptions, together with the total exemption for all gifts made earlier than five years before the date of death, amply take care of any possible cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I should like to make in refutation of the exaggerated statements about the dire effects this proposal will have in relation to agricultural land.  It is this &mdash; that the artificial basis of valuation referred to in section 39 will continue to apply in relation to agricultural land unless the land is sold within six years from the date of death or date of the gift.  This system of valuation is, together with the special abatements for widows and dependent children, of such enormous value to persons with agricultural land that out of an average of 2,560 estates paying duty in each of the years 1966 to 1968 less than 4 per cent are estimated to have been farmers.  The number of farmers who will be affected by the present proposal will, therefore, be very small.</P>
    <P>Some concern was expressed in the House on Budget day in relation to a farmer who makes over his land to his child on marriage and thus qualifies himself for an old age pension. Such transfers will not, of course, be brought within the charge to duty unless the farmer dies within five years of the transfer.  If he did so die, the first £5,000 of the gift would be exempt; moreover, the artificial basis of valuation would be applied in respect of the land.  If, despite these reliefs, there were still a charge to duty, I would remind the House that there would have to be substantial other assets in addition to the land. This would mean that the farmer, during his lifetime, would have had a <Col N="1532" /> worthwhile tax-free income from the farm, followed by an old age pension from the State when he transferred the farm.  I do not think anyone will claim that such a man was unfairly or harshly treated.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with stamp duties. The purpose of section 42 is to extend the general exemption of ships to aircraft and, in particular, to ensure that no question may arise of charging stamp duty on certain instruments relating to the sale of aircraft by Aerlínte last October.  Section 43 provides an exemption from stamp duty, similar to that in force in relation to remittances of PAYE, wholesale tax and turnover tax, in respect of cheques drawn on forms supplied by the Revenue Commissioners where tax deductible from sub-contractors is being remitted.  None of these changes was announced in the Budget.</P>
    <P>With the exception of section 44, Part V of the Bill which deals with corporation profits tax, is consequential on income tax amendments in Part I.  The exemption from corporation profits tax of certain public utility companies, building societies and the Agricultural Credit Corporation is extended under section 44 for another year, pending the outcome of the current investigation into the operations of building societies by an interdepartmental working group.</P>
    <P>Section 45 enables free depreciation and the investment allowance to apply for corporation profits tax purposes on the same terms as are provided for income tax in sections 20 to 24 of the Bill.  Sections 46 to 49 apply, for the purposes of corporation profits tax, the interest provisions applicable to income tax in sections 15 to 18 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to Part VI of the Bill: Section 50, which is an annual provision, fixes the annuity for the redemption of the debt incurred on voted capital services in 1970-71 and 1971-72.  Section 51 increases the excise duty payable by firearms dealers from £1 to £25, except that the duty payable by dealers in ammunition for &ldquo;sporting&rdquo; guns will be £3.  This is a new provision which was not announced in the Budget.  Its specific purpose is to induce as many dealers as possible to <Col N="1533" /> confine themselves to dealing in &ldquo;sporting&rdquo; ammunition and it effectively forms part of the measures that have been passed by the House under the Firearms Bill, 1971, to secure a tightening-up of the existing statutory controls on firearms.  Sections 52, 53 and 54 are self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for a Second Reading.  The detailed provisions are summarised in the explanatory memorandum circulated earlier but I shall be glad to deal with any points on which Deputies may require further information or clarification.</P>

      <P>In effect this Bill gives legal status to the Budget and it is, therefore, of considerable importance each year to the taxpayers, the farmers, industrialists, and to the business community generally.  This year the Finance Bill must assume a particular importance.  It is being introduced at a time when the environment and circumstances are quite different from what they were last year, the year before and in previous years.  This time last year when the Finance Bill was introduced, as was the case in the previous year, we had applied for membership of the European Economic Community.  The fact of our application was there and it was known.  It was referred to from time to time in our debates here.  It was all so remote, so far away, that it did not appear to be germane or relevant to legislation such as the Finance Bill or to other items of legislation or acts of policy which the Government introduced.  Today that situation no longer obtains.  If we are to accept it as being an accurate assessment of the situation, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have declared that it is a certainty that this country will become a member of the European Community in January of 1973.  It is no longer a possibility.  In the view of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs it is an absolute certainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in considering that assertion, which must be taken as being the considered view of the Government, that we must now this year pay particular regard to the provisions of this Finance <Col N="1534" /> Bill.  As I say, circumstances have changed.  The environment is entirely different.  There are now, if this assessment is correct, new problems to be considered, new issues to be dealt with, new challenges to be faced and, above all, new opportunities to be availed of. I will not go over what I have said often recently in this House.  I will not go over what I regard as the mistakes, grave and serious mistakes, which this Government have made in relation to the management of the economy. Suffice it to say that we have suffered and the economy has suffered significantly because an inflationary situation was permitted and tolerated when, perhaps, prudent and wise action might have averted trouble.</P>
    <P>But, put that behind us.  In this changed environment which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach have referred to, in a situation in which our accession to the Treaty of Rome and our membership of Europe is no longer a matter for speculation but is a matter to be regarded in Government planning and Government policy as a certainty, in that change of circumstances I believe an opportunity is given to us, to the Government, to Oireachtas Éireann, to everybody who has responsibility in the State, for imaginative, aggressive and courageous action which I think can undo much of the harm which the mistakes of recent years have brought about, that is, if we are prepared to be serious, to be realistic and to put into our action and our policy our belief in relation to the future of this country.</P>
    <P>There is a time now &mdash; the next 18 months &mdash; in which there will be a real need in this country for bold, courageous and imaginative leadership. I believe the coming 18 months between now and January, 1973, will be decisive for the future of this country, for the welfare of its citizens and for its continuance and maintenance as a viable economy.  If we sit down and do nothing, if we carry on as we have carried on in the past, if we allow outside forces and trends to fashion our action, then I believe we will forfeit and lose an opportunity which may never recur.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the score.  The Taoiseach, <Col N="1535" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government say that we are going into Europe in January 1973. That is no longer a matter of speculation; it is a matter of cold objective certainty.  Let us look at ourselves. Our gross national product per head is much the lowest of the ten countries that will form Europe in 1973.  Our GNP per head compared with the present EEC average is 40 to 50 per cent lower.  So that there is a 40 to 50 per cent gap between the present average and the gross national product per head of our population.  Can we afford to ignore that gap?  Anyone who thinks will appreciate that we cannot.  Our very survival as a viable economy in an economic and monetary union which is looming up will depend on our ability to bridge that gap.  If we do not bridge it, if we do not take action now, if we do not display the kind of prudence and wisdom which a people is entitled to get from its government, if we do not, with imagination and courage, put the correct policies into operation, the danger is that we will enter Europe in 1973, we will become part of what will evolve to be an economic and monetary union and we will be sucked dry.  So, we must bridge this gap.  If we do not bridge it our people will disappear, our people will leave, at an accelerating rate, all the peripheral regions of our country and will be sucked to the centres of population.</P>
    <P>So, with this prospect ahead we have and the Government have, in my view, a particular responsibility to plan to utilise now to the fullest possible extent the initial opportunity which will exist for us in Europe in January 1973 and that is an opportunity at that stage to increase our exports to Europe.</P>
    <P>Our economy is an open one.  It will continue to be an open one.  Consequently, a substainable increase in production will depend and must depend on a rapid and sustained increase in the sale of commodities abroad. This is all the more so in respect of our future because as the figures show we as a people have a propensity which is amongst the highest in the world to sustain an increasing rate of imports. <Col N="1536" /> That is a propensity which is there and I assume that will continue and will accelerate once we go into Europe, so that from our point of view the entry date into Europe will be a risk and a danger but an opportunity also, an opportunity at that stage, at that time, to sell and sell and sell but we can only be geared for that if we realise what requires to be done now and plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>How are we going to increase our exports?  Where will we get an increase in saleable commodities?  It is obvious that the real export opportunity in the immediate future lies in the agricultural sector.  In relation to industry we must be prepared for an initial adverse impact, particularly as there is no sign as yet that our cost inflation crisis has been contained, never mind reversed.  No matter what wonderful change may have come in regard to our costing and prices, I do not think that in 18 months time we will be able to look to industry to provide us with the tremendous boost in exports which we will require to bridge the gap between the European average GNP and what we are experiencing at present.</P>
    <P>In the sphere of agriculture there exists an immediate opportunity for development and growth which can be availed of by quick, decisive and bold action.  Under the European arrangement we are offered the most attractive prices any farmer could contemplate. We are offered ideal market arrangements and an unlimited market for every item we produce in the agricultural sector.  If the Minister and the Government are right, we know that this will be available to us in January, 1973.  Should we not shape and gear our economy and put into operation in our policy the measures that will ensure that in 18 months time our agriculture will have produced such an abundance for sale in the European market that we can derive a substantial benefit?</P>
    <P>Is there any evidence that the Government are alive to this situation? Is there any evidence that they have taken steps to alert our farmers to an appreciation that for the next two or three years an opportunity will exist which may not recur?  I do not want to <Col N="1537" /> be pessimistic but it is my belief that three or four years after that period of accession in January, 1973, from our point of view conditions will cease to be as attractive.  However, we have the initial opportunity to sell at attractive prices every commodity we produce.</P>
    <P>Is there any evidence of Government thinking in this Bill or in any official announcement as to their plans for the future?  I have here the White Paper issued in regard to the Common Market. Assuming Ireland succeeds in entering the EEC at the beginning of 1973, the Government state that &ldquo;the volume of gross agricultural output might be expected to show an increase by the latter years of the decade of the order of 30 to 40 per cent&rdquo;.  Is it the thinking of the Government that by 1980 we would hope to increase agricultural output by 30 to 40 per cent? That is displaying the imagination of a mouse, it is applying no thought or imagination to the requirements of this nation.  With no market limitations on output, with exceptionally attractive prices and with a potential gross output in agriculture assessed at three times the present level, who can say what we could achieve by hard work and sound leadership in the next 18 months?</P>
    <P>Having regard to the White Paper on the Common Market, I fear there is an assumption by the Government that the present structural and social restraints in agriculture will continue. In the past farmers have been under-capitalised, they have not obtained the necessary credit.  The time has come for new thinking and a new policy. This should aim at removing past historic restraints on increased production from the land.</P>
    <P>I would suggest certain things which should be done as a matter of urgency.  First, the Government should decide &mdash; and I am certain they will have the support of all Deputies &mdash; that credit for agriculture must be readily available.  This can be done in a number of ways.  In the first place, a special fund should be established &mdash; perhaps an interest rebate guarantee fund on the lines of the present EEC proposals at Community level &mdash; to ensure that financial considerations will not be an obstacle to increased agricultural production. From that fund any proposal <Col N="1538" /> to increase agricultural production in any commodity should be financed and supported by the Government.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I believe immediate steps should be worked out as a matter of urgency to find in what way we propose to take full advantage of the financial assistance which will be available under the Mansholt Plan in January, 1973.  We should be working that out now.  We should be in a position to say to every farmer, big and small, in the West, in the Midlands, in the South, in the North and in the East, how the funds available under the Mansholt Plan can be of advantage in increasing production.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I believe the Government should take their courage in their hands and abolish immediately the multi-price system for milk.  It is no longer relevant.  We need all the milk and butter we can produce.  Restraint on the production of milk and butter is no longer relevant.  In January, 1973, we will be able to sell every pound of butter that comes from the green grass of Ireland.  Why should we prevent production?  Why should we curb it if this roseate future is as clear as the Taoiseach and the Ministers have said it is?</P>
    <P>Fourthly, we should plan now to utilise in a constructive way the refund from the Community in respect of export subsidies.  By doing something along these lines we can gear agricultural production immediately for a vast increase in output, not that 30 to 40 per cent by 1980.  We should aim at doubling our present agricultural output by January, 1973.  I believe we can do that.  If imagination is exercised, if there is a proper lead from the Government, the people will respond and, if they do respond, we can achieve a situation in which we will go into Europe with things to sell; we will go in with products to sell at the prices obtaining in an expanding market.  If we do not do that, if we go on assuming a slow increase in agricultural output over the next seven or eight years, then an opportunity which may never be repeated will be lost.</P>
    <P>Now is the time, if ever time was, to initiate a drive to speed up the transfer of farms from the old to the <Col N="1539" /> young.  As a matter of policy the Government should encourage young enterprising farmers to get land and husband it.  Far too often in the past we have had a social&mdash;I call it social &mdash; restraint on agricultural production in that young men of imagination did not have the opportunity of engaging in agricultural production.  Now is the time to initiate a national drive which will put these young men on the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister endeavoured to defend section 40 of this Bill.  Section 40 renders liable to estate and death duty all transfers of land made to a son on the occasion of that son's marriage. Surely that is not the sort of thing we should be doing now.  Surely we should be encouraging such transfers.  Surely we should be encouraging those who are not themselves able to utilise the land to its fullest extent to transfer that land to another proprietor, particularly where such transfer is associated with that person's marriage. Here it is proposed to tax that kind of transfer.  The result will be either to discourage parents, or other relatives, from transferring their lands or it will impose an entirely new burden of taxation on newly married couples, young people who ought to be in the front line of agricultural production. Here is the opportunity for which we have been waiting for centuries.</P>

      <P>Here is the opportunity whereby we can cease to be the cabbage patch for Britain.  Through all those miserable centuries we were dependent on the fancy and the whim of successive British governments.  Our agricultural output was clamped down because of the cheap food policy pursued by the British.  We have the opportunity now to get away from that.  We need no longer continue to keep down the production of milk.  We need not apply incentives to discourage production.  Abundance in the past meant the taxpayer subsidising the British to consume the product.  This situation will no longer obtain.  We should increase our agricultural production because our agricultural assets represent a vast potential for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> On these benches one has the responsibility of criticising if one feels that criticism is justified.  One has the responsibility also to put forward constructive proposals, genuinely intended, and I make these suggestions in regard to agriculture because it is of concern to the entire nation, however divided we may be politically, whatever difficulties or troubles we may have, that we do not drift into Europe; we must go into Europe, if we are going into Europe, armed with goods to sell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We must go into Europe knowing precisely the direction in which we are going, realising that we are facing a hard, uphill battle, but with the capacity and the will to survive. We certainly should not let what appears to be a tremendous opportunity pass by.</P>
      <P>We have problems, too, in regard to industry.  The future will be difficult but, again, I ask are we doing enough? Are the Government doing enough? At the moment serious structural weaknesses are becoming apparent in our industrial arm.  Industries have grown up over the last two or three decades in the atmosphere of protection. Now, in the last two or three years, as a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement that protection is disappearing and these industries or some of them are finding they cannot meet the full brunt of free competition, so that the structural weaknesses are beginning to appear and particular industries appear to be unable to survive.  Again, are we doing anything about it?  Is there a plan, I ask, or is the situation to be that we are going to let things drift and eventually when all the weaknesses have become manifest, everything will settle down in a particular pattern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that good enough?  Of our industrial production 72 per cent is aimed at the home market and a strong home market is the only sure guarantee for increasing exports.  Our industries produce 72 per cent for home consumption. It is in relation to that that one must consider that the Government made a profound mistake last October <Col N="1541" /> when they increased corporation profits tax to 58 per cent.  The Central Bank, in their Quarterly Bulletin for the spring of 1971, referred to that action of the Government as follows:</P>
    <P>The increase in corporation taxation in the autumn of 1970 is unfavourable to private investment not just because of the disincentive effects of a reduction in after-tax profits but more importantly because it reduces the cash flow out of which companies finance investment.</P>
    <P>That is a stricture on, or indictment, if you like, coming from the Central Bank, of this action by the Government. This Bill continues that by not removing it.  Why do the Government not admit this was a mistake and put it right?  The position now is that struggling Irish companies, facing the bite of competition for the first time, have had in this year to meet a retrospective increase in corporation profits tax: in some cases 52 per cent of their profits went in taxation.  They have to produce 58 per cent from this on and they are fighting for existence against British companies that carry a load of taxation in relation to the retained profits of 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>On our own home market, small struggling Irish companies have a tax differential of 18 per cent to meet.  I do not understand the reason for this. It costs £6 million, less than 1 per cent of our total revenue.  Why is it being continued, particularly at this time?  Now is the time when, if ever, the industrial arm of our economy require finance.  It requires the ability to invest, to strengthen, to concentrate, to specialise, to plan for the next 18 months to meet the challenge of Europe.  It is utterly without any basis of common sense that by our own domestic taxation we should be hitting at the machinery of Irish industry, weakening it and making our industrial arm all the less effective in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to defend this the Minister said we should look at the export tax relief.  That applies to 28 per cent of our industrial production, mostly to companies which are foreign-owned. I am talking about Irish companies <Col N="1542" /> that grew up in the years of protection, small and limited, but they may have a future if they can expand and revitalise themselves now.  These companies are being hit by this oppressive taxation.  It is no use saying to a struggling <i>entrepreneur</i> in those circumstances: &ldquo;Look at all the tax reliefs somebody else is getting.&rdquo;  He is concerned with his own industry and future.  Of course the result is there to be seen &mdash; mounting unemployment.  We now have the highest rate of unemployment in Europe, comparatively speaking. I do not say that is directly due to this kind of taxation but this has certainly contributed to it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any possibility of the Minister or the Government reconsidering the situation.  I do not want to say anything which would cause uneasiness in Irish industry but I believe the effect of this taxation of last October continues to be bad and I do not believe that situation will change until we restore a rate of taxation which allows an Irish company to compete on the same terms with the English competitor who is now trying to take away the Irish home market.</P>
    <P>In any event, there is a great deal of work and a great deal of thinking to be done.  There is a great deal of planning required.  Never before could it be said as truly as now that our future requires a united effort now by every man, woman and child.  Every section, every part of our community must realise that our future survival is our common responsibility.  I believe it will require the united and determined effort of all sections.  We cannot afford in the months &mdash; if it be months&mdash;that lie ahead a continuance of faction fighting such as we have had in the past.  We cannot afford the cynical promotion of sectional interests irrespective of the damage done to the community.  We cannot afford, above all, the neglect of national interests for purely party political purposes.  This is an occasion on which those who have the responsibility to lead must be in a position to speak the truth fearlessly without regard to political complications.</P>
    <P>We have not that at the moment and I think we need it.  We need men in <Col N="1543" /> office leading the country who will be prepared in the formative period ahead of us to do their duty irrespective of what the consequences may be.  Maybe that is asking too much from the party system.  I do not know, but I am certain that the need at the moment is that kind of outlook in the Government for the period immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>I have said all I want to say in relation to the general aspects of the Bill and the policy it contains.  I want to refer to one or two details.  The Minister defended the section of the Bill dealing with death duties and I wonder was he being absolutely fair with us when he referred inferentially to a favourable comparison between British and Irish rates.  I will go into this in more detail in Committee but I should like to remind the House now that agricultural assets, as defined by the appropriate British statute, are reduced by 45 per cent before they are taken into account.  This also applies to industrial hereditaments and plant and machinery.  That means that under English death duty law the small trader is dealt with in a very preferential way. Here, the rate is 45 per cent more.  In addition, it must not be forgotten that in Britain some years ago they abolished legacy and succession duty. In this country we still retain it and in addition to estate duty we still have a 10 per cent levy for legacy and succession duty.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is quite wrong for the Minister to suggest that in relation to death duties we operate on a more favourable basis than in England.  It is not so.  Our rate of taxation in relation to anyone, unless he has children under 21 years of age, is much higher than in England.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes in this Bill to make people pay 9 per cent in respect of arrears of death duties.  He is by profession a solicitor, and a very good and competent solicitor he was and I am sure will be again, I hope. He will appreciate how difficult it is for a solicitor acting for a client in respect of death duties to get together the necessary estate duty accounts and so on.  I know the Minister is giving a four month interest free period in respect of arrears but I suggest that is not <Col N="1544" /> long enough.  However, it is a Committee matter.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the position of the widows of civil servants who are outside the scheme in the sense that they are pre-23rd July, 1968, widows.  It is said that wives who became widows prior to that date should not qualify for the scheme because their husbands had not contributed towards the fund.  I understand that is not correct.  It appears from the Quinn Tribunal Report that there has been a 5 per cent retainer from civil servants' salaries for superannuation purposes.  If this is so it seems to mean that in the case of the pre-1968 widows that retention has been availed of by the Exchequer without in any way giving benefits to the widows.  If we are to have parity, which is suggested as being desirable in principle I would urge the Minister and the Government to provide for these pre-1968 widows and go further than, in fact, has been done.  They have been allowed limited benefit on the basis of coming in for half the pension; they want to buy their right to the other half and I feel they should be entitled to do so.  Any of them who got the half pension who <Col N="1546" /> also had non-contributory social welfare pensions lost these, or the purposes associated with them.  Consequently many of them have been put in a much worse position as a result of what was granted as an <i>ex gratia</i> step by the State than they were in before.  In any event, I would urge the Minister to consider their position.</P>
      <P>These are my observations on the Finance Bill and on the general situation of the country.  Let me sum up by saying it seems to me that we in this Dáil, who happen to be the Members of the Legislature, have a particular responsibility in representing the people at a time when decisions of far-reaching significance are going to be made. Every Deputy has a responsibility to be constructive and point out the ways in which our economy and the national interest can be improved.  I do not know whether anything I have said will carry any weight with the Minister or the Government but I would urge them with all the emphasis I can use to think very carefully about the next 12 months.  If we are going into Europe for goodness sake let us go in armed and knowing what we are doing and if it is a certainty that we will be a member of Europe by January, 1973, let us plan now, let us gear agriculture.</P>

      <P>The one thing which really annoys me at the present time is the way members of the Government and, indeed, members of the Fine Gael Party address EEC representatives. They seem to take the line that we are going into Europe and everybody is behind the idea.  The same attitude is being adopted by the Tory Government in Britain who do not even have the support of their backbenchers.  I should like to ask whether the Government have got the support even of all their frontbenchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Murphy said a few minutes ago, we have been going into Europe since 1957.  Europe seems to <Col N="1547" /> be the magic cure for practically all our ills.  Every time things have gone badly and since Fianna Fáil took office things have been going bad very often, the solution was that when we got into Europe everything would be all right. It appears to be the general line of thinking in Government quarters and in Fine Gael quarters that if Britain goes into Europe we are stuck and Britain are bound to go in.  This is the belief despite the fact that it has become more and more evident that the ordinary people in Britain are opposed to membership and the numbers are growing.  It was pitiable to listen to the British Foreign Minister on television the other night trying to explain what Mr. Heath said before the election about not going in unless he had the people with him and what he is saying now.  The trick cannot be pulled here because we must have a referendum.  We have a written Constitution and constitutional changes must be agreed by the people.  In view of the situation we should face up to the fact and realise that not everybody is in favour of going into Europe.  In fact the referendum may show that the majority of people are opposed to it.</P>
    <P>If the Government believe what they are saying will the Minister for Finance tell me what has been done to prepare us for membership of the EEC? The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was supposed to be a preparation and we all know how disastrous that has turned out to be.  Since that time as far as I can see the Government do not seem to be really sure. They feel if they shout loud enough everybody will believe they are doing something.  With the incidence of unemployment as high as it is surely it would not have been too much to expect that the Government would do something more than cutting people off the dole to try to reduce the numbers at the labour exchanges?  First of all, the numbers at the employment exchanges were reduced by what I consider to be an excellent idea: putting people on a retirement pension if they wanted to retire at 65.  This was followed by the dole shambles.  All this has left 15,000 people fewer, no matter how we look at it, on the unemployment <Col N="1548" /> register.  This appears to be the only tangible thing done so far so that the Minister for Foreign Affairs can say to his counterparts in Europe: &ldquo;We have reduced substantially the number of unemployed in the country&rdquo;. Of course, the only way the number has been reduced is by taking them off the register.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Finance Bill should have contained something which would give hope to the people of this country. Whether we go into Europe or not, they have nothing except what they are able to earn by the sweat of their brow.  They are depending on a week's wages or salary to buy the necessities of life.  Despite all the talk we have had about the guarantee by the Government that if wages were stabilised and we did not have any breach of the wage agreement prices would be stabilised, prices have been soaring and continue to soar, and there does not seem to be a thing the Government can or want to do about it.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is a great disappointment to those who felt that, if there was fresh thinking in the Government as to what should be done about running the country, some evidence of it should be in the Finance Bill. The evidence is not there.  We have had, for instance, no effort at all to reduce the burden of income tax on the ordinary wage earner.  The Minister has made a puny effort in regard to the people who are earning under £600 a year.  Does he realise that £600 a year is about £12 a week?  Who are working for £12 a week now except children? What is the idea of attempting to say there is an improvement in the income tax situation for low paid workers when the only people included are those who do not exist?  If the Minister was really serious about it, surely he would have agreed that a low paid worker at present is a worker who is getting less than £20 a week.  If he had set his sights on that, we might say some serious effort was being made by the Government to deal with this crushing burden of tax.</P>
    <P>I recounted here the other evening &mdash;and I am sure you will agree, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I am entitled to do it again&mdash;that at present <Col N="1549" /> there are certain jobs where because of the shortage of plant or shortage of space or for a dozen different reasons it is necessary to work overtime.  There is a marked reluctance on the part of some workers to work overtime because as they ask me&mdash;and I am sure they have asked the Minister&mdash;why should they kill themselves working when for every £1 they earn the State takes 7s. or 35 new pence out of it before they get it, and if they happen to be living in a local authority house on a differential rent, the local authority takes 3s. more or 15 new pence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was explaining the reluctance on the part of many people to work overtime in this country.  It is not because they do not want the money but because they resent having to pay the State 7s or 35 new pence in income tax from their overtime and also 3s or 15 new pence to the local authority in rent.  The result is that the £1 for overtime which they worked so hard to earn becomes 10s, 50 new pence, or less.  No effort whatever was made by the Minister to alleviate the position with regard to these people.  If he was really serious about helping the lower paid worker this is one way in which they could be helped.  It is interesting to note that in answer to a question I tabled on 8th June&mdash;Volume 254, No. 7 of the Official Report, columns 1165 and 1166 &mdash;the Minister for Finance gave me a reply which included the information that income tax, including surtax, collected in the year 1970-71 amounted to £116,641,000 and that the estimate for this year is around £140 million. Is it not true that most of that comes out of the pockets of people who work very hard?  If an organisaion such as the Agricultural Wages Board fix a minimum rate of wages at around £16 a week, if the board agrees they require that minimum amount to live, how does the Minister explain that those workers, if they are married, have to pay tax on £4 per week of that and if they are single have to pay tax on £9 per week of it; in other words, that they have to pay £1 tax in one case and nearly £3 in the other?  Is the Minister not <Col N="1550" /> aware that 15 years ago the tax-free allowance for ordinary workers was almost as high as it is today?  Last year his predecessor gave a concession which was heralded with a blare of trumpets, the first £100 to be taxed at 4s 8d.  This year the Minister takes it away.  He says in his speech here that he is giving some of it back.</P>
      <P>The facts are that last year the concession cost the State £6 million.  This year that £6 million is being taken and all that is being given back is £1 million, measure it anyway you like. In addition to that, the only concession given to both married and single people is £25 extra at 5s 3d in the £1, that is, about £6 a year.  Does the Minister consider that people who were entitled to earn £6 or £7 per week tax free as single people and £10 to £12 as married people 15 years ago, should still pay tax on the same amount? Anything earned over that amount has to be taxed.  The whole thing is ridiculous, and no Minister for Finance has ever faced up to the fact that it is unfair to take from workers what they need to live.  That is being done and it cannot be denied.</P>
      <P>This year a new arrangement is introduced, and the Minister skates around it in his White Paper and indeed, in the Finance Bill.  It is a provision for taxing subcontractors or &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; in respect of which there was a very long debate in this House. For those who do not know, &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; are the people who go on a building site, take a job on task, one man being leader of the gang and the others working as part of the gang.  Whether this has been frowned on by the trade unions, as it has by some trade unions, it has undoubtedly, in my opinion, reduced housing costs, because they put a set price on a job and perhaps work long hours in order to earn the money. They were not paying tax and, in many cases, no cards were being stamped. for them.  This was the argument made by the Minister when he was introducing the idea that these people should be taxed.  He taxed them to the extent of 35p out of every £1, the onus being put on the person who was paying them to deduct that from their wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> When that provision was going through the House there was no reference to anybody except those working on a building site.  What has happened? When 5th April came everybody who could be counted a contractor by any stretch of the imagination was included: people who have been working with local authorities, some of them with tractors, some of them with lorries, perhaps two or three of them raising stones or material of some kind for a local authority, some of them collecting refuse or cutting grass.  All of these people came under the &ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; section of the Finance Bill, according to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Then the idea of getting exemption arose.  It was said that all they need do was apply.  The income tax authorities have refused to exempt more than half the people who have applied for contractors' certificates on the ground that they have not got a set headquarters.  I do not know whether they would need headed notepaper.  If a man has been working or intends to work with a group on this sort of work he is either entitled to a tax-free allowance as a sub-contractor or he is not.  If the Minister and the House say that all he need do is apply, then genuine applicants should get exemption, but they have been refused.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is muddled thinking on the part of the Department and the Minister or on the part of the income tax authorities, but somebody has slipped up.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of this or not, but throughout the length and breadth of this country building sites have been idle and some of them are still idle, because these men are not prepared to work with a contractor on the chance of having a drawback at the end of the month of more than one-third of their wages which, according to the Department of Finance, must be stopped under the present legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a sensible man and he should give instructions to his Department, first, that those engaged in refuse collection do not come under the lumpers regulation; secondly, that <Col N="1552" /> people who are engaged, under contract, in cleansing around towns and villages, do not come under it; and, thirdly, that only those employed on a building site were originally intended to be included under the Act passed by this House; that those who apply for a certificate as sub-contractors should get it, and that there should not be this fiddling around by officials maybe making somebody happy that they are going into great detail to ensure that nobody escapes the net.  If this is done I am quite sure the Minister will find it will relieve a great deal of tension. It is bad enough for these workers to have to pay the money but it is worse when it is made impossible for them to work.</P>
    <P>Whether we agree with the system they work or not, it exists, and now that they have agreed to mend their ways and pay the taxes due by them, things should not be made more difficult for them.  I cannot understand why the people to whom I refer are told they cannot get a tax-free certificate as sub-contractors because they have not got a set address, a set headquarters. Originally it was agreed that the provision would apply to people doing jobs in contract groups.  Those are the people who are applying.  The sooner the matter gets the attention it requires, the better it will be for every body concerned.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the EEC a moment ago. Is the Minister aware that certain organisations dealing with the issuing of assistance to small industries in this country have been told that it is Government policy not to encourage the continuance of small industries?  Is it Government policy to do this?  Was this instruction given by the State? Were officials told to tell applicants for grants that while their cases were being considered it was not Government policy, because of impending EEC admission, to continue to support or assist them in any way to continue in business?  A few weeks ago I mentioned an industry employing 20 or 30 men in a small town.  This is as important to them as it is to an industry employing five times that number in Dublin city or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always made it a point in this House to keep within the rules of order when matters like this are being discussed.  With all due respect to you, if I widened the debate half as much as the previous speaker did, I would expect to be pulled up. What I have just been talking about is within the rules of order and if the Chair wishes I will quote him the reference.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the changes with regard to gifts.  He seems to think that because he is exempting the first £5,000 for a relative, and £1,000 for a person who is not a relative, everything is all right and that this will not cause very much trouble.  Does he not understand that at present&mdash;and mind you some people who have a little bit of money have been in the habit of trying to provide a house for their children when they are getting married&mdash;even a small house is worth more than £5,000?  I wonder where this fits into his reference to the fact that it should not affect anybody since the first £5,000 is not included.  He has gone a little bit off beam because he should know better than anybody else, because of his profession, that costs in this regard have been running very high.  It is most unfair to try to tax a present of a house which a father or mother may make to a son or daughter getting married which is, in effect, what the Minister is doing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of the rate of interest which must be paid if somebody is appealing against a tax demand.  The interest is payable pending the appeal being held.  Surely this <Col N="1554" /> is a ridiculous situation because if a person appeals he feels that he is in the right.  I suppose the intention is to punish those who are deliberately trying to avoid paying tax which they should pay.  If the appeal fails and the person decides to go to court the Minister says he must pay the tax first.  He does not seem to realise that in many cases this would mean that people who are asked to pay tax which they feel is unfair, may have to sell their property, even their business.  Last year there was a case of somebody who had started a business nine years previously and who had paid a small amount of tax conscientiously each year.  He got into the hands of a person who agreed to fill up a tax form for him with the result that he was taxed to the tune of several hundred pounds. Only after a very long investigation was it discovered that the form was filled in in such a way that the impression was given that the turnover of the small business was the same since it was started nine years ago as it was last year, something over £5,000. If that person had to comply with what is laid down here, when the first appeal was turned down he would have had to sell his little shop because he could not raise the money in any other way.  Yet the Minister feels no hardship is caused by having this included.  I suggest he should have another look at this.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that general taxation was being raised this year by about 12 per cent only.  I think he is wrong.  I think it is proposed to raise general taxation by almost 20 per cent. I should like the Minister to see if the figures he has got are correct.  I should also like to point out that last year, because of increased wages, a tremendous amount of extra taxation came in while this year the suggestion is that it will go up from £116 million to £140 million.  The national wage agreement which will operate for most people during the year, and for some people next year, on top of the public service agreement, will probably result in almost as much extra taxation being paid this year as was paid last year. I think the Minister's estimate is wrong. If he looks at it he will find that at the end of the year he will be able to <Col N="1555" /> do what he did last year.  Instead of the deficit of £15 million or £16 million which the Taoiseach talked about in Cork early in January, there was a small surplus when the final figures were reached.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Minister in his speech, and in his Bill, and in the White Paper, did not refer to 1st January, 1972.  He has already warned us that he proposes to introduce a value-added tax.  What is the situation in relation to the value-added tax? Will it be introduced or will it not? The Minister told us it would be introduced on 1st January, 1972, but no provision whatever has been made for a change in taxation in this Finance Bill nor was any reference made to it in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I got the impression that the Government may think they are codding somebody by doing it in this way.  We all know that, even though taxation has been increased and prices have been increased, after 1st January next we will almost certainly have a recurrence of the first turnover tax, the second turnover tax, the wholesale tax and the increase because of the introduction of decimal currency.  All of those have resulted in a situation in which prices have gone completely out of hand.  Let me make a brief reference to the introduction of decimal currency.  I do not know who is responsible but I will blame the Government because they must have known when they suggested that if traders found that they could not get their prices even they should increase one price slightly and reduce another price in order to level off.  In fact what happened in most cases was that the traders had a look over their stock and increased the price of all fast selling items and reduced the price of the slow selling items and then said: &ldquo;We have reduced this and we have increased that, and that is what the Minister told us to do.&rdquo;  The result has been that prices have gone completely out of hand.  It is very difficult for the trade unions to try to persuade their members that the national wage agreement <Col N="1556" /> should we adhered to because they say, and say rightly, that while they were prepared to keep their side of the bargain the Government have not kept theirs.  The bargain was that no increase in prices would be allowed.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister expects that at the end of the year&mdash; whether he will still be there is another matter&mdash;no remarks will be passed about the further increase in prices. If that is his idea he is in for a rude shock.  I would suggest that before this debate finishes the Minister should spell out for us what is going to happen on 1st January, 1972 and, if it is still the intention to introduce value-added tax on that date, to write it into that Bill because that is where it should be.  The Bill is supposed to cover the period to 31st March next.  Then we will know whether or not he is really serious about trying to tell the country what he proposes to do with regard to the finances of the country for the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made here by me to the question of income tax.  I should like to ask the Minister if it is a fact that now, on instructions from the Government, contributory widows pensions are to be regarded as income for tax purposes.  Contributory old age pensions have been so regarded for some time.  This has been justified on the grounds that if a person had an income in addition to the contributory old age pension the total income could be quite substantial.  In most cases the widows receiving contributory pensions are widows of insured workers.  Many of them are finding it extremely difficult to live. Some of them are not able to do very much work but try to do a little work in order to supplement the meagre allowances they get from the State. Their husbands paid insurance while they were alive.  Is it now the intention of the State to treat contributory widows pensions as income and to tax them?  If it is, it is the meanest thing that could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I had occasion to discuss this matter with persons who were working for a few hours a day in an effort to supplement what they were getting from the State.  When they applied for a tax-free allowance they <Col N="1557" /> found the contributory widows pension was assessed as income and the tax-allowance, therefore, was lower than when the husbands were alive.  This is something which should not happen and which should not be allowed to happen.  Something must be done to ensure that a little more consideration is given to those who are finding it very hard to live.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, either now or at some future date, to ensure that income tax will fall less heavily on workers who are receiving low wages and who are finding it very difficult to live.  There are a number of particular sections of workers who are badly affected by this.  While it has been said in this House by this Minister and by his predecessor that it is not possible to differentiate and to give preferential treatment to one section of workers as against another, there has been a plea made by part-time firemen throughout the country that it is unfair that they who are risking life and limb for a small pittance in an effort to prevent fires and to fight fires in towns and country districts should be liable to income tax in respect of the small payment they get. Without being in any way critical of those who are gaining by it, I would say that if differentiation is possible for the purpose of allowing those who are described as artists to get a tax exemption, surely it should be possible in the case of persons who are receiving very much less than they are and working hard for it.</P>

      <P>If a person were to invest 12½ new pence, the price of this Bill, with a view to ascertaining what this Finance Bill is about and possibly with a view to ascertaining how taxation has piled up and probably how it is disbursed, what would he find?  He would be very disappointed indeed because while this document is charged at the rate of 12½ new pence to the purchaser it gives little or no information so far as tax assessment or disbursement is concerned.  I have pleaded here time and again that the Department of Finance should issue annually a booklet telling the people in clearcut terms what they would like to know about the tax structure, what <Col N="1558" /> is exempted, what is not exempted. The ordinary people, all of whom could be said to pay tax, want some information on how tax is assessed. That information is not available.  The few who were unfortunate enough to invest in copies of Bills, including the consolidation Bill that was produced a few years ago, were dismayed when they found what they got for their money.  They despatched their money to the Government Publications Sale Office thinking they would get such information that they would know everything about Finance Bills and how they work and that they would be very wise indeed when they had read them.  I am pleading here again that booklets be produced in simplified language and not in this jargon that is found in Acts.  The Acts are not set out in simplified language.  I do not see why they should not be.  There are too many &ldquo;whereas&rdquo;, and so on in Acts.  This Finance Bill is mainly a mass of amendments of previous Acts, as the first page shows.  It does not give us very much information.</P>
      <P>Possibly that is the reason why in discussing this Bill, which one would think should be a very important measure for discussion in the House, there is not too much competition amongst Members to contribute to the debate.  The Minister opened the debate and, despite the fact that there are more than 70 Deputies on the Government side of the House, not a single one of them has anything to contribute to the discussion of this Finance Bill this evening.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice tells me the debate is not over yet.  Present indications are that so far as his team is concerned it is over. My remarks will have fallen on good, fertile ground if they are responsible for getting some contributions from the rank and file members of the Government party because I should like to hear them on some aspects of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum we are told that section 1 imposes tax and <Col N="1559" /> surtax for the year 1971-72 at percentage rates corresponding to the rates in force for the year 1970-71.  Section 2, we are told, terminates for 1971-72 and subsequent years the reduced rate relief whereby the first £100 of an individual's taxable income was charged at two-thirds of the standard rate of tax. We are told that at 31st March, 1971, a sum of £116,641,000 was received by way of income tax and surtax&mdash;an increase of almost 20 per cent over the preceding year.  I have said time and again that money does not fall from heaven.  We have no magic powers to make money or to get it other than from the people.  I am excluding the system that has been adopted by the Government in recent years of borrowing from whatever source from which they can obtain loans.</P>
    <P>During the Budget discussion I claimed that there was no justification for the income tax regulations that are in force and I make that claim once more.  I have seen tax forms where the wage was stated to be less than £7 weekly.  In the last week I have seen a tax form where the weekly amount was stated to be £6.95.  Is it fair or just that at a time when money is depreciating steadily in value, a single person without dependants is compelled to pay income tax when his earnings are in excess of £7 per week?  The regulation was the same ten years ago but there is a major difference in that £7 was equivalent in purchasing power to £14 or £16 today.  I have pleaded for many years that this should be adjusted. Irrespective of the glib talk we hear about going into Europe, we must be factual in our approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>On my way to Dublin I gave a lift to two girls from Dunmanway.  They were working in Bandon, 17 miles from their home.  I gave them a lift at Iniskeane village, which is about seven or eight miles from Dunmanway and nine miles from Bandon.  The girls told me that they were earning approximately £10 per week.  They have to travel approximately 34 miles daily; in the morning they were able to get a lift for the first eight miles but they had to depend on passing motorists to take them the remaining nine miles to <Col N="1560" /> Bandon.  In the evening they had to depend on passing motorists to bring them home.  Each of the girls is contributing more than £1 from her small wage packet towards Central Funds. When I inquired why they did not avail of the public transport service they told me that a weekly ticket from Dunmanway to Bandon would cost £2.25&mdash;20 per cent of their earnings. If they had to pay this cost, in addition to the £1 which the Minister for Finance is taking from them, they would have very little left.</P>
    <P>There are many others in the country who are in a similar position.  In reply to questions or in debates we are told that there is no justification for allowing any travelling expenses to people going to and returning from work.  In areas such as south-west Cork, north-east Donegal, County Monaghan and many other areas where employment is scarce it is necessary for people to travel many miles to their place of work.  Whether these people travel in groups or on their own they are entitled to a deduction of income tax in respect of travelling expenses.  However, the attitude of the State is: &ldquo;We do not care how you get to work but we will put our hands into your wage packet. We will not give any reduction in respect of your payment to public transport or private transport systems, for taking you to your place of employment.&rdquo; Is it not time that the law was changed?  Is it not time that people should get a reduction in their income tax when they are compelled to travel many miles to their place of work&mdash;in many cases depending on passing motorists to get them to their destination?  If our laws were fair and just this position would not obtain.</P>
    <P>I know&mdash;I have said this before and I repeat it again now&mdash;that the State needs money.  The Exchequer must get money.  Without it we cannot go ahead.  That money, however, should not come directly from lowly paid workers.  The men with £10 or £11 a week have little enough, after paying the travelling expenses to which I referred, without our Minister for Finance putting his hand into their pockets and extracting £1 a week <i>per capita</i> from people earning that kind of wage.</P>

      <P>I am sure that in other countries there are concessions.  Surely we have brains enough, surely there is enough competence in the Department of Finance, to draw up regulations excluding such people from the tax net.  I am aware that, according to the Minister, the presupposition is that our people are mainly dishonest. The Minister does not deny that this Bill is full of snares and traps to catch these allegedly dishonest people.  That is down in black and white in the Minister's statement.  Assuming that some, who should be caught, are getting away, in general terms that is what the Government have to say about our Irish people; they have to set these snares and traps in order to catch them within the income tax net.  I appeal to the Minister to bear what I am saying in mind.  It is not unlikely, unless bigger events occur, that we will have an autumn Budget.  Having regard to the mentality of Fianna Fáil, to the mentality of the Minister for Finance and the mentality of the present Government, I see no hope for these unfortunate people until such time as Fianna Fáil cross the floor of this House and take their places on these benches.</P>
      <P>I have made these assertions here time and again.  I think they are quite justified.  I believe the ordinary worker has a grievance against the Government. The tax allowance for married women, for example, is negligible. There are circumstances in which married women have to go out to work, even those with young children, in order to supplement their husbands' earnings so that they can maintain their families in a reasonable way.  The present allowance is utterly inadequate. It is about time it was changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government do not see it, but I am sure that the ordinary Deputies have no difficulty in seeing it: I refer to the wide divergence between those of us, and they are listed in this book, <Col N="1562" /> who are earning £5,000 per annum plus.  I am speaking only of those in public employment now, leaving out altogether those in private employment. It is all right to take a few pounds from people with incomes like that, or even with incomes of £4,000, £3,000 or £2,000.  Taking money from men with incomes of £10 to £30 a week is anathema to me.  I would say that a man would want at least £30 a week now to give himself and his family a reasonable livelihood.  I am quite sure that sort of weekly income would not provide for a month's holiday by the sea or for the other incidentals, the yachts and so on, that some of our friends are blessed with. I will not say any more about that. The Minister for Justice is a relatively young man and it is no harm for him to take these home truths back to the Government because, mark you, people are taking note.  People feel aggrieved.  I am sure the kind of thing to which I refer is also happening in Limerick just as it is happening in other parts of the country.  So much for sections 1 and 2.</P>
    <P>The next item I notice here is excise duty.  Last year it increased to £91 million.  One could argue that it is mainly the working people who contribute the bulk of that excise duty.  I do not know if the general public are aware of the extent to which they contribute to revenue, particularly those of them who smoke and drink.  We are told by doctors and by other public men that we should not drink and we should not smoke.  We are told that we should save.  We are told that smoking and drinking are bad for us.  We should cut them out.  Miracles are few and far between, but supposing by some miracle that advice was taken, what would be the result?  Let us be factual about this.  You would find that almost £100 million was missing from last year's revenue account, and that is a sizeable sum for a country of this size.  I am sure it will be found that in the current year more than £100 million will be missing.</P>
    <P>As well as the taxes I have mentioned, amounting to £91 million for last year, let us look at the incidentals for a moment.  What about our brewing <Col N="1563" /> and distilling industry, our tobacco and cigarette manufacturers, the employment they provide and the taxes collected from that employment?  What about our transport system which brings goods all over the country, plus the licence duties and plus the taxes paid by those who work in that industry?  What about those who work in our hotels, bars and grocery shops selling the goods distributed by the transport system?  For a small country like this we are resting too heavily on those people.</P>
    <P>According to this report, the half glass of Irish whiskey is 17p.  That does not include wholesale tax.  I am reading from the Official Report for 4th May, 1971.  Scotch whisky is at 18.4p, brandy is at 22.1p and the pint is just at 17½p.  I can recall mentioning during the Budget debate that a man drinking two pints a day contributes something like £1 per week to the Exchequer, taking into account the wholesale tax. It is all right to talk about rates and other forms of taxation.  Just because they are paid half-yearly they seem big, but the taxation I have been speaking about is filched daily in the kind of secretive way we have devised for its collection.  The State has no problem collecting it but the consumer has to pay.  A gallon of petrol is taxed at 20.75p, plus the 5 per cent.  Then we come to tobacco which is at 15p to 25p per ounce.  The standard packet of cigarettes is at 20p, plus the 5 per cent wholesale tax.</P>
    <P>These excise duties are very important in so far as they collect about 20 per cent of our revenue.  We are leaning too heavily on that type of taxation.  It is all right to tell people: &ldquo;You do not have to smoke.  There is no one compelling you.  You do not have to drink.  It is a luxury.&rdquo;  My view is that it is not.  In rural Ireland&mdash;I am sure the same applies to urban Ireland &mdash;meeting friends a few nights a week for a few social drinks is traditional. There is nothing wrong with people gathering together in their local public houses, discussing matters of common interest, singing a few songs and enjoying themselves after a few drinks. <Col N="1564" /> Those who do not wish to patronise drinking establishments are free to remain outside.  This type of taxation is shouldered mainly by working people and it continues to increase on spirits, beer and tobacco.  This cannot continue. Other systems may have to be found and there is no need to say that the Government do not have to be prodded to find them.</P>
    <P>I come now to the turnover tax, which we doubled from £20.345 million in 1970 to £41.180 million in the last financial year.  When we were discussing the introduction of that tax in 1967 we were told it would bring in £14 million a year at most.  It has escalated steadily to £41 million.  God knows what it will be next year or what the new system being thought up, the value-added tax, will bring in.  The wholesale tax is bringing in £25 million.  Both wholesale tax and turnover tax are levied on foods and other commodities essential to ordinary everyday living.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is justification for spreading it to all sections rather than confining it to certain sections.  There should be room for some reductions in other lines.  We hear a great deal about corporation profits tax which is 58 per cent this year.  We are told it is a tax on the rich and that we must be cautious about foreign firms that come here and make big profits and we must see that they do not get off too lightly. The income tax and surtax net were not sufficient and we spread a third one for them which we call corporation profits tax which brought in about £20.5 million last year.  My knowledge may be limited but my view is that the consumer pays that tax because any company paying the tax at present surely adjusts their prices to ensure that their dividends will at least remain up to standard, if not move upwards. It is merely a joke to say we are levying tax on rich corporations and that it is right and just to do so and to get these people into a special net so that we can fleece them.  I do not deem myself to be an economist but I base my remarks on the assumption that a firm liable for 58 per cent profits tax will charge an additional amount <Col N="1565" /> for their goods not only to bring in the tax but also to pay the administrative cost of collecting this money and paying it over to the State.  I should like the Minister to give some of us who are deemed not to be so well enlightened in this field the benefit of his observations on that assertion.</P>
    <P>I cannot resume my seat without referring to this heaven on earth that is supposed to exist across St. George's Channel and the North Sea.  The Government have presented EEC as something that will change the Irish way of life when we become a member and give us a kind of heaven on earth here. We heard a somewhat similar statement from Deputy Dr. O'Higgins who thought January, 1973, was too far away and that when we become a member of the Community everything in the garden will be bright and rosy.  I believe that a relatively small country like ours cannot live in isolation if countries all around decide to join a group such as the Common Market. There may be justification for a federation of states in Western Europe.  We must be factual, however, in talking of its advantages.  Even today we were told that 72 per cent of our trade is with Britain and we all know, if we read the papers, that there is a big difference of opinion in Britain as regards entering the Common Market.</P>

      <P>It is a pity we do not have uniformity.  My views differs from that of the Chair.  This is not something for the future.  Since 1957 we have been hearing about entering the EEC and what awaits us there, the benefits we shall reap, and that the disadvantages are few and far between. It may take longer than I think to deal with this matter and I do not like going against the Chair.  To sum up, members of this party have had opportunities of getting briefings on the EEC, what it entails, it advantages and likely disadvantages.  We have been told by the Minister about the books he has distributed recently.  If you took one copy of each issue of the books distributed on the EEC in this country and put them together they would weigh almost a quarter-ton.  My colleagues in the Labour Party have put a great deal of work into research on EEC membership.  Without the aid of the Civil Service which is available to the Government, the Labour Party have possibly done more.  Naturally, we are not a group of yes-men; we can arrive at decisions which may vary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling that the EEC may not be entirely relevant to the discussion on the Finance Bill, although it provides a relatively wide area for discussion.  I would not have mentioned it at all were it not for the fact that previous speakers did so, apparently with the approval of the Chair.  I shall, however, let bygones be bygones.  We are blessed with a number of learned economists in this House who tell us all about money matters, how money is collected, how it should be disbursed, but as I mentioned at the outset those of us who are not so knowledgeable still know the difficulties that many people are coming up against as a result of the 1971 Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I set down as forcibly as I could in the earlier part of my contribution what changes I thought should be brought about and brought about instantly.  I illustrated as best I could the need for such changes and I am hopeful that the Government will take some notice of statements made by Deputies who are not members of their own party. If this is a democratic institution, which seems to me rather doubtful, then they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is peculiar that on this wide ranging Bill we have no speaker from the Government side of the House other than the Minister.  Why are they so shy?  Why do they not come in and make a contribution?  Why do they not justify the system of taxation that I <Col N="1568" /> have strongly condemned here this evening and tell us why this kind of taxation should not be exposed?</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the statements I have made today will not fall entirely on deaf ears.  We never know how long the Government will be there because we must accept that they are only limping along.  If the position changed I would make statements similar to the ones I have made this evening because this is not a political matter, this is a business matter.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the interjections we have just heard from the Minister for Justice or from Deputy Coughlan reflect any credit on this House.  I include the Minister for Local Government in that stricture. I propose to deal with the tax situation under a number of headings: first, the economic effects of our present system of taxation; secondly, the general level of taxation whether it is a fair one, and the amount of money taken, by the various means available to the State, out of the pockets of the people in order to finance Government expenditure; and, thirdly, I hope to deal with various tax headings which have been dealt with in the Bill: income tax, customs and excise, death duties, stamp duties and things like that.</P>
      <P>In the course of his Budget speech the Minister made what one might consider a high sounding statement about the achievements of this Government in the field of taxation.  He said:</P>
      <P>The last decade has seen a profound change in the structure of our taxation system.  From being a simple machine for the collection of revenue on a relatively narrow economic base, it has evolved into a more flexible instrument for economic and social reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three things generally accepted by economists and others as a test for the effectiveness of a tax system in the economic and social fields.  They are its effect in stabilising the economy, in re-distributing incomes among the people in the community and in ensuring the proper allocation of resources in the community.  In the field of stabilisation of the economy our tax system certainly does not live up to the claims being made by the Government.  If it did then during the last year stabilisation generally speaking would have been effective in curbing inflation and preventing an excess of inflation.  Under that heading the <Col N="1571" /> tax system in this country has been a lamentable failure.  Otherwise why would we have a rate of inflation here higher almost than any in all Europe? In the last year we have had a rate of inflation of 10 per cent in one year. This is hardly a credit to the stabilising effect of our tax system.  The naive belief apparently reflected in the Minister's remarks, that we can look at tax as a means of regulating the economy while allowing the growth of Government expenditure to continue and ignoring the need for monetary policy as well in support of one's broad aims, has no basis in modern economics.  You cannot hope to control the economy simply by taking taxation in isolation and pretending that it is an instrument for achieving stabilisation if you are not going to use the other methods as well; and the Government are failing evidently and have continually failed in this regard both in the field of their own expenditure and in the field of monetary policy.</P>
    <P>The field of distribution is another heading under which one can judge the effectiveness of the tax system.  The effect of our tax system in recent times in redistributing income is far from the level of achievement which the Minister appears to claim for it.  We have had down the years an increasing emphasis on indirect taxation.  It is generally accepted by economists and by others concerned in the social field that indirect taxation is a more regressive form of taxation than direct taxation. In other words, it is a form of taxation which takes more, relatively speaking, from the less well off sections of the community and less, relatively speaking, from the more well off sections of the community than does a direct taxation on income. Under that heading the avowed policy of the Government of promoting indirect taxation as against direct taxation is directly in reverse of the claims made by the Minister in that, instead of distributing income in favour of the less well off sections, this emphasis is tending towards a distribution in favour of the more well off sections.</P>
    <P>In the field of allocation I would <Col N="1572" /> ask the Minister whether he knows how badly the present system of producing public goods and services operates.  Many of the consumers of Government expenditure and Government intervention would be delighted to tell him how difficult it is to get money out of the State.  The amount of time which is spent by TDs in ringing up various Departments is an indication of how ineffective the Government are in allocating resources efficiently to those in need.  Were it not for that, the amount of intervention by public representatives in the field of public administration would not be nearly as great as it is.  I think it is fair to say that this country is ahead of most in the amount of lobbying of public departments on behalf of individual constituents that has to be done by public representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the failure of the Government in implementing the proposals put forward by the Commission on Income Taxation.  There were a total of 112 recommendations put forward by that Commission.  Fifty-seven of these have been implemented without modification but 29 have apparently been accepted by the Government in principle but have not been implemented.  The Commission on Income Taxation reported in 1961; yet there are 29 of the 112 recommendations of the Commission which are apparently accepted in principle by the Government but have not been implemented. The Minister says that these latter recommendations are kept under constant review with a view to their implementation as and when possible, but ten years have passed and the Minister has not been able to implement these recommendations even though he accepts them in principle.  This is not exactly an indication of a very fundamental approach towards the reform of tax of which the Minister appears to be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the level of taxation, there are a number of factors which should be borne in mind.  First of all, the amount of the income of this community: <Col N="1573" /> the percentage of gross national product which was taken in 1970 as taxation was 31 per cent.  This compares with a target for 1970 of 26 per cent of gross national product to be taken in taxation, which was set out in the Government's own Second Programme which was to end in 1970.  In other words, the Government have exceeded by over five percentage points their own target for the amount of the gross national product which was to be taken in the form of taxation.  They have exceeded by over five percentage points the amount of the people's income which they have been taking for their own purposes.  This clearly indicates the failure of the Government to keep within the limits imposed by their own policies.</P>
    <P>If the Government introduce an economic programme they should at least be able to ensure, if they cannot ensure that the targets are met in the private sector, that they are met in the sector over which they have direct control. Yet the Second Programme targets in the field of taxation, over which the Government have direct control, were exceeded by five percentage points in regard to the portion of the gross national product which was to be taken by the Government in the form of taxation.  It is also worth nothing the breakdown of this.  The Second Programme indicated that taxes on income would take 9 per cent of the gross national product.  In fact, this was achieved.  The amount resulting was 10.9 per cent.  Taxes on capital were to take 0.4 per cent.  That target was reached.  Taxes on expenditure were supposed to take 16.8 per cent.  In fact they took 19.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting where this money has gone over the period.  Since 1964-65 there has been an overall increase in Government expenditure, and therefore in taxation, of 148 per cent. It is interesting to see the distribution of that increase.  The increase in the percentage given to social welfare has been only 19.7 per cent whereas the increase in remuneration to those in the Government's own public service has gone up by 37.4 per cent.  It is clear that there are more and more civil servants <Col N="1574" /> being employed and getting more money while the rate of increase in social welfare payments has been almost as low as half the rate of increase in remuneration for those employed by the Government.  It is clear that there are more and more civil servants being employed to do less and less work and that there is less for the social welfare classes and the other classes deserving of help in the community. This is what is happening to the money which is being raised by an ever-increasing burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there would be a very substantial reduction in Government expenditure in 1971-72. He claimed in his Budget speech that this is of much greater significance than the tax changes announced in the Budget.  In fact, in the television presentation of the Budget and in the newspaper presentation of the Budget this was flashed across the screen&mdash; £76 million Cut in Government Expenditure. This was supposed to bring joy to the hearts of the taxpayers but when you go behind that £76 million cut in Government expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was referring to what appeared in the papers and on the television the following day and I do not think the Minister made any attempt to correct any wrong impression which might have been created by what appeared on the television.  I do not know of any statement emanating from the Department of Finance purporting to put people right in case they had got the matter wrong.  The Minister now comes back very sensibly to tell us what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very simple to quote what the Minister said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will:</P>
      <P>We decided that the rise in Government expenditure would have to be moderated and the original current and capital expenditure programme of £797 million for 1970-71 has been reduced to the total of £721 million, an increase of 9½ per cent on last year's outturn.</P>
      <P>This is where they got the £76 million which flashed across the screens on the following day.  I would like to go behind that.  Many people having seen this will have been misled into thinking that the expenditure of the Government had, in fact, come down by £76 million and that therefore there was £76 million available for a reduction in taxation.  Of course nothing could have been further from the truth.  In fact, at that time there was to be an increase of 9½ per cent in Government expenditure.  What happened was that the original demands from the various Departments were pared by £76 million. Everybody knows that in the budgetary process the various Departments make demands which are well in excess of what they expect to get. The paring of that £76 million off the demands originally made was not an effective reduction in Government expenditure at all.  It was merely something that goes on every year when Departments make demands in excess of what they expect to get.  However, the Minister went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> This very substantial reduction, which was not achieved without difficulty represents the main effort of my budgetary policy for 1971-72 and is of much greater significance for our economic well-being than the changes I shall announce today.</P>
    <P>If it was of such great significance to our economic wellbeing surely the Minister would be prepared to specify exactly where he made these reductions amounting to £76 million.  The people are entitled to know what services will get less than would have been provided if these reductions were not made.  I challenge the Minister to tell this House where exactly he made the reductions, so that Deputies will be able to make a responsible decision on the matter.  If it is as significant as the Minister says he should be prepared to give the House that information.</P>
    <P>I now propose to move to the field of income taxation.  Section 2 of the Bill is one to which all right-thinking people will object strongly.  The Government propose to raise income tax by picking on the relatively less well off income taxpayers.  Instead of picking on those who are in the higher reaches of taxation, the Minister picks on those who are just on the margin, who have just come into the tax net. Section 2 terminates for 1971-72 and subsequent years the reduced rate relief whereby the first £100 of a person's taxable income was charged at two-thirds of the standard rate of tax. Obviously that first £100 is of much greater importance to the person who is on a small income than it is to a person who is on a big income.  Therefore, on balance, this provision will be seen as a regressive tax increase, as a tax increase which is bearing most heavily on the section of income tax payers who are least in a position to bear the burden.  Surely what the Minister should have done, if he wanted to raise extra revenue, was to go to the higher reaches of the income tax bracket and get his increase from those people who are in the best position to meet it.  This provision is indicative of the political philosophy of this Minister.  He has obviously yielded to <Col N="1577" /> the demands of the big income tax payers in this field when he chooses to get the biggest increase from those who can least afford it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note also that section 5 provides that the cost incurred in obtaining registration or renewal of registration of a trade mark for the purposes of the trade will be treated as a business expense and thereby allowable as a deduction for tax purposes in computing profits of trade.  It is interesting to note that the Minister is prepared to make this concession in respect of the expenses of those who are in commercial business, people who are relatively well off, whereas he is not prepared to make any concession in regard to increased expenses such as those suggested by Deputy Tully and others in respect of people who are seeking to have their travelling expenses allowed as an expense under the income tax code. Surely that would be much more significant and a more equitable form of expense to allow for the purpose of income tax than this one in relation to trade marks.  Everybody knows that the expense involved for trade marks is not of very great significance for any firm which is in a big way, and this concession is really giving something to people who do not need it.  If the Minister wanted to make concessions in terms of expenses it would have been much more to the point if he had made them in terms of travelling expenses or in terms of some of the other expenses which bear most heavily on the wage earners, particularly those on low wages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against it at this time.  Perhaps when we have more money to give away it will be appropriate to make this concession, but if we are going to make concessions they should be made to those who are more likely to appreciate them.  I think it is fair to say that the level of income tax bears particularly heavily on those on very low incomes.  I have figures here to which I should like to draw the attention of the House.  The Supplementary Benefits Commission in England did something which we have not done here.  It drew up for various categories of persons, single people, married people, and married people with different numbers of children, levels of income which it considered minimal for those people to be above the poverty line.  It is fair to say that the standards drawn up in England are quite appropriate here.  Not only is our cost of living as high as the cost of <Col N="1579" /> living in England, but it is widely contended that the cost of living here is 10 per cent higher than in England for most commodities and for some commodities much higher than that.</P>
      <P>I want to quote from an article entitled &ldquo;Poverty and Taxation&rdquo; by David Piachaud in the &ldquo;Political Quarterly&rdquo;, volume 42, No. 1.  The Supplementary Benefits Commission in November, 1970, drew up the levels of income which it considered minimal to keep people in the categories concerned above the poverty line.  For a single person it considered that the weekly income should be £10 8s.  For a married couple it should be £14 3s a week.  For a two child family with children aged eight and ten years it should be £16 13s a week.  For a four child family with children aged six, eight, ten and 12 years, it should be £18 14s a week.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that for a single person the rate of income needed to keep a person above the poverty line was considered to be £10 8s.  Yet, in this country a single person gets an income tax allowance of £7 a week only.  In other words, £3 8s. of the income which only brings him up to the poverty line laid down by the Supplementary Benefits Commission in England is taxable in this country.  We are taxing people who are accepted by the Supplementary Benefits Commission as being below the poverty line. That is the case for a man.  For a woman the allowance is only £6 15s so £3 12s of her income is taxed.  That is the stamp of a Government with no concern for social justice and using the tax system to perpetuate injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a married couple living alone the standard laid down is £14 3s to keep them above the poverty line.  In this country £3 3s of that income is taxable because the tax-free allowance for such a married couple is £11.  That is wrong.  For the two child family and the four child family, the minimum income is exceeded by the tax-free allowance so for them the position is not as bad, but the single person and the married couple living alone, and living below the poverty line, are paying income tax and to my <Col N="1580" /> mind that is entirely wrong.  This evil is compounded by the fact that we have what is effectively a system of regressive taxation in the form of our flat rate social insurance contribution. On top of the income tax which a single person earning £10 8s has to pay, he also has to pay 78p a week approximately in flat rate social insurance contributions.  This person is contributing at the rate of 35 per cent of £3 of his income in income tax and he is also contributing to the State in his social insurance contribution.  Clearly our system of taxation hits the single person and the married couple who are below the poverty line.  This should not happen and it is something which should engage the immediate attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The money which is being taken from people who are below the poverty line could easily be recouped.  I propose that it could be recouped and should be recouped by the introduction of a capital gains tax.  Money made by an increase in value of shares which are brought and then sold at a much higher price, or an increase in value of land which is bought and then sold at a much higher price goes untaxed, if it can be shown that that speculative transaction does not purport to be the primary source of income of the person concerned.  People are making capital gains and they are not being taxed if they are not the primary source of income.</P>
    <P>We should definitely introduce a capital gains tax.  If we introduced such a tax we would not have this blot on our national record of people below the poverty line paying income tax. I hope the Minister will take the advice which has been proffered to him by this party down through the years in favour of a tax system which would be much more favourable towards the people to whom I have referred in the lower income group.  To ensure maximum welfare we should not tax unduly heavily the productive sector of our community.  It is in that spirit that I advocate a capital gains tax.  Clearly, engaging in an activity which results in capital gains is not a productive activity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> The introduction of a capital gains tax such as I have mentioned would have been much more appropriate than penal taxes on productive companies which have been imposed by this Government.  We have a rate of taxation on companies of approximately 58 per cent.  Britain is in direct competition with us for the distribution of resources.  We are virtually in the same money market.  We are in the same management market.  We are competing directly with Britain for personnel and for capital.  Their total rate of taxation on companies is about 42 per cent.  As a result of the recent increases which have brought our level up to 58 per cent we have put ourselves at a severe disadvantage competitively. We have, therefore, a situation where there is a direct incentive on British companies with subsidiaries here to close down the Irish subsidiaries in order to minimise their tax bill and concentrate production in Britain where the burden of taxation is very significantly less than it is here.  The Minister made what I consider to be a highly spurious defence of his policy in reference to company taxation in the Budget Statement.  I quote from the Minister now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I quote from the Budget Statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed in many quarters at the present burden of taxation on company profits.  But when our present combined income <Col N="1582" /> tax and corporation profits tax rates of 58 per cent are compared with the rates prevailing in other countries, it is often overlooked that under our system the shareholders is not taxed again to income tax on the dividends he receives out of the company profits.  The result is that, effectively, company tax is paid, in many cases, at a rate much lower than 58 per cent.  In the United Kingdom, for example, in addition to the tax paid by the company on its profits, the individual shareholder must pay tax on his dividends out of those profits.  But in this country, if the company distributes 40 per cent of its pre-tax profits to its shareholders the rate effectively borne by the Irish company on its profits is not 58 per cent but 44 per cent.</P>
    <P>In other words, if the company distributes 40 per cent of its pre-tax profits in dividends and these are taxed for income taxation then it looks as if there is a positive incentive for Irish companies to distribute their profits in the form of dividends.  If this is the case we are creating among companies in this country the incentive to enjoy the money now and to pay later.  There is the incentive to unload as many profits as possible in dividends and not to retain them in order to plough them back in investment.  There is this incentive to give the money out to the shareholders, where possibly it is not productively employed, rather than to retain it in the company where it will be put to good use in investment.</P>
    <P>This taxation system, to my mind, has a built-in disincentive to the retention of profits for the purpose of investment. That is a direct reversal of the policy which has been adopted in Britain.  They consider that it is in the best interests of the country to encourage companies to retain as much as possible of their profits for investment. The tax system in Britain puts an extra burden of income tax on profits which are distributed and there is less taxation of profits which are retained.  That is the right policy because if we want companies to expand and business to expand and investment to take place we should not penalise companies for trying <Col N="1583" /> to finance that investment out of their own funds by retaining profits and we should not create a positive incentive for companies to distribute these profits in the form of dividends which, apparently, if one is to read the Minister's statement, is the effect of the tax system which is in operation under the present Government.</P>
    <P>Also in this area of taxation, under section 19 local authorities, housing trusts and housing societies are within the scope of section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, under which a person making a payment in respect of construction operations under a construction contract is, in certain circumstances, obliged to deduct tax at 35 per cent from the amount of the payment.  In other words, tax is being deducted in advance on payments for certain contracts for local authorities.  I know and I am sure Deputy Tully knows that this is having a very bad effect on Meath County Council and many other county councils in that they cannot get contractors to do work for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know a particular project in my constituency, the provision of a water supply in a place which has been deprived of water because of the Boyne drainage works, where they cannot get a contractor to do the work because of this provision.  I hope the Minister will examine this provision and ensure that it is not unduly hamstringing local authorities and creating an unfair competitive disadvantage for them relative to the other employers of the contractors whom they habitually employed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is ahead of me.  I am falling down on the job. In regard to the free depreciation and allowance for designated areas, my main quibble with this is that again the Government are choosing the designated areas.  There is a distinction between the designated areas and the non-designated areas.  The designated areas will get the advantage and the non-designated areas will not.  This designation is out of date in many respects.  It is not an appropriate method for distinguishing between different rates of support for different areas of the country.  There are certain areas within the designated areas where income per head is much higher than it is in many areas in the non-designated areas.  Taking crude county statistics, I understand that the level of income in Kerry and Clare per head is higher than it is in Laois and Offaly. Kerry and Clare are designated areas. So, they will get this extra advantage to entice industry there, whereas Laois and Offaly, although the people are earning less and in greater need of assistance obviously, will not get this benefit.  This is an indication that this whole concept of designation is out of date and needs to be revised.  We need a much more flexible system, not adhering to crude county boundaries which very often are not appropriate and do not indicate the real level of income because there may be one area of a county which may not be in need of any assistance and another area which is as bad, if not worse than, any designated area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the example of Meath, it is fair to say that there are areas in the <Col N="1585" /> western and northern parts of.  Meath which are, so to speak, out of the commuter belt from Dublin, which are in as much need of industrial assistance as any designated area and certainly in as much need as the designated areas which come right to their borders on the Cavan and Monaghan border and yet they cannot get this assistance, whereas places in Monaghan and Cavan, just across the border, can get it.  This is not fair because it provides an artificial inducement to people to site industry not in the best position, and provides a disincentive to growth in towns in County Meath which are in grave need of industrial expansion and which have the infra-structure to provide industrial expansion and induces industry to go that little further into Cavan and Monaghan where, perhaps, the infra-structure is not there and the advantage to the community of the provision of industry is not as great.</P>
    <P>What I advocate is not that Meath as a whole should be made a designated area&mdash;that would be unfair because there are areas where there is full employment&mdash;but that a much more flexible system should be adopted, that we could take electoral areas or parts of electoral areas out of counties and designate them or possibly a town in the middle of an area which is depressed should be designated for the purpose of this Act and the other Acts. We should be more flexible and not adhere rigidly to county boundaries.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate in his reply whether the provisions in sections 16 and 17 are new or if there have been equivalent provisions in existence heretofore.  It appears to me that if there have not been equivalent provisions an injustice has existed.  Section 16 is concerned with the position in which, in the case of an assessment which is under appeal, the amount of a payment on account which has been made by agreement with the inspector of taxes may prove to be in excess of the tax found to be due on termination of the appeal.  The section provides that any overpayment which is being repaid in such a case will be repaid with interest at the same rate as that <Col N="1586" /> which applies to overdue tax.  The section has effect in relation to assessments made after the passing of the Act.  It would be unjust if similar provisions were not in existence heretofore. Obviously, there were individual cases of hardship which would have occured if similar provisions to those contained in sections 16 and 17 were not in existence.</P>
    <P>The customs and excise increases, particularly in relation to the price of drink, will have an adverse effect on our tourist trade.  Britain is a direct competitor of this country in terms of tourism in that American and continental tourists may decide to visit these islands and the relative cost of living in Ireland and in Britain perhaps will induce them to spend more time in the country with the lower cost of living.  In this situation we must compare ourselves with Britain in terms of our general level of taxation, particularly on items such as drink which are of importance to tourists.  When people are on holiday generally they drink more and the increases in the price of drink will have an adverse effect on our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Apart from the American and continental tourists, we are trying to attract British visitors to Ireland and a matter that will weigh with them is whether drink is more expensive in this country.  In this regard we have been falling behind.  I understand that the pint of stout is approximately 7½p more expensive in Ireland than is the pint of bitter in England and this is a substantial difference.  I realise that this is slightly balanced by the fact that bitter is not as alcoholic a drink as stout, but even making adjustment for that it is fair to say that the price of ales and stout is about 5p more expensive than in Britain.  Frequently one of the first questions asked by a tourist is what is the price of drink in the country he proposes to visit and very often it plays an important part in deciding whether he will visit that country.  By having our prices at a higher level we are putting our tourist trade at a severe disadvantage and it is unfortunate that the increase in the price of drink has been introduced.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what effect <Col N="1587" /> membership of the EEC will have in the matter of drink prices.  Perhaps the Minister would state whether the VAT will be the only tax put on drink or if an extra price will be put on this item.  In section 26 there appears to be discrimination in favour of Britain in regard to the rates of excise duty <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries from whom we may import spirits.  Will that discrimination be allowed to continue when we join the EEC, if, in fact, we are able to retain excise duties?  I should like the Minister's observations on those points.</P>
    <P>In regard to the tourist trade between Britain and Ireland, the waterway between the two countries is probably the only international waterway which is not duty-free in terms of drink and other commodities sold on ships using the waterways.  If one travels from Britain to France the drink one can buy on board ships is duty-free but the same condition does not obtain when travelling from Ireland to Britain. Apparently this is a decision of the Irish Revenue Commissioners.  This is one of the little pinpricks which discourage people from coming here as tourists and this restriction should be lifted.  It indicates the out-of-date thinking of the Irish Revenue Commissioners in that they do not regard the Irish Sea as an international waterway. They still imagine we are members of the United Kingdom and they will not operate the system used on other international waterways because perhaps subconsciously they do not regard the traffic in the Irish Sea as international traffic.  This attitude probably derives from the fact that the Revenue Commissioners were in existence before the State was founded and this pre-Independence attitude is reflected in their tax policy.</P>
    <P>In regard to death duties, there is a danger in too closely following the British system which is more appropriate to the situation obtaining in Britain.  In that country there is great accumulation of wealth, many of the fortunes having been made in the 19th century during the industrial revolution. For such large estates heavy death duties are appropriate not only as a revenue provision but as a redistributive <Col N="1588" /> provision in that it reduces the disparity between the wealthy and the less well-off people.  This applies here also but not to the same extent as in Britain because we did not have an industrial revolution and we do not have the great disparities in wealth, people with huge fortunes, to the same extent as Britain.  That is, I think, an essential qualification.  I am not drawing any particular conclusion, but it is something which should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Another factor which differentiates our position from that of Britain is the agricultural character of the community here.  Agricultural land is valued very highly.  The valuation increases as speculation in land grows. Having regard to the potential in income yield to the farmer land is valued altogether too highly.  If the average farmer were to sell his land and invest the proceeds in ESB stock it is quite probable that he would enjoy a bigger income from that investment than he would breaking his back working seven days a week.  That is not because our system of farming is inefficient; this is something the prophets of doom in relation to the EEC forget.  Our farmers are probably more efficient than their counterparts in Europe.  But the price paid for land can buy a great deal of stock.  It is this sale value which is taken into account when computing the basis on which tax is to be levied. It is not the value to the farmer in terms of the income he derives from the land.</P>
    <P>Many farmers have no intention whatsoever of selling their land.  They intend to go on farming.  Indeed, the country would be that much worse off if they did not so intend.  Death duties are levied not on the basis of the income from the farm but on the notional sale value, a sale value inflated as a result of speculation.  People buy land in order to have some security.  Foreigners are anxious, perhaps, to have a bit of land here in case other less solid types of investment collapse.  Land is a stable commodity.  Stocks and shares are not. Foreigners buy land not from the point of view of the likely income to accrue but because of the security of the investment. <Col N="1589" /> This speculation puts up the price of land and this is what has caused the artificially high valuation, relatively speaking, <i>vis-à-vis</i> its earning capacity.  Yet, this is the basis on which death duties are levied.  These death duties are a very heavy burden on a farm as compared with their impact on industry, commerce and so on.  That is why we should look very carefully at the system in the light of its effect on the agricultural community. I shall come back to this later.</P>
    <P>There are other fundamental considerations which must be borne in mind when examining the system with regard to death duties.  We must ask ourselves is the time of death the best time in the life cycle of the owner or owners to levy a very heavy tax? Is it the most appropriate time?  Is the best time the time at which the owner has just died?  I do not think it is.  First of all, great difficulties can arise when ownership is in process of transition.  There is a new owner coming in.  He may not understand the business thoroughly.  But this is the time at which we elect to levy death duties.  This is the time, the most inconvenient time, when we levy property tax.</P>
    <P>I am not against property tax.  It is a useful and a valid form of taxation, but I do not consider the time of death the appropriate time at which to levy such a tax.  Again, is it wise to tax an estate regardless of the position of the inheritors?  It is worth remembering that estate duty is levied on the estate; it is not levied on the inheritors.  Theoretically it is levied on the estate irrespective of whether the estate is going to a nephew, a great-grandnephew, or a fourth cousin in the United States. The rate of duty is the same&mdash;perhaps there are some minor differences&mdash;as it is if the estate is going to a son who grew up with the business and hoped to succeed to the business.</P>
    <P>The position is different in the case of legacy and succession duty.  There is a differential rate and the relationship of the inheritor to the deceased is taken into consideration.  If the relationship is very close the rate of tax is lower than it would be in the case <Col N="1590" /> of a distant relative.  Morally and socially that is a more justifiable type of tax.  We should consider whether it would be possible to reorganise our whole system in regard to estate and succession duty in order to redress the balance somewhat.  Estate duty, which does not have a differential, is much more important relatively speaking.  It is a much greater burden on the inheritors than are succession and legacy duties.  Could we redress the balance somewhat and make the more equitable inheritance taxation, succession and legacy duties, a bigger part of the total taxation and phase downwards estate duty which, in my opinion, is not as just a form of taxation?  Estate duty should be replaced by a five-yearly wealth tax.  Those who possess wealth above a certain level should be assessed on this wealth every five years.  There should be a tax rate which would yield a return equivalent to that currently yielded from estate duty.</P>
    <P>That would be quite fair because it would not bear heavily on a firm, business or industry at the time of death. It would be spread right over the life span of the business.  It would be coming up every few years and would therefore act as a constant reminder to people that they had property which they must utilise to the best effect in order to make enough income to be able to pay the tax.  Estate duty as it operates at present does not have this effect because the person in charge of the business knows he will not have to pay it; he will be dead when it comes to be paid.  It has no incentive effect on him to earn enough money to ensure there is money to pay the duty.  If you have the wealth tax I am suggesting there would be an incentive to the person earning to make enough money out of the business to meet the payment.  This would be important in ensuring that capital resources of the community are used to the optimum.  This tax would act as a goad towards the optimum use of the property.</P>
    <P>Succession and legacy duties should be retained as the only taxation levied on the death of the owner and estate duty should be abolished.  There is <Col N="1591" /> some justification for a tax on the death of the owner of property but it should not be as great as it is at present.  That is why I am prepared to accept retention of succession and legacy duties while proposing the replacement of estate duty by the five years wealth tax.</P>
    <P>I should like to recall what I said earlier about the effects of death duty on agricultural property in that it is overvalued and therefore pays a much higher rate of tax than would normally be borne if it were related to its earning capacity.  I direct the attention of the House particularly to sections 37 and 40 of the Bill.  Both sections are bad and I am opposed to them.  Section 37 removes the reductions in value for estate duty purposes of gifts made in the third, fourth or fifth years prior to the death of the deceased.  The explanatory memorandum states that section 40 restricts the exemption from estate duty of gifts made in consideration of marriage to the first £5,000, of gifts made by a party to a marriage, to the other party or by a parent or remoter ancestor to a child, or remoter descendant on marriage and to the first £1,000 of gifts made and so on.  I am not reading this in a way that is very clear but basically it removes the favourable consideration for estate duty purposes of gifts made in respect of marriage.</P>
    <P>These two provisions would have a very serious effect on the agricultural community in that they remove an incentive which existed to the transfer of land by a father, who possibly was not in the best position to work land to the best advantage, to his son.  This reluctance on the part of fathers to transfer land to sons has been one of the failings of the Irish agricultural scene for many years.  It is reflected in the very low marriage rate in rural areas.  Sons of many small farmers were not in a position to get land early enough in life to give them the security and assured income which would enable them to get married. This gave us the depressing result of so many unmarried people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 37, where <Col N="1592" /> there were reductions in the rate of estate duty in respect of gifts made in the third, fourth and fifth years prior to death, there was some incentive for a man who thought he had perhaps three or four years to live to make the land over to his son.  He knew that if he did not live the whole five years and be completely free of estate duty at least the rate of duty would be somewhat reduced.  That gave him a financial incentive to transfer the land to his son.  This is no longer the case. He must live the full five years or pay the full rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is a great incentive to make the transfer earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, people do not think of these things until late in life.  Five years is something too long for people to think ahead; they are not prepared to admit their lives are coming to a close and this is understandable. This change in section 37 will have a bad effect and the change in section 40 will operate similarly. An appropriate time when the farm could be transferred to the son would be on marriage.  The exemption which existed and which will exist up to the implementation of section 40 is an incentive to make such a transfer.  Again, this incentive is being removed.  In this context I should like to reflect on section 38.  It appears to provide an incentive to transfer land to the widow. There are many cases where this would be appropriate but very often it is wrong to transfer the farm to a widow who may be no younger than the deceased. Anything which proves a disincentive to the testator from passing the land to his son who is likely to be able to make better use of it than the widow is questionable.  I expect to hear more from the Minister about what he envisages under section 38.  It is possible it will not have the effect I anticipate as a disincentive to passing land to the son.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, where it would be useful and important to have land <Col N="1593" /> transferred during the lifetime of the owner to his son.  We should bear in mind also in relation to section 37 that if the Minister wants, as he appears to want&mdash;particularly in his speech&mdash;to introduce a tax on gifts as distinct from a tax on death, he should say so and introduce such a tax.  To try to introduce a tax on gifts with particular discrimination against gifts which happen to be made in the last few years of a man's life is quite wrong. If you want a tax on gifts, have one, but do not pick out only those gifts made in the last five years of life for <Col N="1594" /> particularly harsh treatment.  There may be a case for the introduction of a gifts tax, if the Minister is not prepared to adopt my proposal to get rid of estate duty and substitute a wealth tax, to supplement taxes already existing.  If so, let him introduce such a tax but do not select for particularly harsh treatment gifts that happen to be made in the last five years of life.</P>

      <P>Of the 112 recommendations of the Commission on Income Taxation listed in Chapter XXXI of the Seventh Report (Pr. 6581) of the Commission and Appendix I to that Report, only 26 were not accepted by the Government for reasons indicated in the first and second White Papers on Direct Taxation published in April, 1961, and April, 1963, respectively.  Of the remaining 86 recommendations, 57 have been implemented with or without modification and 29 fall into the category mentioned in the Deputy's second question.  These latter recommendations are kept under constant review with a view to their implementation as and when possible.  However, it must be borne in mind in this connection that regard has to be had to such factors as budgetary considerations and changed circumstances, such as the recent abolition of Schedules A and B, which have rendered some recommendations obsolete or irrelevant. It is also the position that reports on the studies currently being undertaken into company taxation and the activities of building societies have to be awaited before implementation of certain of the outstanding recommendations can be considered.  When regard is had to the various factors involved, there are few, if any, of the recommendations falling into the category mentioned in the Deputy's second question which could at present be implemented.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together and to circulate with the Official Report the statistical material requested.</P>
      <P>The level of taxation, as a percentage of GNP, was generally higher in 1970 than was implied in the Second Programme projections, though the relative importance of the constituents was broadly in line with that expected.</P>
      <P>Total current expenditure of public authorities, at 1960 values, was also in excess of Second Programme expectations for 1970.  The pattern of expenditure differed greatly from what was envisaged.  Subsidies and transfer payments accounted for a much greater share and expenditure on goods and services a lesser share than that projected.  This is due partly to the greater emphasis on social expenditure during the sixties.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the projections of the Second Programme for 1970 have been replaced by those of the Third Programme spanning the period 1969-1972.</P>
      <P>1968 is the latest year for which internationally comparable data for taxes are available for EEC member and applicant countries.  Satisfactory international comparisons of taxes on capital are not available.  The 1968 data show that tax receipts as a percentage of GNP are much lower in Ireland than in any of the EEC and applicant countries.  The proportion of taxes accounted for by taxes on income is, however, higher in the other countries than in Ireland.</P>

    <P>(ii)  Amendments to the E.S.B. General Employees' Superannuation Scheme, 1943 were sanctioned by the Minister on 10th June, 1969, with effect from tha date, pending the making of the necessary order.</P>

    <P>Amendments to the Bord na Móna Regular Works Employees' Superannuation Scheme, 1963 were sanctioned by the Minister on 2nd June, 1970 with effect from 4th June, 1970 pending the making of the necessary order.</P>
    <P>OSTLANNA IOMPAIR ÉIREANN TEO.</P>
    <P>The General Employees' and Regular Wages Superannuation Schemes are only a relatively short time in operation and details of outgoings are not yet available.  The rates of contribution are 6% in the case of general employees and in the case of regular wages employees, 5¼% of the amoun t by which the weekly pay of the member exceeds twice the rate of contributory Old Age Pension payable during the same week to a single man.</P>
    <P>HARBOUR BOARDS.</P>
    <P>The Harbour Board schemes are either completely non-contributory or non-contributory in respect of service before specified dates.  Employee contributions have therefore no actuarial relationship to outgoings.</P>
