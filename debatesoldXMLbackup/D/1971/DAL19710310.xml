      <P>A considerable length of time has elapsed since the debate began on the Taoiseach's motion and the amendment tabled by the Leader of the Opposition in connection with the entry of this country to the EEC.  Our application to join the EEC can be described as one of the most vital and important steps we have taken since we became a nation.  I have often wondered, and many Deputies have expressed the same thought, if the Government realise the importance of the step which they propose to take. Despite the magnitude of this important step very little interest has been shown either by the ordinary man in the street or by Members of this House about our application for membership of the EEC.  One would imagine steps would have been taken to have a debate of this kind resumed much earlier, and that an effort would have been made to make known to the public, many thousands of whom appear to be in ignorance about our application for membership of the EEC, the implications of joining.  Deputies on all sides of the House have a responsibility to make known the issues involved.  There have been speeches from the Fine Gael front bench, the Labour front bench and, as a sequel, a rather complicated utterance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Cosgrave urges the Government to ensure that the terms to be negotiated safeguard the interests of the Irish people and in this respect we must question if the negotiating team have had sufficient regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the documentation circulated in regard to the EEC I have yet to see any document which sets out clearly the losses and gains involved in entry and also the pros and cons for nonentry into Europe.  There has been considerable uneasiness throughout the country in regard to this matter.  There are thousands of people who consider we should join and many others who <Col N="641" /> say we should not join the Community. The vast majority of our people are not cognisant of the implications of membership.  Responsibility rests on Members of this House to make the issues known.</P>
    <P>I have read the speeches made in regard to our proposed entry into Europe.  I am convinced that by joining with European countries we will be playing our part as an independent nation.  We are a small country and because of our geographical position we have been overshadowed by Britain.  People in this country were shocked when they discovered that there were people in Europe who did not know that we were a separate nation until we applied for membership of the EEC.  We frequently have the idea that the world is watching us and yet there were people in Europe who were unaware that we were an independent and separate State.</P>
    <P>Although we are a small nation we have played our part in full as a member of the United Nations.  The Irish Army is associated with the peace-keeping forces of that organisation and by membership of the UN our status as an independent nation was underlined. When people say we should not go into Europe I wonder what they mean by this.  Are we not already in Europe?  We are part of the continent and as a European nation we have the obligation to contribute with the other European countries in an effort to achieve co-operation and peace.  This is an obligation as binding as our obligation to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>If our application for membership of the EEC is accepted we will have an important role in moulding the future policies of Europe and this is as it should be.  The importance of Britain as a world power has meant that we have been overshadowed for too long and we have been too dependent on that country.  If for no other reason but to throw off the shackles of Britain we should join the EEC.  We should stand on our own feet; we should not be dependent on the British market but should look to the much wider European market with its many millions of people.</P>
    <P>I have not heard any constructive alternative proposals from those who <Col N="642" /> are violently opposed to our entry into the EEC.  Since the foundation of this State it has been our aim to co-operate to the fullest possible extent with all other independent countries in the creating not alone of a better Europe but of a better world.  If we are admitted to the EEC it will undoubtedly give us a better standing as a nation and a greater degree of independence from Britain.  We have a long road to travel before we are admitted to membership no matter what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery, may say about 1973, 1975 or even 1977.  There is now growing opposition in Britain to membership of the EEC.  How deeply-rooted that opposition is I cannot say but it is certain that if Britain is admitted to membership there is no possible alternative for us but to follow because of our geographical position, because of our trading arrangements, because we are an agricultural country and because of our close proximity to Britain.</P>
    <P>People may say that in the EEC big powers dominate and small powers are helpless.  As it is at present the mighty powers control and have the loud voice and the small nations if they are outside the EEC have very weak and feeble voices.  When a small country is in the Community its voice is equal to that of a strong power; it can be heard; there is machinery available to make it heard.  That is why for a small country such as ours the advantages of membership completely outweigh the disadvantages.  When we are a member we will help in the making of laws and the formulation of policy whereas when we are not there the mighty powers can draft policy, regulate prices and allocate markets.  All this can be done to the detriment of a nation like ours unless we are on the spot.</P>
    <P>That is why the line taken in relation to the EEC by the Fine Gael Party is the wisest policy, the most fruitful policy and the policy which eventually must lead to this country participating as a real independent nation in the building and reconstruction of a united Europe.</P>
    <P>It has been said, the small nations can be pushed about.  As members of a community such as the EEC there is <Col N="643" /> no question of pushing small nations about.  This country is too dependent on Britain from the point of view of agriculture and of industry.  The British market is our main outlet for cattle and for agricultural produce and our industrial exports to Britain are quite considerable.  We have had experience in the past in relation to industrial exports of Britain clamping on levies whenever it suited her.  There was a time when the British agricultural economy was not as strong as it is today.  At that time they depended very greatly on the agricultural produce they got from this country.  As their own agricultural economy expanded they became less dependent and in recent times whenever they got an opportunity&mdash;perhaps it is an indication that those who went from this country to negotiate better trading and marketing terms with Britain were not sufficiently effective or were not good bargainers&mdash;the terms and results of agreements were not always to the advantage of this country.  There were many industrial levies and taxes imposed by the British on imports from Ireland which were unreasonable in view of the fact that we are Britain's nearest neighbour for trading purposes. It must be admitted that for our industrial and agricultural exports we have depended too much on the charity, the generosity or the whim of Britain.  On the other hand it may have been that those who represented this country at the various Anglo-Irish talks were not good at getting the best possible terms for this country.  We do not know for which reason the best terms were not always obtained for us.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, from the opposition to joining the EEC, that we were going into the EEC with enemies.  That is far from the position.  We are entering into a partnership with friends who have a common desire to help, to co-operate and to improve the standards of living of all people within the Community. The right policy is to get into the Community first and then to deal with the problems which may arise.  It is easier to deal with the problems inside the Community than to attempt from outside the Community to resolve <Col N="644" /> problems which may never arise.  It is wrong to criticise from outside.  It is better to be inside and to build up constructively.  If one is advocating Ireland's entry to the EEC one should leave nothing undone to make it known that the laws and institutions of that Community are not something which are fixed for all time.  They can be altered.  In order to alter them to suit the conditions of a nation like ours, we must be within that Community first so that we can lobby other member countries who may have problems similar to ours and to solicit the support of Ireland's friends in Europe if the occasion arises.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of EEC is to assist the economic development of the countries in Europe which are least developed.  Our country is underdeveloped. We have never got the chance over the past 50 years to develop because we have devoted too much of our time to petty party problems rather than concentrate on the main problems of national development. We are a poor, undeveloped country.  We have a national debt of £120,000 million.  Something like £90 million is needed each year to pay the interest on it.  I always thought that countries applying for entry to the EEC would have to have a certificate of solvency.  If Ireland is asked at Brussels to produce such a certificate I do not know where it will come from.  The national debt is astonishing. It must be borne in mind by the negotiators that the fabric of this country is shaky at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be careful of what he says about that subject.  If the Deputy studies the figures for capital formation in this country as a percentage of production each year he will find that we are not in an unusual position in regard to the amount of money required to pay the debt.  We have to be careful of the position, but there is nothing particularly unusual about the position in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>For a nation of 26 counties our national debt seems astonishing and appalling having regard to the fact that we are an undeveloped country industrially and <Col N="645" /> agriculturally.  The numbers of the unemployed are astonishing also.  With the exception of Greece we must have the worst health services in Europe.  If we join the EEC what steps will be taken to bring these services up to a proper European standard?  How can this be done out of our own resources if we have such a big debt and are in an economic and financial mess?  How can we provide additional employment and develop our natural mineral resources?  How can we achieve a high standard of housing in the country? We have not the financial resources to provide proper housing for all who require it.  Marshall Aid does not exist now.  It is essential that we go somewhere where we can get assistance so that we can develop to the fullest extent possible.  Our unemployment position is deplorable.  Our health, housing and farming problems are enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without fear of contradiction, I can say that our farmers are neither equipped nor trained to compete with European farmers.  They have worked hard and compare favourably in this regard with European farmers.  Our farmers have not got money or credit facilities at their disposal.  They are in a sorry plight because of the lack of working capital which would keep them going from spring until the harvest.  If we are to prepare them for EEC entry, we must put them on equal footing with the British farmer and the Norwegian farmer so that on entry they can be on equal terms with the Danish, German, French and Italian farmers.  In the event of Ireland's application being accepted, our farmers must get help and assistance from the Community to raise them to higher living standards because the Irish farmers have, perhaps, the lowest living standards in Europe today.  I presume that is why so many farmers are anxious to join the EEC.  We hear it suggested that we should not join the EEC, that it is dangerous to join, that we do not know what we are joining, but, may I ask, no matter what we do, can we be any worse off than we are today?  Having regard to our experience in the past 30 or 40 years, whatever prospects of greatness we may have in Europe, if we were to remain out on <Col N="646" /> our own in isolation, depending entirely on the whim of Fianna Fáil, where would we be left either as regards industry or agriculture?  Many may say that when we go in we surrender the rights of this House and we become dependent on Brussels.  Can we be any worse off depending on Brussels than we are depending on this Government?</P>
    <P>The economic plight of the people is beyond the imagination of the present Government.  They speak from figures and statistics far removed from the facts that are visible in the homes of the people.  Our farmers' living standards can only be brought into line with those of the farmers of Denmark from within and not from outside, looking in: it can only be done with the co-operation and help, financial and otherwise, that must come from within. If we do not go in our future prospects are bleak and gloomy.  The only chance we have of shaking off the shackles of distress and semi-poverty in which all our people live today is to join the EEC.  Nobody knows that better than the Government because there are hard times in industry.  Industrialists were asked to prepare for entry into the Common Market.  Grants were provided for 1,400 industries, one-third of the number requiring these facilities. What assistance did the other two-thirds of our industries get to prepare for EEC membership?  Is it not true that it is as fashionable in Ireland today to be in the bankruptcy columns of the daily papers as it is to be in the social and personal columns?  How can we play our part in Europe with a community of bankrupt and semi-bankrupt industrialists and totally bankrupt farmers? How can it be done?  What are the prospects?  Outside the EEC the prospects are very gloomy.  They cannot be any worse within the EEC and they may improve.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that every day we see in the papers that factories, whether textile or shoe factories, are closing down and that tens of thousands of industrial workers are out of employment and we are not in the EEC? Those who are opposed to EEC membership tell us that when we join the EEC all our industries will close down. They are closing down today and we are not in the EEC.  The <Col N="647" /> are closing down because our industrialists are prominent in the bankruptcy columns of our daily papers and the Government are doing nothing to keep bankruptcy notices off factory doors or to keep sheriffs or bailiffs away from the farmers' doors. We see our industrialists with no markets and high living costs.  They have to meet the demands of trade unions which must be met having regard to living standards and the manner in which the cost of living has risen.</P>
    <P>I have heard, and I am still hearing from those who oppose Ireland's entry into the EEC, that when we enter the EEC the Irish housewife will be distracted by the high cost of food.  We are not in the EEC today and yet food costs are continuing to rise.  The EEC cannot be blamed for that. Whatever chance we have of having a sufficient income to meet higher living costs in the EEC it cannot be done now because our people cannot get the necessary income to meet these soaring living costs.</P>
    <P>The cost of living was never bedevilled so much as it was since 15th February, Decimal Day.  Everything seems to have gone completely out of control since.  The first inquiry when you go into any shop is: have you a £1?  This applies no matter what you wish to purchase.  The moment the £1 is changed it is gone.  Money has lost its value.  Prices have gone out of control and the Government have made no effort to control them.  Our prospects might be better in Brussels than in Dublin.  We could not be any worse off.</P>
    <P>Within the EEC no European country will have a greater claim on money for development than we will because we can produce no certificate of financial solvency and we have ample evidence of under-development. Therefore, we will have first claim on whatever is going for undeveloped European states.</P>
    <P>We have been told that it is dangerous to join the EEC because of certain defence commitments.  The fact is that EEC membership involves no defence commitments whatever.  Why is that not spelled out clearly for those who <Col N="648" /> believe that there are such commitments? When the Tánaiste or the Minister for Foreign Affairs contributes to this debate I hope it will be made clear that so far as records and evidence can show, EEC membership involves no defence commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well that our people should know the position. The Minister knows and we know that there are no defence commitments but the man in the street and the man down the country do not know.  It may well be that in the future members of the EEC may think it desirable to develop some common defence institutions. If there are defence commitments it must be borne in mind that as a member of the United Nations, we are already committed to participate in the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.  Our negotiators should make it clear that there can be no question either now or in the future of any regulations from a Brussels Parliament imposing conscription or compelling citizens of member countries to undertake military service.  It is vitally important, therefore, that our people should be given the fullest information in this regard.  There are many thousands of our people who believe that in the event of a European defence <Col N="649" /> policy on our joining the EEC it will result immediately in conscription to the defence forces, as we have seen in the past in Italy and Germany.</P>
      <P>You can lead the Irish people a fair distance, as we have seen from the way Fianna Fáil have led them&mdash; they are the most easily led people in the world&mdash;but you cannot drive them. Therefore, whatever defence commitments will be instituted from within the EEC a guarantee should be given that there will be no question of compulsory army service by our citizens who do not desire to participate in military conflicts, who desire to live at peace with all other communities.  Such a guarantee is necessary in the interests of the freedom and liberty which our people enjoy, particularly our young people who have the Army as a career.  If they want to join the Army, if they like soldiering, that is all right, although soldiering has not been a very profitable profession in this country in the past.  If we are to keep an army either for United Nations purposes or for participation in EEC military commitments they should be paid at the highest European standards.  As I say, we can play our part in the EEC as we are playing it in the United Nations, but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should make it clear that there will be no question of a Brussels Parliament or a European Parliament imposing military conscription in any shape or form against the will of the Irish people.  The newspapers also have an obligation to make facts known in this regard to the reading public, because I am satisfied that the reading public have not been given all the facts in relation to EEC membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons why Ireland should join the EEC.  Those who are opposed to Ireland's entry put forward many reasons why they should not join.  I think the main reason for joining is that no matter how bad the conditions will be for us as members of the EEC, they cannot be any worse than they are here today: unemployment, an undeveloped economy, high living costs, farmers and industrialists in bankruptcy.  Does the EEC not hold out a ray of hope for us to shake off the <Col N="650" /> shackles of bankruptcy and the prospect of a decent standard of living?  In the EEC our farmers will get 50 per cent higher prices for milk and meat. This will greatly increase their income and bring new prosperity to rural areas. The farmers' representatives met the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. Deputy Gibbons, yesterday for the usual pre-Budget talks.  There are always talks before the Budget.  It is usually too late to talk after the Budget, but very seldom within the Budget are there any worthwhile benefits or advantages to offer to the industrial or agricultural section of the community, simply because the economy cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>Why do we not face facts and realise that we are now at the limit of our resources?  We cannot tax the people any more than they have been taxed; we cannot borrow any more than we have borrowed.  Where, then, do we go?  Naturally, the only practical step left is to throw in our lot with the EEC in the hope of a more prosperous future within that community.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that our farmers want better prices for their cattle and their milk?  Is it not also correct to say that the Irish dairy farmer is not equipped or prepared financially to enter the EEC?  The margin of his profit from his hard work from sunrise to nightfall leaves him disillusioned.  When we hear farmers protesting, objecting and demanding, do we not say to ourselves that they are not doing so for fun or sport?  They are doing it because they realise they are at the end of their tether in so far as financial resources are concerned.  Therefore, the prospect of a 50 per cent increase in milk and meat prices in the EEC would afford massive help to our farmers.  This, in turn, will bring new prosperity to rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another reason why we should join the EEC is the new opportunities it will bring for industrial exports.  This, again, will bring an increase in the numbers employed in industry.  That is what we want.  If we are to progress in accordance with the plans of the IDA and others to set up industrial estates, we must not alone keep our industries going and our workers employed but <Col N="651" /> we must have markets for what we produce, because it would be senseless to set up factories and to produce goods for which there is not a market. At the moment we have the British market and a small slice of the American and Canadian markets.  In Europe we have a market readymade for us&mdash; six nations within and three more to go in.  Why not go in and avail of this readymade market to the fullest possible extent?</P>
    <P>When either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs comes to speak of industrial exports and the industrial opportunities we will have when we enter Europe, I hope they will refer to the situation in regard to the Shannon Free Airport Development area.  A statement in this respect in the context of EEC membership is necessary.  On numerous occasions in this House I have raised my voice in favour of the Shannon industrial estate.  I expressed my faith and confidence in the development and growth of that estate.  I still believe in it and I want to ensure that when we go into Europe our membership of the EEC will not hinder future development there.  It has a very high standing in the world today and I hope our negotiators in Brussels have emphasised this.  I hope special arrangements will be made in respect of Shannon in regard to tariffs and so on because it would be disastrous if the development of that estate were hampered in any way.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there will be great advantages for our industrial exports within the EEC.  I have in mind particularly the textile industry.  No one knows what its future is at the moment. We know that mills in Yorkshire, the home of the textile industry in Britain, have been closed.  If Britain enters the Common Market her textile industry will be given priority and if we join at the same time the same should apply to ours.  I speak with a special interest in this because of the textile trade in my constituency.  On the other hand, if Britain joins and Ireland stays out, where will we be?  That is why I cannot understand those who express serious opposition to our joining.</P>
    <P>If Britain joins and we foolishly <Col N="652" /> decide to stay in isolation, out on a limb, this would mean that the Six Counties would be members because they are linked with the United Kingdom and they would be part of Europe.  One of the most vital steps towards Irish unity will be the entry of this country to the EEC at the same time as Britain because we all move in together.  If Britain and the Six Counties were members of the EEC and we were not, the so-called Border, which has caused such widespread distress and bloodshed, would be more permanent than ever.</P>

      <P>Whatever prospects there are for complete Irish unity are to be found in membership of the EEC.  A number of people in the Six Counties are not at all enthusiastic about membership of the EEC because they feel that if we join the great benefits from Europe will flow into the Republic rather than into the small section known as the Six Counties. However, if Britain joins and we do not the great advantages from Europe would undoubtedly flow into the Six Counties.  If membership of the EEC is of great advantage, why should we not avail of that advantage? If the Six Counties secure advantages by membership more power to them.  It should be the concern of this Parliament&mdash;and I am sure it is the concern of all Irishmen&mdash; that there should be full employment in the Six Counties.  We like to see the shipbuilding industry, the flax industry and all branches of industry booming in that part of our country which is partitioned off by an imaginary border. We wish them well in their efforts to get employment but if there are advantages from Europe we like to see them enjoy those advantages with ourselves.  One way in which Ireland can be looked upon as a unit is within the EEC in which the 32 Counties <Col N="653" /> can be catered for very well and reasonably.</P>
      <P>We have a 32-county underdeveloped area.  The people on both sides of the Border look forward to assistance and co-operation from Europe.  It would be better for us all if Ireland was a unit in relation to this matter.  I am glad our application is being considered at the same time as the British application because it makes a mockery of the so-called Border.</P>
      <P>I hope Ireland's application will be successful and that our negotiators will be wide awake.  I am sorry there was not a different approach at the commencement to this question of our entry into the EEC.  It is a great pity that the Government have all the negotiating to do in relation to this matter.  From the start this should have been tackled on a non-party basis and there should have been a negotiating team officially representing Ireland consisting of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or any other Minister, the Leader of the Labour Party and other members of that party and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and other members of that party.  This would have been in the best interests of the country. It is regrettable that, perhaps, the greatest national step that ever was taken, or is ever likely to be taken again, should have been taken by one political party in leading the negotiations in this matter.  I believe half the uneasiness which exists in the country at the present time would not have existed if this matter was approached in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the lack of information to the Opposition which has been responsible for creating a good deal of the uneasiness which exists at the present time. There is information which the Minister for Foreign Affairs or any other Minister probably do not see fit to disclose to the Opposition.  If the Opposition were part of the negotiating team they would have had all those facts.  It is regrettable that the Opposition and the Government were not jointly responsible to this House for conducting the negotiations in connection with our entry into the EEC.  Perhaps the Government considered that <Col N="654" /> having been elected it was their duty and responsibility to conduct those negotiations bearing in mind that if there are successes they will take the credit for them and if there are disadvantages they will take the blame for them.</P>
    <P>The EEC commitment in relation to helping underdeveloped areas will mean substantial new capital for industrial development in Ireland.  The fact that we are underdeveloped means that there are no prospects of ever becoming developed as a result of our own initiative and, therefore, we must depend on help from abroad.  Our neighbours and partners in Europe are the only people who can assist us in that direction.  By joining we will become less dependent on Britain.  We depend too much on Britain.  The less we depend on them the better for ourselves. We can have other European countries with open doors for us.  We now have a golden opportunity not to be so dependent on Britain.  By joining we will gain a real share in the shaping of European policy.</P>
    <P>This country has an outstanding tradition because from the very earliest days the Irish people sent their sons and daughters to the farthest parts of the earth in order to spread the Christian faith.  If in joining Europe we can play our part in shaping European policy in all fields we can exert a great influence on Britain.  We may be a small, insignificant country but Irishmen have travelled to all parts of the world and have participated in Parliaments many thousands of miles from here.  One of the pioneer leaders of Canadian independence was an Irishman. Irishmen have taken part in the development of public life and otherwise in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, and in the Church in Japan and in China, in India and in Africa.  When we have played such a significant part in bringing our thoughts and beliefs to these countries can we not do even more in moulding the policies in all sectors in Europe?</P>
    <P>We can play a big part as a nation sitting alongside other European nations and with our Christian outlook helping to shape decisions on important economic, financial or defence matters. <Col N="655" /> We will be there to express our opinion, to contribute by our common sense and intelligence in the shaping of European policy in which at present we have no say, no rights beyond the right to comment.  Until we are inside we will have no say in the shaping of European policies.  We can look at them, we can talk about them but we cannot participate in making them until we are in. An Irish influence in Europe would be a very great advantage.</P>
    <P>I hope that this will not react unfavourably and that instead of Ireland endeavouring to exert a good influence on Europe it will be Europe that will exert a great influence on Ireland and attempt to change our way of life.  No matter what way Europe may try to change our way of life our life cannot be any worse than it is today.  Whether we like it or not our entire social fabric is collapsing completely around us because we have a careless Government and we have a sleepy Church, I am sorry to say.  This country at present is reeking with drink, drugs and sex and while that is so the admission rate to mental hospitals is one of the highest in Europe.</P>
    <P>How are we to create an impression in Europe if this is part of the social environment in which we live?  I am sorry to say that the State has a big responsibility in this and that the Church which appears to be slumbering without a murmur&mdash;no loud voice is raised against drugs, drink or sex&mdash; is allowing the social fabric to collapse. I say this with regret but we must face facts.  We must believe what we see. We must realise that there was never such consumption of intoxicating drink as there is at present.  Is this the kind of influence we are going to exert on Europe, or is this the backlash of European influences coming in to upset our way of life?  I do not know, I cannot say which.  However, it is wrong. How are we going to create abroad a respect for law and and order when we have not got law and order at home? How are we going to create confidence in a European Parliament when we have not got confidence in our own Parliament?  How do we expect the European Council of Ministers to tell <Col N="656" /> us the truth if our own Ministers will not tell us the truth in our own Parliament? That is gone too, I am sorry to say.</P>
    <P>Where do we stand?  Are we all handcuffed and blindfolded?  How are we going to create an impression abroad?  Faith and fatherland, honesty and integrity, how are you! We cannot stand up and preach honesty and integrity in Europe; we cannot stand up and speak of law and order which we have not got; we cannot stand up and speak of civil rights which we have not got here; we cannot stand up and speak for equal rights and equal opportunities which we have not got here. Furthermore, we cannot stand up and uphold the dignity of the institutions of the European Parliament when we cannot uphold the dignity of our own Parliament.  That in my opinion is the most serious aspect of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that our people are in a most extraordinary frame of mind, a frame of mind in which they could not care less.  That is the worst frame of mind in which any people could be.  That is a sad state of affairs and a state of affairs which reveals depression and gloom.  What you want is an energetic and enthusiastic community filled with confidence, with hope, filled with courage and belief in the future, a people full of life led by their Parliament and statesmen, sponsored by their churchmen.  Instead of that we have the Church asleep&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will leave the Deputy to deal with them.  I am saying that as far as many great moral aspects are concerned they are asleep.  Whether it is that they do not know what is going on, the fact remains that they are silent and silence means agreement. They were not at all silent in 1948 on the mother and child scheme, but they <Col N="657" /> are remaining very silent about contraception and divorce.</P>
      <P>If, to be brought into line with European legislation, we must introduce divorce, I venture to say that the introduction of such legislation would be the death knell of the family as a unit in the Christian life of our community. Such legislation would be wrong.  It would be disastrous.  This is an occasion on which one must speak with a degree of courage.  It is an occasion, also, on which one must be guided by one's own conscience.  The introduction of divorce would rock the foundation of every Christian home in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I hope I shall never see the day when such legislation is introduced.  I hope, too, that the day will never come when we will give approval to contraception or abortion. Legislation of this nature would be a complete prostitution of our faith and fatherland.</P>
      <P>It is popular in Ireland and in other parts of Europe today to speak of sex, divorce and drugs.  These things are foreign to Ireland.  The Government and the Church must be active in dealing with these problems.  There must be no slumbering because there is no point in waking up when it is too late.</P>
      <P>When I appeared on television here about two years ago on the occasion of my retirement from membership of the front bench of this party, I pointed my finger at Leinster House and said that 25 years hence there would be no room there for a democratic institution and that the mob would have taken over Leinster House.  Some people laughed at me then but, a little more than two years later, we find that both the Church and the State are slipping and that there is growing unrest all around us.  The unrest that is being experienced in many European countries is brought about by reason of the fact that many people forget there is a Supreme Being&mdash; God&mdash;the Maker, the Founder and the Giver of Life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existence of God is forgotten in <Col N="658" /> many European Parliaments and we find now that it is beginning to be forgotten here in this Parliament which might be regarded as one of the most Christian Parliaments in the world.  I hope that, if and when we enter Europe, there will be increased prosperity for all but, at the same time, I hope that our way of life will not be changed as a result.  I have been to the United States, Canada, Denmark, Holland, France, Italy and Britain and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and neither have I any desire to go there.  I shall leave that place to the Deputy and his friends.  From my experience of the countries I have mentioned, I would say that the Irish way of life is by far the best.  I would not like to see this way of life being surrendered for the riches and prosperity of the world. People in those countries would not so much as take time off for a chat.  If they want to telephone their friends, they do so after midnight because they would not find time to do so during the day.  All they are interested in is making money and, of course, as they work harder, the prospects for them of thrombosis is greatly increased.  A German who came to set up an industry in my constituency said to me that he could not understand why the Irish take a break of one hour for lunch when they spend only about 15 minutes eating and spend the remainder of the time chatting or smoking.  I told him that we do not believe in killing ourselves, that we have trade union regulations and that we do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  His point was that the 45 minutes spent in relaxation should have been used in production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in Denmark I saw children going to school outside Copenhagen at 6.45 a.m.  I hope that our children will never have to be aroused from their sleep at 6 a.m. and sent out on the road to fetch the school bus.  In Denmark, too, I saw people coming from work at 10 p.m.  It is not unusual for farmers there to rise at 5 a.m. and to work continuously until <Col N="659" /> 10 p.m.  That sort of life is not worth living.  The Bible tells us that we enjoy three score and ten years but many do not reach the age of 50.</P>
    <P>I hope that our Irish way of life will never be changed and that we will continue to find time to relax.  Some people may say it is this easy going way of life that has left us so backward but I would gladly leave the wealth and prosperity of the world to others so long as I could continue to enjoy our way.  I have seen children in Holland and Denmark on their way to school at a quarter to seven in the morning, winter and summer.  If we were to copy Denmark and Holland in this would life be worth living?  We will do our own day's work in accordance with our conscience and we will have a prospect of living longer than they do in various parts of Europe, the United States of America, Canada and elsewhere.  Within the EEC the influence of this country will help to bring our Irish way of life to Europe instead of our importing the European way of life here.  I hope that whoever sits in Brussels will not be backward in encouraging the Irish way of life in Europe.  If the Minister for Health could present here statistics for all these European countries, it would be shown that whatever else may be said about us&mdash;let us be undeveloped and poor&mdash; it is an indisputable fact that our people live longer than do their counterparts in most European countries and that despite the fact that we have probably the worst health services in Europe.  That is due to our Irish way of life.  Entry into Europe will not change it.</P>
    <P>Another reason why we should join the EEC is that, if Britain joins and we stay out, much of our present industrial exports to Britain will be destroyed.  Remember, 40,000 people depend directly on industrial exports for their living at the moment.  If Britain joined and we stayed out we would lose the best part of the British market for our meat and milk products and our farmers would be in an even worse position than they were during the economic war.  Thousands of them would be ruined.  Another reason we should join is that Ireland as <Col N="660" /> part of Europe will be a much more attractive proposition from the point of view of investment from America and from EEC countries.  Such investment would boost economic development here.  These are vital reasons why we should join.</P>
    <P>Again, if Ireland were outside the EEC and Britain were inside, the Border would become an international frontier between us and the rest of Europe.  On the other hand, within the EEC closer relationships are bound to develop between north and south because we will be part of the same European unit.  That will be a major step towards the unification of our country because we will be all one in Europe.  By joining we will play our part in bringing about a new organisation of society in Europe designed to make conflicts like those of the past impossible in the future.  Again, the effect will be to raise the living standards of all the peoples in the Community.  These are the reasons why I believe we should be within the EEC.  These are the reasons why we should play our part as a nation by joining Europe.</P>
    <P>There are those critics who say the Irish language will be killed the moment we join the EEC and that Irish culture, Irish music and Irish dancing will disappear.  For the record, so that I may be quoted, I assert here and now that the Irish language, the language of our forefathers, is our national language and always will be. Without our own language we would lose our identity as a nation.  To those who express fears for the language, I ask can they rejoice and congratulate themselves on the progress of the language under a native Government? It could not possibly be any worse under the EEC than it is at the present time.  The Irish language has always thrived on opposition and, if we enter Europe, there will be a real challenge. I am one of those who have faith in the language.  I speak it.  It is the only language spoken in my home.  I believe in it.  I believe there is a future for it. Not for me the white flag and the despair; not for me to say that learning Irish is a waste of time and that the language is finished.  It is finished only for those who want it to be <Col N="661" /> finished.  If the Irish people want their own language and are sufficiently nationalist, then the Irish language will and can survive.</P>
    <P>In the past the language has been used for different purposes, not all of them commendable.  Let us remember that the Irish language is our own nationally recognised language and the Irish man or woman who has no respect for the language and, knowing it, does not speak it, is not worth his or her salt and is unworthy to be described as an Irish man or woman.</P>
    <P>I believe that, when we go into Europe, it will be recognised that we have our national language.  If a challenge comes from Europe that challenge will be met in the same determined, patriotic way in which other challenges to our national heritage have been met in the past and will be met in the future.  I have no fears for the language within the Common Market but, if the Irish have no respect for it outside the Common Market, they will not have respect for it within the Common Market.  The challenge will be there from Europe and I believe, because of that challenge, the language will flourish.  That will be the natural evolution when we are faced with countries who identify themselves by their language.  Our national pride will be awakened and we will be only too glad to speak our own language.  It will become second nature to us to show the foreigner that we are as good as he is and that we too have a language of our own.  To all those critics who say that the Irish language will be finished when we go into Europe I say that the day we go into Europe will be the day on which we can stand up and say that we want to be identified as a nation by our own flag, our own language, our own independence.  The Irish language will most certainly be spoken, even on a more voluntary basis than it is now, the day we go into Europe.</P>
    <P>When we see the Germans, Norwegians, Italians, Danes, Dutch, French and British we will want to declare our independent identity.  The one way we can do it is to speak our language openly, courageously and determinedly.  We are not going to remain alongside Britain and say, <Col N="662" />&ldquo;What you say we say&rdquo;.  We are going to stand up with pride and delight and say, &ldquo;We have our own language; we are going to use it&rdquo;.  The day we enter Europe will be one of the best days for the future of the Irish language because we will be faced with a real challenge.  There will be a purpose in speaking it, a purpose in knowing it and a purpose in making our partners in Europe know that we have our own tongue and are prepared to speak it.  I have no fears for the language in Europe, but I have fears for the language if we remain as we are.</P>
    <P>There is a vast knowledge of Irish in every home today but I do not know why it is not spoken.  There is a certain fear that if we speak Irish ungrammatically someone will laugh at us, yet we do not mind people laughing when we speak ungrammatical English.  There is a certain amount of shyness and fear about speaking Irish. Let us hope that shyness and fear will disappear when we join the EEC.</P>
    <P>One issue which is likely to cause concern, and I say this without fear of contradiction, is the procedure under the Treaty of Rome where the Council of Ministers give directives. One such directive has been given in relation to fisheries, which I shall deal with in a few minutes, but before a directive is given by the Council of Ministers in connection with the purchase of Irish land by aliens, I want our representatives in Brussels to make it known to everyone in Europe that Ireland's application should stand on the fact that we want to negotiate complete exemption in relation to the purchase of land by foreigners.</P>
    <P>Citizens of every member country of the EEC will have what is known as free movement of employment.  There will also be a free movement for the establishment of businesses and the right of each member country to purchase land and property in member States.  I am afraid the Italians, the French, the Germans, the Dutch, the Danes, and the Norwegians will not understand our history.  In no country in Europe is there a history in connection with land such as there is in Ireland.  The land and the faith have <Col N="663" /> been closely linked.  Interference with the faith in Ireland will be a failure and interference with the land is also doomed to failure.  From the days of Parnell, Davitt, Dillon, John Mitchel and O'Brien the closest relationship has existed between the land of Ireland and the people of Ireland.  So much so that the first great Irish socialist, James Fintan Lalor, a County Laois man, preached and wrote, &ldquo;the soil of Ireland for the people of Ireland to have and to hold from God alone who gave it&rdquo;.  His words have been quoted by statesmen from that day to this.</P>
    <P>The love of the Irish for the land is similar to their love for the faith and the love of a father for his own family.  The Italians, the French, the Dutch, the Danes, the Germans and the Norwegians, do not understand the Irish way of life in relation to land. Even if foreigners are allowed under the Treaty of Rome to come here and buy land on equal terms with Irishmen, they will not be let do so.  There is not enough land in Ireland for farmers and farmers' sons who want it.  How are we going to allow land to pass into the hands of foreigners? Parnell, Davitt, Dillon, John Mitchel and O'Brien all made sacrifices in order that there could be Irish ownership of land.</P>
    <P>If foreigners, with fat cheque books, are able to come and buy the land on which we were born and reared the Irish will end up working as labourers for foreign landlords.  The Irish will be made slaves in their own land.  May I assure the Government that that will not work?  If the Government cannot explain to the Council of Ministers, that because of the traditional love for the land, Ireland must be exempt from this regulation, which is one of the conditions of entry, they should send for some of the Fine Gael Party who can explain it. It is all very well for the Government and the House to commit themselves to this regulation but we cannot change the way of life of our people and make them into slaves working for Europeans.</P>
    <P>Ireland has some of the best and cheapest land in Europe and <Col N="664" /> foreigners will be anxious to buy it. They will be unaware of the history of blood, sacrifice, determination, loss of life, imprisonment and of the self-pride of Irish landowners.  It is a source of pride to Irish landowners to look at the land they own and they give thanks for the efforts of their forefathers who ensured that the land of Ireland would be left to the Irish people.  I should hate to see the day when the land of Ireland would again be divided into large ranches owned by foreigners.  At the moment there are some 200,000 acres of land owned by foreigners.  If foreigners have the free right to come in and purchase land, the people of this country cannot compete with them.  We cannot get money from the banks or the credit corporation to purchase land and when foreigners come here with their enormous financial resources the Irish farmers cannot compete.</P>

      <P>Recently the Minister for Foreign Affairs met a deputation from the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  That council produced a resolution stating the following:</P>
      <P>We, the members of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, express our deep concern that in the event of this country joining the EEC all non-nationals should have the same right as Irish citizens to purchase agricultural land in this country.  Having regard to the fact that agriculture is our main industry and that great congestion exists among smallholders, we call on the Minister for External Affairs so that in the negotiations for this country's entry the special and unusual background of land history will be fully dealt with and that this country might be exempt from any regulations which would put non-nationals on the same standards for the purchase of Irish land as those of Irish farmers and Irish landowners.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs met the deputation in a courteous fashion and listened to everything they said. He said that the Council of Ministers gave a directive in relation to fisheries and I think he went as far as saying that it was slipped across in a hurry and that a directive was not given by the Council of Ministers in relation to the purchase of land by aliens.  I was present with the delegation when the Minister said this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deputation expressed anxiety that the same thing might happen in relation to land as had happened in regard to fisheries.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed that so far as Irish land was concerned he would ensure that before any decision was taken in this matter he would bear in mind the representations made to him by the <Col N="666" /> General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  He sympathised with the aims of the General Council and stated he would direct the attention of those responsible for the negotiations in Brussels to this matter.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make sure that the history of the land of Ireland is made known to all in order to ensure that what was done in the case of fisheries will not happen to our agricultural land.  We welcome foreign industrial investment and development.  It is much better that the Irish people should be engaged in employment as a result of foreign industrial development here than that they should work abroad for the same foreign interests.  However, there is a difference between industrial development and foreign ownership of agricultural land on a large scale.  The Irish landowners will not tolerate this. It is better that the Government should realise this so that it can be spelled out clearly that Ireland must be exempt from the free right of foreigners to compete against Irish landowners for the purchase of land.  The national and historic background must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to those who are opposed to Ireland's entry into the EEC and who fear that we are throwing aside our policy of neutrality.  During the 1939-1945 war we adopted a policy of neutrality.  It was believed by the people to be the correct policy and we were ready to take on any invader who dared to put a foot on Irish soil. Whether we acted fully in accordance with this policy history alone will tell, but nevertheless we had the name of being a neutral country.</P>
    <P>How neutral are we at this very moment?  How can we be neutral if we enter the EEC?  We are already a member of the United Nations Organisation. Neutrality in its purest state has been a thing of the past for the Republic for several years.  We cannot possibly remain neutral in changing circumstances and circumstances have changed because we have entered the United Nations.  To those who are foolish enough to think that membership of the EEC will interfere with our policy of neutrality, if there was ever such a thing as a policy of neutrality, <Col N="667" /> I say let us face facts.  We can only hope and trust that the peace which all peace-loving people desire will be achieved and that there will be no military conflict, no need to take one side or another.  We as a nation have decided on our policy in regard to neutrality.  We decided on that policy when we joined the UN.  We are now on the side of all peace-loving countries. Let us hope that in Europe we can play our part to bring about not alone a lasting peace in Europe but by our contribution to European peace generously contribute to world peace.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what can be called a great slip-up in relation to our fisheries <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EEC.  A directive from the Council of Ministers stole through and the result of this stealing through, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs calls it, is that the right to fish our territorial waters by member countries is a reality.  I agree that this directive affects Norway very seriously.  It will perhaps have the same repercussions in Norway as matters relating to agriculture would have in Ireland.  The time has come when some form of statement should be made to our fishermen whose livelihoods are in serious jeopardy as a result of foreign trawlers being given the right to fish what have always been regarded as our territorial waters.  We have had a different type of fisherman.  It is only in recent years that our fishermen have been encouraged to go well out to sea. Formerly they could not do this because they had not got the trawlers, the training or the equipment to go far out to sea.  They fished mainly around the Irish coast and at certain times of the year went as far as the French coast.</P>
    <P>The most courageous of all our fishermen are the fishermen from the Killybegs area and from the south west coast.  It has been established beyond doubt that the main bulk of the catches by all our fishermen was found within ten miles of the shore. Frequently the profitable shoals were found within our territorial waters by fishermen from Killybegs, Arklow, Galway, Ballycotton, Castletownbere, Schull, all round the Kerry coast and <Col N="668" /> up to Galway.  These men always fished where the profitable shoals were, convenient to their landing points.  For example, the Ballycotton fishermen have their own lobster ground convenient to Ballycotton and know where the profitable catches of lobsters are. They have their facilities available on shore and their market.  What will happen in the case of the Ballycotton lobster fishermen, the Dunmore East herring fishermen and the Killybegs fishermen?  I will say, in the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of fisheries, Deputy Fahey, that the most experienced and courageous fishermen in Europe are the Killybegs fishermen.  That was my experience many years ago when for a short time I was in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in charge of fisheries.  My opinion of these fishermen has not changed.  I feel sympathy for them and indeed I am agitated when I find that the livelihood of the Killybegs fishermen is in danger, like that of the lobster fishermen at Ballycotton and Schull and the herring fishermen at Dunmore East.  If they see that the foreign trawlers or lobster boats can come in to the edge of our coast with more modernised equipment, greater gear and more wealth behind them than our fishermen can ever hope to have, they could be discouraged.  Their earnings have never been sufficient to buy modern equipment such as the French and the Norwegians have. How can the Irish fisherman compete with them even in our own fishing grounds which are being invaded by foreign fishermen, our partners in friendship in the EEC?</P>
    <P>Something happened in Brussels when this was rushed through and the Irish Government did not know about it until afterwards.  Is not that a terrible commentary on our negotiating team? Is it possible that in Brussels there is such organisation with regard to EEC matters that a directive of this kind could be passed by the Council of Ministers without our knowledge? Ireland could not be represented on that Council yet.  That is why it is so important to become a member.  If we had been in the EEC before this directive was given the Irish point of view <Col N="669" /> would have been heard at the Council of Ministers.  Was an agenda circulated to accredited representatives from the EEC countries?  Was it known that such a directive was likely to be given by the Council and that it would endanger the livelihood of many Irish fishermen?  There should be sufficient safeguards for the following reasons: (1) regard should be had to the limited financial sources available for our fishermen who compete against the foreigners; (2) there is a lack of modern gear and boats; (3) there is lack of proper training for our fishermen as compared with European fishermen, and (4) very modern catching gear available to Europeans is not available to our fishermen.</P>
    <P>If any responsible negotiator knew that there was a directive of this kind to be given and that it would have a detrimental effect on the livelihood of our fishermen some positive action should have been taken.  Is it now too late to do anything?  Can this matter be reopened?  How can we get around this directive?  If this directive can be given, what is to stop the members of the EEC from rushing through a similar directive in relation to the purchase of Irish land by foreigners?  What is to stop them bringing in any regulation which might be detrimental to industry or agriculture?</P>
    <P>There was a headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 27th November, 1970 which worried me.  It probably worried Deputy Fahey also because he is paid to look after these people.  I have a real regard for the fishermen because I know of their skill and industry and how dangerous their lives are and how much they must depend on the weather, the currents, the movement of shoals and the position of lobster beds.  All these are uncertain. I became sympathetic to these men even though I represent an inland constituency.  In the article I referred to it is said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are they going to sacrifice the fishermen for the benefit of the farmers?&rdquo; The question was put to me by 40-year old Joe Boyle, skipper of &ldquo;Árd Croine&rdquo; on the pier of Killybegs as we discussed the prospect of the future of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> Raymond Smyth interviewed Joe Boyle and a man called Hegarty and a number of other fishermen.  The interview indicated the worries of the fishermen in relation to our entry into the EEC. Articles such as this direct attention to the serious plight of these people. There was a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 28th November, 1970 headed &ldquo;The Fishing Future&rdquo;, which read:</P>
    <P>It is hard to see why a country like ours should have to import fish and fish products to the tune of nearly £2,000,000 annually.  A lot still needs to be done in improving variety and distribution both in the home and foreign markets.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to see what our fishery prospects are in the EEC. I presume the Government have examined this matter in great detail but the net result of any steps which they have taken is that the foreign trawlers can undoubtedly fish right up to the coastline to the detriment of our fishermen.  The Europeans can dump fish here much cheaper than our fishermen can supply it.  Is it not true that there is a gloomy future facing this industry?  Are we not entitled to lament in advance their prospects on our entry into the EEC?  Our negotiating team should do something practical for our fishing industry and arrange compensation for our fishermen in order to compensate officially for the <i>faux pas</i> that has taken place and see that we shall get sufficient funds from the Community to ensure that their livelihood will not be affected and that they will be put on the same level in regard to modern boats and gear as European fishermen.  When the right of foreigners to fish in our territorial waters is recognised at least our fishermen should be put in a position to compete with the foreign trawlers that will be reaping the bountiful harvest of fish around our coasts.  I hope this will be done.  I am alarmed at the outcome of these negotiations so far as the fishing industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that we have contributed very generously to supplying the British housewife with <Col N="671" /> subsidised food at low prices and in this regard and in regard to levies and tariffs imposed by the British on our exports to them, I want to say that the only real agreement between ourselves and Britain was the 1948 Trade Agreement which put millions into the pockets of Irish farmers.  Whenever it suited the British they imposed levies against us.  Whenever it suited their economy they put themselves first, naturally: one could not expect them to put Ireland first but, as regards levies and tariffs, they showed no great consideration for us.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask one question which I hope will be answered: what will happen to our Army and Army equipment if we enter the EEC?  The Army at the moment has about the same number of officers as men.  It is very difficult to meet a member of the Defence Forces who is not an officer.  I do not know where the privates are; we never seem to meet them.  I drive by The Curragh frequently and I am often around Collins Barracks in Cork but every member of the Defence Forces we meet seems to be an officer. I am told our Army equipment does not compare with military equipment of other European countries.  What reorganisation will take place in the Army if we enter the EEC and what steps will be taken to see that we would have an Army which will not be merely for ceremonial purposes? Will it be used to make a serious contribution towards European defence and peace-keeping?  If we are to have an Army we should have an Army fully trained, well paid and equipped and trained in the use of the most modern military weapons.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to say what will happen in industry if industrialists bring foreign workers here where we have displaced skilled Irish workers.  We cannot close our eyes to this.  If we enter the EEC, an industrialist from any member country who decides to invest money in an industry here will be entitled to bring over skilled workers on the pretence that they will train Irish workers.  Will there be a limit to the number he can bring over? <Col N="672" /> I hope the trade union movement will not have its eyes closed to this&mdash;they never have.  One thing this country must thank God for is a trade union movement with the highest standards of integrity which is very much alert and alive to the interests of the workers.  Where would our workers be if it were not for the trade union movement?</P>
    <P>I wonder if the trade union movement has been called on by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to talks at Iveagh House with regard to this problem and if the Congress of Trade Unions have had any discussions on the number of foreign workers which a foreign industrialist may bring here to work in his own industry.  There is nothing to stop him from bringing as many as he likes but would it not be wise to make it known, having discussed the matter with the trade unions, that the number of skilled workers which any of these foreigners may bring over here will be limited because Irish workers are very quickly and easily trained?  They can adapt very quickly to practically every technique of an industrial process.  I have heard this from various industrialists. It would be quite wrong to allow foreign industrialists to bring in as many skilled operatives from abroad as they like.  That is why an effort should be made to ensure that Irish skilled workers will not be displaced in employment as a result of the arrival in this country of skilled industrial workers from abroad.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk from time to time about the Mansholt Plan.  I want to express my surprise that when Mr. Mansholt was in this country recently the Government did not avail of the opportunity to have a meeting arranged either in Leinster House or the Mansion House or elsewhere for Members of the Dáil and Seanad so that they would have the pleasure of querying Mr. Mansholt on the various aspects of his European plan for agriculture.  Apparently Mr. Mansholt visited a number of Irish farms and was impressed by what he saw.</P>
    <P>If the Mansholt Plan is to create larger farms at the expense of the disappearance of the smallest farms and <Col N="673" /> the small farmers we should be very careful.  During the emergency from 1939 to 1945 the small farmers were the backbone of this country.  They produced wheat, oats, beet and barley and kept the people supplied with food when a ship could not land in any of our ports.  The history of our small farmers could and should have been made known to Mr. Mansholt.  I do not know whether his idea is co-operative farming or whether he stands for the very large farm which would put the small farmer completely out of business. Perhaps Mr. Mansholt's plan is to have greater production and greater efficiency than we can have from the small farm units.  This may be all right for some of the large European countries but as a small country we must mould our agricultural policy to suit the conditions of our people with preference for our three branches of agriculture: milk, livestock and tillage.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mansholt has had most unfavourable European publicity.  He has been accused of planning to drive tens of thousands of farmers off the land. We in this country cannot accuse Mr. Mansholt of that.  We can only accuse him of being very familiar for many years past with Fianna Fáil policy. It has been the policy of Fianna Fáil to drive the small man off the land. There are fewer farmers working on the land today than there were 10 years ago.  Many small farmers have disappeared and Mr. Mansholt had no hand, act or part in it; it was Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Before I would readily condemn Mr. Mansholt's plan I would want to know more about it.  There are people either praising or condemning his ideas without being familiar with what he really has in mind.  I have read most of his speeches and the more I read of them the more mixed up I become.  When I hear people repeating what Mr. Mansholt is supposed to have said the more I wish I had been there to hear exactly what he did say.  However, when Mr. Mansholt arrived in this country some opportunity should have been given to the elected representatives of all parties in this House to discuss with him the serious implications for agriculture of Ireland's entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> Sometime last June the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery, spoke to the EEC on behalf of the Irish agricultural community.  He told us certain assurances were given in relation to various aspects of our agricultural policy, particularly in relation to foot and mouth disease, the Colorado beetle pest, the quarantine regulations, TB and brucellosis tests, sugar quotas and so on and that the Common Market would hope to establish certain standard procedures for all participants. We have not heard since whether any progress has been made in that regard.</P>
    <P>However, we do know that there is growing opposition in Britain and in this country to joining the EEC.  We also know that the New Zealanders are doing their best to discourage entry into the EEC, particularly by Britain and Ireland.  The French are terrified that Britain's entry will mean greater competition to French industry.  The New Zealanders believe that if Britain joins the EEC they will lose a big section of their agricultural exports and that countries like Ireland will gain.  We in Ireland should be able to understand the anxiety of the New Zealanders to wreck the Common Market prospects.  Maybe we would do the same thing if we were in similar circumstances.  New Zealand knows there is an excellent market in Britain and in European countries for what she produces and she is afraid for her future in these export markets.  We in Ireland would have a greater share of the exports that New Zealand and even our fellow applicant Denmark are putting into Britain at the moment, but we are not capable of supplying a greater share of what New Zealand or even Denmark is sending.  These questions are of primary importance to us and it is up to the Irish Government to look after them in every possible respect.  In this country, whether it is to any great extent I cannot say, there are two branches of agriculture which do not appear to have a rosy future under EEC policy&mdash;horticulture and sugar beet production.  I represent a constituency which is well known as a sugar beet producing area.  On 15th July, 1970, the <i>Evening Press</i> published an article dealing with sugar <Col N="675" /> problems in the EEC.  It stated that the Common Market Commission had turned down a Dutch request for a conference in Geneva in relation to sugar production.  It stated that Dr. Mansholt expressed the view that steps must be taken to reduce sugar production inside the Community.  There had been a sugar surplus of 900,000 tons the previous year and it had become necessary to cut down on future surpluses in the Six.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries should interest himself in our beet production, bearing in mind that we have got beet factories in Carlow, Thurles, Mallow and Tuam and that beet is a very profitable crop. I am particularly interested in this because the lands of Carlow, South Kildare, Laois and parts of Offaly are well known for the high standard of sugar beet they produce.  In the event of our EEC entry I do not know what those beet producing farmers will turn to. Will they have to switch from beet to grass?  What will become of the numerous workers in the four sugar beet factories?  In short, what will be the overall position of sugar production from beet in this country?</P>
    <P>I do not know if the NFA have had discussions on this subject with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. My constituents are vitally interested in this because one of the most progressive beet factories is in Carlow, on the borders of my constituency.  Am I to understand from Dr. Mansholt's comments that there is a very gloomy future facing beet growers in this country if we enter the EEC?  Before this forecast disaster takes place, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must have re-adaptation proposals for beet producing farms.  Will he tell us if it is proposed to cut down on the acreage under beet; if the production of sugar is to be slashed; what the EEC want in this respect?  I have not read anything in the newspapers on this problem and I have neither heard nor read a single utterance on it from any Minister. Beet producers have been a very hard-working section of the agricultural community and they are entitled to be told now whether the proposal <Col N="676" /> is to bolt and lock the doors of the four beet factories.  I hope to hear a statement on this from some Minister at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>We have only small exports of horticultural produce and we are told that in the context of EEC membership we will have to take the rough with the smooth in this respect.  Tomato imports, now controlled, will be open the whole year round.  In order to find a market abroad for Irish tomatoes we will have to depend on a sense of taste.  Irish tomatoes have a peculiar taste and this may favour them in European markets. However, we should be told what will be the position of Irish tomato producers. Apple producers here will have to face competition from France and I am afraid the future of this industry here is not rosy.</P>
    <P>One would expect to have more frequent reports from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to this whole exercise.  An EEC body has been drawn up of civil servants from the various countries to formulate a policy for the Council of Ministers to be finalised by the EEC Commission.  I cannot say whether Irish civil servants have contributed to this body.  I should think the organisation has been made up of civil servants from member countries.  I understand that among the aspects they are considering is a European dole for farmers.  This time, Fianna Fáil have headed Dr. Mansholt.  We are not opposed to this because if a small farmer has not fulltime employment on his land he must be given something to live on.  The only objection I have to it is that it is not enough.</P>
    <P>My information is that within the Six there is already a group of civil servants representative of each of the six countries and that they are already working out a suitable scheme for harmonising regulations for all member countries to provide dole for farmers.  It is not anything in the nature of assistance for farmers.  They use the good old Irish word &ldquo;dole&rdquo;.  I hope that it will be a generous contribution for the small farmers and that the big farmers will not need it.  All any farmer wants is fair prices and constant and regular markets for what he produces.  If the <Col N="677" /> farmer has these he is not interested in any form of dole.</P>
    <P>I understand the same committee of civil servants in Brussels are considering a universal rates policy for member countries.  I see the former Minister for Finance is contemplating the imposition of some form of additional tax on our farmers.  Our farmers have to pay the severest and heaviest form of taxation in rates which has now gone beyond their capacity to pay.  The bubble has now burst and they have reached the stage where they cannot pay the existing rates.</P>
    <P>Let us hear what relief there will be in the EEC for our farmers.  Will it be the same position as it is now?  Will it be worse or will it be better?  My information is that the six member countries are at present considering the aspect of taxation and rates in member countries and that they are also having a review of the position in countries who have applied for membership. Again, neither rates relief, tax relief nor income tax have been touched on as yet.  Therefore, let us take a look at this give-away.  If we are not entitled to membership of this committee let us make representations in the strongest form and explain that our rating system is imposing brutal hardship on our farming community and that as a result of the existing system based on valuation our rating system is a crushing blow to advancement and to progress.  Within the EEC it would not be possible to continue the-payment of rates as presently designed. Therefore, before any submission has been made by this group of civil servants drawn up from member countries let us make some inquiries about it, if we have not done so already.  Let us make known the heavy burden which rates are on production, both agricultural and industrial, in this country. Let us cash in on any benefits which are to be gained from membership of the EEC.  I say to those who are critical of our desire to join the EEC if we do not join we put up with present conditions which are becoming harder and tougher every year.  If we join we cannot be in any worse position than we are in at present.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I want to <Col N="678" /> touch on and that is the constitutional changes.  If we join the EEC certain changes must be made in our Constitution. I hope that what those changes mean will be spelled out loudly and clearly.  Let us not sacrifice something in our Constitution at the expense of getting into the EEC.  Changes can be made only by referendum.  When such a referendum takes place let the implications of the Constitutional changes to enable our entering into the EEC be precise and clear.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion in relation to Article 44 of the Constitution.  I cannot say whether reference has been made to this Article in relation to the Six Counties or in relation to our position in Europe.  I cannot see where Article 44 of the Constitution can affect us in relation to our application for membership of the EEC.  We should be extremely careful that whatever rights and privileges we have, particularly in relation to our national culture, traditions and heritage, should be safeguarded and protected.  I am sure whatever changes have to be made in the Constitution will be spelled out very clearly.</P>
    <P>A number of targets were set by the EEC but strange as it may seem very few of those targets have been met and achieved.  Let us ask ourselves one question: Is the EEC in relation to the Six who are at present members a success?  Is everything going well and smoothly?  Has it gone beyond the stage of teething pains and growing pains?</P>
    <P>If we review the results we see that very few of the aims and targets set out have been fully achieved.  For example, there is only one target which has been fully achieved and that was in relation to the abolition of an internal customs union and the creation of common external tariffs applied to nonmember imports.  The abolition of restriction on movement of workers and on the right to establish business anywhere in the Community has not met with 100 per cent success but only near success.  The elimination of quantitative restrictions on other non-tariff barriers to trade has met with only partial success.  In relation to the standardisation of national policies and <Col N="679" /> export assistance and establishment of common trade agreement with third countries, the action programme priority has been a failure; each of the members have separate treaties with third countries, such as Japan and Eastern Europe.  They have also failed to agree in regard to the adoption of uniform company law.  The adoption of measures to harmonise national energy policies has also had a measure of failure in regard to the action programme priority.  The adoption of common policies for transportation services so that road, rail and waterways are competing on equal footing throughout the area has also failed.</P>
    <P>Is it not appropriate for us, as applicants for membership, to point out to the Community that they should make an effort to put their own house in order?  The Community as they stand, with so many of their targets only half achieved, partly achieved, or failures, should make a serious effort to look again at these targets and try again to achieve them.  I wonder if it is really healthy to extend the Community.  Perhaps it is.  Perhaps it may be easier for the Community to rectify their failures when they are enlarged.  Perhaps the magnitude of the failures does not match the magnitude of the successes they have achieved.  However, the establishment of the EEC, its co-operation and unity, is good and sound and should be encouraged.  We have millions of people to be fed and we have tens of thousands of acres from which to feed them; we have millions to be clothed and we have tens of thousands of workers to produce the clothes; we have workers to be housed and we have millions of workers to provide the houses.  It is difficult to understand why this cannot be done in a more efficient and determined manner.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Community is a genuine effort to eliminate from modern society that great disgrace, poverty and distress.  Whatever else may be said about the powerful countries of Europe who are growing fatter and fatter from power and authority, prosperity and growth, there are poorer countries in which to the great shame of society there is still a vast amount of concealed poverty.  Let <Col N="680" /> us hope that the member States of the Community, with the three applicants for membership, will jointly play their part of the common good of Europe and for the good of each country within the Community.  I hope their target will be to raise the standard of living of all within the Community and that after a very short period, when there has been a division of European wealth, the weak and the small may prosper with the mighty and strong and that the mighty and strong will make an effort to eliminate distress and the disgrace of having in modern society so much hunger, hardship and poverty.  Perhaps the great step which Ireland is taking will be a step towards the removal of all the blotches caused by poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>May I say to those who are against our entry that they should be consoled with the thought that if we do not enter we do not stand to gain but we do stand to lose?  If we enter we cannot be any worse than we are now but we do stand to gain.  The Fine Gael Party and their Leader are putting the country and its future first in an effort to put agriculture back into its rightful place as the main industry in the country, to provide substantial facilities for all branches of the economy. We hope that this great decision will lead to an Ireland in which we will have food, work, clothing and shelter for all and emigration and poverty for none.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now almost nine months since the debate on this motion began and I believe that this debate should have been started again to allow Deputies to make their contributions again as so many things have happened in the intervening months, both inside the country and within the European Economic Community. Our thoughts have been diverted here on numerous occasions from the very important decision that has to be made within the coming months or years. We, in the Labour Party which is the smallest party in the House and the only party opposed to Common Market membership, should be given an opportunity of allowing our speakers to make their contribution once again on this very important issue.  I would ask <Col N="681" /> the Ceann Comhairle and the Whips to make available opportunities for more regular discussion of the Common Market issue.  Perhaps it could be debated here monthly or, at least, every two months during the coming year.  In that way, negotiations currently in progress could be debated.  This would result in both Members and the general public being kept aware of what is happening in Brussels in relation to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>There is at the present time throughout the country a movement aimed at selling the Common Market to the public, particularly to people in rural areas.  So far as I am aware, debates are being conducted in most rural constituencies which purport to give to people in rural areas an opportunity to discuss the problems of the EEC. Anybody who has listened to any of these debates will be aware that the speeches are repeated throughout the country.  One of the questions I would ask at this stage is, who is behind this movement?  Who is supporting it?  Who is pushing this salesmanship of the Common Market?  There is no doubt but that there is a concerted effort to sell the EEC to our rural population.</P>
      <P>This party is opposed to Ireland becoming a member of the EEC.  When a motion on the EEC was being debated here on the 23rd June, 1970, the Leader of this Party, Deputy Corish, said as reported at column 1672 of the Dáil Debates for that day:</P>
      <P>We oppose the concept of it because not alone are we republican but we are socialist as well.  As republicans we believe that if we have to accede to the conditions of the Treaty of Rome we will lose our sovereign, independent status and be dominated by a Brussels bureaucracy. We oppose it as socialists because we believe the EEC is anti-planning and is based on the principles of <i>laissez faire</i> and free competition. We have always said in this House&mdash;and this is not the least important&mdash;that there is little, if any, concern for the third world&mdash;the third world of underdeveloped and starving nations which are still being exploited by their former colonial masters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> This was the position of the Labour Party in June last and at our recent conference this same position was upheld unanimously by the delegates. Also, it was reiterated by our Leader in his address to the conference.</P>
    <P>During the past three hours or more, the previous speaker put forward many arguments why we should not join the Common Market.  He discussed every aspect of life in this country, social, commercial, industrial, political and religious and he pointed to problems which would arise in respect of all these aspects as a result of our joining the Community.  However, in conclusion he pointed out that it would be to the good of this country that we should join.  It might be wise to consider not only the position of the party to which the previous speaker belongs but, more important, to consider the position of our negotiating team in Brussels.</P>
    <P>In a document entitled <i>The Report on the Progress of Negotiations on Ireland's Application for Accession to the European Communities</i> which was circulated to us last month, a report on the opening statement of our negotiators is given at page 3 of the Appendix. We are told that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The negotiations were opened formally at a meeting in Luxembourg on 30th June, 1970, between the Community and the applicant countries.  In accordance with the decision taken at The Hague Summit, the Community stipulated at the outset that the negotiations were being opened on the basis that: (1) the applicant countries accept the Treaties of Rome and Paris and their political objectives, all the decisions that have been taken by the Community since the Treaties came into force&mdash; including decisions taken during the period of negotiations&mdash;and the choices made by the Community in the field of development.</P>
    <P>On that occasion, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said in his opening remarks that he reaffirmed as he had done at the meeting in Luxembourg on the 30th June between the Community and the applicant countries, <Col N="683" /> that the Irish Government accept the Treaties of Rome and Paris, their political objectives and the decisions taken in their implementation.  That is the position that has been adopted by our negotiating team.  All the Articles of the Treaty of Rome have been accepted by them.</P>
    <P>It is well to point out now that there can be no debate or no argument with the Community about the Articles of the Treaty of Rome.  We can only consult with the Community on our terms of entry.  This situation is very different from the belief held by some people that once we get in we can have the conditions changed to our liking and that the most important thing is to get in first and then do what we can.  This position has been made clear to us in this document which was circulated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  If he had not circulated it we could still have found it just as clearly put in another document called &ldquo;Commission on the European Community's Opinion concerning the Application for Membership of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and Norway&rdquo;.  It is set out in this quite clearly at page 5, paragraph 9.  It states that the accession of new members to the Communities implies the acceptance on their part not only of the treaties but also of the decisions which have been made since the treaties came into force: &ldquo;These decisions, which are the fruits of general hardwon compromise between the six founder states have become essential elements of the <i>de facto</i> solidarity which links the Six together and, from this angle, the very existence of the community. That is why as a general rule a solution to the concrete problems will have to be sought by working out transitional periods and not by amending the existing rules.&rdquo;  The rules will not be changed.  This publication states that quite clearly.  The word &ldquo;decisions&rdquo; is explained for us; it is used here in the general sense and does not refer to the character of the acts taken by the Community institutions.  It also covers the agreements concluded with nonmember countries.</P>
    <P>We have accepted the rules and they <Col N="684" /> cannot be changed.  We can only debate on the transitional period for industry and agriculture.  We have accepted certain guidelines.  In the case of industry and agriculture we have more or less agreed to a transitional period of five years to get ourselves ready to meet the competition which must inevitably come through membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>Entry was first mooted almost ten years ago and there was then great activity on the part of the Government to get our industry and our agriculture into a fit state of readiness to meet competition on entry.  At that time, too, it was just as forcefully said that we would become members of the European Economic Community, not alone be members of the Government party but be members of the Fine Gael Party as well.  The position has, I think, changed since this debate began here last June.  Last June, and before it, the question was if Britain joins do we join or can we stay outside.  If Britain joins we must join.  Now the question seems to be what will happen if Britain does not join; do we join or do we stay outside?  This is the question that will arise in the months ahead: what shall we do in the event of Britain not joining?</P>
    <P>It is wise to consider for a moment the reasons why Britain wants to join. Britain, like most of the Six, is an industrial country and the reasons for her wanting to join are pretty much the same reasons which led to the setting up of the Community in the first instance.  Britain is looking for a bigger market for her industrial production. Her empire is shrinking.  Many of the countries which constitute the EEC have suffered the same experience.  The Belgians have lost the Congo.  The French have lost the North African states.  The Italians have lost their colonial empire.  The Dutch have lost their East Indies possessions.  Britain has a great deal in common with the Six and her reasons for joining are completely different from our reasons for wanting to join.  The reasons were given in an article published by the Bow Group in the European Community monthly of March, 1970.</P>
    <P>It is in Britain's interests as well as <Col N="685" /> in the Six for Britain to participate in a tariff free industrial market of Europe and to co-operate to the fullest extent in European technological developments.</P>
    <P>They welcome the gradual unification of economic and monetary policies and urge the establishment of a European reserve currency.  They support new negotiations for a common European defence policy, work towards a common European foreign policy and promoting the cause of a directly elected European Parliament.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons stated by the Bow Group for Britain joining the Common Market.  How many of these could be applied to us?  We can see no advantage certainly in having a tariff free industrial market for Europe.  As a result of the reduction in tariffs following on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement we are beginning to feel the chill of competition.  A low tariff wall helped in the past to keep our small industries viable.  As a result of the removal of this wall industries now find themselves in a difficult position. The textile industry is feeling the cold air of British competition.  The boot and shoe industry is under heavy pressure.  In my constituency eight small factories have closed down in the last six months, three in Wicklow town, four in Arklow and one outside these two areas.  We certainly do not see any extension of industrial activity here as a result of our joining Europe, in which we will be on a level with the industrial giants of Europe and Britain.  That is one reason why this party sees justification in opposing our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>Opinion in Britain is changing from a pro-EEC stance to an anti-EEC stance.  The leaders of the two main political parties in Britain are in favour of joining the EEC but it is obvious to anybody looking at the reports in British newspapers and on television that many people are having second thoughts about entry.  As negotiations continue the numbers against joining the EEC are growing.  If Britain, because of the heavy commitment to the agricultural policy of the EEC countries, decides not to join then we will be in a strange and anomalous <Col N="686" /> position with regard to our application.</P>
    <P>When we first applied to join the EEC the thinking was that if Britain went in we must also go in.  This thinking was accepted by the Commission in Brussels.  They are on record as accepting the fact that the trading positions of three countries at present negotiating alongside Britain are so closely connected with Britain, that they must do exactly what she does. The Confederation of Irish Industries in their circular newsletter dated 9th March deal almost entirely with this prospect.  The opening paragraph states:</P>
    <P>The Common Market debate has shifted ground perceptibly in the last few weeks.  There are now clear indications that the Government, and the country, are considering European membership in broader terms than before.  Up to now, behind the rhetoric and the posturings which have characterised much of the debate, there has been a widespread acceptance of the view that if Britain joins the EEC, Ireland has little option but to do the same.</P>
    <P>Further on the newsletter states:</P>
    <P>The question &ldquo;Could Ireland remain outside the EEC if Britain goes in?&rdquo; is now being replaced by the question &ldquo;Could Ireland go into the EEC if Britain does not?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this new ball game, the old arguments are no longer relevant.</P>
    <P>We are debating here on the basis that Britain will certainly go in, but this is far from being the case.  A new position may emerge during the next few months, as the Confederation of Irish Industries suggest, and Britain may not after all pursue her application.</P>
    <P>The usual question put to the Labour Party is: what alternative course is there for Ireland?  It should have been the job of the Government to investigate the alternative courses open to us if we decided not to go in.  It has been said that we must go in because there are no countries in Europe outside the EEC.  This is far from the truth. Switzerland is surrounded by EEC countries and yet she is probably the <Col N="687" /> most prosperous country in Europe. She is in a sound financial position, even sounder than Germany.  She is able to lend money to Britatin and help her out of financal difficulties.  Sweden, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Finland and Iceland are not joining.  The position of Iceland is similar to our own in that she is an island although much more distant from the Continent than we are. She is, however, joined by bonds of history to Europe.  Finland, despite not being a member of the EEC, does a big trade with the Community.</P>
    <P>As these countries have decided not to apply for full membership, surely we should investigate why they find it more advantageous to stay outside it? The Government have not sufficiently investigated the possibilities which would accrue to us if we decided to stay outside the Community.  Either a trade agreement could be drawn up with the EEC or associate membership could be negotiated.</P>
    <P>It is argued that we have to join because we could no longer trade with the EEC countries and we would have to look for markets for our agricultural produce in Africa, America, South America and East European countries.  It is not true to say that if we did not join the EEC we would not have any trading agreements with the Community.  Associate membership could be negotiated.  In the opinion of the Labour Party this country stands to lose a great deal by entry into Europe.  We would lose the power to impose tariffs and quotas to protect our sensitive industries.  Reference is made to this in the document which was circulated to us last month in connection with our negotiations.  As I pointed out in my opening remarks, the rules are made for the Community and we can debate only our terms of entry. However, there is no doubt that the protection of our sensitive industries would have to cease at the end of the transition period&mdash;a period of five or six years has been suggested in this case.</P>
    <P>We would also lose the power to conclude trade agreements with other nations because the Community must have a voice in trading arrangements <Col N="688" /> between members and outside countries. This is one area of our sovereignty where we would suffer a loss. We would also be unable to grant State aid to attract industries into this country. In the booklet entitled <i>Membership of the European Communities: Implications for Ireland</i> dated April, 1970, there is a chapter dealing with this matter.  It is stated:</P>
    <P>State aids which distort or threaten to distort competition are, to the extent to which they adversely affect trade between member States, deemed to be incompatible with the Common Market.  The Commission, subject to the overriding authority of the Council, decides what aids can be allowed and which have to be eliminated or adapted.</P>
    <P>It can be seen that the regulations in this regard could be detrimental to this country.  Because of the policy of successive Governments, industries have been attracted here and they have brought a great measure of relief, particularly in rural areas.  The attraction of industry by means of State aid to the west and other depressed parts of the country&mdash;even to parts of my own county which are as depressed as the western areas&mdash;has brought prosperity to rural communities.  We will not be allowed to continue with this aid in the event of our entry into the EEC and in this sector we will be the losers.</P>
    <P>It was stated here this morning in cross-talk between the Tánaiste and Deputy O.J. Flanagan, when the latter was speaking about the sale of land to non-nationals, that this matter was covered in the regulations and that it could not happen.  I do not think this is true and I regard this as one of the danger areas if we join the EEC.</P>
    <P>Mention is made of this matter in the document I have already referred to and it bears out the fear expressed by Deputy Flanagan, who might be regarded as a pro-Marketeer.  As Deputy Flanagan stated, the difference in the price of land, even at present, in Ireland and on the continent is quite considerable.  Land is relatively cheap here compared with prices paid in European countries.  Irish landowners cannot afford to compete with the rich <Col N="689" /> industrialists of Europe for the purchase of land.  In this document there is a section dealing with the right of establishment in agricultural land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been quoting from this document on several occasions. It is a document which was circulated last month and is entitled <i>Report on the Progress of Negotiations on Ireland's Application for Accession to the European Communities</i> and I shall refer to this document again in the course of my speech.  It is stated in this publication:</P>
      <P>Under Irish legislation non-nationals who have lived in Ireland for less than seven years must obtain the consent of the Irish authorities to acquire more than two hectares of rural land for non-industrial purposes. This control is necessary in pursuance of the Government's policy of achieving equitable distribution of land and creating viable agricultural holdings.  The Irish Government are prepared to comply with the Community's directives which have already been adopted on the question of right of establishment in respect of agricultural land.  In relation to the possible extension of the right of establishment in this sector we will raise in the negotiations our need to maintain sufficient control over the disposal of land in Ireland. This is to enable us to pursue policies to deal with such structural problems as exist.</P>
      <P>If there is any question about the purchase of Irish land by non-nationals I hope that the negotiating team will pursue this most vigorously.  However, in the negotiations in another important sector&mdash;our fishing industry&mdash;the results have not been favourable and should our negotiators have the same lack of success on the question of land the result could be disastrous for our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile to point out to the House how the Community have treated the applicant countries on the question of fishing rights and the fishing <Col N="690" /> industry.  In October, 1970, the Six concluded an agreement between themselves in which they set out their principles in regard to the fishing industry. These principles must be accepted and adopted by us if we join the EEC.  The regulations for a common structural policy for the fishing industry provide that we must allow access up to our shores for vessels of member states. We are at present negotiating relief from this position.  These rules were made between The Six while negotiations were going on with this country, which has a lucrative and expanding fishing industry.  This industry shows signs of a bright future.  The regulations were drawn up so that they could not be questioned after the entry of other countries to the EEC.  Norway is a country with, perhaps, the biggest stake in the fishing industry in Europe and it is an applicant country.  The fact that this agreement was made without anyone from that country putting forward their policies or negotiating their position seems to be highhanded and an unfair act.  It is easy to see why the Community were anxious to have regulations made before the four applicant countries eventually entered it.  There is a deficit of fish requirements in EEC countries of about half a million tons, while in the applicant countries there is a fish surplus of approximately 700,000 tons. The rules were made before the applicant countries could discuss them. These decisions cannot be questioned.</P>
    <P>I have read in different documents that from the Community's point of view and from our point of view it has been accepted that the rules cannot be changed.  People in favour of the EEC have said in the Dáil and outside it that agriculture will boom as a result of our entry into the Community. This point has been made in every constituency.  The people are being told that entry will bring about a bonanza for Irish agriculture.  At present the Community operate a high food prices policy.  The agricultural policy is one of the major debating points at the present time.  It seems to be the point on which discussions between the Community and the British may break down.  We are primarily an agricultural country.  Sixty <Col N="691" /> per cent of our people are engaged directly or indirectly in agriculture. This bonanza is a welcome carrot to dangle before the eyes of the rural community.  It has not been pointed out to the public that there are vast surpluses of food in EEC countries which were built up in their own areas. There is a huge surplus of butter, 350,000 tons of skim milk, 8,000,000 tons of wheat and 2,000,000 of sugar. These surpluses are in the store-houses of Europe.  In the future an effort will be made to use up these supplies.  We could question the continuance of the high food prices policy if our country gained entry into the Community.  The livestock industry will flourish.  Beef, mutton and lamb and livestock will be worth £37,000,000 in exporting them to the Community alone.</P>
    <P>This represents a huge expansion.  It is questionable whether the bacon industry can compete on equal terms with the countries of the European Community.  The production of sugar beet, dairy products and wheat will be curtailed.  More people are employed producing these than in rearing beef or other livestock.  Commentators in favour of our entry are putting forward agriculture as the main reason why we should enter the Community.  It has been said that some countries are adopting a modified version of the Mansholt Plan.  This plan must be applied here if we enter.  At the end of 1968 when the terms of the plan became known to the farming communities throughout Europe there was an outcry by the farmers which ended up in cattle being driven up the steps of the Community building in Brussels.  The farmers there were enraged by some of the suggestions in that plan.  A modified version was then put forward by the Community.  Some suggestions of how this plan might operate were given in the European Community Monthly on the 8th of June, 1970.  On page 6 under the heading of &ldquo;Farm Modernisation&rdquo; it deals with part of the modified plan of Mansholt.</P>
    <P>It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Commission Vice-President Sicco Mansholt's basic premise was that <Col N="692" /> there were too many inefficient small-scale farmers in the Six.  He wanted to persuade them to leave the land.  His suggestion was to grant Community aid for modernisation only to the farmers assured of an adequate income.  This policy has been retained but the criterion has been made more flexible, partly it seems, in response to reaction from farmers themselves.  The revised proposals set a minimum level of gross output calculated after deduction of seed and feeding stuffs of 10,000 to 12,000 dollars a year per man given a maximum of 2,300 working hours a man a year.  The original plan set the following minimum standards for a viable farm: 200-300 acres for grain and roots; 40-60 cows for dairy farming; 100 to 200 head of cattle for beef and veal production; 100,000 chickens for a poultry producer and 10,000 laying hens for egg production.</P>
    <P>These were the minimum standards in the revised version of the Mansholt Plan.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that after allowing for seeds and feedstuffs the output per man should be in the region of 4,000 to 5,000 a year.  I am sure many farmers in Ireland would be delighted if that possibility were to come about by entering EEC.  We in this party would certainly have second thoughts about our opposition to entry if we thought this was even a remote possibility for Irish farmers.  But as we see it there can only be one or two ways in which this can be done and it is by driving thousands of farmers from the land.  This is, in fact, the only way it can be done&mdash;by a reduction in the number of people engaged in farming.</P>
    <P>This, perhaps, is possible in Europe. The six countries of the European Community are basically industrial countries.  They have vast industries throughout their countries; they could possibly accept the unemployed persons from agriculture when the revised plan is put into effect.  There has always been over employment in the last ten years in Germany.  Workers have been brought from Italy and elsewhere to make up the deficit in the numbers required for industry and one <Col N="693" /> can understand how and why this policy could work in relation to places like Germany, Holland and Belgium and even Britain, but it is ludicrous to think that we could see a reduction first in the number of farms to meet the conditions of this suggestion which would require the number to fall from 283,000 to almost 36,000, and a drop in the number engaged in agriculture from approximately 300,000 at present to 45,000, if we are to believe that the income levels proposed are to be reached in a country like this.  A reduction in five or ten years of almost 250,000 people in agriculture would be disastrous for this nation.  It is something that could not be accepted by our people and&mdash;perhaps in this debate&mdash; what is meant by the application of this modified Mansholt Plan to agriculture must be explained.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the plan which I might mention here is that there is not a need for additional agricultural land in the Community.  There is a move to limit the total farmland and, quoting again from the &ldquo;European Community&rdquo; of June, 1970, it is stated under the heading, &ldquo;Mansholt Plan Modified&rdquo; on Page 6:</P>
    <P>The Commission considers that equilibrium cannot be re-established on the agricultural market unless the area of cultivated land is reduced. Reclamation of new farmland from the sea and elsewhere would be banned and the clearance of land for farming discouraged.  All new reclamation schemes would have to be notified to the Commission.  There would be incentives for turning farmland over to woodland and recreation.</P>
    <P>I wonder are these points being laboured by pro-Marketeers throughout the country when they are putting forward reasons why we should join the EEC.  In past years many thousands of acres of land were reclaimed.  Credit can be given to the first inter-Party Government for putting forward a very energetic scheme for land reclamation. We now find that if we go into the EEC we have been doing the wrong thing; we should have let this land go back into bog or whatever it was originally.  I <Col N="694" /> cannot see how we could accept conditions like these if we join the EEC. I do not think the public, when they become aware of it, will accept these conditions.  It is only right that the Government should make the public aware that plans like this are suggested for members of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>I have quoted from journals produced by the Community to back up what I have said.  I have mentioned that this has been suggested by people who, in their own way, are trying to create an argument and debate about the EEC in this country.  People like Anthony Coughlan and Raymond Crotty are to be complimented on their efforts in putting forward arguments and creating a debate about the EEC. Too many people have been accepting the inevitability of our entry into Europe and have been welcoming that entry without spelling out what it will mean for every section of the country.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned agriculture and I have said it is the area that is being held up to people in rural Ireland as being the main reason for our going into the Community.  If we look at the other area of employment, the industrial sector, we can only be pessimistic if we investigate the effects of entry into Europe.  I mentioned earlier that the reduction of tariff walls in a short period of years, by the end of the seventies, will mean that our industries will be on a par commercially with the giants of Europe and Britain, should Britain enter.  As I have said, the effects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement which are beginning to be felt in industry throughout the country leave us a little more sceptical about our industrial survival in Europe.</P>
    <P>That agreement was opposed by this party&mdash;we were the only party to vote against it&mdash;and the stand taken by this party was proved right and is being proved right with each successive month.  In my own constituency in the last six months eight small industries have closed with a loss of between 200 and 250 jobs.  I can supply the names of these industries if they are required, and I shall certainly supply them to the Minister for Industry and <Col N="695" /> Commerce when the debate on his Estimate takes place.</P>
    <P>We are told that certain industries will prosper and have a future in Europe.  We would have expected that the industries which are connected with agriculture would be the ones to survive best in an enlarged Community. Already what appeared to be the strongest industry in this country, the Guinness Group, have been talking about rationalising their production here.  A figure of 500 redundancies in the coming months has been mentioned and indeed the setting up of a separate brewery in Liverpool to meet the needs of the British drinking public is a very strong possibility.  Everyone in this country must now be worried about other industries when such a strong firm as Guinness begin to feel the draught and are making provision for entry into Europe.  I certainly do not think that on the basis of an expansion of our industrial production we can hope to see our prospects improve in an enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>To go back again to the document, the Report on the Progress of Negotiations on Ireland's Application to the European Communities, the negotiators have been discussing the effects of entry on the commercial life of the country.  One aspect in which I was particularly interested was the free movement of workers which is dealt with on page 10 of the Appendix.  It says there:</P>
    <P>We accept the principle of free movement of workers within the enlarged Community.  We would propose that the transitional period for the implementation by Ireland of the Community provisions in this regard should be of the same duration as that to be agreed for trade.</P>
    <P>If the Mansholt Plan is applied and if tariff walls are removed in respect of our industry and that of Britain and the Community we will certainly see mobility of labour and the title &ldquo;mobility of labour&rdquo; will be substituted for that of emigration.  It is a euphemism for emigration.  It is a policy for emigration to the industrial sectors of Europe, Germany, France and so on. We have already seen this operate <Col N="696" /> from the poorer parts of Italy to Germany and I believe our entry into Europe will see it repeated with workers from this country to Europe. It is a prospect that nobody wants to see realised but it is, nevertheless, a possibility and one that requires discussion; it also requires a certain amount of investigation by the Government.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned that the trade union movement had been ignored by the Government in their dealings with the application for entry into Europe, and I believe this is so.  I am a member of the largest trade union in this country and I am a branch secretary of that union.  I know of no initiative that has been made by the Government to bring spokesmen from that union in on discussions about the possibility of redundancy or loss of employment through entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>I deplore that the trade union movement has been ignored in this fashion, because the movement accounts for something like 200,000 industrial workers.  If people's jobs are at stake then surely the spokesmen for those workers should be the first people to be consulted about the possible effects of entry into Europe?  I would hope that even at this late stage of our negotiation the trade union movement would be consulted and be brought in on discussions.  It is ridiculous that a negotiating team which travels from this country to Europe has no representatives of the workers on it to discuss the future of thousands and thousands of the workers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be only fair to all sections of the community that the views of labour leaders should be brought to bear on these negotiations. The agricultural sector have been most vocal about the benefit which will accrue to them.  In listening to debates in the rural parts of my constituency I have noticed very little advertence to the effect of entry into Europe on the industrial sector of our community, and I would hope that this deficiency will be remedied and that at future debates throughout the country all aspects, and not only those of agriculture, fisheries and industry will be considered. <Col N="697" /> I hope, too, that the social implications of membership as well as our sovereignty will be considered.</P>

      <P>This question was discussed at considerable length on the occasion of the passage through the House of the Health Bill.  The new health boards have members from their own staffs.  These include county medical officers, surgeons, psychiatric nurses, nurses serving in health board hospitals and doctors serving as dispensary medical officers.  It would be almost impossible to have the professional element of the board if they were excluded but certain types of officers such as programme managers are being excluded under the regulations to be made in accordance with the Health Act.  We will have to see how it works.  My belief is that it should work very well and satisfactorily but obviously this is a matter which must be watched during the course of events of the next five or ten years.

Of course, the basis of it is that they will all act collectively, that a nurse should give her nursing experience in discussions at board meetings where community services are involved.  At the same time, she would act in a collective capacity.  Similarly in the case of doctors, medical officers and other members of the board.  So far as I know, this is working very well.</P>

    <P>Grants for festivals are made from Bord Fáilte's annual grant-in-aid for administration, promotional and marketing activities.  The grants are made at the discretion of the board in the light of funds available, the value of particular events to tourism and the <Col N="701" /> number of competing projects for grant assistance.  I am informed by the board that there has been no change in their criteria in relation to financial support for festivals and that grants have been paid to Waterford International Festival of Light Opera and the Cork Film Festival in the current financial year.  The board will not be able to finalise their budget for 1971-72 until their grant-in-aid has been settled.  This allocation will be fixed very shortly.  When notifying them of the allocation, I propose to draw their attention to the desirability of continuing support for festivals.</P>

The special marketing campaign which is being undertaken by Bord Fáilte is expected to cost £395,000.  Of this amount £200,000 will be met by the transfer of unused interest grant moneys provided in the Vote for my <Col N="704" /> Department for the current financial year.

The most recent occasion was 3rd February when the Minister informed me he was about to introduce a supplementary estimate.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Taoiseach has transmitted to me for consideration representations which he received from the Cork Branch of the Association of Widows in Ireland containing an outline of proposals relating to the establishment of a compulsory pension scheme to cover widows and orphans and requesting certain improvements in the existing scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions applicable in the case of survivors of persons who had not been in insurable employment.  I have also received, through the Minister for Local Government, a copy of the same representations from the Galway Branch of the Association of Widows.  These representations are being considered in my Department and I will reply to them shortly.  In the meantime may I remind the Deputy that there is already in <Col N="706" /> existence, in addition to the non-contributory widow's and orphans' pension scheme, which is of general application but subject to a means test, a scheme of compulsory social insurance which provides for widows' and orphans' pensions? This scheme, which is, of course, State guaranteed and financed by contributions from employers, employees and the State, applies to all employees engaged under a contract of service whose remuneration does not exceed £1,200 a year, as well as to employees in higher remuneration brackets who have opted to continue in insurance on a voluntarly basis.  As I stated recently in reply to a Dáil question on the subject, there are proposals before the Government at the moment in regard to raising the remuneration limit and, indeed, as I indicated at the time, I hope to be in a position to abolish it altogether in due course, thus providing compulsory social insurance cover for, <i>inter alia,</i> widows' and orphans' pensions for all persons employed under a contract of service.</P>
    <P>May I also remind the Deputy that, as I have so often pointed out in the past, both the contributory and the non-contributory scheme of widow's and orphan's pension are under constant review with a view to effecting such improvements in them from time to time as may be practicable and feasible within the means available?  In particular, I would point out that apart from general improvements in these schemes in relation to their coverage, application or the considerations under which they are available increases in the rates of widows' contributory and non-contributory pensions have over the past 11 years far exceeded the increase in the cost of living.  For example, a widow with two qualified children in receipt of a contributory pension in 1959 received £2.3 weekly. Today such a widow receives £6.3, while the cost of living rose by only 67 per cent over the same period. Widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions have done even better: such a widow with two qualified children in 1959 received £1.92½ while today she would receive £5.75, an increase of almost 200 per cent.  Other important improvements in the existing schemes of widow's and orphan's pension, to <Col N="707" /> mention but a few, have been the increase of the age limit for qualified children to 18 years or to 21 years if still attending school or university, substantial liberalisation of the means test in the case of non-contributory pensions, especially on the basis of assessing the annual value of capital and in the amount of earnings which may be disregarded as means in the case of a widow with children.  Moreover, almost seven years ago the minimum age of entitlement to a non-contributory widow's pension in the case of a widow with no children was abolished&mdash;there never was such a limit in the case of contributory widows' pensions.  This compares more than favourably with the position in Great Britain and Northern Ireland where a minimum age of 50 years applicable in such cases even in respect of contributory pensions is only now being reduced to 40 years, effective from 1st April next.  Such a minimum age limit in relation to contributory widows' pensions is common practice on the Continent of Europe also.</P>
    <P>I may mention too that of the 62,500 widows in the State who are 70 years of age or over, some 48,250 are in receipt of pensions from my Department, either old age pensions or contributory widow's pensions and all of these are eligible for free travel and, subject to prescribed conditions, for free electricity and free wireless or television licences.  And here I must say that I do not accept the statement in the Deputy's third question that pensions paid to widows in Limerick, which are at the same rate as those paid elsewhere, are completely inadequate, nor can I accept the inference in the question that the position of widows in Limerick is such as to call for some special action on their behalf to the exclusion of all other widows or necessitous individuals or families in the State.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will find a fuller account in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, with which I am sure he is familiar, of the improvements which have been effected in the various income maintenance services, and in the widows' pensions schemes in particular, in the State between 1958 <Col N="708" /> and 1968, and he will be able to refresh his memory on the further substantial improvements which were effected in 1969 and 1970 in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts of those years.</P>
    <P>He will also find in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development the clearly declared aim of the Government to continue to devote an increasing proportion of growing national resources to the extension and improvement of the income maintenance services until they can be regarded as adequate in the light of costs and standards of living in this country and the levels set by international practice and ratified in international instruments.  As heretofore, the improvement in these services will be achieved by increasing the rates of social assistance and social insurance payments, by changes in the coverage and application of the services and, where appropriate, by introducing new services.</P>
    <P>In the allocation of national resources to social welfare services the Government will strive to maintain an equitable balance between different classes &mdash;urban and rural, industrial and agricultural, employees and self-employed. As far as possible services will be financed by methods of insurance so that benefits may be granted without test of need or means.  Where such tests are necessary&mdash;as they are in some schemes so as to avoid wasteful dispersal of resources and unnecessary burdens on the Exchequer and on the economy&mdash;they will continue to be liberalised as far as possible.  In this field the Government have, of course, no desire&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Finally, may I point out that my Department have for some time past been engaged in a detailed examination of all aspects of the social insurance and social assistance schemes with a view to determining the further reforms and improvements which might be made?  As a result, new schemes of invalidity and retirement pension and a scheme to assist deserted wives and families were introduced last October and a scheme of payment of death grants in respect of insured persons and their dependants will become operative towards the end of this month.  Work is in hand at present on, amongst other matters, the preparation of schemes of pay-related unemployment and disability benefit and I am afraid that pay-related pensions must wait until these schemes are soundly established.</P>

      <P>Indeed, an even more urgent task may well be the extension of the existing compulsory insurance scheme and the introduction of compulsory or voluntary insurance for the self-employed or for particular classes of self-employed, including farmers, who are not provided with such cover at present and who cannot, therefore, avail themselves of social insurance schemes to provide against sickness, old age, or for widows' and orphans' pensions.  In this connection, I hasten to add that the introduction of compulsory or voluntary insurance <Col N="710" /> schemes to meet the needs of the self-employed poses many difficult problems in relation to finance and administration and I do not see any ready or quick solutions.

If he says that there is free electricity for widows he knows nothing whatever about the subject because free electricity is limited to 100 units.  There is no such thing as free electricity for widows.</P>

The statistics will include information as to the amount issued in loans to each county.  The statistics will not, however, be processed until the results for the whole financial year ending on 30th April next are available.

A loans scheme on the same means basis as the higher education grants scheme is, however, available to trainee teachers so that no candidate is excluded from training by reason of his parents' inability to pay the fee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the letter <Col N="717" /> dated 16th August, 1968, sent to the Kerry Vocational Education Committee expressing concern at the inadequacy of the existing post-primary facilities in the North Kerry/North-West Limerick area and indicating that it had been decided that the best way to cater fully for this area would be by the establishment of a State comprehensive school in Tarbert which would serve the catchment areas of Tarbert and Glin as well as part of the Ballylongford area, he will now explain the reason for not erecting the school at Tarbert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, aware of the letter referred to by the Deputy.  Strong objections were, however, made by the people of Glin to the location of the school in Tarbert.  As the school is intended to cater for the Glin area as well as for Tarbert and part of the Ballylongford area, the Deputy will appreciate the desirability of trying to secure local agreement in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In August, 1968, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Lenihan, sent a letter to the Kerry Vocational Education Committee, who at the time had proposals to establish a vocational school at Ballylongford, advising them in the best interests of post-primary education to accept the Department of Education's direction and build a State comprehensive school at Tarbert.  The committee has since been working on that instruction from the Department.  I cannot understand why the Minister and his officials have changed their minds.  It was not at the behest of the committee that the school was to be built at Tarbert.  It was on the direction of the Minister's officials that the committee should drop the idea of building a vocational school at Ballylongford and instead erect a comprehensive school at Tarbert to cater for the catchment areas of Tarbert, Glin and part of Ballylongford. It appears that Ministers of State can change their minds overnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out to the Deputy that I am aware of this letter.  I also pointed out to him last week, when I replied to a <Col N="718" /> question on the same subject, that the money available to me for the building of comprehensive schools is limited.  I have no problem in spending the amount of money that is available.  I am making the money available in areas where agreement has been reached.  I said on the last occasion it would be very much to the advantage of the educational situation in that area if agreement could be reached. In so far as it is possible every effort should be made to reach agreement as to where the school should be situated. As I have pointed out to the Deputy, if agreement is not reached I shall have to make my own decision on it.</P>

We have other places where there are two areas concerned and where each one wants the school in its own particular area.  I have pointed out that as the amount of money I have is limited I will spend it in the areas where agreement has been reached.  I accept that a decision must be made in relation to the situation of this particular school and I may have to make that decision eventually.  Nevertheless I consider that in the interests of the education of children in the area, agreement should be reached.  I am sure it should not be impossible to reach agreement in the best interests of the children.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.  I am aware that 50 workers employed by this company were laid off on 5th March, 1971, and that the remaining 62 workers are under a week's notice since March 4th.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries and am informed that the decision to close arose from the necessity to re-equip the factory to produce the type of yarn now in demand in the company's export markets.  I am also informed that although the new machinery to be installed cannot be provided until towards the end of this year it would not be possible, in the meantime, to continue operations at the factory in the existing circumstances because it would not be economic.  There is no prospect of reopening the factory until such time as the new machinery has been proved commercially.  Indeed, I understand that the decision to purchase the new equipment depends on the outcome of current tests to prove its commercial viability.</P>

These will more than compensate for any loss of employment in the factory now being discussed.  I realise that this is a disappointment to Deputies opposite but it is a fact that Limerick and the Shannon Industrial Estate are immensely successful.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the scheme of supplementary housing grants which are payable by local authorities is to help persons of modest means to provide their own houses as an alternative to seeking subsidised housing accommodation from the local authority.  About 90 per cent of farmers are eligible for supplementary grants under the existing rateable valuation limit of £60.  I do not consider that an extension of the scheme to include some farmers with valuations in excess of £60 is warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be only fair to put the farmers in the same position as the non-farmers with regard to the grants? A valuation of £60 is equated to £1,200 per annum income.  That income is exceeded where there are dependants. Would the Minister not allow a similar excess in the case of farmers?  It is unfair that farmers with a valuation of £62 or £63 do not get grants.  A household can have an income of up to £1,500 and still get a grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

It is only the farmers with high valuations of over £60 which the Deputy wishes to have included.  I do not think it is warranted.  The scheme of supplementary grants is available to persons of modest means to enable them to build houses.</P>

    <Title>Membership of EEC: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Taoiseach on 23rd June, 1970:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the White Paper entitled <i>Membership of the European Communities: Implications for Ireland.</i></P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To add at the end of the motion: &ldquo;and urges the Government to ensure that the terms of membership to be negotiated adequately safeguard the interests of the people of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Cosgrave)</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the mobility of labour inside the proposed enlarged EEC Community and I suggested that, perhaps, the term was a euphemism for emigration as we have known it in the past 50 years.  The application of the Mansholt policy to Ireland will undoubtedly create vast unemployment in rural areas and the removal of tariffs protecting industry will also have grave effects on industry and may close down several small companies and industries which will result in further emigration.  The <Col N="733" /> mobility of labour would have great significance in that respect.  It would mean that Irish farm or industrial workers, apparently, would be looked after in countries like Germany, France, Belgium and Britain.</P>
      <P>Mobility of labour in the opposite direction is difficult to imagine except, perhaps, in the case of industries set up here such as industry connected with the off-loading of fish from foreign trawlers which will result.  I believe, from the EEC fisheries policy.  In that case it is likely that countries setting up factories here will bring over staffs and that key positions will undoubtedly go to these foreigners.  I already suggested that the trade union movement should be invited to further discussions about the possibility of further redundancy in industry and the likelihood of redundancy as a result of our entry into the EEC if that comes about.  I want to appeal again to the Minister and the Government to get in the experts from the trade union movement who have been dealing with these problems so that when the negotiating team go to Brussels they will have expert advice and, if necessary, will have expert personnel with them to handle these problems.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Flanagan was speaking it was suggested that there would be no defence commitments involved in our entry to the EEC and that our neutrality as we have known it in the past 50 years and during the last world war will remain irrespective of what happens inside the Community.  This is not borne out, in fact, by questions asked in the Dáil last year.  In answer to one question the Minister for External affairs as he then was, Dr. Hillery, said on 14th May, 1970:</P>
      <P>Full participation would involve full obligations.  We would have to act closely in political as well as economic affairs and would have to participate in common action, even the defence of the new Europe.  It would be as ridiculous for us as members of the EEC to forsake the defence of the new Europe as it would be to forsake the defence of our own country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This commitment, even before serious negotiations had got under way, clearly <Col N="734" /> implies that we are prepared to accept defence commitments in the EEC. On another occasion the Taoiseach on television said:</P>
    <P>If the group&mdash;</P>
    <P>meaning the EEC&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;was attacked I do not think we could opt out of our obligation to defend it.  It is not a question of neutrality but of meeting your obligations within a complex of that nature.  Neutrality in the context of the EEC would not be the old conception of neutrality at all.</P>
    <P>There the Taoiseach was clearly accepting responsibility for the defence of the enlarged EEC.  As I said earlier, the Tánaiste would not accept that entry to the EEC would mean a military commitment.  We know from history that the countries which at present constitute the EEC include some of the most belligerent nations in the world.  Their history even in this century leads one to believe that, perhaps, we could be involved with the nations that would, in the pursuance of their policies, run into trouble with other nations both to the east and even to the west of them.  At present in the EEC there is no great need for a separate defence force.  American troops under NATO are at present defending the borders of Western Germany and France and have up to 600,000 combat troops stationed in Europe.  In the European Community monthly journal for April, 1970 this is stated clearly:</P>
    <P>NATO (including the Americans) has 600,000 combat and direct support troops in peacetime on its central and north European fronts while the Warsaw Pact musters 925,000 (of which 600,000 are Soviet).</P>
    <P>At the moment with these troops present in Europe there is no need for a separate defence force.  The Americans are carrying the defence commitment. With the enlargement of the Community it is to be expected that the Americans will be losing interest in the defence of Europe and will feel obliged to hand over to the enlarged Community.  If 300,000 of those troops are removed from Europe they will have to be replaced as is suggested by <Col N="735" /> certain people in the American Congress, and in that event naturally forces will have to be raised in the countries of the EEC.  This is also mentioned in the same article dealing with the defence of Europe.  It says:</P>
    <P>If the security balance were placed in doubt in the 1970s, Western Europe's sense of potential military inferiority to the Soviet Union could again lead governments to look nervously over their shoulders to Moscow when taking major decisions.  Perhaps this anxiety could even push them to integrate their present inadequate defence policies.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly a defence commitment is a possibility and it would be foolish for anybody in this House or elsewhere not to face that possibility.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the democracy or the lack of democracy in the institutions of the Community.  At present none of the ruling bodies in the Community is elected by direct suffrage to any Parliament.  One of the bodies which run the affairs of the Community is the Commission, which is the executive and the Civil Service, and it is composed of nine members. They make the day-to-day decisions for the Community and could make decisions which would affect the affairs of this country if we were a member of it.  For example, they could decide whether State aid should go to a particular industry or not.  Another of the ruling bodies of the Community is the Council of Ministers and this comprises the Ministers from each of the member nations as well as other members.  Germany has four members on the Council; Italy has four; France has four, Belgium has two, Holland has two and Luxembourg has one.  It is suggested that after the accession of the four applicant countries the proportions will be changed: Germany, France, Italy and Britain would be on the same footing with ten members each in the Council; Belgium and Holland would have five, Ireland, Denmark and Norway would have three each; and Luxembourg would have two.  This would mean our influence in that Council would be to the extent of <Col N="736" /> three members out of a total of 61, and unless we got into a balancing position our voice would be very small indeed.  The other body that rules the Community is the Parliament and the representation is as follows: Germany, France and Italy have 36 each; Holland and Belgium have 14 members each; and Luxembourg has six members.  This body meets only once a year and the decisions are taken then.</P>
    <P>As yet there is no commitment under the Treaty of Rome to have direct elections to any of these bodies.  There is no stipulation in the Treaty of Rome that an election has to take place within a certain time.  There is a suggestion that, in future, election to the council or to one of the bodies will be by direct vote of the people.  It is to be hoped that if Ireland does enter the Community it will be one of our first objectives to see that this Community would be democratised by having direct vote for election to its ruling bodies.</P>
    <P>I hope that the two parties in the House who are committed to entering Europe will give some thought to the problems I have mentioned, particularly those in connection with agriculture in many spheres of which there are great problems.  It is not enough to say that our cattle and beef markets will be enlarged.  There are all the difficulties of implementing the Mansholt Plan which will require a great deal of intense study before any final decision is made.</P>
    <P>With regard to sovereignty, which is probably the most important point I would conclude by reminding the House of two lines of the Proclamation which read:</P>
    <P>We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies to be sovereign and indefeasible.</P>
    <P>I hope that our negotiators will have this uppermost in their minds when they are discussing Ireland's position in the enlarged Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should mention straightaway that I do not propose to deal in general with the matter of <Col N="737" /> Ireland's application to the European Economic Community or, indeed, in any way to attempt to copy the example of my namesake who succeeded in keeping this House for something like five hours while he discoursed on everything relevant and irrelevant to this country's situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC.  I intend instead to deal with a matter of concern to me as Minister for Lands, of concern to the Members of this House, and of concern to the public, which is the right of establishment in land which is provided for in the terms of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>When he was dealing with this matter, Deputy Oliver Flanagan had something to say about the peculiar history of our country in regard to its land but he went on to say that love of their land and of their families is something foreign to the Dutch, the Danes, the French and the Germans. How ridiculous can a debate of this nature become?  Has the Deputy never heard of the shattered corpses around Bapaume?  Has he never visited Notre Dame de-Lorette in France and seen there the bones of countless thousands of people mingled with the soil of France?  Does he not know of the passionate love of their land which the French have just as much as we have? By what right does he say that Germans, Dutch, French and other European peoples do not have the same love of their soil as we have for ours and for that matter, the same love of family as we have?  Of course they have. He seems to forget that twice in a mere 30 years this century these countries were involved in a conflict during which their soil as well as their nationhood was at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not take away the fact that our situation is, in many respects, different from that of any other country in Europe and, certainly, it does not minimise the fact that we as a people have particular reasons for concern in regard to the rights of other than Irishmen to our land.  I wish to assure him as I would assure Deputy Kavanagh, of the particular concern of the Government and their spokesmen in regard to this matter.  It is not necessary in so far as Members of this House are concerned, to detail <Col N="738" /> the history of the situation in this country in regard to the acquisition of land by foreigners but, perhaps, for the benefit of those who are outside the House and who may not be familiar with our history in this respect, I should detain the House for a few moments in sketching briefly what has happened here during the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, prior to the second World War and, indeed, during that war, there was no restriction of any kind on the acquisition of land here by foreigners.  However, after the war years when there were increasing purchases of land by non-nationals, there was strong opposition of this, particularly from the owners of small, uneconomic holdings who had been looking forward&mdash;some of them for a very long time&mdash;to the acquisition and subsequent division of these lands by the Land Commission. This opposition was heightened by the fact that the supply of land in this country was never equal to the demand. I should like to stress for the benefit of those people inside or outside the country who may not so know, that this still is the position.</P>
    <P>However, another factor which affected the situation was that fewer larger estates were coming into the possession of the Land Commission if only because they had been acquiring them progressively during the years and they were, therefore, finding it more difficult to obtain land for structural reform purposes.  As Deputies will recall it was in 1947 that the Finance Act provided for the levying of 25 per cent stamp duty on transfers of leases of rural properties to non-nationals as compared with the then rate of three per cent which was required of Irish nationals.  However, this did not prove to be a sufficient deterrent and, again. in 1961 the Finance Act modified the situation by making provision for the Land Commission, on the notification of the Revenue Commissioners, to keep a register of land purchased by non-nationals thereby, for the first time, being able to make an accurate assessment of the amount of land being so acquired.  Again, these measures proved inadequate until in 1965 the Land Act of that year required that all nonnationals  <Col N="739" /> who had been living here for less than seven years would have to obtain the consent of the Land Commission before acquiring rural land. The only purchases of land which do not come within the ambit of the relevant section of that Act are those relating to urban property and land being acquired for industrial purposes.  Also, small parcels of land of up to five acres.</P>
    <P>I should mention, however, that non-nationals who have been resident continually in this country for a period of more than seven years may purchase land on the same terms as our own nationals.  It is hardly necessary to go any further in regard to the history of the steps that have been taken during the past 30 years to protect our land from acquisition except in certain circumstances by non-nationals.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to the situation as it is today and the possibilities that arise in regard to our negotiations for entry to the EEC.  It is necessary to emphasise what was emphasised by the Minister for External Affairs, as he then was, when replying to a question put down by Deputy Donegan on 24th February last.  The reply was a lengthy one and I do not propose to read all of it. It begins:</P>
    <P>The Applicant countries will be required to accept the Treaty of Rome and the decisions taken by the Community to implement its provisions. One of the provisions of the Treaty is that the EEC Council shall issue directives to enable nationals of our country to acquire and use land and buildings situated in any of the other Member countries.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Oliver Flanagan was speaking here earlier today he mentioned a deputation of the General Council of County Councils who had visited the Minister for Foreign Affairs recently in regard to this matter.  However, I do not think the Deputy mentioned that he was a member of that deputation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> He certainly implied it.  It was obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not wish to misquote him in any way but he <Col N="740" /> was a member of that deputation and the various representatives of the General Council very forcefully brought home to the Minister their views in regard to this whole matter.  Once again the Minister pointed out that, if we enter the EEC, we must accept the obligations as well as the privileges contained in the Articles of the Treaty of Rome.  The particular Article which concerns us here is Article 54.3 (e) which, as well as aiming at the right of establishment in land, goes on to say that this right of establishment is subject to the proviso that there is no conflict with the principles of the current agricultural policy and these principles are set out in Article 39.2 of the Treaty as follows:</P>
      <P>In working out the common agricultural policy and the special methods which it may involve, due account shall be taken of:</P>
      <P>(a)  the particular character of agricultural activities, arising from the social structure of agriculture and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions;</P>
      <P>(b)  the need to make the appropriate adjustments gradually; and</P>
      <P>(c)  the fact that in Member States agriculture constitutes a sector which is closely linked with the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>There are, I think the House will agree, important reservations contained in Article 39 in regard to this whole question of the right of establishment. It is important also to point out that we are not alone as a people, as a nation, as a country, in being concerned that this right of establishment in land, the right of citizens of other States to acquire land within another country, should be restricted.  By the very wording of Article 39.2, it is restricted to the extent that I have mentioned.  It is obviously a question of application, a question as to how the provisions of Article 39 will be put into effect as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only two directives pursuant to these Articles that have so far been adopted are those that were adopted in December, 1961, and these provided for two things: (1) the right to acquire farms which had been abandoned or <Col N="741" /> left uncultivated for more than two years and (2) the right of Member State nationals who have worked as paid agricultural workers in another Member State for an unbroken period of at least two years to acquire farms in that State.  Two other Council directives in the matter of land purchase designed to amplify the rights of nationals of Member States have also been issued and these provide, first of all, for the right to change farms and, secondly, the legal right of access to rural leases.  These are not of particular consequence.  What are at the moment the only directives which concern us are not, as will be obvious to the House, of real concern to us.  For one thing, it is very difficult to define what is an abandoned holding.  I suggest it is impossible to define.  Again, how could one define an uncultivated holding?  I certainly could not.</P>

      <P>That is the point. I do not think it could mean untilled because, if that were so, there would be a great deal of land, particularly in Deputy Tully's constituency, which would qualify as being uncultivated, not having been tilled for a period of two years.</P>

      <P>The phrase is <Col N="742" />&ldquo;abandoned for a period of two years&rdquo;.  I think it would be virtually impossible to define what abandonment means.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree but, as things stand at the moment, I see neither of these two directives constituting any threat to the people of this country.  At worst, if it had the effect of treating a farm left vacant for two years as an abandoned farm, it could only have the very best effect on those who have the privilege of owning land in this country.  It might teach them a lesson and I, for one, would not be the least bit sorry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if anyone who left his property for a period of two years came back and found that, by directive of the European Council, it had been declared abandoned.  This does not constitute any real threat to the owners of land here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other directive in regard to agricultural workers is even less of a threat.  What is important is the draft directive issued in January, 1969, which, if adopted by the Council, would grant full right of establishment in farming to all Community nationals. <Col N="743" /> It is obvious that our present legislation would be contrary to this directive if it were adopted in its present form. Here is where we come to the crunch in the whole matter.  Assuming the directive is adopted, the big question is whether it will be adopted before or after our entry into the EEC.  If it is adopted after our entry then Ireland will have, through its representatives, a voice in the discussions, whereas, if it is adopted before we enter the EEC, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will obviously have to negotiate strenuously on it.  I am sure the House must be satisfied now with regard to the importance of this question in the mind of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Later on in the reply I mentioned earlier the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government attach the utmost importance to this question of land purchase.  I, therefore, raised the question at the very outset of the negotiations.  In the statement which I made at our first negotiating meeting with the Communities in September of last year, I drew attention to Ireland's present controls on the purchase of land by non-nationals. I explained that these controls were necessary in pursuance of the Government's policy of achieving equitable distribution of land and creating viable agricultural holdings. I also informed the Community that, in relation to the possible introduction of full right of establishment in agricultural land, we would raise in the negotiations our need to maintain sufficient control over the disposal of land in Ireland in order to enable us to pursue policies to deal with such structural problems as exist.  It is proposed to pursue the matter at an appropriate stage in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>This should satisfy Members of the House as to the concern of the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to this vital matter. I want to assure the House also of my own personal concern about this question. I agree that we have a different history in regard to land and a different position in regard to land at the moment, from that of any other of the <Col N="744" /> present or proposed members of the Community.</P>
    <P>At present the 11 million acres of agricultural land in Ireland are divided into approximately 200,000 holdings. I am referring to farmers who derive their main source of livelihood from the land.  Of these, 84,000 are under 30 acres; 53,000 are in the range of 30 to 50 acres; and 47,000 range between 50 and 100 acres.  Accordingly, a fair estimate of the number of farms requiring restructuring would be between 60,000 and 80,000, against a background of acute congestion in the west and parts of the south and north, the fact that it is difficult to obtain industrial employment for those leaving the land, the difficulties of the Land Commission in acquiring land, particularly in large quantities, as land settlement proceeds, and that free sale would, we expect, be one-way traffic.  I cannot imagine Irish people in any numbers availing themselves of the freedom to acquire land in France, Germany or Holland whereas, in present circumstances, it is obvious that a very large number of foreigners would be desirous of buying our land.  As well as that, our exceptional geographical position as an island on the perimeter of the EEC makes us, for reasons which I do not have to detail, particularly attractive to the nationals of EEC Member States.</P>
    <P>These are the realities of the situation and it would be naive not to say that the whole idea of the Common Market is to avoid discrimination on the basis of nationality.  Last week M. Deniau, a representative of the Commission, remarked that this principle was very important, and was the key to what the EEC are trying to do. This does not mean that the Treaty of Rome exists, or is intended to exist, to hand out certificates of economic death to less developed regions.  As I have already pointed out, there are safeguards in regard to sensitive sectors.  It is obvious that the most sensitive sector so far as we are concerned is the whole question of our agricultural land and its use.  In a country where 28 per cent of our people&mdash;far and away the highest percentage in Europe&mdash;still obtain their <Col N="745" /> livelihood from farming mainly if discrimination on grounds of nationality is to be avoided, what does the future hold?</P>
    <P>It is important to point out to the House that we can continue legislation which is discriminatory, although not discriminatory in regard to nationality. We can and will discriminate in pursuance of the policy of restructuring farming land.  We will not be discriminating against people because they are British, French or German or anything else.  We will also be discriminating against some of our own people who will not be allowed to purchase land freely as in times gone by. If any land restructuring or reform programme is ever to be carried out to a successful conclusion, the purchase, sale, the leasing, letting, <i>et cetera</i> of land indiscriminately will never again happen in this country.</P>
    <P>I have no reason at all to think that such legislation would be contrary to our obligation under Article 54.  On the contrary, having regard to the provisions of Article 39 I believe it would be fully in keeping with our membership and would be endorsed by the Commission.  While it would certainly continue restraints on the nationals of other countries, it would also continue restraints which exist today in regard to our own people.  This represents a reasonable national posture for our Government and our spokesmen to adopt.  It is a posture which will have the sympathy of the representatives of the countries negotiating with the EEC at present and afterwards of our fellow members in the Community, assuming that we become a member in due course.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke in West Cork recently, and I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 8th March, 1971:</P>
    <P>Replying to a question on whether non-nationals would have the same privilege as nationals in the ownership of land here, Dr. Hillery said this was something which had to be negotiated.  In general, the principle was that no law should discriminate on a nationality basis and could not favour your own citizens.</P>
    <P>However, he would be shocked if <Col N="746" /> the community did anything that would involve land here before we were &ldquo;in&rdquo;.  In any case, it appeared that the spirit of the community was not to take a decision that would adversely affect any member country.</P>
    <P>I can assure you I have made some very clear soundings in Brussels about our views on land.  They cannot but know my views but there are always ways of protecting our interests without discriminating.</P>
    <P>Although I do not propose to deal with it, it occurs to me that we may similarly be able to protect ourselves in the equally vital matter of our fishery industry. I share the concern of Deputies on the other side of the House in regard to this vital matter.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my intervention today is first of all to assure Members of the House that the interests of the Irish people in regard to the right of establishment in the land of Ireland is of paramount importance to our negotiating representatives and is closely watched by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, my Department and I and, of course, the Government as a whole, along with the many other complex issues involved.</P>
    <P>One could waffle on forever on the subject of the EC and what may happen. It is a mistake to do so because the things which might happen and the things which can be imagined as happening are almost endless.  I would suggest to Deputies that if they are trying to educate the people as they ought to on both the merits and demerits, so far as this country is concerned, of entering the EEC it would be much better if they tried to stick as far as possible to fact and restrained themselves from unnecessary theorisation. One way or other there will be very serious problems for this country.  We will have serious problems whether we are in or out of the EEC.  On the economic side it is perfectly obvious that both Britain and ourselves, as applicant countries, have serious economic problems at the present time. One could argue forever on how successful negotiation for membership would affect that situation.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that when the time comes for the people to decide the <Col N="747" /> various issues by referendum the issues should, as far as possible, be put fairly and without emotion.  It is not much good being emotional about the issues involved here.  It goes without saying that we must preserve our distinct nationality: our language, our traditions and our culture.  The Irish people will ultimately have to decide many issues by referendum.</P>
    <P>Those against our entry to join whip up emotion in every way they can, some of them who are in influential situations, in my opinion, unscrupulously. It is very easy to whip up anti-EEC feelings on issues like sovereignity.  In regard to land, which is possibly the most emotive issue of all, it is very easy to abandon discussion and deal purely in hysterics.</P>
    <P>Europe has changed rapidly since I was a child and since the end of World War II.  Only a person who has refused to face what has happened since the end of World War II will fail to realise the immense benefits which have flowed initially from the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community and subsequently the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything that Deputy Oliver Flanagan may say about the dignity of this House and this Parliament, if we can manage to lead our people to a dispassionate discussion, in which each of us would frankly give the merits as we see them and the demerits as we see them, then the sort of statement made by the Deputy this morning would not be necessary.  He said we should have an all-party delegation in Brussels negotiating on behalf of Ireland.  It sounds grand in theory but it does not work.  The elected Government of the people are responsible to the people for carrying out these negotiations and if and when the people wish to change the negotiating team and put in another one they have their own way of sending for Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  When, and if, they do, it would be his responsibility and not an all-party mixumgatherum responsibility to shoulder this grave obligation.  I am confident the people will make the right decisions anyway.  Let us hope those who <Col N="748" /> represent them will put the issues fairly in the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We are discussing a motion in the name of the Taoiseach that Dáil Éireann takes note of the White Paper entitled <i>Membership of the European Communities: Implications for Ireland</i> and an amendment to that motion in the name of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, to add at the end of the motion:</P>
      <P>and urges the Government to ensure that the terms of membership to be negotiated adequately safeguard the interests of the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is not an overstatement to say that the negotiations now proceeding in Brussels are the most important negotiations undertaken on behalf of this country for the past 50 years.  The step we are about to take is second only in importance to the negotiations that took place about 50 years ago in connection with the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands concluded on the note that these negotiations must be entrusted to the Government of the day.  I do not intend to make a controversial speech but it is regrettable that the negotiations must be conducted by the present Government.  They do not enjoy the confidence of the Irish people and they cannot expect to enjoy the respect of Governments abroad.  This is not surprising in view of the events that have taken place since April, 1970.  In the circumstances it behoves this House to keep a constant eye on the negotiations and to ensure that the Government report frequently to this House regarding the progress made in this matter.  It would have been much better if the Taoiseach had sought a renewal of his mandate from the Irish people before his Government undertook the task of conducting the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our party approve of our entering into Europe provided that we are given adequate safeguards, as requested in our amendment.  This applies, in particular, to matters such as the sale of land to aliens, which subject has just been dealt with to <Col N="749" /> the best of his ability, having regard to the material at his disposal, by the Minister for Lands.  We also require adequate safeguards in relation to the protection of industries and incentives to encourage industries to come to this country.</P>
    <P>Given these incentives, it is in the interests of this country from the national and the economic point of view to join Europe.  Some people are inclined to approach the subject on the basis that there is no alternative and that we are not a free agent in the matter.  They consider if Great Britain joins we have no other choice and that is the end of the matter.  In fact, we have an alternative.  It would be a pity if the only argument in favour of our joining the Community is that we have no alternative because this argument is unworthy and not convincing. In my opinion it flows from a national inferiority complex.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal in the first place with the benefits that will flow to this country nationally from full association with the Common Market.  The Treaty of 1922 conferred on what is now known as the Republic of Ireland political freedom.  Having won that measure of freedom it remained to us to work towards and achieve national unity and economic independence.  It is now 50 years since that event and there is no dispute between the parties who constitute the membership of this House about the advisability of the Treaty and the measure of freedom it gave to us.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was on television recently he was asked if he laid all the blame for Partition on Great Britain and he stated he did not.  He said that regard had to be taken at that time to the fact that there were about one million people of the Protestant religion in north-east Ireland whose views and principles had to be respected.  It was good to hear this from the Taoiseach and let us hope that it puts an end to the kind of nonsense and humbug that we heard from Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;some of them at present in this House and others no longer here&mdash;regarding the alleged sale of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The Government of Ireland Act was <Col N="750" /> introduced in 1920 and the Treaty was a little later.  It gave us the right to achieve political freedom for the whole country as well as economic independence. I do not intend to labour this point but it is necessary to trace briefly the events of that time.  After the Treaty, those who believed in it and accepted it, set about working towards social unity by acknowledging then, as the Taoiseach does now, the fact that one million Protestants in the North of Ireland had views that had to be respected.  With that end in view this party constituted the Seanad and made seats for 23 members of the minority religion in this country in it.  We were abused for doing that by members of the Tánaiste's party at the time, but we did it because we thought it was the way to move towards national unity and the blending of views, north and south.  That continued for the first ten years of the lifetime of this State. In 1932 we had a change of Government and a violent change of policy towards the means of attaining national unity.  Shortly afterwards we did away with the Seanad, largely because it constituted a forum for minority opinion and thought in this country.  We built up an economic barrier in the form of tariff walls between the north and the south of the country.  As time went on, contact between the Six Counties and the then Free State became less and less.  There was no economic communication between them. Commerce ceased and with the complete break in commercial contact it soon became apparent that there was less physical or social contact between the two parts of the country.  The northern people gravitated towards England as their source of contact and commerce.  There ceased to be any good reason for communication between the two parts of the country.  In fact, the generation which grew up then began to regard Northern Ireland as a foreign country.  A young fellow thinking of leaving home spoke of leaving the country and going to Belfast.</P>
    <P>The action of those days did more than anything else to consolidate Partition and to postpone the reunification of Ireland.  The tariff war made the Border a tangible obstruction.  It became <Col N="751" /> necessary to reinforce Border patrols and to increase the strength of customs personnel.  The movement of merchandise between one part of the country and another came to a standstill. The movement of people was greatly restricted.  There ceased to be much point in people traversing the Border.  The result was that the North and South were driven permanently apart.  The North looked to Britain. We regarded Northern Ireland as a foreign country from the point of view of trade.  The result of all that is the tragedy of Northern Ireland today.  If the negotiations which are going on do something to end that it will be a good thing.  We became grossly ignorant of each other with the loss of contact between both parts of the country. There has been much misunderstanding between the peoples of the Republic and those of Northern Ireland. That ignorance of our country, our laws and of the influences which prevail here and the belief that this country was dominated by the religious majority to the complete disregard of the religious minority generated fear in the people in the North.  That fear begot the bloodshed that is a daily and nightly occurrence of the Six Counties now.</P>
    <P>Three years ago I believed when men like John Hume, Ivan Cooper and Austin Curry and those of moderate minds who agreed with them set out to improve civil rights in the north on the basis of getting the people together and getting them civil rights that we were coming nearer a united Ireland of one sort or another.  I believed then that a united Ireland would come before the end of this century. The movement which was started then should have ended Partition but the extremists, the people who have done nothing for years but bedevil the situation, jumped on what they thought was a bandwagon and created strife and bloodshed which is the curse of the situation now&mdash;extremists from both sides&mdash;Protestant extremists and IRA extremists.  If a closer coming together of north and south for purposes of commerce and trade, and if our entry into Europe would do away with this gross ignorance and as a result do away <Col N="752" /> with the feeling which exists then I believe that bloodshed would cease and this island would be on the way towards a coming together, as somebody said, of minds and hearts and understanding, a coming together of people. There is no point in putting together pieces of land if the people who populate the land hate and fear each other or do not trust each other.  I believe that our entry to Europe on satisfactory conditions will lead to an intermingling of people north and south for purposes of trade and commerce.  It will create a more friendly atmosphere and will pave the way for ultimate understanding and the ultimate unification of the country.</P>
    <P>Much harm has been done&mdash;and I regret to say that I think instead of the unity of the country being brought nearer it had been put farther off&mdash;not by the John Humes and Ivan Coopers but by the extremists on both sides who have chosen destruction as a means to secure an immediate end to the problem.  That is the position and those are the national grounds why I believe we should join Europe, provided satisfactory terms can be negotiated. Perhaps further discussion of the matter might not be entirely relevant on this debate, but the tragedy of the North in the last few years is that those who did something for the oppressed people of the North after so many years of other people doing nothing, were not allowed to continue without senseless intervention from extremists on both sides.</P>
    <P>Other members of this party have dealt with the economic consequences of joining the EEC and beyond dealing generally with them I do not intend to discuss them in detail.  I intend to deal at some length with the land problem. As I see it, the Common Market affords us a market of about 250 million people.  We are told and I think it is generally accepted that we should get better prices for cattle, beef, dairy products, lamb and pig meat.  Perhaps the position regarding pig meat is not as favourable as the other items.  These items represent about 63 per cent of our total output.  The White Paper tells us that beef will increase by 60 per cent; the price of milk will increase from 2s 4d per gallon in 1968 to about <Col N="753" /> 3s 9d a gallon on entry.  The huge market we will have should enable us to diversify but, going around the country and talking to people, one thing that has struck me is the complete bewilderment of the farming community about what is involved in entering the Common Market.  This is not entirely the fault of farming organisations, because they are holding seminars and doing their best to instruct the farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government should spell out for the agricultural community and the industrial sector what exactly is involved. I do not believe the Government are doing that.  Could it be that the Government have not the information? That might be so.  Listening to the Minister for Lands dealing with the effect of our entry on section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, one could fairly come to the conclusion that both he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are anything but clear as to what the position is regarding the purchase of land by foreigners if we enter.  I am not clear and I have read the Minister's reply to the question on 24th February.  I have listened to the Minister for Lands today. There is quite a considerable element of uncertainty about the whole thing.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> All the information that he has but if anybody, however intelligent, having listened to the Minister, were asked to sit down and write an essay on our position regarding the sale of land to foreigners or the purchase of land by foreigners, he would not create a very clear picture of the position.  The Government in the last 12 months succeeded in mounting a major campaign to explain decimalisation and to prepare the country for Decimal Day. They did a very good job and made it perfectly clear.  Perhaps that is because <Col N="754" /> they understood the implications clearly themselves and it was therefore easy to put them across.  I must, therefore, fault the Government for not making the position clear to farmers and industrialists&mdash;particularly to farmers. It is a pity also that over the last few years we have not had a clear and well-defined agricultural policy because, I find bewilderment in the agricultural community about the Government's agricultural policy.  In 1966 farmers were told: &ldquo;Get into milk.&rdquo;  They were paid for doing so; they were given a heifer subsidy.  Between 1966 and a year or two ago the Government seemed to come to the conclusion that we had reached saturation point in milk, and there was a right-about turn.  The farmers were then paid to get out of milk.  They were given a subsidy for feeding milk to stock rather than selling it commercially and now it is impossible to know who to believe or what to believe.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am saying it is unfortunate for the agricultural community if that is the case and it is unfortunate if the Government, with all the technical advisers at their disposal, cannot find this out. As I was saying, the position now appears to be completely muddled.  One man engaged in the butter business will tell you that the amount of butter in the country at the present time is nearly down to zero and that we will be importing butter; and another man will tell you we will not be able to supply the home market, never mind fulfil our foreign commitments.  If that is the position&mdash;and that is what I am told&mdash;it is an unhappy way to be taking the plunge into Europe to compete with the people we will meet there who <Col N="755" /> have made a successful job of their own business.</P>
      <P>Membership of the EEC will undoubtedly attract foreign capital and foreign industry.  I have come to the conclusion that some of the industries we got here in the early part of the 1960s were what I would call Common Market efforts.  The then Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, was telling us that we would be in Europe on 1st January, 1964.  Some time prior to that some strange industries came to Ireland. For example, one which came to Cavan town received a State grant of £175,000 and it engaged in an operation of importing partly processed farm machinery from West Germany to Cavan, processing those partially processed pieces of machinery to a further extent and then re-exporting it to Germany.  That may sound a crazy operation, and so it proved to be.  The 200 promised employees never rose beyond 50, were as low as 11, and a fair average was about 20.  That was an undertaking that came here in anticipation of our entry into the Common Market.  However, we will, as I say, have more foreign capital here and more foreign industries and while that will be welcome in one way, it will certainly create a very serious challenge to our managements and work force.</P>
      <P>I can only hope we are ready for such a challenge, but again the events of the last twelve months, the closing down of factories here and there, have created a doubt in my own mind and have forced me to pose the question: are we ready?  What have the Government been doing about our preparation for Europe?  You would think we had decided to go into Europe only 12 or 18 months ago.  The fact is that this decision was taken ten years ago. If the Government had been discharging their duties and taking the matter seriously they should have been working overtime during the past ten years to prepare all sectors of industry and agriculture for our entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hold here an unhappy record for the greatest number of man-days per year lost through strikes.  That may be a slight exaggeration.  If we are not at the top of the league we are far from <Col N="756" /> the bottom.  I think we are second to Italy, and I stand corrected if that is not so.  If we are to get into Europe and compete with West Germany where strikes are practically unheard of our industrial relations here will want to improve.  We will not be able to afford the luxury about which I have spoken. Managements and workers in industry will require to be far more conscious of the effect of strikes on the national economy and to arrange industrial relations accordingly.  I am not giving a lecture to the workers.  What I am saying applies equally to management and to workers.  It is a bit of a reflection on the country that most of the industrial unrest seems to exist in State-sponsored bodies, who are the biggest employers in this country, and side-by-side with the semi-State bodies you might put monopolies such as the banks.  Industrial unrest should not exist here if there was a proper approach from the managements and a proper lead from the Government, on the one hand, and a better response from the employees on the other hand.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for Justice in my party I feel I should say something regarding the legal implications of joining the EEC for the Republic of Ireland. The object of the Treaty of Rome is to set up an economic union in which people, goods and businesses will be free to move from country to country and in which there will be substantially similar conditions of competition.  This involves two types of change in the national law.  It involves the elimination of restrictions on the free movement of goods and the elimination of restrictions involving discrimination on basis of nationality.  It involves elimination of discrimination against the freedom of movement of workers and the freedom to establish businesses.  This involves not only the abolition of tariffs but also the abolition of import and export prohibitions which cannot be justified on the grounds of public morality, good public order, health and so on.</P>
    <P>Laws which have the effect of rendering competition substantially different in different Member States will have to be brought into line.  This could affect laws regarding food purity <Col N="757" /> requirements and laws relating to pollution because if we are operating under laws which are more lax than the laws in the other Member States, we would be required to step up our standards here and, of course, the stepping up of those standards would affect our production costs.  The Treaty of Rome is an economic treaty.  It is concerned with social and legal problems only in so far as they affect economic matters or in so far as it may be necessary to alter the law or social customs to bring about economic equality.</P>
    <P>In view of some of the speeches that have been made, it might be no harm to emphasise our entry into Europe as such as having nothing whatever to do with divorce or with family law. I understand that the only social provisions spelled out specially in the Treaty refer to equal pay for men and women and for paid holidays of a similar duration in each country.  Of course, these are obvious examples because they affect the economic position. It could be wrong that one country should pay women less for the same work as men and that another should be compelled to pay the same rate to men and women.  It follows, therefore, that there is no reason why we should alter our laws substantially on entry to the EEC.</P>
    <P>I might mention at this point that there is available an excellent book on the Common Market.  It is written by Mr. John Temple Lang and it deals fully with what he calls the common law and the Common Market.  The book is a sizeable one and I hasten to say that I do not intend to discuss it during this debate.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, certain Constitutional changes will be required to enable the European economic institutions to exercise in Ireland the powers conferred on them by the Treaty of Rome.  Under that heading, some people fear for our sovereignty.  In one way we will be less sovereign on entering Europe but in another way we will assume greater national importance because we will be one of a group and we will have an independent say in the formation of policy and in the formation of regulations which will bind all the Member <Col N="758" /> States.  At any rate, it is part of my business to try to spell out the changes which I think will be necessary in our Constitution before we accept the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Treaty enables the Common Market institutions to make regulations which will automatically have the force of law here.  The Treaty confers jurisdiction on the EEC court over citizens of this country in certain matters, only in matters referring to the interpretation of the Treaty but that means that our Supreme Court will not be the ultimate court of decision here.  In certain cases we will have to submit ourselves to the Community Court to have certain matters decided and certain instruments interpreted.</P>
    <P>At the present time it is laid down in our Constitution that our Supreme Court is the final court of appeal. Therefore, Article 6 of the Constitution will have to be changed because this Article provides that:</P>
    <P>1.  All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of common good.</P>
    <P>2.  These powers of government are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is clear that that Article will have to go.  Article 15, Clause 2, provides that:</P>
    <P>The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.</P>
    <P>In so far as the regulations laid down by the Community can have the force of law here without any reference to this Parliament, it is clear that Article 15, also, will have to be amended.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of our Constitution lays down that:</P>
    <P>Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State.</P>
    <P>If it is considered that that is inconsid <Col N="759" /> sistent with having laws made for us by the European Parliament and having laws made for us by the European Parliament and having an appeal to the European Court, Article 5 will have to be changed too.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell for a few moments on the Land Act, section 45 which provides that it shall not be lawful for a non-national to purchase land here without the consent of the Land Commission.  Deputy Donegan put down a question to the Minister for External Affairs on the 24th February on this subject.  Deputy Donegan, as reported in Volume 251 of the Official Report, column 1950 and subsequent columns, asked the Minister for External Affairs:</P>
    <P>if he will explain precisely his interpretation of the position in regard to the purchase of land by Europeans when Ireland joins the EEC.</P>
    <P>This matter was dealt with at some length by the Minister for Lands today. In my opinion he left the matter in mid-air, so to speak.  I do not blame him for that and I am not complaining about the Minister's performance; he did only what anyone would have to do in this situation&mdash;he left the matter in mid-air because that is where it is.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Donegan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said:</P>
    <P>The applicant countries will be required to accept the Treaty of Rome and the decisions taken by the Community to implement its provisions. One of the provisions of the Treaty is that the EEC Council shall issue directives to enable nationals of one country to acquire and use land and buildings situated in any of the other member countries.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, the present directives would enable non-nationals to buy agricultural land which had been abandoned or left uncultivated for more than two years; it would also enable non-nationals who had worked as paid agricultural workers for a period of two years to buy agricultural land here.</P>
    <P>It is not expected that the acceptance of these Community directives would create any serious difficulties in so far as our national interests are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> That part of the directive dealing with the purchase of land by foreigners who have worked here continuously as agricultural labourers for a period of two years is perfectly clear and I agree with the Minister for Lands that it is a perfectly reasonable provision; it would not be unreasonable for such a person to buy land here after that length of time.  However, the first part of the directive is anything but clear.  It says that land which has been abandoned or uncultivated for more than two years may be bought by non-nationals.  I am not clear what the word &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; means.  I am less clear as to what &ldquo;uncultivated&rdquo; means in this context. If we enter Europe, however, I know that it is not our interpretation which will be accepted; it will not be our definition of abandoned or uncultivated that will count.  It will be the definition given to these terms by the European Court and it is that definition that will, in the last analysis, be binding on us. It is vital, therefore, that we should know now where we stand and that we we should know what is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands is abundantly clear as to the dangers involved for this county in the right of foreigners to buy land here on a wholesale scale.  The Minister appreciates the position and has made it clear that it is necessary to guard against this because of our background and because agriculture is such an important factor in our national economy.  However, again in his reply, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said:</P>
    <P>The situation, therefore, has not yet been reached where nationals of one member country are fully free to purchase farms in any other member country.  The Council has had before it since January 1969 a draft directive which, if adopted, would grant, in effect, full rights to nationals of one country to purchase farms in other member countries.  It is not possible to say at this stage when this draft directive might be adopted.  It is possible that it may be adopted between now and Ireland's accession to the EEC; or perhaps its adoption will not arise until after accession.</P>
    <P>Now, if the directive is adopted before we enter, then the Minister for Foreign <Col N="761" /> Affairs will have the right to bargain on a political basis and say that we want exemption from that particular part of the directive or that we want to have it softened down a bit.  If it is not adopted until after we enter, then we will have a vote&mdash;one in six, one in ten&mdash;as to whether or not this should be the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan was accused today of being emotional when he discussed this particular matter.  He may have been, but he put up a good argument; he seldom puts up a bad one. In the light of what the Minister for Lands said this afternoon it is clear that he appreciates that this is an emotional matter; it is something about which the people feel very strongly; it is something in relation to which we will have to bargain and bargain hard. That is the purpose of our amendment; we urge the Government to ensure that the terms of membership to be negotiated adequately safeguard the interests of the people of Ireland and, if we do not get the necessary safeguards, then we should not join.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have not a stronger Government, a Government that enjoys the confidence of the people at home and respect abroad, negotiating for us.  We have not got such a Government and there is nothing we can do about it.  The fight will have to be made to the very last ditch. The Minister for Lands, while arguing that we would not be entitled to discriminate if this directive were accepted, also argued that we could discriminate on the grounds of regional development and the restructuring of land policy.  Candidly, I do not know what that means and the Minister did not explain.  Regional development boards will apparently plan for each region and it will be open to these boards to say that, since there is not enough land for our own, people from outside may not come in and buy land.  But not alone will it preclude non-nationals from buying land but it will also preclude nationals from another region buying land.  It is all very much up in the air at the moment.</P>
    <P>We are talking about going into Europe next year or the year after.  If <Col N="762" /> that is the aim then we should be attending to this; indeed, it should have been attended to long before this.  The regions should be in existence.  We should know what regional policy on the part of the Government is in regard to regional development, with particular reference to agriculture. That was in reference to Article 5, I think.</P>
    <P>Article 29 will also have to be changed.  It states:</P>
    <P>The State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Clause 6 of the same Article says:</P>
    <P>No international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Treaty provides for the conclusion of agreements binding on Member States.  Therefore, in my opinion, Article 29 will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>Article 34 will have to be changed because it says:</P>
    <P>Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public.</P>
    <P>Because of the appeal to the International Court that will have to be changed.  Clause 6 of Article 34 provides:</P>
    <P>The decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>That will have to go.  Therefore, we will have to have very substantial changes in our Constitution.  With the other changes that are talked about, it might be, as Deputy Corish said at the Labour conference, a neater and a cleaner job to scrap the whole thing and give us another Constitution.  There is the objectional clause in Article 44 which could be got rid of at the same time.  It was put in just for window-dressing. <Col N="763" /> It means nothing but it offends people.</P>
    <P>The next matters of importance from the negotiating and the bargaining point of view are the tax concessions on profits from exports.  We have been giving tax concessions to people who came in here and established industries and brought capital and know how. We exempted them from profits earned on exports under an Act introduced by the late Deputy Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance.  That has been accepted and extended by subsequent Governments.  This sort of thing is prohibited by Article 98 of the Treaty and it is dealt with at page 61 of the White Paper.  It would be very dangerous if these concessions were to be removed because, not only would we cease to be attractive to foreign industrialists, but some industrialists who came here under the promise of this exemption might consider that a confidence trick had been played on them.  If they did not go that far&mdash;and it would be unreasonable for them to go that far&mdash; they might consider that it had ceased to be profitable for them to stay here and they might clear out, with consequent unemployment all over the place. That will have to be bargained and bargained hard and fast.  I believe that the Ministers concerned appreciate the importance of this.  This coupled with the protection for the land of Ireland might be so vital as to mean that we might have to change our thinking if we did not get some reasonable safeguards on this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan covered a very wide field and he made a point which at first sight might appear hard to follow but with which I thoroughly agree.  He said he believes that our entry into the Common Market instead of damaging our national language would benefit it.  I believe that, because I believe that people who heard the French and the Danes and the Dutch speaking their own language would develop a certain inferiority complex if they could not speak in their own language and would regard themselves as being not properly educated. In other words, it would put a snob value on Irish.  I believe that is one way <Col N="764" /> of reviving Irish rather than by compulsory methods.</P>
    <P>I believe and this party believe that we should enter for national reasons. I have outlined those reasons at some length.  I believe it would lead to the reunification of the country in a shorter time than we might think.  If we get the safeguards we are entitled to as a country with a very checkered history, a country that has suffered great hardship in the past, we should join, and it will be in our interests to join.  The Government should negotiate and negotiate hard on this basis.  They should keep the House informed.  They should take the House into their confidence. They should take Parliament into their confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan suggested that we should have an all-party committee negotiating on behalf of the country.  I said at the beginning that I did not propose to make a controversial speech but it has to be conceded, and it must be admitted, that the Government are at a disadvantage both at home and abroad.  They have taken a fair hammering over the past 18 months.  There are huge question marks hanging over the Government collectively and individually. I do not think that is an exaggeration.  Any member of the Government who would deny that the Government have taken an internal hammering and have been exposed to the nation as doubtful, is not really facing realities.  If that is important at home it is even more important abroad because our bargaining strength with the Six Member Countries lies in the strength of our Government and the respect which each of those member states has for the Government of this country and for the integrity of our negotiators.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it might be no harm if the negotiations were protracted and if they dragged on, if we are not to have a general election in the near future.  A Government refreshed and cleansed by a general election would be in a much stronger position to bargain and to argue.  I am convinced that if we had a general election there would be a change of Government but, even if there were not a change of Government, a Government <Col N="765" /> emerging from a general election would have a mandate from the people.  It may be said that the present Government have a mandate from the Irish people given to them at the polls on 18th June, 1969.  In the events which have happened since then the Government cannot claim that they are, as of now, entitled to that mandate or that as of now they enjoy the confidence of the people.  I hope these negotiations will not conclude until we have a general election and until we have a Government which is accepted at home and abroad as enjoying a mandate and is seen to be a Government of integrity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have waited a considerable length of time to speak and I regret that my right to contribute is being questioned as if it were undemocratic.  It must be evident to everybody that the Government have been fair in the allocation of speakers during this debate.  I do not intend to take up the time of this House in any way, which would not be either proper or fair.  What kind of Europe have we sought to become a member of? Whence did it arrive?  What is its present programme?  What is its future path?  These are questions of considerable consequence and every person should be informed on them.  The Europe we are concerned with is a Europe born out of war but by contrast it is a Europe which was nurtured on the food of peace.  It was born out of war because the smaller countries of Europe could not accept or tolerate <Col N="770" /> a situation where the possibility of another European conflagration could be contemplated.  They could not contemplate a conflagration which would involve them again in destruction and conquest against which they had no real defence.</P>
      <P>It is significant that the founding fathers of the European Community were stronger numerically in Belgium, Holland and Italy than in the larger countries of France and Germany. However, France, Germany and Luxembourg were all aware of the need to guard against any such conflagration in Europe.  For that reason the intention behind the Treaty of Rome was to establish a political union in Europe.  It is only when such a union has been achieved that those who are concerned in that union can ensure that no such conflagration will envelop them in the future.</P>
      <P>However, that was only one factor. Apart from ensuring peace and security within the confines of Europe, how does the Community view itself <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the world and the world powers.  In applying to become a member of Europe are we applying for membership of another power bloc?  Is the European Community in the field of armaments, defence, foreign policy and nuclear development determined to exercise its influence as do the two major power blocs in the east and west?  Is Europe determined to create another bloc that in turn could cause a reaction particularly from the African countries, the countries of the east and perhaps Eastern Europe?  If this were the kind of Europe to which we were applying for membership I do not think that anyone here would be very enthusiastic about it.  It is evident from the conduct of European affairs in the last number of years that far from endeavouring simply to create another power bloc that would arouse reactions from other groups, the whole basis of Europe is that it is intended to break down existing barriers between the Community and the developing countries and the countries of Eastern Europe.  This is the Community of which we have sought membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a full member we can involve <Col N="771" /> ourselves in the common programme and this is an exciting challenge and a positive opportunity for us, particularly with regard to the programme for developing countries.  It is true that that programme in many ways is directed towards the former colonial possessions of many of the member countries. However, the fact that they may be former colonial possessions does not make them any less worthy of development aid should they need it. Although the development programme is directed to a large extent towards former colonial possessions it is not confined to those countries.  Africa is rapidly emerging as a significant area of influence and it is vital that we use the most effective channels of association and be seen to be closely and most actively concerned in the welfare of that great continent.</P>
    <P>Many of us in this House have complained frequently that we are not sufficiently concerned about developments in other parts of the world, particularly Africa.  More often than not these complaints have come from parties other than the Government party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained this fully to Deputy Treacy and I do not see why the Deputy should intervene now to have a repetition of the explanation I gave to Deputy Treacy.  Time is running out and, to put it mildly, the Deputy should not come in at this stage and ask once more for the Chair's explanation.  I will give it again to Deputy Cluskey. In a debate of this kind&mdash;in any debate other than a debate on a Private <Col N="772" /> Member's motion&mdash;there is no precedent for calling one, one, one.  I want to make that clear and to put it on the record again.</P>
      <P>It is only in a debate on a Private Member's motion that a Member from each party is called in turn.  In a debate of this kind such a practice does not exist.  I called the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education for the reason that since the debate began nine Labour Deputies have intervened and have spoken for 20 hours; 14 Fine Gael Deputies have spoken for 20 hours; 15 Fianna Fáil members &mdash;Ministers and Deputies&mdash;have intervened and have spoken for 10 hours. In the circumstances I considered that the Parliamentary Secretary was entitled to be called.</P>

      <P>I do not intend, even for the purpose of trying to reestablish the continuity of my contribution, to summarise everything I have said.  It is difficult to pick up the threads <Col N="775" /> immediately.  I had referred to the fact that membership of this Community would enable us to play an effective part in the programme of development aid towards developing countries.  I do not want to say more on that point except that it is a matter of concern for all people in this country which has a great tradition of helping developing countries, that we should regard ourselves bound not just as a matter of policy but as a matter of conscience to ensure that we use our best resources and effort and technology to assist the further development of these countries. Politically it would be wise but morally it is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>The question which is posed most often by those who would oppose entry to the European Community is that we are, in becoming a member of the Community which offers so much in that and other areas, compromising our sovereignty and that we will not be masters of our own area.  This has been a strong argument against entry. It is hard to give a definitive, final analysis of what sovereignty is.  It is easier to say what it is not.  It is not the right to rule in your own yard but to have no influence or say whatever in what is introduced into your yard from outside, and to have no influence or say whatever on the situation which will pertain in your yard because others, who are stronger and more effective outside it, are determined to influence you in your activities although you can do nothing about it.  If that were sovereignty, it would be a very unsatisfactory thing and not the type of sovereignty that any Irishman would be prepared to accept.  That is the type of sovereignty we are being asked to ensure that we will have in the future, irrespective of what happens in Europe.  We are being asked to ensure that we will stay independent and sovereign and will not be beholden to any man.  It is rather like the bachelor who says he will stay unmarried and be beholden to no one for the rest of his days.  Such a man might find that sharing his sovereignty with a wife and family he would have a better life than he has as a single man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we contribute we, in turn, receive <Col N="776" /> under this new arrangement in a European Community.  If we were to be influenced by any international developments, like a war involving Europe or some other part of the world, what good would our precious sovereignty be then?  If a nuclear conflagration enveloped us, what good would it be if we could say that we stayed sovereign?  If there is to be a war again it will not be of a type which will allow us to be unaffected by the events occurring between other powers.  Obviously the practical and honourable and by far the most desirable thing for us would be to be involved to ensure that these situations cannot arise, to guard against any such antagonisms and conflagrations and to ensure that the peace which is so needed will be maintained.  Ireland is an active agent towards peace.</P>
    <P>We are told sometimes that we would renege on our culture and language. It is often said that because of our tradition both in economics and in our associations with the UK and America and in similar traditional associations with them in matters of language and even through the media of TV and radio we are, in fact, very much influenced beyond our power, perhaps, by both of these civilisations and their traditions.  We are certainly much more influenced by them than by any other countries or civilisations outside our own.  Can anyone ask: is this a happy and flourishing situation for a culture or for a language, for that matter, to develop in?  Do we still again want to lock ourselves off from the rest of the world and the traditions of Europe particularly and find ourselves restricted to this influence?  It may be true, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said in his last contribution, that membership of the European Community would give a certain snob value to Irish.  This may or may not be true. I am not particularly concerned that it would be true but what is true, and it must be very evident to all who have any experience of Europe, is that when you are involved in the mainstream of European affairs you become concerned and aware of the activities, the culture and the languages of other countries.</P>
    <P>You become attuned to their thinking and influenced by the many you <Col N="777" /> enrich your own.  You become, among other things, particularly concerned about the need to preserve your own identity while at the same time contributing to the common source or to the common fund of European culture. One could use words on this at will but the reality in any event is the proof of the argument and that is that the children and the young people and, indeed, the not so young people in Europe have a much greater awareness in many ways of their own culture, in France or Italy or in Germany. They do not shout about it very much but they have a very definite awareness of their own culture.</P>
    <P>They also have a very definite awareness that theirs is not the only culture. The fluency they enjoy in languages, sometimes in three or four languages, a fluency with which none of us can compete, the awareness they have of the problems of other people and the environment in other countries, particularly European countries, is certainly far ahead of that which obtains here.  For those who would presume to discuss this on a philological basis, relating to fluency in languages particularly, it must be self-evident to every language student and scholar that fluency in two languages leads to fluency in three and four and five.  The person who wants to confine himself to one language can do so and fair weather to him, but if we build up on our own Irish language as well as on English we shall not only language but up our culture and our language but we shall be ensuring that it will be, in fact, an assistance to us in acquiring fluency in other languages, whether French, German, Italian or any other. Our language and many of these European languages share a common base or root, as is evidenced by the vocabulary which you will find by comparison in some instances in German, in some instances in French and in other instances in Italian.  This, I hope, will satisfy those who will say that we are giving up and endangering our culture.  Far from endangering it and far from giving up our language, anybody who is interested in our culture and in our language will realise that this is the greatest opportunity we ever had not only of putting that on <Col N="778" /> a firmer basis but of adding to it the great enrichment of the European influence from the Greek days to the Roman days down to the Renaissance days.  This surely is an enrichment that is worthy of sharing in on a greater level than we probably have up to this time.</P>
    <P>The young people of Europe whom I had the opportunity of meeting at an international youth conference recently which I attended with members of the International Youth Council here in Ireland, are not concerned with divisions. They are very much aware, as I have already said, of their separate identities but they are greatly concerned to break down the barriers of their separate distinctions. The conference I attended in Munich, Germany, was attended by youth representatives from every country in Europe, not just the countries of the EEC as we know it or of the applicant countries or associated countries. These are the citizens of the future Europe.  They are concerned to build up in Europe the society on which the Treaty of Rome was based. Anyone who has spent any time even in our own country in consultation with them, will realise this&mdash;unless one trots out the old clichés at them about the rich man's club&mdash;and young people are, of course, susceptible to that kind of thing; if you trot out that at them, of course, they may react to it&mdash;but, by and large, they realise that the European adventure, like any other great adventure of this sort, is based not just on selfish considerations but on hope of what they can achieve.  If anything, they have shown both in Germany and in France impatience with the fact that the European ideal has not been realised as quickly as it was hoped it would be, under the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>Speaking of young people, may I refer to what is an associated area as far as I am concerned, and that is the recreational facilities and the recreational programme which is generally developing throughout Europe? Apart from the Council of Europe programme of sport and recreation for all which we are endeavouring here to promote as much as possible, within the EEC countries themselves, if there is one thing more than another that is <Col N="779" /> evident in this area it is that we, I suppose, can justly envy them the facilities they enjoy in the recreational and sporting areas.  They may be obliged to provide these facilities because (a) they do not have the natural facilities that we have and (b) there are more people in these countries to enjoy or who require recreational facilities than there are in Ireland.  Allowing for that it is still clear that they do have a very high order of recreational facilities in Holland, France, Italy and Germany.</P>
    <P>We cannot immediately hope to achieve the same high order but if you look at the pattern upon which these are provided you will see one thing to which we should have special regard at this time, that is, rationalisation in the provision of our facilities.  I have visited many sports centres and educational institutions.  We cannot hope to provide here on a haphazard basis for every educational institution however small the kind of facilities that are provided throughout Europe in cities and towns for all the educational institutions in the area.  To state it more simply, we sometimes have even in one town three different schools operating with, if you like, the best they can provide, three different and separate &mdash;in every sense&mdash;types of facilities. One may have a gymnasium without an outside playing area; the second may have an outside playing area and no gymnasium and may be remote from the first and the third may have neither. This pattern is totally contrary to the whole development of these facilities in Europe.  They develop wherever they can the equivalent of what is now regarded as new development here&mdash;at least it is being discussed and I hope positively and without any fears&mdash;a community school.  They have the equivalent of what is, in fact, a community school, under the management of the people who are concerned in that community school.  But in that community school also they have every appropriate facility, not only in the classroom but outside the classroom. I do not think I should labour this point except to say that if the Germans and the Dutch find it necessary to rationalise their resources having regard to their money and what is available <Col N="780" /> to them, surely we must endeavour to achieve the maximum possible usage and rationalisation in this area.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that one of the matters I asked the newly formed Comhairle Spóirt is Caitheamh Aimsire to consider in the very early stages was this question of the rationalisation of recreational facilities throughout the country.  How we use our leisure time will determine how we work in our working time.  It is very important that the Irish worker, whether at his bench or wherever else he may be, will be as keen, as psychologically integrated, as mentally healthy and as physically healthy as he possibly can be to ensure that his contribution and his productivity will be on the highest possible level and will also give him the work satisfaction which only a healthy and active person can get.  All these things are of the greatest consequence, and would be even if we were never to become members of the EEC.  However, now that we have proceeded quite a long way in our application we must be greatly concerned to provide all these facilities.  I would conclude this part of my speech by simply expressing the wish that those who are concerned in the provision of these facilities, whether at educational level, at local authority level or any other level would see themselves as having a common responsibility in this area in order to produce the best possible results.</P>
    <P>There is, too, in this area a need for rationalisation even in the administration of many of our athletic and recreational activities.  In Ireland we have a great tradition of recreational activity and the enjoyment of recreational activity.  It is good thing that there are so many organisations, but sometimes a plurality of organisations can lead to the dissipation of resources. From my experience of dealing with the many organisations that exist I know they are all equally aware of this. We are fortunate in the House to have so many people dedicated in a voluntary way to implementing this programme, but, nevertheless, I would make a public appeal that where there are two or three organisations on a national level doing basically the same <Col N="781" /> thing for the same reasons but who for one reason or another may not be able to associate with each other that they would&mdash;and I do not want to spell it out any more than this&mdash;in their own interests and in the interests of rationalisation and of the fullest utilisation of the resources ensure that nothing would be wasted by virtue of their being separated.</P>
    <P>In the European countries facilities for both youth and youth problems are in many ways much more complex than they are in our own country.  Where you have intensely developed areas of population there will be more complex problems.  Germany is a very good example of what I am talking about.  The State Parliament, and by that I do not mean the Federal Parliament in Germany but, for example, the State Parliament of Bavaria have a budget for the development of recreational activities and for the furtherance of active social work in the youth area.  Apart from that, the municipalities have a very positive programme in this area.  Our local authorities have very heavy demands on their spending programmes and must meet these demands having regard to priorities.  There are encouraging signs of the increasing use of amenity grants from our local authorities and I would recommend very strongly to them to extend their activities in this area because they will be, if you like, competing with municipal authorities in other countries who are very conscious of the positive effect of investment in these amenities both for social and recreational activities and otherwise.  As far as I am concerned I would be only too anxious to co-operate in any way possible with the various local authorities in implementing a positive programme for recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer to a matter which, while it is not immediately relevant to our membership of Europe, is one of very great concern and consequence to us here.  I refer to the effect our membership would have on the unification of our country.  Those in this part of Ireland who would most strongly oppose membership of the EEC&mdash;or at least some because I must be careful to exclude the Labour Party &mdash;and notably those who do not even <Col N="782" /> recognise this institution in which I am now speaking, find themselves for once making the same case as those whose ideology they totally oppose.  I refer to the extremists in both parts of our country, the extreme Unionists in the North and the extreme whatever-you-like-to-call-them in this part of Ireland. The extreme Unionists and people like the Rev. Ian Paisley are very anxious to ensure that Europe's unity is not effected because they see in it the last bastion of their separate identity.  Is it not ironical that those who are totally opposed to them here should be arguing the same case but for a different reason?  Is it not rather strange that if we were to become a member of the EEC there are people who, for some reason I cannot understand, would say we would be injuring the cause of the unification of our country? This is not an argument that has been raised in the House and, therefore, it does not need to be answered in the House.  However, I would say to those who demonstrate against EEC membership or who wave their placards against a visiting representative of the European Commission or a visiting Foreign Minister: &ldquo;Even if you are consistent in your own ideologies would you give a thought to what you are endeavouring to achieve?  You may for once be acting in support of those who are most bitterly opposed to you.&rdquo;  Having said that&mdash;and it is not my business to decry people for whatever views they may have&mdash;I would suggest we should arrange to consult with Stormont from time to time in the course of our negotiations. After all, they have no sovereign Parliament such as we have.  They will not be consulted as to whether or not they will become members of the EEC. Neither can they be consulted by means of a referendum such as our people must be and will be as to whether or not they are prepared to accept membership of the EEC.  For these reasons it is important that we would consult with them as fully as possible.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me now that I had better qualify what I have just said. Of course, Stormont will be consulted by Westminster in these matters but, nonetheless, they cannot in any way <Col N="783" /> effect the change of policy with a view to deciding as to whether they should or should not become a member of the Community.  If Westminster so decide, then so it will be whatever Stormont may think.</P>
    <P>It is our common hope that we will all unite as one people in the not too distant future.  In so far as there are common problems, whether they be in the agricultural sphere, in the educational sphere or in any other sphere, particularly in the areas of Cavan or Fermanagh and Monaghan and Tyrone, there could well be within the European Community a total region for a common development programme. It is important that our Government are considering the effects which this would have on the rest of our fellow Irishmen in the north.  It is important, too, that we give to them the benefit of the consultations to which I have referred.  We will keep them informed, in some way, at any rate, of the progress of our negotiations. This would be the first step, in this area at least, towards achieving the unification of our country.</P>
    <P>Although the argument for membership may be repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> it is important that it is made known to people in every parish throughout the country.  In this respect, I should like to commend in particular the voluntary organisations such as Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tire for the manner in which they are promoting this argument.  The Irish public are better informed than are their counterparts in the United Kingdom on the effects which the Common Market will have for them and on the need which they may have to change their programme on the farm or in whatever sphere they happen to be engaged.  As a Deputy I often have visits from farmers and others who ask me whether this particular pattern will continue within the Community and whether they should consider, for example, changing from one type of farming to another or diversifying their activities in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to Members of the House that they use and accept these voluntary organisations for the <Col N="784" /> purpose of continuing this argument and these discussions.  I would recommend also that Members of this House would assist in every way possible the campaign for discussion which the Irish Council for the European Movement initiated and have been undertaking for some time with success.  If these suggestions are adopted, the public, well informed as they are at present, will be even better informed by the time of our final accession to the Community.</P>
    <P>While I agreed with almost all of what Deputy Fitzpatrick had to say in the course of his contribution, I could not possibly agree with him when he said it is unfortunate that we do not have a strong government to negotiate on this matter.  He went further and said that we do not even have a government that is respected either at home or abroad.  I do not know whether Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests seriously that there are people in his party who have a standing on a par internationally&mdash;not just nationally; we will leave that out for a moment&mdash;with our leader, particularly in Europe.  This is a matter of great consequence at this time.  Anyone who goes to the slightest trouble to inquire will spend a long time finding out whether the Europeans are aware of the existence of certain speakers or leaders in the Opposition parties but they are very much aware of the personality, the integrity and the strength of the Leader of this Government. They are equally aware of the effective capacity of our Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Dr. Hillery, to conduct these negotiations.  While I do not blame Deputy Fitzpatrick for taking the opportunity of making a political point and saying it is a pity we cannot have an election so that we might have strong government, I ask what kind of strong government or what kind of leadership has the Deputy in mind since the two parties opposite are divided on this most basic issue of membership of the European Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can do no more in the very limited time available to me than to utilise that time to the best advantage to impress on the Government <Col N="785" /> their obligation to face up to their responsibilities in safeguarding the likelihood of all those people involved directly in this venture into the EEC. Already, because of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in January, 1960, the livelihood of thousands of our people has been jeopardised. As we advance towards free trade in the context of a common market, the repercussions will be much more serious and the element of unemployment will increase out of all proportion. I make this plea for the safeguarding of the jobs of our workers. There is plenty of evidence to show that the signing of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;this preliminary step to entering Europe&mdash;has caused serious dislocations in industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one need accept my word for this because we learn every day from news media of the closure of factories and of the laying-off of men and women.  This is particularly true of those vulnerable industries such as the motor assembly industry, the boot and shoe industry, the textile and clothing industry, the jute industry, the woollen and worsted industry and many others. It is difficult to understand the apathy of the Government to this growing volume of closure, to these financial and trading difficulties and to the human misery that results from these difficulties.  Their approach to the negotiations of our agreement with the countries of the EEC is pathetic in the extreme.  Instead of acting honestly and honourably in this matter, admitting that we are a small country, underdeveloped and suffering from serious chronic ills, we have our Minister for Foreign Affairs purporting to accept the Rome Treaty in its entirety.  He has made no serious effort to lay down the kind of conditions we will require so badly if we join the EEC.  This pathetic posturing has got to stop.  The Government must face up to their responsibilities. They must safeguard the jobs of our workers, the livelihoods of our small farmers, of our fishermen and our shopkeepers.  All the evidence is there of rising unemployment.  There are now some 70,000 persons on the unemployment register.  This does not take into account some 40,000 boys and girls <Col N="786" /> leaving school each year.  Neither does it take into account the large numbers of women, single and married, who are available and willing to work; neither does it take into account the numbers who opted for early retirement and who, if they had not done so, would now be listed as unemployed.  The situation in regard to unemployment is truly appalling and it is worsening day by day.</P>
    <P>My appeal to the Government is to take action and, in the first instance, to amend the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in order to stem the rising tide of imports of so many commodities, a tide which is having an adverse effect on the livelihood of so many thousands of industrial workers in this State.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement has meant the lowering of protective barriers and the result is that all our shops and stores are cluttered up with foreign goods, the vast bulk of them British.  It has meant the taking over of our distributive trade by foreigners.  All this makes a mockery of the Buy Irish campaign.  If the Government are hell bent on getting into the EEC it behoves the Government to strive to ensure that we have a healthy economy and that the inroads being made upon us by these industrial giants of Europe will have no further dislocating effect on Irish industry.  We are bargaining to get into Europe at a time when our economy is at its lowest ebb, when our national resources are weakest and when so many industries are clearly vulnerable to foreign competition.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to realise that there is no certainty that this country will be admitted into the EEC.  There is a rising tide of public opinion against this idea and this ideal in the British Isles.  It has been said that three-quarters of the people of Great Britain are opposed to joining the EEC.  If this Government presented the facts fairly and honestly to the Irish people I believe there would result here a rising tide of indignation.  Even in the benches of Fine Gael there are now serious reservations about their support of the Government's venture into the EEC.  We now have qualifications coming from the leading <Col N="787" /> spokesmen of Fine Gael.  They were mentioned here this evening by Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick.  There are overtones of uncertainty.  &ldquo;If we do not get proper conditions,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we ought not to join.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not opposed in principle to going into Europe.  The party I speak for is not merely nationalist in outlook, it is international as well. Poverty and insecurity in any part of the world are a threat to freedom and prosperity and we welcome the opportunity of going into Europe and joining with our European colleagues there, but we want to go in as equal partners.  We want to have an effective say in the administration of affairs in Europe.  We do not want to be treated as a poor relation who has nothing to contribute.  We do not want to go in under the coat-tails of John Bull.  We realise that, if Britain goes in, we have no option but to go in. We must follow the market to which upwards of 80 per cent of our produce goes.</P>
    <P>We are gravely perturbed, however, at the attitude of this Government and its spokesmen who are trying to pretend that they are leading us into a Valhalla, in which prosperity will abound and no one will ever again see a poor day.  They seek to pretend that there is no threat to our sovereignty, to our traditional independence or neutrality.  All this is quite untrue and they know it to be untrue.  They seek to pretend there is no threat to our culture or our traditional way of life. Of course, there is a most serious threat to our ancient way of life in going into the EEC.  Obviously the Government are seeking the opportunity of going into this great economic bloc in the hope and the belief that some of the gilt will rub off and give a boost to this ailing economy of ours.</P>
    <P>One wonders why they are not seeking to strike a harder bargain in respect of safeguarding jobs and the land of Ireland.  Entry into the Common Market means the exchange of men, money and materials, without let or hindrance, and, irrespective of what the Minister for Lands said this afternoon&mdash;he <Col N="788" /> would discriminate against foreigners to ensure that the land of Ireland is retained in the hands of Irishmen&mdash;he cannot discriminate against the foreigner in this matter and well he knows that.  He knows, too, that the whole concept of the Common Market is to do things in a big way; big business, interlocking companies, cartels and monopolies, these are the order of the day.  So are big ranches. This means, and Mansholt has said so, the elimination of the small farmer.  It constitutes a most serious threat to the fishermen around our coasts.</P>
    <P>We want the Irish people to discuss this in a factual way.  We want all the facts revealed.  We want them to be told what I am stating here tonight. For the ordinary people it is likely that there will be an increase in their cost of living of up to 20 per cent.  This is not my forecast.  It is the forecast of those far more qualified than I that the increase in the cost of living of the Irish people will be up to 20 per cent, and perhaps more.</P>
    <P>In a situation in which we have the Government seeking to impose a wage freeze on our people and on our workers it is a shocking prospect that we will have such a worsening in the standard of living of our people without reasonable and proper redress.  Therefore, I say that it might not have been necessary to involve us, our industrialists and our workers in free trade with Britain.  Over the past six years we have been involved in such an agreement. During those six years the protective barriers have been coming down on all goods imported from Britain.  We have seen the result.</P>
    <P>We have seen the dislocation of industry, the unemployment, the redundancies which have arisen.  Before that agreement was signed, many of us forecast that industrial graveyards would result from it.  We said that the battle we were taking on was a battle between a pigmy and a giant, and that our industrialists simply could not cope alone with the industrial giants of Britain. This has been proved to be true.  We were told we were pessimists.  We were told we were moaning Jeremiahs.  We were told we were doing a national disservice by saying those things, but <Col N="789" /> industrial graveyards have resulted. Factories are falling like ninepins. Workers are being thrown on to the unemployment scrap heap every day. There is no attempt by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Taoiseach, or anyone else, to amend the free trade agreement with Britain and say: &ldquo;This must stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It was all the more deplorable because, in fact, we enjoyed free trade with Britain and we could at the same time safeguard our native industries with our system of tariffs and quotas. We did not have to do this damnable act.  We did it in preparation for Europe.  Now, if Britain does not join, this will have been a stupid, dangerous and costly exercise for the Irish people and especially for the Irish working classes.  There is no certainty that Britain will join, be it under a Conservative or a Labour Government. They are hard-headed businessmen. They will go in on their own terms only, and they will see to it that the British people and their Commonwealth associates are adequately protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is prepared to go in with his hands up and to accept the Rome agreement hook, line and sinker.  This is a shameful posture for a man who could and should say: &ldquo;I represent a small community,&rdquo; and point out the economic ills of that community.  I believe he would be met fairly and honestly by his counterparts in Europe.  We do not trust this Government to negotiate for and on behalf of the Irish working classes.  They have never shown a true concern for the welfare of these workers, despite their 30 odd years in power.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that.  It is the lack of responsibility in facing up to this matter which appals us. There is a growing number of people in these islands who are vehemently <Col N="790" /> opposed to entry except on the right terms.</P>
      <P>We are opposed to going into the Common Market because it will mean for us a unique loss of sovereignty, a loss of national independence and a loss of our traditional neutrality.  The free trade agreement with Britain has meant a loss of industrial employment which we do not seem to be able to recover.  It has meant increased emigration, a closing down of large segments of our industry and a rapid take-over by foreign cartels and foreign capital.</P>
      <P>Entry will mean the more rapid elimination of the people of rural Ireland, 50,000 of whom left, or were forced to leave, within five years in recent times.  It will make for the elimination of the small farmer and it will present a great challenge to our fishermen.  It will increase the cost of living on all our families by about 20 per cent.  It will constitute a threat to our national identity and our cultural distinctiveness.</P>
      <P>One must sympathise with the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Kennedy, when he talks about this matter and says that it will strengthen the possibility of the revival of Irish and the retention of our Irish way of life.  I believe that entry into Europe and the free exchange of men, money and material which arises therefrom, to those of us who are consciously moral in this matter, constitutes a serious threat to the traditional family life in Ireland.  Under our Constitution the family is designated as the natural, the primary and the fundamental unit group of our society, possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights antecedent to all positive law.  It is clear to all of us, I am sure, that we will be subjected to the influences of Paris in respect of family life in this country.  Many of the things with which we are concerned now, lest they be permitted, must of necessity be commonplace.  What is the likelihood of immoral literature and pornography invading our lives and our homes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely pose the question. At the same time, I would not be prepared to accept that kind of guarantee.  This pretence of concern for our language and culture by the Government spokesman comes ill at the present time because they were the people who, despite their pretence to republicanism, entered into the free trade agreement with Britain six years ago and by this decision abandoned their old traditional policies, the Sinn Féin protectionist policies.  Whether we like it or not economic dependence on Britain or on the countries of the EEC also implies political dependence.  The association with Britain at the present time is a rigid association and integrates us with Britain more than did the Act of Union itself.</P>
      <P>In the matter of competition we believe the advantage will lie all the time with the countries of the EEC and Britain.  We shall have to contend with the gigantic forces of Britain and our industries are not equipped to meet that challenge.  It will be one of foreign super-salesmanship, of supra-nationalism, of the creation of the ring, the monopoly and the cartel.  The Government should spell out clearly to all sections directly involved that if and when we join we shall be abandoning our right to impose tariffs and protective quotas.  We shall have no power to sign treaties.  We shall have no power to come to the aid of industry or agriculture by the provision of subsidies, grants and State aid which they have enjoyed over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt whether we shall be able to stop non-nationals from buying land despite the high sentiments expressed by the Minister for Lands this evening. I respect that this is what he would wish to do but Deputy Fitzpatrick on the other hand pointed out as a lawyer that the court at Brussels can determine who shall buy land in any particular country and can give non-nationals the power and the right to buy land.  The decision of the court in Brussels supersedes the decision of the High Court or the Supreme Court in that regard.  I do not see what degree of manoeuverability or independence we shall have to determine our own future when one considers we shall only be entitled to three out of <Col N="792" /> the 61 votes in the European Parliament. One can easily imagine the situation in which the Irish representatives will find themselves in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have adverted to the elimination of the small farm and I have already refered to the Mansholt plan.  The Mansholt policy is to get rid of the large surpluses of agricultural foodstuffs, such as 520 million tons of surplus butter and the 350,000 tons of surplus skimmed milk in 1970.  His method of getting rid of these surpluses is to get rid of the producers and this very definitely means the elimination of the small farmers.  Indicative of the Mansholt plan is the fact that there has been a reduction in the number of small farmers in Europe in the past decade from 10,000,000 to 5,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That was long before the Mansholt plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mansholt plan was designed to accelerate the elimination of the small farmer.  We are also concerned about the rising cost of living which is bound to come about if we join the EEC.  It has been said that the price of butter will be 10s. a pound, steak 15s. a pound, and pork 10s. a pound.  There will be substantial increases in all commodities.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that this debate is limited.  My colleague, Deputy O'Leary, has yet to speak.  I do not want to detain the House unduly but I think it is fair to say that the Labour Party desire very much that we shall not be misrepresented on this issue.  We stand alone in this House in our opposition to both the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and this agreement with the EEC.  We are not ready for that kind of union.  We are too underdeveloped and too vulnerable.  This Government have failed to take the necessary steps to rectify the situation down through the years so that we might go in with a degree of confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned primarily with the livelihood of our fellow-workers.  If employment is to be found we want it to be found by the Shannon, the Suir, the Lee and the Nore and not by the banks of the Seine, the Tiber or the Rhine. <Col N="793" /> We want to see essential safeguards provided.  No serious attempt has been made to provide these safeguards.  We are particularly concerned about the haphazard, lackadaisical approach of our Ministers going to Brussels pretending that this is no problem for us, that we can accept all the conditions of the Rome Agreement and all the repercussions arising therefrom and that is of no concern to the Irish people.  Most of all we do not believe that this Government can be entrusted with that great responsibility.  I do not wish to introduce an acrimonious note but it is fair to say that the events of recent times in this country are well known abroad.  This Government have lost not merely credibility but they have lost integrity in the eyes of European and world statesmen.  In these circumstances, and having regard to the other matters to which I referred, we cannot condone, approve or ratify the present undertakings until or unless more dedicated and more honourable men are making Ireland's case.</P>
    <P>We are not against the principle of joining Europe and we understand fully what benefits could accrue.  I have seen the concern for the welfare of people in various communities in Europe.  I have seen governments genuinely concerned for the welfare of their people, proved conclusively in rising standards of living, in full employment and in people protected adequately in sickness, infirmity and old age.  We should like to be associated with such humane programmes but we do not think the time is ripe.</P>
    <P>These are some of the sentiments I wish to express on this important issue in the hope that the Government will face up to their responsibility.  If and when we go in I hope that the Government will ensure that the best conditions are obtained and that there will be minimum dislocation of industry and hardship for our people.  It is the responsibility of a good Government to cushion the impact of these repercussions and this Government must be seen to act responsibly in this matter. They must give to our industrialists a modicum of hope for the future; they must give back to our workers some degree of security and give to our <Col N="794" /> farmers, shopkeepers, fishermen and all those involved some positive assurance that they will be protected adequately in the negotiations for entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>As a party we have been criticised for standing alone against the Government's proposals.  One would imagine there was something especially unusual about the defence we have made for not participating at this juncture in Europe.  Let me remind our critics that we are not alone in this stand.  Switzerland has remained out of the EEC and has no intention of joining the Community. Although Switzerland is a landlocked country in the heart of Europe it has adhered rigidly to its independence and its military neutrality. I understand that there is no anxiety in Finland to join the EEC.  Austria has little desire to join the Community and another country renowned for its traditional stance of neutrality&mdash; Sweden&mdash;has not as yet intimated any desire to join with the Six.  Spain, Portugal and Iceland have yet to join, or indeed to show serious inclination to join the EEC.  Therefore, when we say that little Ireland should stay out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This has been a long debate and there has been a lengthy interruption stretching over many months.  Therefore, it falls to my lot at the end of this debate to bring together the threads of arguments that animate the Labour Party's opposition to the application to join the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our opposition to this matter in the early 1960s might be regarded as one of the curiosities of Irish political life. The opposition of the Labour Party in that period was considered rather quaint and odd when one considered the apparent unanimity on this question. The senior Members of this House can recall that age of certainties <Col N="795" /> when the Taoiseach of the day was Seán Lemass.  It seems a long time ago and much has happened in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Certainly it was an age of certainties. There was little doubt but that we would be in the EEC by 1970 and the official bible of that period&mdash;the Second Programme for Economic Expansion&mdash;declared that we would be a member of the Community by that date.  It was assumed that Britain would be a member of the Community in 1970 and when negotiations were commenced between Britain and France in the mid 1960s it was believed in this capital and by our foreign service that real negotiations were in progress. Of course, we know now that no real negotiations were taking place at that time.  At that time we took the British view that there was only one obstacle to British entry, namely, the late President of France, and that when President de Gaulle departed from the scene all would be well.  We did not appreciate the French view at that period, namely, that Britain had not got over its imperial mentality and that it wished to maintain its special relationship with the United States.  We did not know that Britain wanted to do all this while at the same time entering Europe.  Properly the British application was rejected on the basis that they were not negotiating at all.</P>
    <P>We did not understand the nature of the EEC then, nor do we understand it now.  I refer to the Government approach throughout this period.  We did not understand in the 1960s that the Community was a political creation, we do not understand it now.  We thought then it was simply an economic package, an extension of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement; we still think on the same lines, if we are to judge from the numerous White Papers emanating from the Government benches.  Obviously we signed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement because we thought a temporary breakdown had taken place in the British negotiations.  That breakdown has now lasted for five years.  Negotiations have commenced again.  The defenders of the agreement <Col N="796" /> would have been astonished.  The people whom we saw signing it and asking us to come back in January, 1966 to endorse that agreement, would have been amazed were they to think that we should be still talking about Britain's accession to the EEC in 1971. We did not understand that the discussions which President Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan had in the Bahamas had more to do with Britain's rejection in the end than any negotiations on economic matters on entering into Europe.  We would have been astonished and our leaders would have been astonished to see any connection between both events.  They never understood what the political origins of the EEC were in the first place.  Deputy Aiken's knowledge of political matters was confined to a small geographical area of the globe.  He did not understand that politics existed in Europe and were involved in the EEC itself. The same misunderstanding and naivety of approach towards Europe is exemplified today in the handling of our negotiations.  The persistent weakness of the Government's conduct of the application has been the lack of understanding of the political forces in Europe and also a failure to understand the long-term objectives of the Community itself, and in both cases a failure to communicate to the Irish people these fundamental factors which are necessary in coming to any true appreciation of what accession to the Community means.  They communicated a child's view of Europe to the Irish people.  Their view was that there were no politics in Europe.  Europe was a matter of better prices for our farmers and a possibility that our workers might hold on to their jobs. It is a variation of the old aisling tale of help from abroad from the Latin countries and cash from some golden cup, a mystical belief in our mission in Europe and one which on this occasion would give us increased prosperity and better jobs.  They did not understand the politics.  There were to be no politics in this Europe and no ugly socialists either.  When they spoke of politics in relation to this Europe it was a kind of cold war version of Europe they believed in.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, it will be said in reply <Col N="797" /> that statements have been made by Government spokesmen relating to political unity in Europe.  If such speeches have been made, they stopped short at this kind of statement without spelling out the implications of what it might mean to this country or Europe.  It is a fair comment on Government speeches on the EEC to say that they shy away from political considerations or conclusions about the shape of the Europe of the future or the part of this country in it.  It was to be a purely economic creation and if any politics intruded into this area they were to be the kind of politics that suggested that Partition would end soon after we joined the EEC or some years after it.  In fact, as anyone who has examined the Community will know, political considerations between the Member States are the animating spirit of the Community. The Community is a political one and economic considerations are secondary to it in every decision now and in the future.  From the very outset the attitude of this party and its opposition stems from our fears for the future of Irish jobs.  This was our approach to the whole adulation of free trade throughout the 1960s.  This is why we opposed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  We were helped in this opposition by the lack of economists in our party then.  We found it a great help that we were not saddled with economists in our decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but our approach antedated the arrival of economists.  We are happy to find the economists supporting our political approach to this agreement in 1966. We are not happy about the effects of that agreement but we are happy that simple men looking at problems fairly can come to the correct conclusions. We understood that our economy, being an underdeveloped one, could not expand in perfect free trade conditions.  We still suffer from the simple lack of understanding of how it can come about that our industries can expand in conditions of perfect free trade.  We have looked at the <Col N="798" /> pages of economic history to find such a miracle and we have found none. Ours has never been a developed economy. The whole makeup of our economy makes us as an applicant unique among the applicants, one with unique problems.  That can be proved from the structures and from the proportion of our population employed in agriculture or by a measurement of the <i>per capita</i> income of the population. In this month's issue of the OECD <i>Observer</i> we are third last in a long list of countries.  That is our position in the league.  That is our situation when we say we are ready to comply with the full terms of the Treaty of Rome.  On page 101 of this book on the Common Market it is stated:</P>
      <P>Doubts about the wisdom of allowing Europe's major underdeveloped country</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is us&mdash;</P>
      <P>to join as a full member were largely dissolved by the charm, good sense and positive enthusiasm of the permanent heads of the Éireann Departments of External Affairs and of Finance who toured the capitals of the Six.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt the good humour of those men but I have reservations about their good sense.  I have been in trouble here before in doubting the qualities of the people in the diplomatic service. I doubt the good sense of the heads of the Departments whose enthusiasm and good humour persuaded these hard-headed Europeans that they could allow in &ldquo;Europe's major underdeveloped country&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been accused by Government spokesmen who know the sensitive nature of the working people and who know on what a slender basis that confidence is based when they have said that we are telling Irish workers that they are inferior.  We are not.  We are defending the birthright of every Irish worker to have his job protected.  It is the job of the Government to protect the jobs.  When we speak about the nature of our economy and the dangerous position in which the worker is placed in a free trade situation we do no more than our duty and we do no more than declare our allegiance to the worker's cause and interest.  It ill <Col N="799" /> becomes others, whose negotiations affect the worker and put his job in danger, to accuse us of forgetting his real interests.</P>
    <P>Britain is negotiating very seriously indeed now.  It would have been heresy to say ten years ago that Britain might not go in.  British public opinion has shifted perceptibly on this and it may never happen that Britain goes in, in which case we will have another alternative to discuss.  But, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is correct in saying that if Britain does not go in on this occasion it may be the last time that Britain would try. I think he has made that statement and I would go along with him in saying it, at least for a very long time.  It certainly would mean that our own accession to the Community would be postponed indefinitely or that certainly a different argument would commence. But they are now negotiating seriously and assuming that they get over their budgetary difficulties, their financial arrangements with the EEC, we shall know later this year whether these things will come to pass or not.</P>
    <P>Norway is negotiating.  The Government have just fallen today.  Norway has complained of the lack of regional policy.  It has referred to the fisheries problem which is not unique to Norway and to the agricultural industry. I referred earlier to the tremendous importance of political considerations in the make-up of EEC.  We recall that Norway, wishing to keep her agriculture out, having a different approach not having the same agricultural problems as we have, sought exemption for her agriculture.  It demonstrates the political considerations, which outweigh all economic considerations in the Community, when you remember that the understanding of the Norwegian Ambassador at Brussels was that the northern portion of Norway would gain exemptions in agriculture purely to maintain the population of that area for, in the words of the Commission, &ldquo;security reasons&rdquo;&mdash;these being the proximity to the borders of Russia.  Which political considerations are advanced by our fiat to maintain our rural population?  It would be very interesting also for Irish farmers to <Col N="800" /> know which are the political considerations which under-pin the agricultural price support system in Europe and to understand that it is not a secure system.</P>
    <P>Sweden is strong enough to stand by at the moment on the EEC.  We have this position of the applicants at the moment: Norway, with a Government fallen today, on the whole question of accession to the EEC; Britain, a Government negotiating very seriously; Denmark, pretty complacent about the position as well she may be, looking at her economy.  And, of our own negotiations it can be said that they are not really seriously facing up to Irish problems, or there is little evidence to suggest that they are.  There is little evidence to suggest that the Irish negotiations are emphasising the lack of a regional policy, that the Irish negotiators, although they may represent a party of reality, know the reality of Irish industry when they declare their acceptance of the idea that a five year transition period is sufficient to protect Irish jobs in the years ahead.  Of the four applicants, the one that is in fact doing least negotiating is the Irish applicant.  The one that is repeatedly stating its confidence in overcoming all obstacles is the one with least reason for feeling any way confident in facing any obstacles in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in this month of January we have 800 redundancies resulting from that agreement.  That is a staggering figure for one month especially when it represents 10,000, in round figures, for a year.  There is little evidence to suggest that our negotiators in that five year transition period are looking for large derogations from the terms of that transition period which would take out of that period large sections of our industry and give them a longer period of preparation. I have seen no such evidence spelled out.</P>
    <P>The clothing and footwear industries are obviously industries under penal servitude sentence in terms of the five year transition period which the Government are agreeing to, involving 20,000 to 25,000 working people.  This is a matter about which the trade unions are gravely concerned. <Col N="801" /> Here are problems and here are people in jobs and seemingly the negotiating attitude of the Government is one of indifference.  We are, in fact, Europe's periphery and apparently we are not making the strongest case of all for a satisfactory regional policy because of this weak position.  There is no emphasis on that point from Europe's periphery&mdash;ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is interesting also to find in Swann's publication <i>The Economics of the Common Market</i>, page 117&mdash;a very good reference in regard to lack of a regional policy in the Community at present:</P>
    <P>A glance at the map of the Six quickly reveals that the most highly developed regions form a block of concentrated economic activity centered on the Rhine-Rhone axis, extending from the Netherlands in the north to Northern Italy in the south. In 1963 a report to the European Parliament estimated that this area covered about 35 per cent of the land area of the Community but accounted for 45 per cent of its population and about 60 per cent of its gross product.  Inevitably, the question arises as to whether a far reaching process of economic integration will lead to an acceleration of this concentration to the detriment of the relatively peripheral areas.</P>
    <P>Then in brackets is added:</P>
    <P>Within the context of British membership of EEC the question can be put in this way&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a very interesting question for an English publication to put, by the way, in terms of this lack of a regional policy on the part of the EEC&mdash;the question they put is:</P>
    <P>Will Britain become the Northern Ireland of the Common Market?</P>
    <P>The question that should present itself to our minds is that on the basis of the present Government's conduct of the negotiations, will Ireland become what the Aran Islands now are to the mainland of Ireland?  This is a question for us to think out in regard to our application and our negotiations at present.  Of all countries seeking <Col N="802" /> EEC membership the lack of a regional policy in that institution must most hit our interest and our position. Yet, the various reports of negotiations that we have give one little confidence that this life or death significance for us of a regional policy in the EEC is properly appreciated on the Government's side.</P>
    <P>One might ask if the entire implications of an economic monetary union have been spelled out.  From the official publications it would appear they have not.  Have the implications of the Werner report for our economy been worked out?  Has the idea of a single economy in Europe been worked out and what implications will it have for us?  A single European currency and the whole idea of budgetary arrangements that harmonise with each other&mdash;what would be the position of an Irish Minister for Finance in such a situation?</P>
    <P>The point to be made is that what started out as a customs union, as a simple agricultural market, is now something qualitatively different.  I made this point before in a previous debate: there is so little difference in emphasis between the way our negotiations have been conducted on this round of talks on our application and the way we conducted a previous round in the early '60s that there appears to be little recognition that there has been a change in the institutions in the meantime.  A political union, in fact, is the next stage.  All the manifold implications of this situation have not been explained to the people.  The Government and their spokesmen have side-stepped the awkward implications&mdash;and there are many awkward implications&mdash;involved in our accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is to the honour of this party that alone of the parties represented in this House we have done our best to bring into focus the disadvantages of accession to the EEC, disadvantages which have not been referred to adequately by other parties in this House; that alone of the national parties we sought to inaugurate a debate here on the whole position because we felt it was necessary in face of the seeming indifference of this Government, the <Col N="803" /> long tenure of office apparently making them indifferent to the real position in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>We have suffered for our stand.  In the first phase it was considered a fellow-traveller posture to criticise the application, and even at this stage we find peculiar expressions used towards critics of the Government's policy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Hillery, in one of his airport seances referred to the enemies of Ireland.  This must have been a rehearsal for the RDS a fortnight ago.  We probably should have been on our guard but he did use that peculiar expression in relation to our criticism of the Government's application.  Realising that this Government are the Government of all the people, including working people, if we succeed in bringing that Government to their senses we will have performed a service for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Most of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen, which includes Mr. Lemass and the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; with the possible exception of Deputy Childers who has been struck by the lyrical aspects of our entry to the EEC, the monks of Charlemagne's court and so on&mdash;have been satisfied with adumbrating the solid advantages of joining.  Without misrepresenting them one could say that the idea was sold on the basis of higher prices for farmers : British prices are low; EEC prices are high.  We just enter the EEC and we get the higher prices.  In the meantime something will happen to save Irish industry, investments will come from somewhere and jobs will be retained.</P>
    <P>The people who have been most duped in the whole affair are the farmers.  I do not think their organisations have done a service to the farmers in not alerting them to the problems attendant on membership.  There may be higher prices for some Irish farmers, but as to the effects of entry on small farms, none of the people in Brussels hide their real intention towards farming in the EEC, the intention to take people off the land.  I am not saying this is not happening <Col N="804" /> at the moment but it would be wrong not to point out that it will be intensified in EEC conditions.  It will be. We are told there will be fewer farmers but they will be more prosperous.  Will they be as prosperous as is suggested?</P>
    <P>It is true that in the early 1960s the price increases for agriculture would have been unanswerable and the Government case then for Irish farmers on the basis of increased prices was unanswerable.  Let that be said.  However, the case is not unanswerable now.  Inflation has cut into farm prices in the EEC.  In fact, there is a silent conspiracy among the Government of the Six to allow inflation to do its dirty work.  There can be no political or human agency when inflation is taking all the unpopular decisions of member Governments.  The agricultural lobby in the EEC is on the retreat. No matter how many cows may be brought into the Brussels Parlour the fact is that the Government of the Six, by a gentleman's agreement are allowing the present volume of price supports for agricultural products to run down.  Therefore, the Irish farmers' organisations are not standing by their members and outlining these dangers. Irish farmers are being led up the bridle path.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement has all the ingredients for the destruction of industry and commerce in this island and that by 1975 that creature of Fianna Fáil negotiations the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement would have done all that was necessary to destroy it.  We do not deny this.  We do not deny that there is not enough fissionable material around this country in the hand of this Government to put every man and woman out of a job but a great proportion of jobs are in jeopardy.  I have a copy of a letter here from the vice-President of the Transport Union, &ldquo;Urgent by Hand&rdquo;, addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and dated 5th March, 1971, part of which I should like to quote :</P>
    <P>... We have represented to you also our concern about the impact which the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the possible <Col N="805" /> EEC climate is having or can have on certain sectors of Irish industry and we have been especially concerned at the plight of textiles where there has been a substantial loss of employment over the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say :</P>
    <P>In the broad area of concern for the future, having regard to the impact which the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is having on Irish industry and on Irish competitiveness, we have to suggest most strongly that the Government would immediately avail of the provisions of Articles 1, 18, 19 and 23 to initiate a major review of the terms and provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement so that appropriate protective measures to safeguard the future of Irish industry may be taken.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that all these things are in that agreement signed by the Government opposite.  However, that agreement is at this moment weakening our competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC. The Federation of Irish Industries saw this some time ago when they referred with alarm to the effect this agreement was having on the home market and on the competitiveness of Irish firms. Of course, that agreement was a misconception of the realities of the EEC. It was a mistake, another monument to the Government's ignorance of events abroad in matters of trade, commerce and politics.</P>
    <P>The peculiar thing is that throughout this debate there has been a tendency to suggest that the Labour Party's approach is peculiar and unsocialist. May I say we are in the good company of most of the European socialist parties as they looked upon their countries' accession at the appropriate times over the past few years. We are in the company of the Italian, German and Danish parties, all of whom at various times voiced their objections to particular aspects of their Government's negotiations.  Admittedly, the Dutch and the Belgians, for historical reasons, had a different approach.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have been accused of being isolationist.  This is ironic coming from the Government <Col N="806" /> party and, indeed, coming from certain spokesmen of the chief Opposition party.  It is ironic that the only party in this House having international connections and affiliated to other European parties should be accused of being isolationists.  No other party in this House have as we have, fraternal relations with the socialist parties of all the major countries in Europe.  In fairness, therefore, how could we be described as being isolationists?  Related to our central preoccupation with Irish jobs, and we admit that our preoccupation is with Irish jobs, was the feeling that other matters related to that preoccupation&mdash;neutrality and sovereignty&mdash;were very important as a bargaining basis, that it was very important to utilise whatever advantages there were in our independence for the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this preoccupation of ours is isolationist and that it does not add up to the adult approach of the other two parties.  I might say at this point that the Fine Gael amendment asks the Government to do everything possible during the present negotiations to safeguard Irish interests.  Based on the policy matter before us which is the conduct of negotiations by the Government, Fine Gael because of their position on this vital matter could be described accurately as being one of Fianna Fáil's most loyal oppositions.  I hope that that remark will not be taken personally or with rancour.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan spoke today in tones of opposition to the Government's application and their conduct in relation to negotiations but tonight there was no real opposition in this regard or throughout the 60's to Fianna Fáil's free trade adventures.</P>
    <P>Did anybody, two, three or four years ago, hear the case explained adequately in relation to our concern for the Irish fishing industry?  I do not recall that they did.  It was not until Norway voiced her objection that the Irish Government discovered there were fish around our coasts which might be taken by the French or the Germans in Common Market conditions.  There have been omissions as there has been mishandling in the conduct of our negotiations.  We accept that in trying <Col N="807" /> to face up to the implications of the Irish situation, we could be misrepresented, that it could be said by our enemies that our position was one that was isolationist, that was anti-national and one that did not reflect the true feelings of the people of the country. As a responsible Opposition we believe it to be our duty to point to the indifference of the Government in relation to the negotiations as we must point also to the lack of information. This lack of information has been referred to time and again and I think it was a Fine Gael speaker who referred some weeks ago to the lack of information as to the prospects for Irish jobs within the EEC.  White Papers will not tell us what will be the position in relation to Irish jobs at the end of the five year transitional period.  We considered it to be our duty to oppose this Government and to force them into the open.  We considered it our duty to make the people aware of the import of the Government's whole approach to EEC membership.  I do not know whether we succeeded in doing that because the question is often put: &ldquo;Are you for or against Europe?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I accept that should the British join, with whom the Government have tied us hand and foot under the Free Trade Area Agreement&mdash;which agreement will certainly do its work in the economy during the next few years whether or not we join the EEC&mdash;it will then become necessary for this tied economy, whose major export markets are in Britain, to come to an arrangement with the enlarged Community. Of course, there is no guarantee that Britain will decide to join. The position of the British Labour Party is that they will await negotiations before they decide whether to support or oppose membership.</P>
    <P>It ill becomes the Government opposite to taunt us because of our opposition with lack of a geographic alternative to that situation.  It ill becomes a party who have been in Government almost continuously since 1932 to taunt us with the result of their labours&mdash;an economy tied to Britain, an economy that allows us very little manoeuvrability in 1971, 1972 or 1973 <Col N="808" />&mdash;but that is their attitude.  They act as if this broken economy were some sort of socialist invention that we brought about.</P>
    <P>If Britain decides to join the Community, we must then ask ourselves what kind of relationship with the Community would suit us best.  I do not accept that it is a clear case of black and white.  Who is to say what other forms of relationship may yet be devised between the Community and other countries?  Who is to say what will be the end of the road in relation to Sweden who are not joining because it would damage their traditional neutrality and since they would not depart from that neutrality?  Who can say with certainty that, in an evolving Community situation, the only alternative is full membership or a trade agreement? Will other forms of association be devised in the years ahead?  We do not know.  Yet, we now have the responsible Minister telling this House that full membership suited us totally at all times and that any idea of associate membership could not be considered. There is the whole question of State aid which I do not have time to go into.</P>
    <P>How will this fare within the EEC? Large numbers of our work force depend for their jobs on State industry. I am aware that the different member countries have not complied totally with the terms of the Rome Treaty. Have the Government sought any particular assurance for the large number of employees who are engaged in State industry?  Of course, we shall accept the democratic decision of the Irish people in relation to the EEC but because of the mistakes made in the past by this Government on the basis of a misunderstanding of the events and because of their apparent lack of appreciation of the political motivation of the Community and since they can abandon, almost without being asked, the whole idea of neutrality, how can we place our destiny in their competence to deal with the jobs of the majority of our people?  I am speaking about the entire handling of our trade abroad by Fianna Fáil from the Lemass period through the Lynch period.  One can have no confidence in them because of the mistakes they have made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> We have sought all along to fill our opposition with real objectives and I shall conclude by mentioning the position of the Labour Party should the Government go ahead with their application.  I quote from our <i>Administrative Council Statement on Irish Entry into the EEC:</i></P>
    <P>12.1 Labour does not have to be reminded that the Government, if it continues in office, has a majority sufficient to give parliamentary approval to any terms of a treaty of accession to the European Communities. If the Government pursue their negotiations, which they will if Britain are doing likewise, then Labour will fight within the Dáil on the terms of the Treaty.  If full membership is approved by the Dáil on the Government's present terms, then Labour will fight in any referendum that arises to amend the national Constitution.</P>
    <P>Within the Dáil, Labour will seek to have the following principles accepted without prejudice to the party position :</P>
    <P>(1)  The underdeveloped state of our industrial sector must be recognised by the EEC and no net loss of industrial employment must result from membership;</P>
    <P>(2)  The social structure of our rural community must not be damaged by the enforced implementation of the EEC agricultural policy.  The special dependence of the Irish economy on agriculture must be recognised and safeguarded;</P>
    <P>(3)  The impact of membership on the balance of payments must not worsen to any extent an already serious situation;</P>
    <P>(4)  The entire area west of the Shannon, the three counties of Ulster under our jurisdiction and West Cork and Kerry must be given special facilities for industrial development.  The special position of the Shannon Free Airport must be maintained;</P>
    <P>(5)  The national policy of neutrality in relation to international <Col N="810" /> military blocs must be maintained;</P>
    <P>(6)  In particular, there must be no loss of national sovereignty over our land, fisheries or natural resources and there must be strict limitations on the rights of foreigners to purchase Irish land;</P>
    <P>(6)  There must be no dissimilarities in the treatment of areas on either side of the Border within the context of an EEC regional policy, if ever drafted and implemented.</P>

      <P>If the joys of birth are increased by the length of labour, then Ireland's being brought into the European world should be an extremely happy occasion because we have now, under various guises and with different degrees of intensity, been debating this matter for the better part of the last decade.  I take leave at the outset to differ from Deputy O'Leary on one vital matter.  He said tonight that the Norwegian Government fell today because of the European Economic Community and its negotiations for entry to that Community.  That is not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Norwegian Government fell today because the Prime Minister was caught out in an untruth and the difference between Norway and us is that their integrity compels governments to resign&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when found out in an untruth.  In Ireland, however, we are ruled by a Government who presume to say there is a distinction between an untruth and perjury.  God knows, when one reviews the events <Col N="811" /> of the last nine months and looks at what is still going on within the precincts of this House, one sometimes feels that even members of that discredited political organisation, known as Fianna Fáil, have long since forgotten the difference between an untruth and perjury.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, the only other matter of fundamental difference from Deputy O'Leary to which I wish to refer is when he criticises those whom he referred to as the Éireann Heads of Departments.  He queried the skill of our negotiators.  We must accept and, I am sure, the Deputy will, on reflection accept, that the ultimate responsibility for the conduct of our negotiations lies not with civil servants but with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and with the Government.  It is on the Minister and the Government that any criticism must fall.  I think considerable criticism must fall in that they have permitted such a state of disarray to exist in Government circles that they have lost all sense of priorities and they have been so disturbed by their internal dissensions as not to give proper attention to negotiations over the last year in particular.  We are, I think, very fortunate in that we have negotiators on the administration side with the expertise, the skill and the charm to which Deputy O'Leary referred.  If we had not got that on the administration side I believe we would be in a very poor way, indeed, because the Government have long since lost any standing a sovereign government could expect to have in international circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the commencement of this debate last July the Taoiseach promised to brief the Opposition on negotiations. Until the Fine Gael group returned from Brussels recently and complained about the utter inadequacy of information from the Government there was no effort by the Government or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, to provide any information to or any briefing for the Opposition.  We have been told that last November an information service was established in the Department of Foreign Affairs for the purpose of providing information on negotiations for entry into the EEC. We have been inundated, I am glad to <Col N="812" /> say, with pamphlets galore from small private organisations, like the Common Market study group and the Irish Committee of the European Movement, and other bodies, which, at their own private expense, have gone to the trouble of stating their case in relation to the EEC.  But from the Department ment of Foreign Affairs not so much as a postcard has come from this information service established in the Department, with all State aid, and all State information, and all State techniques and the taxpayers' money last November.  I think it is high time that the Government, if they are in earnest about our application to join the EEC, endeavoured to see to it that the Irish people are properly informed.  Now is the time to win the people's minds to the necessity of Ireland joining the European Economic Community, with or without Britain, and it is a campaign that will certainly not be won if the Government neglect their duty of properly informing the people.</P>
    <P>Europe is moving, and moving fast, and we cannot afford to stand still. If we do not soon get on to the European bus we shall be left very far behind, so far behind that we will never in the foreseeable future be able to catch up.  One of the dangers at present is that, because of lack of knowledge and because of the Government's inactivity in providing adequate information, our people are being frozen by fear of the unknown into a nervous reactionary outlook.  Whether or not Britain joins the EEC and whether or not we join nothing will ever be the same again.  Ever since the establishment of the EEC new and challenging problems have faced this country year after year and, great as these have been up to now, they have been multiplied as Europe hastens the pace towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>One of our greatest difficulties since we achieved our political independence has been the fact that the domination of the British economy over our economy has prevented us matching political freedom and sovereignty with economic freedom and sovereignty. The EEC offers us an opportunity of escaping from the domination which has been exercised over us by reason <Col N="813" /> of our geographical proximity to the British economy.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect for a moment on what our forefathers knew, namely, that the British are, perhaps, the most selfish, the most egotistical and the most nationalistic race on earth.  Britons are reared to believe that they are superior to the rest of mankind and much of Britain's difficulty today arises from the fact that they find when they grow up that they are not, after all, superior.  We, on the other hand, are reared to believe we are the equals of others and we never find in our experience any reason to disbelieve what we learn when we are young.  This very attitude on the part of the British means that they approach the whole European concept from purely selfish motives.  It would appear that the British Labour Party, now in opposition, are prepared to put in jeopardy the whole concept of a united and sound Europe for purely selfish, political, partisan motives.  Likewise Mr. Heath is faced with the embarrassment that some of his more conservative supporters, including the Unionist members from the North of Ireland, are likely to oppose any proposal by the Conservative Government for the implementation of any treaty which the Government sign with the European Community.</P>
    <P>In the early stages of this debate Deputy Carter, speaking from the Government side of the House, said that the British always kept their word in business transactions.  Perhaps he regarded the Treaty of Limerick as a non-business transaction.  I do not propose to go back that far to indicate how Britain has broken her word but the Tánaiste is aware and the Irish people are aware, that three times since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in 1965, the British have unilaterally broken their bond.  Against the opposition, criticism, and pleas of this country the British have put their own selfish interests ahead of ours.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to make it perfectly clear that our application to join the EEC is independent of British interests, that we are not entirely dependent upon the British interests, that we are not entirely dependent <Col N="814" /> upon the British attitude, and that we do not propose to be the wren on the back of the British eagle.  In view of the present uncertainties about British accession, it is very important that we should make it clear to our European friends that, even if Britain does not join the EEC, we wish to keep our application open.  I am not making light of the problems which would then have to be dealt with and the terribly intricate negotiations there would have to be, not only between ourselves and the EEC, but also at that stage between ourselves and Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly be prepared to help the Minister and the Government to keep up their courage and to adopt that attitude.  We cannot continue as we are, under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. I believe our conditions will be disastrous by 1975 unless we take steps quickly to reverse engines.  I believe we will be on a collision course.  The time has come for the Government to use the emergency measures available to us to take remedial action where difficulties arise.  Certainly, serious difficulties are arising in our economy, particularly in our industrial economy, as one week after another makes so perfectly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was entered into in the expectation of both Britain and Ireland being members of the European Community. We have now gone beyond the half-way stage in the reduction of our tariffs.  Notwithstanding the great difficulties that we experienced, as great and greater than those experienced by the British, at no stage have we availed of our right to retard the pace of the reduction of tariffs.  I believe we have erred in so doing.  I know that our anxiety was to show not only to Britain but also to the world how ready we were to reduce our tariffs. <Col N="815" /> The time has now come, with the present critical state of our economy, with 6 per cent of our people unemployed, with the most severe rising costs and rising prices in Europe, with the worst industrial situation in Europe, with the lowest housing output in Europe, with the most miserable social welfare services in Europe, with the most penal taxes in Europe, when we are in dire economic and financial straits, for us to avail of our right under the Free Trade Area Agreement to suspend, at least for 12 months, any further reduction in our tariffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While we have been accused by Deputy O'Leary, I do not think with the intention of flattering us, of being a loyal Opposition, we believe in being loyal to the Irish people and loyal to the needs of the Irish nation.  Even if it is not politically advantageous for us, that is the line we follow.  In relation to Irish affairs we will not be a British Labour Party, prepared to play politics in the best interests of its own members in order to get into power.</P>
      <P>There are other opportunities that could be available to us if Britain does not go in to the EEC, and if we do. We would still get the bonanza of £100 million extra for our agricultural produce. We would also probably gain considerably from investment particularly by British industry and British money in Ireland anxious, if Britain did not go into the EEC, to use this country as a conduit pipe to get new products into the European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to sum up for the Fine Gael Party such a comprehensive debate.  The difficulty will be understood by those who appreciate that some people took anything from three to six hours in order to state their understanding of the European situation and when, indeed, precedent has <Col N="816" /> been broken by the Tánaiste seeking more time to reply than was available to members of the Opposition.  Therefore, I will be able to deal with a number of limited areas only.  The ones I have chosen have not been dealt with, perhaps, by some of our other spokesmen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed dealt with agriculture and Deputy Donegan dealt with industry and commerce and there is no need for me to go into any great detail in dealing with those aspects.  One of the issues upon which people appear to be becoming very heated and most indignant is the issue of sovereignty. It is proper to reflect that at present we have all the sovereignty possible. We have complete freedom to do as we will save in so far as we have entered into commercial and trade agreements with other countries, or financial agreements with international institutions, or to the extent that we have subscribed to conventions of an international character, like the European Convention on Human Rights or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Once any country subscribes to any belief, any convention, any tenet, any understanding, beyond its own control, it limits its sovereignty.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this modern world, this old concept of absolute sovereignty is something which is less respectable now than it was at one time. Absolute sovereignty belongs to the time of the kings.  The king was sovereign. Nobody had any right to challenge him.  The king could do no wrong.  The truth is that qualified sovereignty is a better guarantee of individual rights and personal rights. One of the great drawbacks in the achievement of universal happiness and universal rights, is that all countries have not subscribed to international conventions respecting individual rights, and that Europe alone of all the Continents of the world has an international convention and an international court to which individuals may make their plea when their individual rights are trampled upon.  It is only in Europe that we have a Court of Human Rights which gives the individual the right to complain.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, when we hear complaints about interference with our <Col N="817" /> sovereignty from what are regarded as extreme republican or nationalist elements in our community, to reflect that the first application by any individual in Europe to over-rule the decisions of the courts of his own country was taken by Gerry Lawless, a person who was accused of being a member of the IRA and was interned on that account under our laws.  Here we have a situation where an individual and his friends considered that the international courts conferred greater rights upon them as individuals.  As one who believes in the fundamental rights of individuals and the equality of all mankind, I regard it as progress rather than retreat to have this country subscribe to newer international institutions.</P>
    <P>Members of the existing European Economic Community and future members are not going to forget their national loyalties.  The Council of Ministers in the existing EEC represents the political and national attachments of the individual countries.  Indeed, in Brussels the Ministers who represent their own countries are regarded as being national egoists, because they insist opon the rights of their own people being considered.  They are in Brussels to remind the European Commission of the problems of individual countries.  While at home it may be thought that people who go to Brussels forget about home problems the reality of the situation is that the Council of Ministers and Parliament ensure that national interests are not forgotten.  One of the most effective contributions which Ireland could make to the future of Europe would be to insist that as the European Community expands parliamentary control is also increased.</P>
    <P>To some people European membership is still very remote.  Members of this House might do well to reflect that if and when Ireland becomes a member of the EEC ten Members of this House will have to spend up to four months a year abroad looking after the interests of the people of this country in the European Parliament until such time as there are direct elections when other people, or perhaps some people from this House, will be elected to represent this country in the <Col N="818" /> European Parliament in Strasbourg and Luxembourg.  These are the realities now facing us.  It might be a good thing to have these direct elections and to have Ireland as a member of the European Parliament because the remoteness of Brussels would not seem as intimidating as it now appears to be.</P>
    <P>There is another advantage available to this country from shedding some of our purely legal sovereignty in order to get real power and real control, the kind of power, control and influence which is available to large organisations but which is not available to a small State no matter how well intentioned it may be.  At the present time not a little of our difficulties, particularly in industry, are due to the fact that large international organisations set up subsidiaries in the industrial sphere in our midst, over which we have little control.  No matter how stringent we make our own laws we are unable to effect control over the large international cartels, many of which have an annual revenue far in excess of the GNP of this country. But within the EEC we would have available to us machinery, which we do not now have, to control these cartels and ensure that they would operate to the benefit of our people and not as they do now entirely at their own convenience and without regard to the consequences of withdrawing from our community as we have seen occur over the last year.</P>
    <P>At present these international cartels and their subsidiaries can hop from one country to another and abandon people at a time of greatest need.  It is significant that the European Commission have already used Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome to stop the injustice of international cartels and protect the consumers and protect individual economies as well.  Efforts to artificially inflate the price of quinine and dyestuffs were stopped. Notwithstanding the power, the might and the international influence of the cartels involved, the European Commission was able, by the exercise of the powers available to it, to prevent these organisations from abusing their dominant position.  I believe our economy will gain a great deal if we <Col N="819" /> join the EEC because we will be able to stop these organisations from abusing the dominant position which they have so effectively used, and about which we so frequently complain, in this House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>When people wail about our loss of sovereignty let us reflect that we shall still have separate representation in the United Nations, in the Council of Europe and in the EEC itself.  We shall still be able to use all our influence, all our techniques, all our skills and our friends to secure a better deal for Ireland.  At present we are in a situation where we are only a small boy in our principal international commercial relations, which are with Britain.  We do not have any friends to turn to.  That is why when Britain three times since 1965 unilaterally applied unfair sanctions on this country we could do no more than complain.  Within the EEC, if the arrangement which had been in operation between ourselves and Britain during the last five years existed, Britain would not have been able to do that because we would have been able to call on our friends.  Two hundred million people can talk to 55 million people far more effectively than 2¾ million can.  That is the reality of the situation which I believe it would be foolish for us to ignore.</P>
    <P>Another problem to which I wish to make brief reference is one of the Aunt Sallies of the EEC debate. This is an Aunt Sally which in fairness, I must point out was put up in the first instance by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, before him by the present Taoiseach and before him by his predecessor Mr. Seán Lemass where to the great surprise of members of the EEC these gentlemen volunteered to accept defence commitments which do not exist under the Rome Treaty and which nobody has since suggested within the EEC should exist.  Our Constitution very properly provides in Article 28 that:</P>
    <P>War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is no need to amend that <Col N="820" /> Article of the Constitution in order to accede to the Rome Treaty and gain membership of the EEC.  As far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned if there is ever any move on the part of any Government of this country to qualify that in any way or to take the right of declaring war from the Dáil, it will be strenuously opposed.  We believe a great deal of the opposition to the EEC would never have developed if only our Minister and the Government had been a little more careful in what they were prepared to undertake or declare.</P>
    <P>People should seriously reflect upon the changing significance of Ireland in any event so far as international defence commitments are concerned.  Ireland is only 1/6000th part of the total surface of the world.  In this day and age when missiles can be flung as easily from the ocean floor as from dry land. 1/6000th part of the world's surface is of no military significance, not to talk about the equal facility with which death and destruction can be inflicted from outer space controlled by man from earth.  It is pointless to wax indignant about membership of the EEC involving an abandonment of neutrality or involving us in a war in which we have no desire to be engaged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien painted a lurid picture of Ireland becoming a member of the EEC and on that account suffering extinction because of some political row in Sofia. The reality of the situation is that no matter how careful we or other countries may be, nobody can foretell precisely which countries might or might not be involved in any future world conflict.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the EEC was born out of a desire for peace in Europe and in the world.  The Community was created out of a desire that Europe would not ever again be the trigger of a world conflict.  At the time of its foundation the overriding consideration was peace within Europe so that the world would be at peace. Europe must never threaten world peace and it has no desire to do so.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of Members of this House and the public to <Col N="821" /> the fact that last September the Council of Europe at Strasbourg adopted a report which recorded the fact that the members of the EEC were now anxious to have as full members of the Community what were hitherto considered to be the neutral nations.  A united Europe will not be able to make an effective contribution to world peace, or to preserve peace within Europe, unless it follows a course of military neutrality.  If this is to be accepted, as a proper canon of European behaviour, reason dictates that Europe must receive within its membership the traditionally neutral countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>There are encouraging signs that within the next decade not only will Ireland be a member of the EEC but that Sweden and Switzerland will follow.  Reference was made today to the position of those countries and to Austria, and to the fact that they were not seeking membership of the Community. There were a number of errors in such references.  Sweden is, in fact, an applicant country for membership of the EEC but is awaiting the outcome of the present negotiations.  It is essential for Europe and for European peace that Ireland becomes a member because our accession will ease the path of the other countries.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in regard to the present negotiations which Fine Gael believe the Government have not handled properly.  We made reference to this in our recent statement although Deputy O'Leary has said that we appear to be the loyal Opposition and are not disagreeing with the Government about any point.  I must confess I was quite surprised at the inflammatory explosion we got from the Minister for Foreign Affairs as a retort to the Fine Gael statement on the return of the Fine Gael delegation from Brussels.  It was not exactly the kind of retort we would have got if Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were in agreement. The Government properly considered it necessary in Ireland's original application and in our statement of requirements to draw attention to the dangers to Irish industry as a result of dumping.  By dumping we mean the unloading of goods in quantity below <Col N="822" /> cost in a manner that could damage legitimate and efficient industries.</P>
    <P>In the only report we received from the Government on the progress of negotiations it is stated in paragraph 74 that in the light of information obtained in the course of negotiations the Government have not considered it necessary to pursue further the question of possible action against dumping or practices of a dumping nature after the transitional period.  Apparently the Government have informed the Community accordingly.</P>
    <P>We consider it deplorable that the Government should have made light of the information they received which entitled them, in their own view, to abandon their arguments against dumping without giving any information to anyone in Ireland about the information they received from the EEC which justified them in their action.  If the information given to the Government was of such a nature as to indicate that there was no need for us to have special provisions to protect our small island's economy against dumping they had a clear obligation to give that information in this report.  Therefore, I urge on the Tánaiste to give us tonight the information that apparently was so vital and helpful that it justified the Government in abandoning their plea for protection against dumping.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in the matter of protection against dumping our problems are not dissimilar to the problems that face West Berlin.  The latter is treated as a privileged entity within the EEC because of the peculiar difficulties of that city, its isolation and its considerable transport costs.  All these problems exist as between Ireland and the other countries of the Community.  A situation could easily arise in which an efficient Irish industry, manufacturing quite satisfactorily for the home market at a competitive price, could be wiped out of existence overnight by the slick operation of some British or European firm dumping goods below cost on the Irish market.  We want to protect ourselves against a situation in which any of these huge international organisations might decide to endure a temporary loss while they flood the <Col N="823" /> market below cost and wipe out of existence a viable Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The size and the remoteness of our market makes some of our industries particularly sensitive and the Government have a clear obligation to indicate to us now how their concern could evaporate on the basis of some information received from the EEC. The only way in which they can satisfy us is by giving us the information they obtained.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael would like to see a strengthening of the provisions so that, of our own volition, we could take immediate action to protect our industries and markets in the face of a clear attempt to dump goods.  There are obvious ways by which the EEC can assure that we do not abuse such a power if it were made available to us.  I await with interest, and I know this interest is shared by industrialists throughout the country, a statement from the Government in regard to this highly sensitive area.</P>
    <P>We criticise the Government that in the course of negotiations or in preparation for future membership of the EEC they have not developed regional and structural policies.  We criticise also the fact that even the Minister for Foreign Affairs has, if one is to judge by his recent statements, remained ignorant of the developments which are taking place even in the European Commission at the present time.  In his most recent utterance, which I have seen published in relation to the acquisition of land by foreigners, the Minister was not aware that the latest Mansholt proposals radically altered the suggestions which had originally been made.  The Minister for Lands has indicated that he is better informed than the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Quite clearly, Ireland's future within the EEC depends upon the immediate and full preparation of adequate regional policies.  Of course, it is fair to say that the EEC have not had any substantial or significant regional policies to date.  Within the existing EEC there is, to all intents and purposes, only one depressed area and that is Southern Italy.  The EEC have realised that the failure to develop <Col N="824" /> a regional policy for that area has meant a flood of people from southern Italy into northern Italy and Milan.  They are determined that this should not happen again.  They accept that the centre of Europe is too crowded already and that the best place for future development is on the perimeter.  It is not for Brussels to work out regional policies.  That is a matter for the Government of each region.  It is clear from the inactivity of our Government that they have not been developing policies for the south west, the west and the north west of this country which are areas of high sensitivity in which, if we had adequate policies, we could maintain the population there at present in greater comfort and with better opportunities than those now available to them.</P>
    <P>I agree with the speakers who have condemned the Government for their failure to alert the EEC in adequate time of the dangers of proceeding with the adoption of the policy on fisheries which has already been adopted.  I do not share the pessimism of some other speakers who stated that Ireland is now condemned for ever to the unfair fishery policies which have been adopted.  If our application succeeds we will be a full member of the EEC before the expiration of the three-year period of the existing fishery policy. We will, therefore, be in a better position with Norway, Britain and Denmark to bring our counsel to bear on future fishery policy.  The injustice of the present arrangement is apparent and is recognised, I believe, even in Brussels. Six nations, one of which has not got a coast line at all, which represent only 40 per cent of Europe's fishing interest have adopted a certain policy, but if the four applicant nations join the EEC they will represent 60 per cent of fishery interests.  I have every reason to believe that there would be a radical change in fishery policy.  It was not also insignificant that in the present EEC executive only three people out of a total civil service of 8,000 people have any knowledge or expertise of fishery problems.  That would radically change if countries representing 60 per cent of Europe's fishing interests were to join the EEC.</P>
    <P>From time to time in the history <Col N="825" /> of every nation there comes an opportunity to decide to progress or regress. The inescapable duty of a nation is to make a decision for progress.  Such a time is this now.  The greatest achievements of nations are not in constitutions, laws, documents or declarations but in the contentment, the peace, prosperity, happiness and good life of its citizens.  We believe that the Rome Treaty, the Treaty of Paris and the whole code of behaviour which has developed from them give Ireland the opportunity for peace, prosperity and national achievement to a degree much greater than that which we would exercise if we relied on our existing institutions.  Our primary obligation is to Ireland.  Our secondary obligation is to Europe.  Our overriding obligation is to all mankind. We believe that these obligations are better served by joining the EEC. Therefore, we support the application. We add a rider to the Government's motion which is that the Government should negotiate strenuously to ensure that the legitimate interests of Ireland are adequately protected.</P>

      <P>The debate on our entry into the EEC has ranged widely.  Evtry facet of the conditions under which we will accept membership has been discussed and debated. It is impossible for me to cover all the points which have been raised during the course of this long-ranging debate.  Many points have been answered already by my colleagues. The Minister for Lands today gave the most detailed possible presentation of our attitude in relation to the rights of nationals of the EEC to enter upon agricultural land.  There is no need for me to develop that point further. Any one who wants the latest information on the subject can read what the Minister for Lands said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal preoccupation in the minds of the Deputies was naturally relative to the conditions under which we could secure membership.  In this connection a number of questions have been answered by the mere fact that negotiations have proceeded since the debate first began.  The purpose of debate in the first instance was declared to be to discuss the White Paper on <Col N="826" /> our entry to the EEC and to discuss the implications of membership which were referred to in the White Paper published in April 1970.  The debate has, for normal reasons, gone beyond the ambient of that limitation.  When Deputy Cosgrave said that the debate would result in information being provided and attitudes being disclosed he was perfectly correct.  The public outside the Dáil and Members of the Dáil have been demanding two kinds of information.  First of all, they want information on the characteristics of the European Economic Community. It is true to say that the White Paper issued in 1967, the document issued in 1970 and the literature supplied by the EEC itself have provided the public with a great deal of information.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has now given full information on the present state of negotiations.  He has made many statements in reply to Parliamentary questions, and he will provide further reports as the negotiations progress.  On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government, I should say that if, as the negotiations proceed, Deputies of the various parties desire a further debate we will be quite willing to arrange for one-day debates solely in order to answer questions and to hear the views of the Deputies on the further events which take place as a result of the negotiations.  That should, surely, keep the House in touch with developments. There is now a wider public demand for information on the EEC and on our position in relation to membership. As the Members of the House know, a special information office is being set up in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Booklets and leaflets will soon be issued.  At the same time, it is true to say that my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has provided information from the Department on demand. Any one desiring to discuss the Common Market, discuss the advantages that lie to us in joining it, in the course of a debate down in the country, or any organisation that wishes to have information has been freely given this information by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  My colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, gave in very great detail <Col N="827" /> the extent to which the Common Market has been debated and, for example, the work that is being done by the private organisations referred to by Deputy Ryan in spreading information about the EEC and our relationship to it as a whole.</P>
    <P>The second kind of information that is being sought could be described as people asking for information on the consequences of our joining the EEC on practically every aspect of our daily lives.  It is very difficult to answer such a question.  It is very natural that people should ask for this kind of information in view of the momentous step we shall be taking if we are able to join the EEC, as we hope we will be. People are asking what the future holds for us in the '80s, ten years from now. This has been echoed by certain Deputies who want the Government to give a projection of what our economic position, our social life, our industrial position will be and not even three years after becoming a member of the EEC but in ten years time.  As everybody recognises, when you take a ten year period you move from the world of facts into the world of opinions and forecasts and estimates.  Even to describe what the economy of the country would be like if no question of entering the EEC arose would be difficult enough.  It would be very hazardous to predict.  The nearest prediction ever made was in that document which described how we would achieve full employment and it was recognised that the figures that were given, the forward projections for agricultural and industrial production, were based on a number of surmises purely hypothetical in character.  Therefore, to predict our economic and social future for ten years is a useful exercise in theory but it is very difficult to do because our world may be radically different ten years from now.</P>
    <P>The White Paper goes as far as possible to set out the consequences of membership within the limited terms of reference and the limited knowledge of facts that we have.  It would be very gratifying if we could give in detail the number of industries that would be likely to boom by the end of ten years, the number of new industries that might <Col N="828" /> be set up, the number of industries that might fail, the number of redundancies that might occur.  That is quite impossible because firms can fail for many reasons or make progress for many reasons.  They can progress or fail through suddenly changing technology, through sudden and utterly unpredictable changes of fashion or demand for certain products throughout the world.  They can change as a result of good or bad management or as a result of the failure of a firm to form some reasonable liaison with other firms in the same industry.  They can fail because of poor industrial relations and make progress because of excellent industrial relations.  Above all, they can fail because of excessive inflation. For example, we would be quite safe in saying that if the present rate of inflation which can be seen in some other countries were to continue through the next ten years we would not be able to play any useful part in any market or in any international community.</P>
    <P>In other words, we can make the negative statement that if the increase in the wage cost per unit of output which is now the highest increase in Europe, followed by the British, since 1963, were to continue on that basis we would not have any future in the EEC.  We expect, for example, that whatever happens, inflation will at least be measured into what is possible and will have some bearing on the total inflation going on in Europe and the rest of the world which is apparently, a permanent phenomenon.  We at least hope that inflation will be controlled. What I am trying to illustrate is that if anyone could tell me what 1981 will be like I should be very glad to hear it and so would the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>We have done some economic planning, ourselves and other countries, for three to five years at a time.  The EEC have a sort of economic plan lasting for three years and there are medium-term and short-term discussions between the Ministers to consider the progress made in the general concept of the plan, to look at short-term and medium-term problems.  In the case of our own planning some of our predictions proved very correct; some fell short.  The results of production fell <Col N="829" /> short of the targets.  It has been a mixed picture ever since we engaged in economic planning and that was for comparatively short periods of from three to five years.  Therefore, it is quite impossible for us to give an exact picture of what our world is likely to be by the time the 80s emerge if we join the EEC in 1973.</P>
    <P>We have heard criticism of the information provided to the effect that we have not sufficiently quantified the gains and losses to be derived from joining the EEC.  Exact quantification relates to calculations that must be made and if we make calculations we must take into account the following variables: the economic growth; the European Economic Community itself; developments that take place in the scale of industry; the availability of man power both among the Six, in our own country and in the countries applying for membership; the terms of trade likely to eventuate not only between ourselves and the Common Market countries but even between the Common Market countries themselves. Above all, we must take into account the rate of investment of income that will take place in each of the members of the EEC, in the EEC as enlarged and in relation to that the investment climate that is operating internationally. That climate must inevitably affect the climate of investment here. Then we have our own social and economic conditions which will affect the trend of investment in our own country.</P>
    <P>I might add in that connection that in looking at the whole growth of our economy we must take into account the growth of the services section which is now of great importance and accounts for quite a big proportion of our domestic production.  In the services section it is extremely difficult to predict changes in the pattern of production over a period.  The difficulties that surround the exercise of prediction have been well summarised by Mr. T. J. Baker who wrote an essay on management for the Economic and Social Research Unit in which he said:</P>
    <P>Normal economic forecasting rests heavily on the assumption that relationships observed in the past will, by and large, continue to hold good <Col N="830" /> in the future.  It also rests on the ability to make specific assumptions concerning the likely behaviour of certain prime variables on the basis of experience and knowledge of latest developments.  In the exercise of quantifying the effects of joining the EEC there are no relevant past relationships to be observed nor is there any basis for choosing one set of specific assumptions rather than another as these largely depend on the actual outcome of the negotiations. All that can be done is to construct alternative sets of assumptions and to attempt to calculate the effects of each without knowing which set is really to prove more realistic and without having any reliable knowledge of the underlying relationships.</P>
    <P>That was a very realistic statement which will be of interest to the House. Therefore, quantification is difficult. However, the relative Departments of State are making continuous studies and when the negotiations have been completed the Government will put before the Dáil the best quantification of the implications of membership that can be devised and calculated and the implications that relate to our acceptance of a given set of negotiation agreements. That is the best we can do and indeed it will be the best that any of the four applicant countries can do. There is no country better placed than ourselves in regard to quantifying the advantages of membership.  We will simply make the best possible estimate. We will have to make some major assumptions in presenting this estimate, for example, the likely response by agriculturalists here, by industrial firms, to the new situation, and above all, as I have said before, the willingness of all sectors not to demand more than is justified by the growth of production. We must also, as I have said, make some estimate in regard to the future level of economic activity in the new industries and opportunities that may arise as a result of the opportunities that lie before us in exporting to the Common Market countries.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account world economic trends and, as the House knows, the prosperity of America, the prosperity of various continents, can affect the prosperity of Europe and in <Col N="831" /> turn affect our prosperity.  We will have to make certain assumptions in regard to that as well.  We are living in a rapidly shrinking world that has become closely interlinked.  As Deputy Ryan and other speakers on both sides of the House said, the acceleration of interlinking organisations of every kind all over the world has limited the power of individual governments to exercise full control over their destinies, and we must seek a co-operative effort to ensure steady balanced growth.  We must do our best when we join the EEC, as I hope we will do, to persuade that Community to try to ensure steady balanced growth and to avoid recessions in trade, economic difficulties and monetary difficulties of a kind that have been seen in the course of European history during the last 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to join the EEC has been based on our firm belief that we will survive all of the difficulties, that we can flourish within the EEC.  Our decision is also based on our belief in the capacity of the Irish people to achieve a fuller life as part of Europe.  Having said that, I want to be very honest with the House and the public over this whole business. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has recommended me to make this further statement about how we judge the desirability of joining the EEC: our judgment in connection with the EEC is ultimately what I can describe as a value judgment.  All the forecasts in the world that we can prepare may help us but our political judgment in making application for membership is based ultimately on our knowledge of the Irish people and their potential capacity for social and economic growth.  I want to be frank with the House and with the country.  Ultimately our decision to make application does not really depend on the wealth of statistics that we can accumulate, on the short term and medium forecasts we can make; it ultimately depends on the political judgement of the Government and the political judgment of the members of all parties in this House and the recommendation they will make to the Irish people on this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for <Col N="832" /> me to enter into a discourse on Irish history.  However, I think I can say that when you look back on the long history of this country and at the frightful oppression which we suffered, when you look at us today with all our problems, you can say that there is no people in Europe with a greater capacity for tenacity, first of all, in the face of both favourable and adverse situations, and there is no people in Europe with a greater capacity for adaptation when they were forced to adapt themselves.  I might even refer in that connection to what has been a sad feature of our history but nevertheless illustrates one characteristic of the Irish people, the fantastic capacity for adaptation by those who have been forced to leave this country for many generations and to go abroad and the contribution they have made in the past far out of proportion to the numbers of our population in any period of time.  Therefore if I might mention what I would regard as one of the strongest reasons for our believing that the Irish people are prepared to take part in the EEC, I am sure the House will accept what I have said as a genuinely true statement. Consequently, as I have said, our ultimate reason relates to a political judgment based on our knowledge of the Irish people.  May I once again repeat what has been said by my colleague on the attitudes disclosed in the debate which indicate overwhelming support for joining the EEC, and I think this is reflected in the views of the people large and wide.</P>
    <P>Now I want to come to the opposition shown by the Labour Party. There have been dissenting voices in the Labour Party.  There has been an extraordinary amount of confused dissent of one kind or another.  I am not going to analyse all the speeches of the Deputies of the Labour Party in the hope of trying to find a means of reconciling the views of one Deputy with another.  They varied very widelv in their attitudes.  I do not know whether the recent developments in the Labour Party which were revealed at their annual conference mean that they have now set on a unified course of rejection of the EEC.  There <Col N="833" /> appeared to be an overwhelming majority for rejection of EEC membership at the last conference held in Galway and yet the Deputies here this evening did not appear to be following the <i>diktat</i> of the Galway conference in that some of them were mending their hand and saying: &ldquo;Well, if we have to join we have to join but let the Government make the best possible bargain,&rdquo; whereas other Deputies spoke in a different vein.  I very much doubt if there is any consensus of opinion among the members of the Labour Party or among those who follow the Labour Party outside the House.  Not all Labour Party Deputies are opposed to membership.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with some of the criticisms made by members of the Labour Party.  Some of them described the EEC as a bastard of monopolistic capitalism and said that they do not wish to have any connection with the organisation.  The EEC has been described as the last refuge of <i>laissez faire.</i> When one considers the governmental supervision in all countries on the EEC, I do not know how they can see very much of what remains of Adam's Smith's doctrine in the conduct of the Government of either the Netherlands or Belgium or France or Italy. However, they seem to see some ghost of Adam Smith within the present members of the EEC.  It is a mystery to me as to where they get that idea. They say there is no sense of social concern within the EEC but Deputy Treacy who spoke only an hour ago referred to the social concern of the Community and said they had made great efforts to improve the social welfare services within the Community. Therefore, there appear to be some contradictions among members of the Labour Party as to the existence of social concern within the EEC.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies said there was no concept of planning for growth.  If these Deputies would look at the growth of the GNP of the members of the Community, they would see the tremendous increases that have taken place.  It would appear that the gross national product of the members of the Community has grown enormously even if, according to members of the <Col N="834" /> Labour Party, these growths were not planned.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy described member countries of the EEC as an undemocratic group governed by a bureaucracy responsible to no one. Yet another member of the Labour Party described the EEC as a sort of relic of Hitler's new order and pointed to a situation where there could be slave labour.  Other Deputies of the Labour Party who wish us to negotiate for association purposes with this monster say that if we must be subservient to these capitalist tyrants, it might be a good thing to associate with them.</P>
    <P>Most of these criticisms have been dealt with by Fianna Fáil and by Fine Gael speakers so perhaps I should only go over the main issues.  The suggestion that the EEC is undemocratic does not stand examination.  There is a whole set of consultation procedures with which I shall not bore the House.  The Commission consult with the members representing the different countries. There is an economic and social committee and a sub-committee attached thereto on which there are representatives of producers, farmers, workers, merchants and the professions.  There are many other committees associated with the EEC on all of which we would have representation on becoming a member.  All of those committees indicate a great degree of constant consultation at every level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan referred to the European Parliament.  I agree with him that the present arrangements in relation to the democratic procedure of the Parliament are not perfect.  Obviously, we would like to see greater devolution in the administration of that Parliament but may I say that the greatest pressure for giving greater powers to the European Parliament has come from that monstrous bureaucracy, as it was styled by the Labour Party, the Commission itself who, in 1965, for example, recommended that the budget of the EEC should come under greater control by the Parliament, that Parliament should have greater powers in examining the budget and in making recommendations in relation to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> The European Parliament discussed the necessity for direct election to the Parliament by elections in each country. This is a matter on which both Deputy Ryan and I would agree.  The Commission&mdash;this monster of bureaucracy&mdash;strongly supported the concept that there should be a change from a parliament in which members are selected from the parliaments of the countries and members of all parties in each House of Parliament to universal suffrage whereby the people of Ireland would elect their representatives to the European Parliament.  If we join the EEC I am sure that Norway and Denmark would be very glad to have that change in the method of appointing members of the European Parliament and I am sure there will be complete unanimity in the House for our so doing and for our exercising all the influence we can in that direction.</P>
    <P>So far as the Council of the Community are concerned, there is a builtin mechanism for ensuring a balance of voting power.  I need not go into this in detail but relating the balance of voting power to the present members of the EEC and relating it to the total number of votes accorded to each country, if all four of the countries are admitted to the Community, the balance of voting power is such that the great powers cannot outvote the small countries on any issue in which it would be important for the small countries to have protection or from which the small countries could suffer as a result of proposals made by the larger powers.</P>
    <P>Some people have suggested that we will be in a minority of one, having no allies, when matters for discussion arise in which we are vitally concerned. Of course, this is not true. Within such a group as the enlarged EEC there will inevitably be continuous shifting alliances and voting by the members in different alliance.  We can be sure that on almost every occasion on which we will have a particular problem to solve, we will find someone who will help us.  From reading the whole history of the Community, it is evident that the great <Col N="836" /> powers have been particularly careful never to put themselves in the position of simply rolling over the smaller powers in the Community.  One of the results of that has been that, although there are arrangements for majority decisions to be effective by the application of a given majority rule in voting within the Council of Ministers on all important matters, it is now accepted that whatever should be the rules there should be virtually unanimity among all the members on all important decisions that have to be taken.  In this connection also I might add that the smaller countries who are now seeking membership, Norway, Denmark and ourselves, have a long tradition of democratic government. Norway and Denmark are countries of very different origin, personality and temperament from ours but they share with us a belief in parliamentary democracy and in democratic forms and traditions.  We can only be delighted that we are associated with two such countries who, during the past 100 years, have given a splendid example of democratic government and of social and economic growth. Whatever may be their problems, we could not associate ourselves with two small countries having a better democratic tradition than Norway or Denmark and I am sure I am expressing the views of the entire House in saying that.</P>
    <P>When those two countries are joined with us, we should be able to ensure an understanding that the small powers must be able to express their viewpoint. When I speak of shifting alliances I am quite sure that we will be able to express our views in an effective way in matters important to us.  There has been criticism of the fact that, within the EEC, there is supposed to be the growth of gigantic monopolies.  Deputy Rvan dealt with that supposition and pointed out the stringent rules to curb monopolies, including fines which can be fixed as high as 500,000 dollars for marketing schemes which result in excessive prices, or for price marketing sharing schemes which result in a deliberate attempt by a cartel to capture a market, or price fixing schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Members of the Labour Party have been mesmerised by the industrial giants within the EEC and by the fact that there is an inevitable growth of large industrial consortia of one kind or another arising from modern technology and from the breaking of national boundaries in matters of trade. This is occurring all over the world, apart altogether from the European Economic Community.  What the Labour Party failed to do was to tell the House that small firms are surviving well within the Community. Small undertakings of fewer than 100 employees per firm represent 89 per cent of all German industries, 95 per cent of all Belgian industries and 95 per cent of French industries employing fewer than 50 people.  While it is quite obvious that there must be mergers between some of these small firms, or rationalisation of marketing, as there is in the case of small firms in this country, encouraged by Córas Tráchtála, nevertheless, one can say, without fear of contradiction, to Deputies in the Labour Party that there is no diminution in the role of the small industry in the European Economic Community.  I do not want to play down the challenge to Irish industry and, in connection with our ability to take advantage of the EEC membership, we have been urging modernisation of industry for some ten years now.  As the House knows, grants have been given for the modernisation of machinery.  Grants are also given for industrial consultants who help firms to modernise and improve their techniques.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a moment.  I need not deal with the safeguards that will be available to us during the transitional period because they have already been dealt with by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In order to help firms which may have difficulties in facing free trade there are safeguards built into our arrangements with the European Economic Community, if we join the Community, and Article 226 deals with these safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> Having mentioned the challenge that faces Irish industry, it is true to say that many industries have already shown foresight and have prepared themselves to face freer trade as a result of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and to face freer trade within the European Economic Community. The standard of efficiency in Irish industry, as in other countries, varies from firm to firm.  As far as we can understand, the vulnerability of Irish industry relates in most cases to individual firms rather than to whole industries.  In connection with whole industries there are particular problems to be faced and we have asked the European Economic Community to consider these; there is, for example, the motor assembly industry and the steel industry.  Apart from certain individual industries most of the problems that will arise will relate to the vulnerability of certain firms rather than to the vulnerability of a whole industry.</P>
    <P>In this connection Deputies in the Labour Party stressed that there had not been half enough consultation with the trade unions.  Members of the Labour Party have visited Brussels on some occasions.  Trade union members have attended international conferences there.  Committees of industrial progress are examining the position of every industry in the country and the Congress of Trade Unions is involved in this.  Last September there was a briefing session between the Department of Finance and other groups and the Congress of Trade Unions was represented.  An attempt was made in December to reconvene another briefing session.  Apart from that, trade unions have had ample opportunity of discussing the effects of free trade in relation to industry through the work of the Department of Industry and Commerce on industrial progress and the House has already received a number of reports on a number of industries.  More reports will be published during the year.</P>
    <P>A question was asked as to what special provisions are being made for Shannon in the context of the European Economic Community.  We have had discussions with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and <Col N="839" /> with the Commission designed to clarify the position.  On the basis of these discussions we are satisfied that compliance with the Community's provisions will not prejudice the maintenance of the present operations at Shannon.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to firms closing down because of difficulties they are experiencing and they asked what will be the consequences of our acceptance of a substantially wider free trade area as a result of our accession to the EEC.  I have already mentioned that there are numbers of small firms operating within the Community and the fact that we have a great many small industries does not mean that these industries should go out of business if they show the same kind of expertise and dedication to production and the same kind of forward-looking attitude towards the Common Market as are shown by the very, very many small firms in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I think I should be frank and say now what Members have realised for a long time : the world of high tariffs is vanishing everywhere.  The list of negotiations for the reduction of tariffs between countries is a long one.  Not only is this the policy between members of the EEC but European countries in GATT are reducing tariffs on goods coming from underdeveloped countries and tremendous efforts are being made in South America, which have been only partly successful, for a sort of local economic community there.  When one looks at the total list of tariff reduction one can see that the world of high tariffs is disappearing. The idea that, if we do not enter the EEC, we will in some way or other still be able to preserve the pre-Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement level of tariffs is absurd.  To use a modern expression it is simply &ldquo;not on&rdquo; in the modern world.  Tariffs will inevitably reduce, irrespective of the existence of the European Economic Community, of EFTA and many other groups.  The world of high tariffs is declining.</P>
    <P>We have been perfectly frank in the <Col N="840" /> White Paper in paragraph 442 with regard to the industrial implications of membership of the European Economic Community.  I do not know whether I need to quote the particular paragraph but what we said was that it was difficult to forecast the effects of the total reduction of tariffs to nil in the context of the European Common Market but, if we make a determined effort to overcome the problems, we will be able to overcome them largely.  Even if there are some industries which will be severely affected, other industries will arise which will benefit from a larger market and, with our arrangements for redundancy and for retraining, we believe there is a very, very great future for industry within the larger area of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>In connection with this whole matter I should say that the majority of the recent closures of firms cannot be attributed to increased competition in the home market as a result of the freeing of trade.  That is a statement I have received from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In the case of the majority of the firms there is no association with the reduction of tariffs. These firms have faced difficulties because of changes in demand for various types of textiles.  There are difficulties to be found in Great Britain and in other countries.  If Deputies will read the financial newspapers in Great Britain for the next three or four weeks, they will find that a great many firms manufacturing textiles of various kinds, if they are in certain ranges of production, will show a very big decline in profits and, as a result, a decline in production and, as a result, a decline in employment.</P>
    <P>Whatever position we hold in the world as a trading nation, we are bound to experience these ups and downs in demand for certain classes of products. I suppose it is true to say to those, such as the members of the Labour Party who prefer not to have great industrial giants, that in some respects it is a very good thing if firms can be large enough to have diversification possibilities so that if a demand for a particular product diminishes there will be a greater demand, perhaps, for <Col N="841" /> another product made by the same company. It cannot always work that way because firms are not so constructed that it is always possible.  I wanted to mention this.  As I have said, with the gradual transition to free trade and what we can ask for in the way of special consideration for firms who are in difficulties under the terms of the European Economic Community regulations, I am quite certain we will be able to make progress in industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan asked me to say something about dumping.  It would take me a long time to read all of the document about dumping which I have been given.  Generally speaking, what the Deputy has read in the negotiation reports holds good.  Once the transitional period is over it is difficult for us to have dumping recognised within the European Economic Community because we are part of it; we are within a free trade area.  As the Deputy knows there are arrangements where dumping takes place outside the Community. The Deputy knows the regulations in regard to that.  He knows that after a certain date we can impose anti-dump-ing duties only if other countries besides ourselves are affected by dumping. Again, if the Deputy will look in detail at what was said he will see that there are some exceptions to that.  If it can be proved that the industry by its very nature is only producing in a very small part of the Community, and that that industry is affected by dumping from a third country, the Commission can-consider making provision for anti-dumping protection even though the rest of the countries within the Community are not particularly affected.  If the Deputy bears those two aspects in mind, he will see that we fully understand and appreciate what we need to do in the way of protection against dumping and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is aware of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy can ask questions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he requires further elucidation.</P>
      <P>I come now to agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has dealt fully with the implications in regard to our joining the Common Market.  The House knows that the outside prospects are very dim for us. We can ask the question as to where we could sell our cattle, and beef, and dairy produce, and at what price, if the British joined the Common Market and we did not.  We have had a very considerable discussion on that already but I should like to mention the fact that the attraction of membership is very favourable so far as agriculture is concerned, because the commodities for which the price will be most attractive, namely, cattle, beef, lamb and milk, amount to 60 per cent of our total production.  As everyone knows the current EEC prices are substantially higher, and further increases are expected.</P>
      <P>One Labour Deputy asked whether we could possibly foresee the increase in the cost of living that would be occasioned by our joining the European Economic Community as a result of the increase in food prices.  Knowing how difficult it is to forecast the increase in the cost of living resulting from any particular change in economic circumstances, I will just say that we reckon that the increase in food prices here will be in the region of 12 to 18 per cent.  This will be reflected in a small rise in the consumer price index now, and above the figure in the White Paper of 3½ to 4½ per cent.  This increase will, of course, be spread over the transitional period and will be offset by the increase in prosperity generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say in that connection that I am terribly scared of any predictions in regard to increases in the cost of living and I should not like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be kept to that figure.  All I can say is that the figure given by the Labour Deputy of a 20 per cent increase in the cost of living is ludicrously exaggerated. We expect that inevitably there will be some increase in the cost <Col N="843" /> of living.  It must also be remembered that when there is a change in the price level of Irish products, the farmers will have greater purchasing power. They will be able to purchase more industrial products manufactured here. They will engage in more trading activities and this should help to increase the incomes of the non-agricultural population so that they should be able to cushion themselves over a period of five years, in one way or another, against increases in the cost of living that will inevitably be experienced once agricultural prices increase.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned very briefly the beneficial results to agriculture, I must again be absolutely frank and admit that there will be increased competition on the foreign and the home market as a result of our joining the European Economic Community, and that the size of the reward we achieve will depend on the efficiency of our processors, exporters, and producers. More capital will have to be invested in agriculture.  Certain Deputies seemed to think that there was a total inadequacy of capital investment by our farmers.  I have not got the figures with me but if those Deputies who said that farmers here have not invested capital, look at the capitalised value of all the grants they have received from the Government for improving their farm structures, and if they then look at the rate of loans obtained from the Agricultural Credit Corporation ten years ago and last year, and if they look at the figures prepared by the Central Bank of the amount of money lent to farmers by the banks now and ten years ago, they will realise that there has been massive capital investment by farmers, although we recognise there will have to be still more under EEC conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If he gets higher prices for his produce he will benefit to the extent that he will get a higher price.  If he modernises his farm he will benefit still more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> I want to deal now with the Mansholt Plan.  There have been many misunderstandings about it.  There have been a number of drafts of the Mansholt Plan.  It is wrong to say that under the Mansholt Plan ruin will be spelled for small farmers.  The plan is designed to help the small farmer and the basic aim is to create viable holdings, to enable small farmers to have adequate incomes and an improving status in their lives as compared with the non-agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Having said that I want to give to the House some of the latest information on the Mansholt Plan.  First of all, participation in the plan is voluntary. Some Deputies have given the impression that if we join the EEC every small farmer who is making less than a certain income will be compulsorily retired and compensated. Nothing is further from the truth. Secondly, the draft resolution at present before the Council for adoption will not be subject to the condition that the farm must be of a minimum initial size. It suggests a certain income which the farm ought to attain if it is to receive help, grants and loans from the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund.</P>
    <P>Mansholt Plan does not mean that every farm of 10 or 15 acres is recommended for obliteration.</P>
    <P>The amounts that a farm should be capable of attaining in the way of income as a result of a six year programme of operation under the Mansholt Plan can be varied on a regional basis depending on the structure of the region.  If there is a region in this country of small farms, and that region is accepted as having a certain socioeconomic characteristic, adopting the</P>
    <P>The decision to adopt the plan in Ireland would involve a voluntary decision on the part of the farmers to engage in development programmes for modernising their holdings or, alternatively, for leaving agriculture.  The choice is voluntary.  It would depend on the level of tourist, industrial or other economic development in any area and, of course, account would be taken by the Government in adopting the plan for the particular area of the <Col N="845" /> favourable character of conditions in one region as compared with another.</P>
    <P>The Mansholt Plan is related, also, to the development of regional policies for economic growth and, therefore, in considering the application of the Mansholt Plan, which is a very flexible one, one has also to consider the fact that under the new arrangements for economic and monetary union we will be able to take advantage of the economic planning which will take place and which is deliberately designed not simply to have economic growth on a huge scale as a result of a union of economic policies, but to ensure that there is no imbalance and that in every country there will be a restructuring of economic growth to suit and favour growth in the less well favoured regions.  That is quite definitely the position in so far as the Mansholt Plan is concerned.  It must be related to the new arrangements for engaging in steps taken towards eventual monetary union which are intimately linked with the whole regional structuring of the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste now stating categorically that he predicts a bright future for the small farmer in the West of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No person could make that kind of easy generalisation. The Deputy knows very well that there are places in the west where there are industries employing the sons and daughters of farmers within a radius of 15 miles so that the farmer no longer depends on the income from his farm.  There are other places where there are difficulties and people are leaving the farms.  It is a varying picture. Having said that, I should add that the Government are stressing the necessity for preserving our existing incentive for regional development within the framework of membership of the EEC.  We believe we should be able to get aid from the European Investment Bank, which is being made available to undeveloped areas within the Community.  There again we are able to continue our incentives for industry and our export incentive and at the same time benefit from the flow of investments from the European <Col N="846" /> Investment Bank.  I think we should see a growth of economic activity in some parts of the west where there is inadequate investment at the present time.  I am not going to predict that we shall be able to stop migration from the land.  As the Deputy knows this has not been stopped in any country in the world.  Efforts will be made to keep people living on the land and give them employment in the neighbourhood if their farms are eventually going to be too small to give them an economic livelihood, so that they will have some alternative living as well. The Deputy knows that is the policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not think I need say anything more about the fisheries policy because it has been made perfectly clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he is very much aware of what has to be done to persuade the EEC to take very seriously the effect of the recent decision in so far as our inshore fishermen are concerned.  As it has not been noticed by Members of the House I should like to point out that an element of conservation in fisheries is important and an element of seasonality of fishing is accepted by the Council of Ministers.  Part of the negotiations we are undertaking in order to protect our fishermen is based not only on their rights but on the fact that they are inshore fishermen.  It is based on the genuine belief that if fishermen of the EEC countries fished over-freely in our fishing waters they would destroy the stocks of fish for themselves and ourselves.  We have made this perfectly clear.  We have presented the documentation in regard to this, which is being studied by the Commission at the present time.  All I can do is repeat what I have said before that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is taking due account of everything that has been said in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Labour Deputies suggested that members of the EEC had shown a gross and selfish indifference towards the third world.  I do not know where they got that from.  We have the list of financial aid provided to the third world by the various countries of Europe in 1967.  Four members of the EEC headed the list, and in this case that also includes the United States, in <Col N="847" /> relation to the amount of official and private aid given to third world countries as a percentage of national income. France headed the list with 1.64 per cent of her national income; Germany was second with 1.26 per cent; the tiny country of the Netherlands was third with 1.24 per cent, and Belgium was fourth with 1 per cent.  There can be no suggestion that members of the EEC are indifferent to the third world. As the House knows, a number of treaties have been entered into with favourable terms of trade for the newly developing countries of Africa and other places with the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need deal with the accusations that attention to social welfare matters is not sufficiently marked within the European Economic Community. All I can say is that there has been an enormous improvement in the living standards of individual workers in the EEC and the improvement in the levels of social security expenditure can be reflected in this way.  In 1960 social security expenditure as a percentage of national income varied from 9.7 per cent to 16.4 per cent, taking the smallest and greatest percentages in the Community as a whole. In 1969 it had risen from 16.1 per cent to 19.5 per cent.  Therefore, I do not think anyone need worry about the Community not giving attention to social welfare matters.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made that the position of workers was not appreciated sufficiently within the Community.  I would mention the fact that there is a co-ordinating group set up by the Commission in which employers and workers participate.  This group is associated with studying the social implications of decisions by the Council of Ministers.  In connection with the decision to form some European companies there is provision for labour participation and arrangements will be in force for helping in the retraining and the resettlement of workers who have been affected by decisions of the EEC.  This shows clearly the interest taken by the Commission and the Council of Ministers in such matters. Finally, the European social fund will be available to meet human and social <Col N="848" /> problems caused by economic integration and new proposals in this regard come into force on 1st January, 1972.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about regional policy.  I have already reassured the House that we are seeking to retain the differentials in our scheme of industrial incentives.  Nevertheless, the Labour Party continue to say that the less-developed areas will be affected adversely by our joining the Community.  This does not stand up to examination.  If one looks at the western areas of the country one can see that a high proportion of income is derived from agriculture.  As the prices of agricultural products will increase and as there will be the possibility of aid from the Agricultural Guarantee Fund to enable farmers to modernise their holdings, it is certain that the western part of the country will benefit most from the agricultural incentives in the EEC because of the greater proportion of agriculture in that area.  Naturally the towns and cities in the west will benefit from the more prosperous farming community.</P>
    <P>Accession to the EEC will mean that we will be part of one of the largest markets on earth.  May I make it clear that regional problems will not be less important when we join the Community? Our entry will not guarantee the solution of regional unemployment and migration.  We must intensify our efforts to encourage investment in the western areas but not only will we have aid from the European Investment Bank but we will also have aid from the Agricultural Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat that steps, which have been taken in stages, were announced on 8th February, 1971 to create an economic monetary union.  I would stress to the House that these plans will speed up the regional policies of the Community.  The Council will enact the necessary measures for giving a solution to the priority problems in the regional field.  The economic monetary union which provides for the free movement of capital will not create regional and structural imbalance. Therefore, built into the whole concept of a greater economic union within the Community is the fact that this reshaping of the economic organisation of <Col N="849" /> each country will not result in the piling of capital investment into the already well developed parts of each member country.  The Community have guaranteed that regional and structural imbalance will not thus be brought about.</P>
    <P>These measures will be implemented between now and 1973 and in the second and subsequent stages, when we hope to be a member, we will have to go ahead with our original plans.  The House is aware that regional co-ordination groups are preparing reports which will set out the main factors that govern regional development here, the infrastructural needs, and the capacity of each region to take part in industrial, tourist and social development.  The Industrial Development Authority are preparing industrial plans for each region.  The group consists of local authority representatives, the IDA, and the regional tourism organisations.  I can assure the House that these plans will be ready so that if we join in 1973 we will be prepared to tell the Council of Ministers that, so far as the stages achieved in the economic and monetary union of the members of the Community are concerned, we can offer them regional directives to enable us to participate fully.</P>
    <P>One Deputy in the Labour Party suggested that we should have selective implementation of the Buchanan Report. As everyone knows, the Buchanan Report was prepared at national level. We can examine the report and take advantage of its findings and we can compare its proposals with those that will emerge from local regional planning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> I do not think I need deal with the Labour Party suggestion that we should enter an association with the EEC.  I think this has been dealt with by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I might add, however, that one main reason why we would not want association with the EEC is the fact that we could not have the agricultural price arrangements. Most of the countries who have applied for association with the EEC&mdash; although they have not succeeded and final steps have not been taken&mdash;are States where agriculture occupies a much smaller percentage of their total exports than it does in our case.  These countries have figures of from 3 per cent to 5½ per cent in comparison with our figure of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>I think I have done all I can to answer the many questions that have been posed during the course of this debate.  I should like to conclude by saying that we accept the amendment to the resolution placed on the Order Paper by Fine Gael along with our own resolution.</P>
