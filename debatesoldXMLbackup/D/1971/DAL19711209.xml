      <P>When we adjourned last week I was saying I regarded the speech of the Taoiseach when he introduced this particular important matter as one of the most extraordinary performances of any head of State in Europe since the Treaty of Rome was initiated and since various measures were introduced in the various parliaments of the countries now members of the EEC and those who intend to become members.  It was merely a Civil Service description of what the legal position is in regard to this proposed amendment of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies here saw fit to speak for as long as an hour but they were at all times relevant.  Indeed, the debate has been conducted throughout in that atmosphere.  The Taoiseach, after all, is the man who would lead us into Europe.  He is head of the Government and unless there is a change of Government&mdash;I think there will be before it happens&mdash;he is the man who will lead us into Europe.  He now proposes a change in the Constitution and this will have to be put before the people in the from of a referendum. His decision was, apparently, that he would merely indicate the legal steps that will be necessary.  His introductory speech occupies only four columns, two pages of the Official Report, and at the normal rate of delivery in this House it would take only ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold the Taoiseach was quite wrong in not broadening or going fully into the various aspects of the problem that confronts this country.  There is a <Col N="1499" /> situation in which any group in the country who see fit can express any opinion they wish on this matter.  Such opinions may be erroneous or they may be correct but if they are erroneous the group who have Deputy Lynch as Taoiseach will not know anything from him of the inferences, the implications of this change in the Constitution.  The people will be in the unfortunate situation of having heard people who are ill-informed, or people who might have a vested interest in our not entering Europe.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a serious lapse on the part of the Taoiseach.  Of course, it has been paralleled on other occasions during the life of the present Dáil when the Taoiseach and other members of the Government have seen fit to be almost insolent to Parliament when introducing very serious measures.  They have sought to create a situation in which free debate before the people of the country has been stifled because they have produced Civil Service type statements of extreme gravity.  The Taoiseach's speech here has been seriously uninformative. He has not been diligent in his duty to Parliament.  He should have given every detail and should have dwelt on every possible consequence so that the people would know how to act in the referendum.  He should have given all the details of our prospects on entry to the EEC.  Instead, he merely discussed what the Parliamentary draftsman had done and said it was a straight case of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There has probably been no more complex matter discussed in this House than the question of the EEC entry.  The Government have been vehement in their denial of the fact that our sovereignty as a State could be affected.  In absolute law that is correct, but at the same time we must think of the wars that have been fought about ideals, about the state which exists when a great nation finds a large number of people on the breadline and in the unemployment exchanges, and when economics have gone wrong. Many wars have been fought when economics have gone wrong.  Under international law and under the <Col N="1500" /> Treaty of Rome we will not lose any part of our sovereignty.  It is true also that if we become economically involved with the States of Europe any attack, economic or physical, on such States would be a serious matter for us and could result in vast unemployment figures here when our trade has intermingled with theirs.  This could happen within a decade of our entry to EEC.  It could result in the closing of export outlets which are of vital importance to us.  In such a situation on paper and in law, there would be no effect on our sovereignty, but there would be a physical effect on our economy which might be so severe as to indicate to a majority of this House that this country might perhaps have to go to war.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should deal in detail with all these matters.  There is a feeling on the Government benches at the moment that if the wolf is at the door the best thing to do is to stay inside hoping that he will go away.  I do not want to overstate the position but to draw attention to these matters which might away the people against the referendum when it comes to a vote. There is no question on the part of the Taoiseach of taking sides in this matter.  The Taoiseach is in command and it is his duty to put the case to the people in its entirety.  This has not been done.  The Taoiseach has confined himself in ten minutes to the phraseology of the amendment and the simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I am not a lawyer. There are many lawyers in the House, including the Taoiseach himself.  I do not intend to deal with the phraseology but I want to emphasise the fact that the Constitution is being amended.  I represent 20,000 to 30,000 constituents.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy, from the newest arrival to the oldest inhabitant, and from the least verbose to the man who puts most words on the record of this House, has the responsibility of representing such a number of constituents. They are not all educated people who can decide for themselves.  Amongst them there are old people who may not have had the advantages of education which we enjoyed and which our children to a greater extent enjoy.  I left my children at home this morning. They, in common with children at <Col N="1501" /> school all over the city and from one end of the country to the other, will all be affected by EEC entry.  Each Deputy has the responsibility of explaining to his constituents the consequences of changing the Constitution. The changes in the Constitution will change the rights of these children.  I picked up my copy of the Constitution and my notes this morning.  One of my children asked me what I had, and I told her that the Constitution contained her rights.  She replied that she knew her rights and that she would be getting her holidays next week.  That simple little event shows us the seriousness of this situation.  We are deciding for our young people who have not yet the right to decide for themselves because of the state of the development of their minds.  They do not know what sort of country this will be in the future and whether or not the very fortuitous non-intervention into the war from 1939 to 1945 would be possible in a future war.  The children do not know whether or not their opportunities for employment will be increased or decreased.</P>
    <P>It is unthinkable that a head of State should come in here and read out one paragraph on the Coal and Steel Community, one paragraph on the Court of Justice, one paragraph on the Council and its decisions, and a little on the wording of the amendment to the Constitution, and then sit down. I ask the Taoiseach when replying to examine thoroughly every little detail of what can happen on our entry into EEC.  On my judgment, representing 20,000 to 30,000 people, I feel that we should go into EEC but at the same time that the degree of bargaining that has been done by the Taoiseach and his Ministers has not been sufficient. During the sixties I was in Brussels and Strasbourg and I attended a study group in Cannes with other Deputies. During that time the Fianna Fáil Minister for External Affairs, my colleague, Deputy Aiken, spent as long as 87 days in America.  Our representative in Brussels was grossly overworked at that time.  The then Minister was in Brussels once in the previous four years.  He was passing through and spent the night there.  Members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party <Col N="1502" /> were interesting themselves in the difficulties which would follow on the arrival of freer trade.  The Fianna Fáil Government were disinterested.  They were more interested in whether China should enter the inner portals of the United Nations building than in whether we should have more trade with Europe.</P>
    <P>During those formative years stances were adopted and positions were taken up.  During those formative years detailed negotiations should have been carried out.  In his ten minute introductory statement to this serious measure which opens the door for the decision of the people, the Taoiseach expressed no opinion except to say in his last sentence: &ldquo;I recommend this Bill to the House.&rdquo;  On such a serious matter it was very wrong for the Taoiseach to ask for a blank cheque.  As somebody said, even if this House has to sit on Christmas Day, it is absolutely necessary for us to debate in detail all the advantages and all the disadvantages.  It may be that something which the Labour Party regarded as a disadvantage could turn out not to be a disadvantage. If in his opening statement the Taoiseach had allayed a certain feeling of trepidation on the part of any Member of the House with regard to our economy or the question of employment, I am sure that Deputy would have been overjoyed.  On this decision rests the prosperity or otherwise of Ireland for the next 30 years.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the timing of the introduction of the Bill.  It is possible that people might be led astray on the referendum because of the Taoiseach's non-performance.  He must get out his pen, do his homework and reply in detail to this debate. There is no proposal for a further debate on the EEC before the House at the moment so far as I know&mdash;a full debate with no time limit, and at the proper time.  In my view the proper time would be the time arranged between the Whips.  This debate should not be acrimonious.  We must have constructive criticism so that the people can get the information and make up their minds.  Who is making up their minds for them at the moment as a result of the Taoiseach's ten-minute <Col N="1503" /> speech giving the mechanics and nothing but the mechanics of the Bill?  Various organisations, some legal and some totally illegal, are expressing opinions in the Press against our entry into the EEC.  If ever there was a political sin by omission it was committed by the Taoiseach when he produced the ten-minute speech which he did.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say a few of the things I think he should have said. The Taoiseach and his Ministers, particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, omitted to explain to the many decent working people in this country that many of the redundancies that occurred are not attributable to EEC entry or to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Any little word said by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this regard displayed a certain blankness of mind. It is possible that our accession to the EEC could cause redundancies.  A manufacturer here who considers that entry will affect his business seriously, may decide to contract his business instead of expanding it.  Therefore, redundancy would be caused.  Many companies will have to re-equip themselves for entry and spend large capital sums and seek grants, or do nothing or, worst of all, close their doors.  We must face the fact that our entry into EEC could cause redundancies.</P>
    <P>As the spokesman for my party on Industry and Commerce I have made inquiries about industries in which there were redundancies.  In no case was our future entry into the EEC the cause of such redundancies.</P>
    <P>I turn now to other matters relating to the EEC which could confuse the issue for the people.  One of these matters is the Bill dealing with value-added tax.  Every small shopkeeper in the country as well as every person involved in trade, every purchaser and every consumer is at this stage open to conviction by persons who do not desire us to enter the EEC, that the value-added tax Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend debating the Bill but merely to point out in passing that persons who will have to vote on this referendum in March or April will, if the Government continue on present lines, have to vote at the same time as the very confusing and bemusing issue of value-added tax is being considered.  It is my opinion that that particular Bill should be postponed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot open up a debate on the value-added tax Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of absolute necessity that that Bill be postponed and that the referendum which should be on the question of entry alone would go before the people after there has been full discussion of the matter and when further changes have occurred and further advances have been made in negotiations.  So far as the timing of the referendum and its probable results are concerned in the context of political affairs in this country, I said in opening my contribution to this debate that, as a result of our proposed entry into the EEC, there arises directly the question of serious changes in our yearly Budget.  When the people are voting on the referendum they must be aware that after we join the EEC, there will be a saving by way of direct agricultural subsidies which, it is estimated, in the Budget of 1973, will amount to £35 million.  For the payments that we receive from the common fund of the EEC, we will have to make a contribution towards the EEC coffers.  It is estimated that in the first year of membership our contribution to Brussels will be about £3 million and that in the last year of the transitional period, it will be in the order of £10 million.  Therefore, there will be an advantage of about £25 million.  That raises the question as to when the Government will go to the country.  It is my belief that they should go now but I expect they will try to hang on until they can take advantage of that. It is well that we should indicate what are the views of the various parties in relation to the expenditure of the amount of money that will be saved <Col N="1505" /> in this way.  So far as Fine Gael are concerned, we agree that it should be spent mainly in increasing social welfare benefits.  I shall say no more on that matter at this stage and I turn now to the question of the purchase of land in Common Market conditions, a matter that was not referred to by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>So far as I can ascertain from the various documents provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs&mdash;very helpful documents&mdash;we can continue our land division policy here so long as we do not extend to our uneconomic holders benefits that we do not extend to uneconomic holders from other parts of the EEC so long as those persons have been resident here for a certain period.  There is another constitutional issue involved here.  It would appear to me that if a young man came here from any of the EEC countries and spent five years here as a farm steward and if, at the end of that time he had an uneconomic holding, he would have to be treated in the same way as if he were the son of a man who had been struggling all his life on an uneconomic holding in the West of Ireland.  That is a question that should be clarified by the Taoiseach when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I wish to refer to the existing situation in the Common Market.  This Bill is for the purpose of having a referendum on the question of whether we should join.  The Taoiseach has made great play, mostly outside the House, of the fact that the combined Opposition are divided on the issue of the Common Market.  I cannot speak for the Labour Party but my view is that pragmatic practising politicians must now accept clearly that when in the British House of Commons a majority of 112 decided on entry into the Common Market, as far as we were concerned the argument was over. The charge that the Taoiseach makes is nothing more or less than a party political charge.  The situation is that the matters at issue are the terms of entry, the terms of entry, for instance, in relation to fisheries, in relation to our sensitive industries, in relation to certain concessions that we should get that Britain could not hope to get.  The Taoiseach did not advert at all to what is the most striking feature that should <Col N="1506" /> be put before the people in this referendum. That most striking feature is that there are many sections of our economy giving good employment and were a concession given to Britain then, because of the volume of goods being produced by Britain in that particular section, it would have a serious effect on the economy and the employment of people within the Six.  There is no hope of a large economy, such as Britain, getting a concession that would hurt the existing members of the EEC.  I get a little irritated sometimes when I hear people speaking of the EEC as if it were a free trade area for the whole world.  It is not a free trade area for the whole world.  The reason why the vote with a majority of 112 in the British House of Commons changed the whole situation is that we send 75 to 80 per cent of our exports to Britain. We could not afford to pay the common external tariff which would have to be set up against us by Britain whether they wished it or not once they signed accession to the Treaty of Rome.  We are weak, we are small.  In many of our sensitive areas of employment and industry we are, in relation to the EEC and indeed in relation to Britain, quite insignificant.  It would be quite wrong if the entire terms of entry for us, or even a major number of the terms of entry, turned out to be exactly parallel to the terms offered to Britain because it is quite clear that there are many industries here, the produce of which would not, because of their size, affect a Frenchman, a Dutchman, an Italian or anybody else, but if the same concession were given to Britain there would be serious complications and serious unemployment within the EEC.</P>
    <P>Similarly, on the question of entry of European goods here, there are the sensitive areas where we depend to a great extent upon our home trade and where the large industries of Europe could put goods in here which would affect employment to a serious degree. Need I mention the sensitive areas? There are footwear and textiles&mdash; which present a world problem at the moment and, therefore, slightly different&mdash;electrical goods and various other products.  I could point to an effort being made at present to defend employment in an electrical goods factory <Col N="1507" /> by providing retail outlets here, an intervention by the Government which I, from this side of the House, stood up and commended.  That is to meet the competition of Italians, Dutch, French, and so on.  We, because of the smallness of our market and the fact that a flood of European goods to us in the sensitive areas could affect our employment situation, can negotiate and should negotiate terms different from those of Britain, terms which would defend our employment and give time for our industries, State aided, to gear themselves over the next decade to an export situation which would equal the amount of home trade lost before our home market is open completely to continental competition.</P>
    <P>On this matter the Government have been too silent.  I have adverted to the non-performance of my colleague, the previous Minister for External Affairs, in relation to Europe over the whole of a decade when he nested in the United Nations and was, in four years, once in Brussels and then was only passing through.  I have laid it at the foot of the Taoiseach that his responsibility in introducing this Referendum Bill was to convince the people from this House, in which the elected representatives could stand up and make their voices heard, and elicit all the information that could possibly be given, to allow the people to vote freely and informatively on this most important issue.</P>
    <P>I conclude now by referring to the political mischief which the Taoiseach, who should be above that, uses in suggesting that the Opposition are split on this matter.  This matter is so serious that I speak now without regard for any slight embarrassment I might cause to a few members of the Fine Gael Party.  The Fine Gael Party have a number of members who could be described as enthusiastic Europeans &mdash;so have the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; people who would almost, as the late Deputy Seán Lemass said on one occasion, &ldquo;go it alone&rdquo; which would, of course, be quite ridiculous, but I do use the word &ldquo;almost&rdquo;.  The great majority of the Fine Gael Party are <Col N="1508" /> determined that they will, by parliamentary question, by their work in this House, by their contacts with the business elements, by their contacts with the trade unions, by their every effort in their political work, see to it that all available information will be in the people's hands and see to it that if necessary we will politically bludgeon the Government into making the very best bargain possible.  I have no right to speak for the Labour Party but I see them as a party determined that no job that can be saved will be lost and that every possible new job will be created and that the huge task of doing this will be carried out by the Government until we, the combined Opposition, can get rid of them.</P>
    <P>I believe that the difficulties within their party for the last two years with their international complications, have left the negotiators, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the other Ministers, at a disadvantage outside the country and within the country also.  There is a political pollution to be cleansed.  It is my view that new men could make better bargains.  There is on this side of the House, in both parties, a determination that better bargains will be made and there is in these parties better knowledge and appreciation of the difficulties and dangers facing the people.  Since the vote in the House of Commons the inevitability of our entry into Europe if the British enter is appreciated.  Whenever I went to a fair with a bullock to sell I did not say to a prospective buyer that I wanted the best price nor that, irrespective of price, I was determined to sell the bullock because to have done that would have placed me in a losing situation.  That is the position facing the House.  What is needed to clear the political pollution is to put men of a different frame of mind&mdash;let us not say better or worse men&mdash;men who because of their period in Opposition have perhaps had an opportunity to be nearer to the people, in a position to bargain and to see to it that our entry into Europe defends the last job and provides every possible new job.</P>
    <P>I make the charge that the Taoiseach in his speech on the Second <Col N="1509" /> Reading of this Bill, and from his exalted position, has not told the people the reasons why we should enter Europe or the reasons why we should not enter Europe.  I hope and pray that that omission will be repaired when the Taoiseach is replying to the debate.</P>

      <P>This debate on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is of serious national importance. Everybody should consider the proposed amendment.

      <P>On the Adjournment of the Dáil.  It is suggested that the Labour Party will oppose this amendment and will tell us that people will be unemployed if we enter the EEC.  Is there any grain of intelligence left in those who oppose entry?  Is it the suggestion that we should become a dead limb on a tree?  I want the people to ask themselves the question: if we cannot sell our surplus products to the EEC countries, will we have to reduce our standard of living?  It is inevitable that initially our entry will result in a few people losing their jobs but we on this side of the House are anxious to create jobs in certain industries that may not be able to compete in the Common Market.  The most serious question for everybody to consider is, if we do not enter the Common Market, how will we fare as an island in the Atlantic, friendless and alone?  Will we be in the position of having to beg the crumbs off the tables <Col N="1510" /> of other countries?  On the other hand, inside the EEC we could bargain and will bargain, in the interests of our people.  According to the Labour Party, we are going to beg the crumbs off other tables and will have no bargaining position in selling our products to EEC countries.  My learned friends of the Labour Party would prefer that we should take the crumbs off these tables.</P>
      <P>Our entry into the EEC raises questions of serious national importance and it should be above party politics. It is not Fianna Fáil who want to go into the EEC; it is the whole nation. Every aspect should be considered.  I do not like to see this being made a political issue.  I would prefer that the people would consider the national implications and would not take the narrow party political point of view. The question is: what benefit will EEC membership confer on our country and on our people?  The question must be considered, if we determine to stand alone and not to enter Europe, what will be the consequences for our people.  Everybody should ask himself that question.  Even the children going to school should ask that question.  If the Government proposal is defeated in the referendum, where do we go from there?  I would ask the very intelligent people in the trade union movement to consider the matter from every aspect.</P>
      <P>I do not want to see anybody losing employment.  All my life I have been anxious to ensure that more and more employment will be created.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been concerned with the well-being of every section, irrespective of class or creed and have given their lives and their time in efforts to create employment. We are not going to sell what we have built up.  We are not going to vitiate the great economic revival and the trade we have built up successfully with other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot go it alone.  There are posters on every wall suggesting that we can go it alone and that we need not enter the European Economic Community.  Is it suggested we should build a wall around this country?  We had some experience of that during <Col N="1511" /> the inter-Party Government.  That Government sold our aeroplanes.  That Government wanted to build a wall around the country so that nobody could get in or out.  Where would we be if we did not trade with other countries? The United States of America tried a policy of isolationism on two occasions when they went against President Wilson and again at the beginning of the second world war. The Americans thought they could go it alone.  They got a rude awakening with Pearl Harbour.  No country, no matter how big it is, can go it alone. China, realising this, was most anxious for a seat at the United Nations.  Large countries cannot go it alone.  Neither can small countries like ours.  These are aspects which must be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>The proposed referendum is not a Fianna Fáil referendum.  It is a national referendum.  We are the Government and we represent the people and, because we are the Government, we have to give the people an opportunity of voting in this referendum.  I welcome criticism and I welcome questions. Everybody should ask questions and everybody should ensure that we make the best possible bargain. Deputy Donegan said that if they were on this side of the House they would make a better bargain.  This is a petty approach.  If Deputy Donegan has advice to offer and constructive criticism we will listen to it.</P>
    <P>This is a national issue.  The matters involved are serious matters.  The people have complete confidence in the Government.  The few will try to smear.  The many, fortunately, appreciate the importance of this.  I have been a long time in this House and there have always been dissidents in every party.  There have always been dissidents in both Fine Gael and Labour.  This is nothing new.  Human nature being what it is people will always differ.  As far as the Fianna Fáil Party is concerned, 99.9 per cent of our party is loyally behind the Taoiseach and the Government in the decisions they are making.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan gave a trite example of a man going to the fair with a bullock and asking the prospective <Col N="1512" /> buyer: &ldquo;What will you give me for the bullock?&rdquo;  He inferred that that was our approach to the Common Market.  Nothing could be further from fact.  I am surprised that Deputy Donegan should take such an unintelligent approach.  The Government have expert advice and their advisers, trusted and competent civil servants, will give them nothing but the best advice.  The hardest bargain possible will be struck.</P>
    <P>I could take Opposition Deputies to task because of statements they have made.  This matter must be approached seriously.  All we ask is a transitional period which will enable us to gear ourselves to the very best of our ability to meet the competition in the Common Market.  Right from 1932 onwards the fight was an uphill one, but the peaks were successfully reached.  In 1932 our tourist industry was nil.  Today it is worth over £100 million.  Our industrial exports are now running neck and neck with our agricultural exports.  That is a tremendous advance.</P>
    <P>We have never let the people down and we will not let them down now. I appeal to the Opposition to approach this matter seriously and intelligently. It must be considered from the national point of view.  The advantages and the disadvantages must be weighed. We cannot go it alone.  That is an impossibility. I have cited the example of the United States of America and China.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are worried because people may lose their employment. The Government will do everything possible to ensure that nobody loses his or her job.  These I believe are matters of national importance, I could talk for a week on the side issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The same scarcity of information which exists regarding our application on the economic front exists in relation to the constitutional implications which will follow entry. At some stage there was a change in the official attitude as to exactly how the people would be consulted about our application for entry.  Some years ago the late Seán Lemass said that if it was found that any of the <Col N="1513" /> Treaty obligations were in conflict with the Constitution as it stands consideration would have to be given to effecting any necessary amendment of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Up until the White Paper was published in 1970 official thinking lay in the direction of indicating to the people the constitutional changes which would follow if we sought entry to the EEC but there appears to have been a change in attitude and the Taoiseach at column 1073 of the Official Report, Volume 257, said:</P>
      <P>Some Deputies may ask why the Government did not propose an amendment which would deal, by reference to special articles, with the incompatibilities which exist between the provisions of the Constitution and obligations of membership of the Communities.  The answer is that the Government consider that it would not be practicable to do so because the extent to which the Constitution would need to be amended is in the final analysis a matter for decision by the appropriate courts.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary economy of information is being used by the constitutional lawyers at the Government's service. Various reasons have been advanced for the lack of information on the economic effects of entry.  No reason has been put forward to change the Labour Party's opposition to entry&mdash; an opposition which is centred on our concern for employment for Irish workers.  No information has been put forward with regard to employment, and a similar disease has struck in the area of the constitutional implications; no information is forthcoming and the Taoiseach has said it is a matter for the courts.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is beyond the wit of members of the Oireachtas to say which major areas of the Constitution will be involved if we enter the EEC. The Taoiseach cannot shrug off his responsibility as Leader of this House by saying this is a matter in the final analysis for the courts.  In a theoretical sense this may be true but the Taoiseach knows there is a duty on politicians to spell out exactly what changes in our Constitution would follow entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> No court in the land or indeed in the international community would suggest that this House does not have that obligation and no court would question the right of this House to point out these changes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach seeks to evade what is the clear-cut responsibility of a premier in going to the electorate.  One may speculate on the reasons for the official change of heart on the way to present our proposed entry to the people.  Some commentators suggest that the Government's reluctance to refer to the specific clauses affected may have a great deal to do with the actual clauses in question and the things they say.</P>
    <P>For example, Article 5, which states: &ldquo;Ireland is a sovereign, independent demoncratic state,&rdquo; was one of the articles which it was stated in the White Paper would need to be amended.  These are awkward and probably emotional words against the background of abject, economic dependence on the British market which has been the policy pursued by this and other Governments over the years despite a barrage of public rhetoric to the contrary.  It has been suggested by some commentators that the Government would find it embarrassing to have to go to the electorate and explain that these were rather embarrassing words which do not sufficiently describe the contemporary position of the Irish State.  That in fact may be true although I do not know why the Government could not go to the electorate and state the exact constitutional amendments that would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government had two choices: they could have done the honest thing and gone before the electorate and listed the constitutional changes that would be necessary or they could have done something which we suggested a long time ago and utilised Article 27 whereby a Bill can be referred to the people&mdash;provided a sufficient number in this House agreed&mdash;which would merely state our desire to enter the EEC.  Let it be clear, the Labour Party are all for consulting the people but we believe the vehicle of consultation with the people should be honest in intent, clear and unambiguous.  Our criticism of the Third Amendment is <Col N="1515" /> that it is deliberately vague and no one can state what in fact the true effects of the amendment being carried would have on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Government have chosen a means of consulting the people which seeks to cloak the full constitutional implications of entry and we oppose this amendment on that ground.  The Labour Party's approach throughout has been for maximum information. We would be departing from that role if we voted for this amendment which appears to go in the direction of total obscurity of purpose.  We have looked for maximum information on jobs, on how the economic future of our people will be influenced or affected by entry and we now want maximum information in the area of the constitutional changes that will be necessary.</P>
    <P>I would not like it to be thought by anybody that this is a last ditch fight by the Labour Party in defence of the 1937 Constitution, it is no such thing.  Instead of marking the high watermark of Republicanism, which many people at the time thought it was and which for years afterwards we were led to believe by ladies and gentlemen opposite that it was, I consider the 1937 Constitution marks a step into medievalism and I certainly do not consider it to be a forward move.  By comparison, and many Deputies opposite even realise this, the Saorstát Éireann Constitution was superior to the 1937 document, certainly in terms of a 32-county State. We now know the 1937 Constitution to be a positive bar to any further dialogue with our countrymen in the north-eastern part of the country.  Let nobody think the Labour Party is addicted to the erroneous clauses and the sectarian provisions contained in the 1937 Constitution.  The 1937 Constitution adopts some features of the Saorstát Constitution and it incorporates certain fundamental rights which we believe it would be wrong to depart from unwittingly or unknowingly and this would be the possible result of accepting the Bill in its present form.  There are certain fundamental guarantees in the Constitution that must not be eroded.  They have proved useful.  This is not due to any <Col N="1516" /> particular virtue of the author of the 1937 Constitution but rather to immemorial common law guarantees dressed up in the 1937 Constitution and on which this Constitution is the sole authority since its enactment and the sole bedrock of these fundamental personal freedoms.  Admittedly, the social directives of that Constitution and the policy directives which are not recognisable by the courts are rather dated but they are capable of further development. Other parts of the Constitution have been the subject, in recent years especially, of Supreme Court interpretation which has opened up the possibility of the extension of personal freedom.  For these reasons we think it would be wrong and foolish to agree to any large scale erosion of unspecified areas of the Constitution. We saw the method by which the Supreme Court extended rights under Article 43.1 where the State guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.  This was used notably in the Ryan case in recent years, in the Philip Clarke case and in other cases to extend greatly the area of individual fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not list the Articles of the Constitution which are affected and we may speculate on the reasons for that.  Peculiarly, this reluctance to list constitutional amendments and come clean on how the Constitution should be changed, this notable reluctance by the Government coincides with a period when any man with ten followers is talking about changing the Constitution and when not a weekend goes by that the Taoiseach does not talk about his intention to change the Constitution.  He does not state the year or the century or give details about the era in which he will go through this Justinian phase of changing the Constitution, but he has made many speeches on the matter in recent weeks. He says he is going to scrap the entire Constitution if he can get a united Ireland; even on the way to a united Ireland he will scrap it in unspecified ways.  Yet, he cannot state here clearly where he wishes to change it or list the clauses which require change now.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Third <Col N="1517" /> Amendment Bill will alter various sections of the Constitution.  As the Taoiseach said, this will be a matter for the courts, and in another part of his speech he said that there is a danger that we might not be able to get all the implications clearly stated in a Bill; technically, we might leave out something. So, there is no doubt that there will be large-scale changes.  It appears there is no nervousness about large-scale changes in the Constitution as long as you do not name the exact areas of change.  We may speculate on the reasons for the Government's reticence with the electorate and their reluctance to state the changes required.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says the draft is very narrow, that it could not be narrower, but the Taoiseach has a peculiar view of reality, to put it bluntly.  To some extent, he has a schizophrenic approach to truth, a certain gift for interpretation which has served him well in recent years.  The draft to us in our naivete appears pretty wide and the second portion to be extremely wide.  It validates all measures adopted by the State consequent on membership.  For example, it could make lawful otherwise unconstitutional measures which the State was not obliged to adopt but which it could hold where necessary consequent on our membership; for &ldquo;the State&rdquo; read &ldquo;the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In regard to that phrase, &ldquo;consequent on membership&rdquo;, we recall a period in the courts between 1924 and 1940, and even after that-one recalls Article 44.1 to the effect that no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law&mdash;when a long series of decisions equated the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; with the actual law of the land.  As long as it was law duly promulgated here and clearly put forth from this Assembly the courts said: &ldquo;That is good enough for us.&rdquo;  The courts said that the Oireachtas was competent to judge. This interpretation was used mainly to bolster up the Offences Against the State Act and various attempts were made to show that the law had a wider significance than simply the law of the land, but those attempts failed.  Likewise, in various cases before the courts in the matter of private property, in <Col N="1518" /> the Donnelly case and others of the same sort, there were numerous examples where the courts said in fact that the Oireachtas was competent to judge these social questions.</P>
    <P>There has been a welcome change. In recent years we have seen the Supreme Court and the High Court taking on a very creative function that all must welcome and it is true that the whole method of judicial review of legislation has developed well by comparison with the past but there is no guarantee that in the future we may not find the courts once more equating &ldquo;law&rdquo; with the law of the land or, in fact, interpreting it in the same spirit as the interpretation of Article 28.3º, namely, &ldquo;time of war or armed rebellion&rdquo;.  Again on the matter of &ldquo;measures adopted by the State consequent on membership&rdquo;, the court could say that these were the decisions that were consequent on membership belonging peculiarly and alone to the Oireachtas.  It may seem farfetched but these are possibilities that could come into existence if we pass unspecified amendments to our Constitution.</P>
    <P>It would be more honest for the Government&mdash;and I do not think any court could question their right to do so&mdash;to specify the actual amendments necessary in the Constitution or, alternatively, to adopt the course provided for in Article 27 of putting the matter to the people in a straight &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; fashion.  We can speculate on the reasons why the Government did not adopt either of these courses and should choose to attempt to cloak the real effect of this Third Amendment to the Constitution. Whether their reticence and reluctance to spell out the implications have anything to do with an early general election, I do not know.  It may be an embarrassing thing to say at the beginning of an election campaign that the State is no longer sovereign and independent.  However, even though the Government may be contemplating a Twenty-six County general election, it must be remembered that what we are discussing is not a petty political matter to be confused with an election. The issue is too important to be tied <Col N="1519" /> to the fortunes of one political party. The Taoiseach should state the order of priorities: which is the more important, to win an election or bring this country into the EEC.</P>
    <P>I am not in the least convinced when the Taoiseach says that the only reasons why the constitutional implications of EEC membership were not spelled out was that this was, in the last analysis, a matter for the courts. Is it not a question, with a general election coming up, of it not being good politics to spell out these constitutional changes?  The amendment says:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>The only limitations in that situation would be that the Community institutions can only exercise their powers in ways set out in the three Treaties listed.  It is true that these Treaties are concerned with economic matters but we cannot say that fundamental freedoms will not be directly affected.  We could say that there will not be any infringement of fundamental personal rights, but these powers in the economic sphere are very wide and open-ended. Reference has been made to Article 235 of the EEC Treaty under which very wide power is provided; and the objectives of the Community, as expressed in the Preamble to the Treaty of Rome, are also pretty wide. Article 235, in fact, opens up the possibility of passing laws in this country which up to now would be regarded as unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that the amendment is narrow in that, when we see the growth of political and monetary union among these States, we shall need another referendum.  Therefore: &ldquo;See how honest we have been.  See how accurate and fair we have been,&rdquo; is the attitude of the Taoiseach.  I do not know what marks we can give for that.  One of the errors of negotiating posture from the very beginning has <Col N="1520" /> been a totally uncritical acceptance of the political implications of joining the Community.  Every other weekend Ministers stated their promise to be of good behaviour in any political development of the Community.  That might be harmless enough if they confined their remarks to the local branches of their party and if they had kept their mouths shut in Europe or in Brussels.  However, at a time when the now members of the Community were anxiously querying the future political developments of the Community, our Ministers were blabbing forth their total commitment to and optimism in respect of an unspecified political charter for Europe.</P>
    <P>Of course we were never told what the political implications were from the outset, but that does not come within the ambit of our discussion now.  It is a bit late in the day for the Taoiseach to say we shall require a referendum to decide on our adherence to a Community that may sprout a political framework when our Ministers have been saying in Europe and at home for many years now that we are willing and able to accept all the implications of entry, including the political ones.  At one stage, if I recall rightly, a Minister, now no longer with us, announced his willingness to accept the military implication as well.</P>
    <P>People may say: &ldquo;This is not a sovereign State so let us not worry about dumping Article 5 which states that Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State.&rdquo;  I do not have much sympathy with some elements of opposition which appear to subsist in a very rarefied atmosphere.  The Labour Party opposition to entry has been centred exclusively on the threat to Irish jobs and we admit to all the limitations of that view.  We apologise to no one for that particular limitation of our view.  After all, who would represent the voice of that large section of the Irish people who are concerned about their jobs in the country if there was not a party in this House to voice that concern?</P>
    <P>One of our major criticisms has been the lack of information.  In the absence of adequate information on how Irish jobs are to be safeguarded <Col N="1521" /> what other attitude could the Labour Party have adopted but the one we have?  People may say that this Article which states that Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic State is just a theoretical abstraction.  It is true that the horror of our political life has been that the Government have practised a style of politics for years which appears to suggest that, politically, we lead an independent course yet like an old mole burrowing underneath this empty shell of sovereignty the actual reality is that the economy each year was bound that much more firmly to the British economy.</P>
    <P>If one looks at any <i>Irish Press</i> editorial at the moment one would think we were in a state of war with Britain while at the same time pursuing in unison with them a step by step approach of entry into the EEC. I just give this as an illustration of the kind of double-think politics practised by the present Government for many years.  It is true to say that we did not have a full going sovereignty when the economic dependence of this country on the British market was copper fastened year by year.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was the great riveting job of that dependence. We did not have a true sovereignty against the background of that situation it is true but it is time that the population of the Twenty-six Counties grew up to the implications of the policies pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>Presumably, had there been any independence in our application to join the EEC, we would have accepted the Gaullist offer in the early 1960s for a form of association for at least an independent initiative, but because our application from the outset in the eyes of the Government was simply a gloss of the British initiative we did not accept that Gaullist offer made clearly in the 1960s.  Indeed, if the Westminster Parliament in the morning changed their minds in this matter our application would go like the application in the early 1960s went, it would go the way of all flesh.  We would call home our people in Brussels and we would have another long sojourn in close unity with the British market.</P>
    <P>I accept that British entry means <Col N="1522" /> there should be a relationship with the EEC on the part of this country. The debate should be about the kind of relationship appropriate to our position and that relationship can go all the way up from entry at one end to association and trade agreement at the other.  We have seen already what the Swedes and other countries have been able to do in attempting to get an evolutionary character to the agreement they might have with the EEC. Our fundamental criticism has been non-negotiations from the start and seemingly no safeguard for our employment position in membership.</P>
    <P>We know there is no regional policy developed within the Community to meet our needs.  That may be understandable enough.  We know we have no regional policy within the boundaries of the State here to meet our employment needs.  In that situation who could look for support for an application to join a free trade entry arrangement where there appears to be no concern either at State level here to frame a regional policy to meet our needs here nor any apparent pressure on the Community in our negotiations for a regional policy geared to meet our requirements?</P>
    <P>The onus of proof lies on those who are attempting to bring us into membership to prove exactly how we may save the jobs we have.  It is not the Labour Party who are in the dock but those who are seeking to bring us into this larger Community where all, they say, will be milk and honey.  On the way to bringing us into this promised land they have also the onus of clearly spelling out the implications of their actions.  In this Third Amendment Bill they do not spell out the implications of their actions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may be preparing for a general election in which he does not wish to have these constitutional implications spelled out.  He obviously thinks it may be embarrassing to say that the State would no longer be sovereign and independent.  He has to put up with this embarrassment if there is a general election in the offing.  He will have to make up his mind what he wants to do, bring this country into the EEC or have a general election, but <Col N="1523" /> his application may become a casualty of his election ambitions if he tries to combine both.  I hope that he can see his way to ensuring that this House can have a united voice in ensuring that the people have, in coming to their decision on the EEC, a document before them which spells out the constitutional implications.</P>
    <P>We are not against the idea of a referendum.  We want to have the people involved in it as soon as possible. The Taoiseach does not convince me when he says that the courts will finally decide on the implications of our entry, that he is not in a position to list out the actual changes which will follow on our entry.  He leaves unstated the actual portions of our Constitution which may be affected. The White Paper early in 1970 mentioned among the provisions of the Constitution which have to be considered in this regard, Article 5, Article 6.2º which provides that the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the Government are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by the Constitution and Article 15.2º which vests in the Oireachtas the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State and provides that no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.</P>
    <P>In 1970 the White Paper referred to these three obvious Articles but now we appear to have retreated from that position, shrouding our whole purpose in high mystery, putting forward this blanket phrase and hoping that covers our political flanks.  I do not think a citizen of a State with a fixed Constitution which incorporates in it certain fundamental guarantees could be happy with an amendment which appears to shroud in mystery the effects of such an amendment on his Constitution.  If the Government are anxious to see that the people declare unambiguously for or against entry, it must be clear to them that the present means they have chosen in the Third Amendment will not secure that willingness on the part of the electorate to look at the issue squarely and honestly and to give their verdict accordingly.</P>
    <P>Instead, the air will be black with <Col N="1524" /> accusations of sell-out, of dishonesty and duplicity&mdash;and political life in this country has enough of such accusations at the moment.  I do not see why we should deliberately prepare for a referendum campaign which would be marked by this kind of approach on the part of those participating in it and on the part of the electorate.</P>
    <P>As we know to our cost, the Constitution is defective in a number of vital respects.  It is a positive obstacle to a further advance on this island towards a meeting of minds and hearts, which is supposed to be the stated objective of all parties in this House. The Constitution has certain positive features; it has taken over certain common law traditions and incorporated them in a fixed Constitution and we would be wrong to depart from these guarantees unknowingly.  I made the point that, by contrast, the Saorstát Constitution was framed more in the spirit of a Thirty-two County State than the Constitution of 1937.  The latter is a monument to the Twenty-six County State, with its prejudices and pomp of that period.  A weakness of the Saorstát Constitution is that it became a creature of Parliament; it did not have the strength of the 1937 Constitution, of the people themselves being the sole arbiters of changes in that Constitution, but there are virtues in the Saorstát Constitution which are not shared by the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>Article 46 states:</P>
    <P>Any provision of this Constitution may be amended whether by way of variation, addition, or repeal, in the manner provided by this Article.</P>
    <P>The whole spirit of Article 46 is that any changes, amendments or repeals should be spelled out.  It is clear that the Third Amendment ignores the spirit of Article 46; it does not spell out the changes that are considered to follow on the passage of the Third Amendment.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Taoiseach could clarify in his own mind what he is seeking to do at the present time. If he is seeking to get a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer on the question of our accession to the EEC, he could use, as we suggested, Article 27, or at least examine our suggestion to see if it is <Col N="1525" /> practicable.  Certainly he could consult with his advisers for a better means of reaching the electorate than the one he has chosen.  Since all parties are agreed on the idea of a referendum, that the people should be consulted on this supreme issue, the Taoiseach could have consulted in a frank way with the other parties to see if we could have agreed on the means of going to the people in the matter of the referendum.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks there has been a spate of suggestions of inter-party discussions&mdash;I have suggested one or two initiatives in that regard&mdash;but here was an initiative the Taoiseach could have taken to consult with Fine Gael and Labour and see if an agreed document could not have been put before the electorate for their verdict.  Instead, we have been presented with a dishonestly contrived Third Amendment to the Constitution.  It does not say what changes are intended; the Taoiseach evades his responsibility by suggesting that this is a matter for the courts.  I do not think he is discharging adequately his duty as Taoiseach by giving this kind of excuse.  It is his job, if changes in the Constitution follow, to list those changes.  No court could criticise him for suggesting particular amendments that may be necessary. During the last ten years when we attempted to join the EEC, the debate from the Government side has been conducted on the basis of giving as little information as possible.  This has happened in the economic sphere where sufficient safeguards have not been given and the trade unions have complained on numerous occasions about the lack of information on vital questions affecting their membership. It appears the same attitude continues when we consider the political and constitutional implications of entry.</P>
    <P>In the political and economic spheres at least, the Taoiseach should come before the House with a document which either comes out clearly and unambiguously on the constitutional implications of entry or, alternatively, looks at Article 27 and comes to a decision about whether we can have a Bill which could go to the people on the basis of whether we wish to enter the EEC.  The Labour <Col N="1526" /> Party do not oppose the idea of a referendum but we consider that the conditions of true consultation with the people in a referendum on a supremely important matter are not best fulfilled in the form suggested in the Third Amendment.  This is our only reason for opposing it at this stage.  Our general approach on the economic implications has been spelled out elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Any Bill providing for a referendum to amend the Constitution is important and the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971, is particularly important.  Not alone is an amendment of the Constitution at stake but on the decision of the people of this country will depend whether we should enter the EEC.  That certainly is the most important decision the people have been asked to make in the past 50 years.</P>
      <P>This party believes we should enter Europe because we are convinced that it is economically advantageous for us to do so and because we are also convinced that it is nationally sound for us to enter.  It is, therefore, very important that the referendum necessary before we enter Europe should be put to the people in such a way that they will clearly understand which amendments they are being asked to make in the Constitution and what effect a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in that referendum will have for them and for the country.</P>
      <P>I propose very briefly to try to convince the House that this country should enter the EEC and I propose to put before the House reasons why I think this Bill as drafted, particularly the Schedule to it, contains a dangerous question to put before the people and contains dangerous provisions which are far too vague, far too far-reaching, and which will have effects that cannot now be appreciated or understood.  In my opinion, the result will be that the people will reject this proposed amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said we believe that we should become members of the Common Market.  In our opinion it is economically wise and even necessary for this country to join Europe.  We in <Col N="1527" /> this party have never believed that Ireland could live in splendid isolation from the rest of the world or that the people of this country should be asked to live here in patriotic poverty.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to be surprised that Fine Gael agree with Fianna Fáil on the question of joining Europe.  To anybody who gives this matter a moment's thought, there is nothing surprising about that.  The only surprising thing about this Bill, about the proposal to enter Europe, is that it should be made by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;that Fianna Fáil should ask the people to enter Europe and to make the necessary amendments in the Constitution to do so.  I say that because it represents a rightabout turn on all that that party have been advocating in the past.</P>
    <P>One can be accused of going back too far, of raking up old statements made in the past.  In so far as I do that, I am doing so only to demonstrate to the people of this country that we in this party have not changed our views about looking beyond the shores of this country, about looking to wider and more profitable markets than that of the approximately 3 million people who reside in this country.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that in any acrimonious way, but I think it should be said.  The records of this House will show that members of the Taoiseach's party in the past are on record as having said that we could live here, and live well, if every ship was at the bottom of the sea.  That could only mean that we in this country could live here without trading with any other part of the world, because when that statement was made the only means of communication or of transporting goods from here to Great Britain and to Europe was by sea.  We were also told by a distinguished Fianna Fáil leader that we could do without importing tea, that we could use a light beer instead.  I am forced to say that people behave irresponsibly enough in this country after a few beers in the evening and that I should hate to see how they would behave if they had it for breakfast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> That is what we were invited to do not so long ago.  We were also told in the past that this country's cattle trade was not an indispensable part of our economy, that there is no great virtue in the bullock, the heifer, the cow, that in order to maintain or to keep national independence we could get on without the cattle trade.  I am putting this on record to show that it is not the Fine Gael Party who have changed in their attitude to seeking better, more extensive markets.  That has always been the approach of this party.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is a good thing to see that after all those years Fianna Fáil have come to realise that the policy of Fine Gael was, indeed, the sound policy.  It is too bad that it has cost this country so much economically, so much in bitterness, to get that lesson brought home completely to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It would be very regrettable, of course, if the only argument in favour of joining the EEC was the economic one.  It must be admitted that if Great Britain joins and we do not join, back we go into the 1930s when there was no market for our cattle except under enormous tariffs and duties.  It is not necessary to develop that part of the argument because it stands out.  As I have said, it would be regrettable if that were the only argument in favour of this country joining Europe.</P>
    <P>I wish to go on record as saying that in my opinion there are sound national reasons why we should join the EEC.  In the 1930s when we destroyed this country economically we also, by the policy advocated by the then leader of Fianna Fáil, drove a wedge between the people of the Six North-Eastern Counties and the people of the Twenty-six Counties.  We decided that we would live in isolation.  The result was that the people of the Six Counties became absolute strangers to the people of the Twenty-six Counties. We were driven apart economically. When there was no reason for us to have commercial communication we ceased visiting the North and the northern people ceased visiting us.  We became not alone strangers to each other, but we developed hatred and fears which sprang from ignorance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> Entry into the EEC will restore commercial inter-mingling between the two parts of our country.  The people will get to know each other better and the commercial communication will do more to end Partition than the bombings, blasting and shooting of the present time.</P>
    <P>It is significant to hear Mr. Faulkner Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, saying in the Northern Commons yesterday what I am saying now and what I am on the record of this House as having said last year.  As reported this morning, Mr. Faulkner said, in a discussion on the White Paper on entry into Europe in the Northern Commons, that when Great Britain and Northern Ireland enter Europe and when we enter that Community there would be more communication between the people of north and south and between the people of England and of Ireland as a whole and that that would lead to a clearing-up of the misunderstandings existing between us.  I have not got the quotation and I do not know whether Mr. Faulkner spelled it out or not but he certainly implied that entry into Europe would lead towards a coming together of the people and an ending of Partition.  I do not believe a northern politician would have said that in the Northern Commons five years ago.  It is refreshing to hear such a statement.</P>
    <P>Apart from economic reasons for entry, we have a national incentive in believing that entry into Europe will do away with the Border and make the artificial line between north and south of our country meaningless. From that will come a state of affairs that we all so much wish for and that is a 32-county united Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should put the question involving whether or not we enter Europe to the people in the clearest possible terms without ambiguity and in a way which will enable them to understand what they are being asked to do and which will enable them, also, to give a clear answer.  The history of referenda in this country since the Constitution of 1937 has not been a happy one from the point of view of those who advocated <Col N="1530" /> the change.  In 1937 we had a referendum in which the people were asked whether or not they wished to enact the 1937 Constitution.  Records show that there was a very small poll. That was the first occasion on which I had any part in a general election as a personating agent.  I remember clearly the bundles of constitutional ballot papers which were found hidden under the writing pads in the voting cubicles when the voting was over. The people did not understand them and they threw them away.  The Constitution was passed by a small vote of the people.  That is not relevant now but what is relevant is that in 1959 the outgoing leader of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time threw his considerable weight behind a referendum, coupling the referendum with his own personal prestige, in order to get the people to change the system of voting and to abolish PR.  There were arguments for and against.  The people said that they knew the system they had and understood it.  They had been told that there were dangers in the system of voting offered in replacement of the existing system and they simply said: &ldquo;No.  We will hold on to what we have.  There is too much doubt about this.  There are arguments for and against which we do not understand and when we are in doubt we simply say `No'.  We will hold on to what we have.&rdquo;  They defeated the proposal to change the Constitution in 1959.</P>
    <P>That proposal was repeated in 1968 in a package deal in two different Bills. One Bill dealt with the number of Deputies per so many thousand voters. The other Bill contained a package deal; the straight vote and some sort of a commission to arrange the constituencies.  Again the people said: &ldquo;We do not trust this proposal.  It is dangerous.  We do not clearly understand it.  We are told that, if we accept the straight vote, the Government will get 90 seats at the next election and we will set up here a single party State in which there will be no effective Opposition in Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many people said, I believe: &ldquo;That may be so, or it may not be so, but it is certainly an argument being put forward <Col N="1531" /> by people who have given thought to it.  We will not vote for a change when we do not understand clearly what the change is all about.  We will hold on to what we have.&rdquo;  They did so by an overwhelming majority.  That is the record of referenda to-date.  The people are slow to change the Constitution, especially if there is anything vague about the proposal, or if there is considerable opposition to it.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this Bill Deputy Cosgrave said that this referendum cannot be carried without the support of this party.  About that there is no doubt.  It is a political fact of life.  Unless this party throw their weight behind the proposal to alter the Constitution to enter Europe it will be defeated.  It will be clear from my remarks that we believe we should enter Europe.  We also believe that the Bill as drafted is much too vague, goes much too far and is unnecessarily far-reaching in its proposals.  There are arguments which people who are against entering Europe will put forward in the clearest possible terms to the electors at chapel gates and at meetings.  I suppose time will be given to the various parties on television and radio.  The same arguments will be put forward there.  They will also be put forward in the Press.</P>
    <P>I do not want this party to be put in the position of trying to answer arguments against the amendment to which, in fact, there will be no valid answers.  Therefore, I appeal to the Taoiseach and members of his party to accept the amendments which will be put down by the Fine Gael Party on Committee Stage, and which will spell out in the clearest possible terms the changes we are making in the Constitution. A trend has crept into legislation in the Oireachtas in my ten years of membership.  When a Bill is being put through the House the trend is not to ask for what you want today only, but to stretch out and ask for what may be necessary in the next 20 years.  There is a definite trend in legislation here on the part of the various Departments to get more and more control over the lives of the people, to get unnecessary control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> When the Opposition put forward the argument that such a proposal is dangerous, or that such a section of a Bill is dangerous and opens the way to abuse or the curtailment of personal rights, they are immediately told by the Minister in charge: &ldquo;You are not approaching it in a realistic way.  You know that will never happen.&rdquo;  How often have we heard that from those benches?  When the Forcible Entry Bill was being put through this House, we were given an assurance that it would never be used against an unfortunate family man who went into an unoccupied house to provide shelter for himself and his family.  We were told that what we were saying about that simply was not true, and that such a prosecution would never be brought. If the reports which I read in the papers are correct, the first case brought under the Forcible Entry Act was brought against exactly such an individual within the past week, against a man who went into a house in order to get shelter for himself and his family.  That must have been the case because the Probation of Offenders Act was applied.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle has just taken the Chair and he will probably be wondering what the Forcible Entry Act has got to do with the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I am saying that this Bill goes too far and that it follows the trend which I have detected in legislation here over the years of Ministers and Departments taking more than sufficient-for-the-day powers in Bills.  I gave the Forcible Entry Act as an example.  There is a tendency to take a sledge-hammer to kill a fly.  It was apparent in the Road Traffic Bill which provided for arrest without warrant for dangerous parking. It is typical of the very dangerous trend that is projecting itself into our legislation.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that, when we are presented with a proposal to amend the Constitution which the Government think it will be easy to shove across because it is coupled with our entry into Europe, we should find in a Schedule gloriously&mdash;dangerously is a better word&mdash;vague terms such as this:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities...</P>
    <P>What in the name of goodness does &ldquo;consequent on membership&rdquo; mean? During previous debates in this House dictionaries had to be wheeled in on trolleys.  I believe that if the interpretation of this enactment is left to the Supreme Court the ushers will be very busy, indeed, carrying in dictionaries and other heavy books because it will be difficult to explain to the five judges of the Supreme Court what exactly is meant.  I would not envy the five members of the Supreme Court having to reserve judgment and having to retire and try to give a reasoned judgment in interpreting this provision of the Constitution, bearing in mind what depended on it.  That is the sort of argument that can be put to the Irish people if the question is put to them in this form&mdash;if they are asked to decide this question on the Schedule as drafted.  I have no hesitation in saying that the people could be terrified sufficiently by those who are violently opposed to our joining the EEC to say &ldquo;We are not buying a pig in a poke; we will hold on to what we have&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not a Constitutional lawyer and neither have I pretensions to any such status but I am speaking now as a man who claims to have a fair knowledge of how the minds of country people react to politicians and to proposals put to them by politicians. I suggest to the House that it can be and will be argued that if this amendment is accepted, it will then be open to the Government of the day to make such changes as the Community may decide from time to time.  That is a blank cheque that could involve us in anything.  There are certain Articles of the Constitution that it is necessary to amend.  The country will cease to be a sovereign State.  That will be hard for many people to accept but if we are to participate in Europe we must accept it as being a realistic fact but Great Britain, also, will cease to be a Sovereign State as West Germany and <Col N="1534" /> France have ceased to be sovereign States in the ordinary meaning of the word.</P>
    <P>Another provision of the Constitution provides that Oireachtas Éireann alone shall have power to make laws. binding on the people of this country. That will go by the board.  Why not say so?  The European Parliament will have power to make laws binding on this State.  Why not say that?  It is written elsewhere in the Constitution that the decision of the Supreme Court of this country shall be final and binding on citizens and that no appeal shall lie to any other court from a decision of the Supreme Court.  That part of the Constitution, too, will go if we enter Europe.  It is necessary so to provide because there will be an appeal to the European Court.  Why not set those matters out in a schedule and also any others that are necessary and say: &ldquo;Do you agree on the amendments to the Constitution as specified in the Schedule to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill?&rdquo;  Why in the name of all that is sensible ask the people to accept that:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities...</P>
    <P>If, instead of &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; there were the words &ldquo;required by&rdquo; or &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo;, these words, while they might not be acceptable, would certainly be less dangerous.  &ldquo;Consequent on&rdquo; might mean that we wanted to give a lead and that the Government could agree to advocate some proposal that would change completely the Constitution of this country but that it would not be necessary. Members of Fianna Fáil have misjudged the Irish people in the past on a question of changing the Constitution. I advise them not to do it again and I want to say that this Party will refuse to be put in a position of arguing in favour of something in which we do not believe and that we will refuse to be put in a position of justifying something that we believe to be dangerous.  It is only honest and fair that what is involved here should be spelled out to the people in this Bill <Col N="1535" /> and not in argument and counterargument during the campaign that will precede the referendum.  It should be spelled out in this Bill in a way that will enable the editorial writers to say in the newspapers what is involved in the referendum and that anybody who says anything else is not being realistic but is being mischievous.</P>
    <P>The newspapers of this country behave in a responsible way and I believe that they would recommend the proposed changes in the Constitution to the people, provided that these changes are unambiguous and absolutely clear.  If any particular section of the press of this country were to say to the people: &ldquo;You are being asked to do something dangerous&rdquo;, this proposal would have no chance of being accepted.  During the past 12 months we have seen the Government reeling under attacks from the press and eventually giving in.  I refer to the dole issue in May of this year.  The Government do not seem to realise that it is of the utmost importance that this question be put clearly to the people and that it is not put to them by way of a package deal meaning anything or meaning nothing.  Anybody who wanted to argue that what we are doing here is scrapping the Constitution completely could so argue.  It would take a very sophisticated argument and I should say that the man who gets up and says that the proposal in this Bill is to scrap the Constitution may be going too far but the people will know what he is saying. They will understand him.  The constitutional lawyer who gets up to refute that argument will be speaking sophisticated, constitutional language with reference to the Treaty of Rome, the Steel Treaty and all the rest of it and the people will not understand him. If you get that sort of situation you will certainly get the result that the Government rightly got in 1959 and in 1968 in their two previous attempts to change the Constitution.  If I were to speak for the rest of the day.  I could not say more than argue this simple proposition, that I believe it is essential for this country to get into Europe and I believe that this Bill, as drafted, is the best possible method of keeping us out of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> For goodness sake, come clean with the people.  Let them know what you are asking them to do.  Have sufficient faith in them to believe that if you spell out in black and white what you are asking them to do and tell them why you are asking them to do that and show that it is necessary, in simple language, they will go with you.  They will not buy a pig in a poke.  They have proved that in the past.  That is inherent in the Irish approach to elections.  They are a bit suspicious of change unless they clearly know what the change is.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to repeat in general terms that I believe it is in the interests of this country economically to enter the EEC because we will have better markets, a better standard of living and a bigger population here.  I believe it is nationally in our interests to join Europe because in doing so we will bring the people of the six north eastern counties and the people of the Twenty-six Counties together and we will be on the high road toward the ending of Partition.  But this is a dangerous question to ask the people. It is a cloudy, ambiguous, mixed-up, unintelligent question that it will be very difficult for people who have the interests of this country as a whole at heart to justify before the people and a question that has every chance of being rejected by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The House is discussing probably one of the most important questions that will ever be put to the people.  We will be asking the people whether it is their desire and their intention that we should become a member of the EEC or stay aloof and remain an isolated island to the west of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted by the people, except for some isolated groups, that for the benefit of the country and of future generations we should join the EEC.  Having established that, we must move along to this referendum.  I believe that technically we could join the EEC without a referendum but I can see difficulties involved with our Constitution afterwards. Irrespective of whether we have to have a referendum or not, I believe the right decision has been taken in asking the people to decide on this <Col N="1537" /> issue.  It would be unfair to make a major decision like this, change the whole course of Irish history, without consulting the people.  What are we asking the people to do in this referendum? There is no doubt that there are complications, complications as to how it should be put to the people, what is the simple way of putting it.  This is one matter which we have to consider and ensure that we do not confuse the people's minds.  We are asking the people to agree that:</P>
    <P>The State may become a member of the European Coal and Steel Community (established by Treaty, signed at Paris on the 18th day of April, 1951), the European Economic Community (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957) and the European Atomic Energy Committee (established by Treaty signed at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957).  No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in this State.</P>
    <P>We are asking the people to agree that we should become a member of these three Communities &mdash; no more or no less.  This House would have no right to make this country a member of any other Communities which may be established in the future without going back to the people and asking their permission.</P>
    <P>I know the change in the Constitution is a delicate subject for the people of Ireland.  This Constitution which was enacted by the people in 1937 is their safeguard and it is something which they cherish very much.  That does not mean that it should not be changed from time to time because people are changing, the ways of life are changing.  Would anyone think, in 1937 that we would become a member of a European Community, that our voice would be heard in the Commission and in the Council of Ministers?  I do not believe that at <Col N="1538" /> that time the people envisaged these developments, that they envisaged that our country would be accepted and that our voice would be heard and that our voice would help to plan and structure the Europe of the future. These things were not taken into consideration at that time.  It was never meant that this Constitution or all its Articles were to last indefinitely.  I am sure all Constitutions have to be changed with the times.  As things evolve we must move along.  For that reason it is necessary that every so often we should have a look at our Constitution and see if we are keeping up with the world as it moves forward. Indeed, when we eventually become a 32-county State a completely new look will have to be taken at the Constitution. We will have to frame a Constitution with our northern brethren.  We will have to do it in consultation with the people of Northern Ireland, taking their point of view and enshrining in it something that will be acceptable to all.  That is for a future day.  That day will come.  As the Taoiseach has stated, we will be willing at any time to discuss changes which may be necessary to bring about that harmony.  What we are asking the people now will have no bearing on these future changes because Northern Ireland and Britain will be joining the Community in conjunction with us. When the decision was made in the House of Commons, by quite a substantial majority, to enter Europe, the argument for our remaining out ceased.  It is only right that we should move as speedily as possible and any constitutional amendments that may be considered necessary should be introduced to the House and put before the people in a clear-cut fashion.</P>
    <P>A Deputy suggested that the Articles which require amendment should be itemised.  This may be a valid point but it must be taken into consideration that this might cause confusion amongst the electorate.  At the moment we know that Article 5, Article 6.2º and Article 15.2º require to be amended but what I am not sure of is whether or not at some future date other Articles will be challenged in the Supreme Court.  Other actions taken by the Community which will be considered <Col N="1539" /> repugnant to certain other Articles of our Constitution might be challenged.  That would place us in a dangerous situation.  We must ensure that the question put to the people in the referendum will be acceptable in Brussels and will stand up in our Supreme Court.  There is no use in saying that amendments will be brought in if they are not accepted by the Community.  The fact of introducing them would complicate the issue.  Any change in regard to the proposals put to the people will have to be very carefully scrutinised first in this country and secondly in Brussels so that they will be acceptable to the Community.</P>
    <P>I realise that it is difficult to frame amendments but there are many lawyers in this House and you will find that there will be very little change made in what we are putting here when the Bill has been processed through the House.  The constitutional lawyers available to the Government and, I have no doubt, in consultation with Brussels, have scrutinised the proposals closely in order to ensure that they are acceptable to Brussels and that at the same time the laws enacted by the three Communities, will be accepted by this country and will not be challenged in our Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we are reducing our sovereignty.  Absolute sovereignty is of little value if the country is isolated from the rest of the world, if one's actions bear no fruit in other European countries.  By all means you can keep your sovereignty while other countries in Europe are sharing sovereignty and are progressing in the areas of economics, agriculture, social welfare, regional policies, and enriching their own people and the people of Europe.  We can retain our sovereignty and remain completely isolated.  The choice is ours to make.  Article 5 states that Ireland is a sovereign, democratic State.  I believe that Ireland remains a sovereign democratic State on entering Europe.  Sovereignty, to a certain degree, is diminished where a country signs a trade agreement with another country.  This House can commit the country to a trade agreement at any <Col N="1540" /> given time.  You reduce sovereignty to the extent that you give your bond to keep a trade agreement.  When we became a member of the United Nations and decided to abide by majority vote, we ceded part of our sovereignty.  This is what we will be doing when we enter Europe.  We will be entering into a trade pact with other European countries.</P>
    <P>I agree that measures taken within the three Communities will be valid in this country but we are confining ourselves specifically to these three Communities and it is only acts which take place within these three Communities that we are asking the people to say should be valid in this country.  I cannot go along with the view of Deputy Fitzpatrick that we should spell it out. Already, in the Treaty of Rome, the reasons why the three Articles require amendment are given.  It would not be feasible to put the questions in a complicated manner to the people.  They must be put in as simple a form as possible and I believe they will be so put as to require a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer.  It is the duty of this House, the duty of Deputies, the duty of newspapers to explain to the people what is involved in the question.  If there were any other way of putting the question that would be done.  The Government are not concealing anything from the people.  The people can clearly see the type of Community they are entering.  The form of the question that will be put to the people will probably be disputed in this House.</P>
    <P>The most important thing is to ensure that the Bill is effective.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Fitzpatrick saying that he did not agree with the way the Bill was framed.  Last Thursday night I listened to his colleague, Deputy FitzGerald, saying that he had looked at various other forms and he disagreed with Deputy Keating's suggestion of a global amendment; in effect, he said that this was the best amendment with, perhaps, two or three words changed.  This amendment is, as far as he could see, the most valid for the purpose of our entry into the Common Market.  Fine Gael believe we should go in.  They will have some amendments, but I believe there will be <Col N="1541" /> very little change in the amendment before us now.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party take a negative approach to the Common Market. They maintain we should not join; we should look for association.  I believe that view is shared by very few because more and more people are coming to see the potential.  In whatever walk of life they are they realise that the future for us lies with Europe.  They know isolationism is no longer possible.  That day is gone.  The day that is with us is the day of joining with the bigger countries, a union in which we can play a part and share in the benefits.</P>
    <P>A business that is not competitive eventually becomes sterile.  I have seen that down through the years.  A business that is not competitive never expands.  Competition is a life force in business.  When we enter Europe we will be driven by an outside force which will compel us to expand.  Our industrialists, our manufacturers, our agriculturists will have to ensure that they are as good as, if not better than, their counterparts in Europe.  They will learn new techniques by joining the Common Market.  People will be coming back from Europe with all the latest know-how.  This will be an incentive to all.</P>
    <P>We are a proud nation and our people will never let it be said that other nations are better than we are. Personally, I think this has come ten or 15 years too late.  Had we entered into this Community 15 or 20 years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The country is all right.  We have saved it for the past 50 years. We will undoubtedly benefit by entering the Common Market.  I do not believe in association.  That would be a disaster.  In association we would have no say in policy.  We would not benefit from the common agricultural policy.  I am sure Deputy Clinton is interested in it.  I believe that, if the issues are put clearly to the people, the people will act intelligently.  But the issues must not be complicated or <Col N="1542" /> clouded over.  Anything like that would be dishonest.  The people must not be misled as to what is at stake. Should we be so unfortunate as to lose the referendum, then those responsible will, I believe, be judged very harshly by historians of the future.  We may never again get an opportunity like this.  The opportunity for us is now.  If we do not accept it we shall be left behind.</P>
      <P>There will be difficulties naturally. But everything worthwhile is invariably difficult of achievement.  That which is easily come by is rarely of much use.  There will be difficulties for some industries.  So be it.  Other industries will expand.  We will have a regional policy and, under that policy, we will be able to industrialise the West.  Already experiments are being carried out in southern Italy.  There will be a regional policy for Scotland, Wales and parts of Britain.  It is ludicrous to think of keeping this country outside the mainstream of economic advancement.  Those who think like that have little imagination.  I have no doubt as to how the people will decide. Though they cherish their Constitution they will be prepared to change it for the common good, the advancement and betterment of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a political gimmick.  This is something above politics.  Fine Gael approve of entry.  I believe that the people in Brussels will accept this amendment.  They will say: &ldquo;Yes, this will stand up within the Community.&rdquo; These are the issues as I see them. Some members of this House may try to confuse the people about them and if they do they will be doing a great disservice to the electorate.  It is far from true to say we have tried to deceive the people.  During the past three or four years at every cross roads, in every public house and in every home the pros and cons of entry to the EEC have been discussed. This is not something which is being put to the electorate at very short notice.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has produced and circulated literature about our proposed entry. I believe television should now play its role and put the facts plainly before the people.  I do not suggest <Col N="1543" /> they adopt an attitude either for or against entry, but it is their duty to inform the people about this major decision which they will have to take.  It is the duty of politicians to explain this amendment to the people because when people are asked to make this important decision they will be making it not only for themselves but for their children and their grandchildren and for that reason the Third Amendment must be explained and truthfully put to the people.  We must ensure that this decision will stand up to the test of time.  I hope at some future date the Community will not bring in an Act which will be repugnant to a section of our Constitution. If this ever happened we would have failed our people because we will have told them that the amendment would be valid and acceptable by the community at large.</P>

      <P>I disagree entirely with Deputy Fitzpatrick &mdash; for the record it is as well to state Deputy Fitzpatrick, Fianna Fáil, because of the danger of confusion, he having followed Deputy Fitzpatrick, Fine Gael &mdash; that the view expressed by Deputy FitzGerald was that this was the only form of amendment that could be put to the people. He did add that of course a few words needed to be changed here and there; these are the few vital words which can make all the difference to the meaning of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> I have come in to say a few words on this Bill to amend the Constitution because in it we are taking the first legal steps to enable our people to decide whether or not they want to join the EEC.  It has been said before and it is no harm to say it again that this is probably the most important decision that our people will be called upon to make since the foundation of the State. In circumstances of this kind where the matter is of such importance it is only right that we should insist the Government explain the extent of the commitment which they are recommending to the people.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party &mdash; a party which is also committed to the idea of European unity and membership of the EEC &mdash; feel we have a grave obligation to press the Government to spell out as accurately as possible the limitations of the obligations to be assumed should the majority of the people say, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the question proposed to be asked in the referendum.  We feel the wording in this Bill does not spell out or limit in a measurable way the obligations which could be imposed subsequent to the passing of this amendment.  Previous Fine Gael speakers have attempted to outline the sort of amendment that would be both clear and definitive.  While Deputy FitzPatrick describes this in an offhand way by saying that it might be necessary to change a few words here and there, that can make all the difference.  It is the few vague and loose words contained in the proposed amendment which make it unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Why should we leave ourselves open to be tied to anything extra by a vague, open-endedness that is completely unnecessary? I am sure it is not beyond the ability of the lawyers attached to the Government and to the various people Deputy Fitzpatrick said are available to them to indicate a way that we could limit in words the obligations we would be entering on as a result of a decision, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;. This is the only fault we have to find and what amazes me is that no Government speaker has come in before now and said: &ldquo;We agree; there appears here to be an open-endedness, an undesirable vagueness which we see now <Col N="1545" /> although we did not see it earlier on. We are prepared before the Committee Stage to take another look at the wording of this amendment, make the necessary changes and thereby make it acceptable.&rdquo;  There are limits to which we as a party, committed to membership of the EEC, are prepared to go.  We will not ask the people to take a jump into the dark; we will not ask the people to commit themselves in the manner that it is proposed in an amendment which says: &ldquo;No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.&rdquo;  That involves us in anything the Community would wish to involve us in later should they so desire.  Even Deputy Fitzpatrick opposite, I think, would agree with this.  Surely that leaves us wide open to anything.  He wants to join EEC; he thinks it is a good thing. He thinks it is good for the country. So do I, even though a periodical recently numbered me among those now changing their minds and taking a fresh look at the idea.  I am no fool and, as I see it, if Britain enters the Common Market there is no course open to us but to enter the Common Market unless we are prepared to go back to the hair shirt and accept standards of living that our young people will no longer accept, unless we are prepared for wholesale unemployment and emigration.  That is what confronts us if Britain goes in and we do not.  Our markets will go.  What will we do with our agricultural and industrial production?  Give it away?</P>
    <P>We talk vaguely about trade agreements. We saw what we could do with trade agreements when we were seeking a butter quota in the British market, a very small thing: they decided what they would give and the price they would pay.  If we cut ourselves off from this market and from Europe, what can we do with our-production? There is no point in producing if we cannot sell.  Where shall we look for jobs?  It is said that there <Col N="1546" /> will be a serious risk to many of our small industries and small farmers. Other countries in Europe face this also.  I discussed this with representatives of various countries that have already joined and know the consequences of membership and, without exception they all say, including small farmers and small industrialists, that there was an overspill of the extra wealth in all sections of the community. Small farmers were better off and small industrialists, perhaps, had to change from running industries on their own to becoming service industries. There was of course temporary disruption and that will apply here also but it will be nothing to the disruption that will inevitably take place if Britian enters and we do not.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the question of whether we should join EEC or not is very important and there is a question that should be put to the people as clearly as possible; that is, what are the alternatives? What are we likely to involve our people in if they say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;?  I think this Bill proposes the vaguest possible way of putting it to the people.  I know there are difficulties about outlining clearly in one amendment what the country is committed to but this Bill, as now worded could commit us to anything.  Deputy Fitzpatrick on the opposite side may say that Deputies should explain exactly what is involved and should inform the people of the obligations they are undertaking if they agree to this amendment.  With due respect to the Deputy, I say he does not know what is involved and I do not think any Member of the House could say or decide or measure what is involved if we pass this Bill.  I am amazed that no speaker has said: &ldquo;You are right in this; this can be improved and we will improve it&rdquo; because if they do not &mdash; and this is not a threat &mdash; the Government could very easily find themselves on their own fighting this Referendum to change the Constitution and enable us to enter EEC. Those would be tragic circumstances for the country as a whole.  We certainly cannot ask the people to do something that we cannot explain to them and that Deputy Fitzpatrick cannot explain <Col N="1547" /> even though he pretends that this is quite easy.  It is not easy.</P>
    <P>I see so many advantages in EEC membership that I support it very strongly regardless of what any paper writes.  I see in it something that will bring forward very much the unification of this country.  The people of Northern Ireland are hard-headed and they want to know what this means for them economically.  They want to stay on the other side of the Border because they feel there is a material advantage in doing so but if these vested interests disappeared, as inevitably they will with the advent of EEC membership for people on both sides of the Border, I think much of the opposition we now know is there would disappear and this will be a very important factor and a very positive step forward in bringing about unification.  We should not lose sight of this and it is not unimportant among the many reasons why we should join EEC.</P>
    <P>The Government have a very serious obligation to explain to the people that they are not throwing away everything or taking a leap in the dark or being committed to anything. It is the fear of the unknown that would hold the people back and perhaps be responsible for them making a very unwise decision.  I have heard great fears expressed for our small farmers and industrialists.  There will be initial difficulties but they will be overcome to the definite and positive advantage of this country.</P>
    <P>We heard and still hear about fisheries. In my view the negotiations on fisheries are being responsibly carried out.  It is very difficult when one is not nearer the scene to decide whether the wisest course was taken in deciding in regard to fisheries that a decision should be delayed until the four applicant countries had joined.  If we got away with that we would probably finish up in the best possible position knowing that no decision so far has ever been taken in EEC without unanimity on the part of all the countries involved.  I am sure it was on this that our Foreign Minister relied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> On the other hand it may be that if we had adopted the line taken by Norway and supported them strongly even if we did not succeed in the long run we would have a fall-back to the second position rather than having it as the first position, that is, to wait for a decision until the four applicant countries had joined.  The one consoling thing about the stand that has been taken is that the four applicant countries are as one in their opposition to the six-mile limit which EEC sought to impose.  There is a very big investment involved for many people in fishing boats and gear and they have been encouraged now for some years past so to invest their money. Having done that, it would be dreadful if they were let down by any deliberate decision of the Government but I am sure this will not happen.</P>
    <P>The matter of animal health has to be negotiated.  This is extremely important for our sales of livestock and meat products in America in particular and I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be firm on this matter.  The horticulture industry is an area of concern but the industry would face a serious crisis if Britain entered the Community and we did not.  Even now, the glasshouse industry is in a grave situation and the Government should do something about it.</P>
    <P>This debate could be expanded to allow a full debate on the Common Market but it is not relevant now as we have had debates recently on the EEC and there will be further discussions in the future.  The matter now before the House is whether this is the best form of amendment to the Constitution that can be presented to the people; is it in the clearest form? Will it ensure we are undertaking the minimum obligations required by the various treaties mentioned in the amendment?  We should not take on anything more than is absolutely necessary.  Why should the Government ask the people to leave themselves wide open to unspecified changes, as they are doing?</P>
    <P>It is stated that no provision of the Constitution invalidates laws enacted or measures adopted consequent on <Col N="1549" /> membership of the EEC.  If we accept this open agreement to take anything we will have lost our grip of the situation.  The Government should realise the importance of this and the importance of the full support and backing of Fine Gael in their efforts to explain the position to the Irish people and to give their recommendations to them.  Fine Gael are as much in favour of joining the EEC as are the Government, but the people are entitled to know about the decision they are making.  It should be possible to spell this out clearly and in a simple form but not to use the open-ended words used in this Amendment.  In the last analysis the people will have to make the decision and it is our duty to enable them to see where they are going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure has been described as one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this House since the foundation of the State.  In common with the Partition of our country, it is the matter which is getting all the headlines now.</P>
      <P>The question of entry or non-entry into the EEC is one of the priorities of the Government; so far as I am concerned, the greatest priority is the ending of the cancer of Partition.  I had an opportunity of expressing my point of view in this regard during last weekend and I do not intend to repeat it now because it does not arise in the context of this debate, although the matter may have some relevance.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of play has been made on the emotive question of sovereignty.  When people speak about selling out on our sovereignty they should be very careful about what they say.  It is a generalisation which is meaningless but dangerously emotive. Headlines of this nature have been used on placards and in literature in a dangerous way and I shall do everything possible to ensure that the type of person who produces such slogans is exposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are people who are genuinely opposed to entry into the EEC but they do not produce these slogans, or if they do they are prepared <Col N="1550" /> to discuss the matter.  They are prepared to state their case fairly and the views of such people should get attention.  However, they are not the people about whom I am concerned. There are those who say that Ireland is going to be sold down the river if we enter the EEC; no explanation is given and it is this &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; mentality I am concerned about.  It is our job to listen to the sincere views of those who believe it is not in our interest to join the Common Market and we must try to convince them we are not selling out on our sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Fifty years ago we did not have any sovereignty whatever and in the context of a 32-county State we have not achieved full independence yet.  Any decision we make in relation to EEC entry will be a sovereign decision by the people of the Twenty-six Counties. It is a sovereign decision, a decision we will be making as Irishmen and Irishwomen on our own account. Whether that decision is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, it will be a sovereign decision.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to the three Treaties of Euratom, the EEC and ECSC is not, in the first instance, a political or militaristic commitment. We have had no discussions on the question of political alignment within the European Parliament.  We have had no discussions on the military aspect of any commitment in NATO. In a very off-the-cuff remark, a personal opinion, because NATO preserves the inviolability of the Border between the two parts of our country, I may say that I do not think we should have anything to do with NATO &mdash; if for no other reason than that.  However, that is a very off-the-cuff remark. It is a rather general remark.  The matter would want to be analysed and considered in depth.  My point is that our immediate obligation to the three Treaties I mentioned is economic and social rather than political or militaristic, in terms of defence and so on.  These are the matters we should remember when talking about sovereignty.</P>
    <P>It is also important to ask, do nations like France, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg <Col N="1551" /> consider that, by virtue of their membership of the Common Market, their sovereignty has been eroded to any great degree?  I would say the answer is, no.  France has a great tradition in terms of culture and so on.  I assume she has also had a great intellectual tradition down through the years.  In their own way the French are not unlike us in their love of their country and their love of the independence of their country.  They are not unlike us in that regard and we are not unlike them. They are a national minded people, although they are willing to enter into the international arena for the good of their country, as nationalists should be. A narrow type of inflexible nationalism is a bad thing.  Nationalism becomes internationalism, I assume, when one brings one's country into an arena of other nations.</P>
    <P>Is France selling out on her sovereignty?  This is the question that any reasonably-minded person should ask, looking at France and looking at the legacy of de Gaulle.  The majority of Freachmen considered him and he considered himself a patriotic Frenchman. Was there any question that the France of de Gaulle was in any way selling out on the sovereignty of the country?  The answer is, no.  Anybody who suggests that we are selling out on our sovereignty would want to produce facts and figures rather than emotions and slogans.  It is false and it is fraudulent to suggest that we are selling out on this term, this expression, sovereignty.  If I and all other Members of the Fianna Fáil Party felt that this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill was in any way eroding our right to negotiate a proper future for our country on behalf of the Irish people we would not subscribe, as we do, to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Without going too deeply into the matter again I know that responsible anti-marketeers &mdash; and sometimes the word &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; in this context can be used as indicating a conservative; I would not consider myself to be a conservative; on the contrary &mdash; who wish to put up a reasonable argument against our entry into the Common Market will recognise that we who are <Col N="1552" /> pro-marketeers are as much interested in the future of our country within the Common Market, as they are in the future of our country if they can keep it out of the Common Market.  We are all Irishmen and Irishwomen, pro-marketeer or anti-marketeer.  We have an equal love for our country.  They may think that what they are doing is right.  We believe that what we are doing is right, but we are not the merchants or the prophets of the sell-out. That is an unfair and rather insidious way to argue.  Emotionalism never solves anything.  As one who is inclined to become emotional from time to time I can appreciate that it is an instant thing.  It is not based on an adequate judgment.  It is a flash, an expression.  It does not achieve very much.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald or some other Member of the Fine Gael Party dealt in depth with the expression &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo;, the legalistic and other forms of the expression &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo;. I have not got my notes with me.  I have a speech prepared but nobody else offered and I got in.  If I can continue until Question Time, I may be able to develop certain points of view on Deputy FitzGerald's contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton made a very fair point and I should like to thank him for it.  He said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is carrying out the negotiations in relation to fisheries, at any rate, with great responsibility. That is a fair and decent-minded statement.  He also said that, although he is a convinced European, he finds it very difficult to accept the wording of the amending Bill.  I can appreciate Deputy Clinton's point of view.  If the Bill is found to be defective, as well it might be &mdash; I have not given it any great consideration in the legalistic sense &mdash; there is absolutely no reason in the wide world why the defects cannot be remedied.  If Deputy Clinton is looking for an amending Bill with which he could agree &mdash; not that it would be amended on that account&mdash;he should realise that if there are defects in the Bill as now proposed there is no reason why they should not be remedied and, indeed, will be remedied.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> There is one other matter which should be mentioned.  I think it was Deputy Ryan who made the point that this proposal would not get through to the people, that this amendment would not be accepted by the people if the referendum did not have the co-operation and goodwill of Fine Gael.  Of course, we wish to have the co-operation and goodwill of all parties in bringing this amendment to the people but, at the same time, I would not consider Fine Gael to be doing any favours for the people in giving their co-operation and goodwill on the matter.  Fine Gael have recognised it is imperative that we join the Common Market and that if they voted against our entry in the context of this particular legislation, they would receive a severe backlash from their own supporters. If Fine Gael are saying that goodwill and co-operation comes from their side, they might recognise what they are speaking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has not lasted as long as I anticipated but I think Deputies on all sides will realise that the substance of the Debate on our accession to the European Economic Communities will be on the White Paper.  As the House is aware, the White Paper has not been prepared yet.  There are many reasons for this, the principal one being that all the terms of accession have not been yet finalised, notably the conditions under which we will seek entry to the Communities in relation to our fisheries and, secondly, but perhaps no less important though not as much highlighted, our animal and plant health conditions and obligations.</P>
      <P>The fisheries problem is likely to be resolved by Saturday next.  At least, I hope it will be resolved on Saturday when the postponed meeting on fisheries will take place.  I hope also that then or very soon afterwards our animal and plant health problems will be overcome.  That ought to permit publication of the White Paper during the month of January and I hope it will be possible to have a comprehensive debate on our terms of accession when the Dáil resumes after the Christmas Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the debate the <Col N="1554" /> suggestion was made that, in a sense, we were putting the cart before the horse in introducing the Bill before the Dáil had taken a vote on the terms of accession.  As Deputies are aware, this Bill is an enabling one and following its enactment, the Minister for Local Government will be required to make an Order providing for the Referendum. The Referendum would then take place after not less than 30 days and not later than 90 days.  Therefore, the passing of this Bill is in no way prejudicial or influential in relation to the subject matter of the debate but even after the debate on the White Paper, there will be the legislation required to implement the accession agreement so that between now and, I hope, spring, the House will have plenty of opportunities for debating more fully all these matters.  This Bill is confined to the constitutional means whereby accession to the European Economic Communities could be facilitated, first, if the terms of accession are agreeable to the Dáil and to the country and also, of course, if the people decide to make the necessary amendments to the Constitution that will enable us to take our part in the Community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating who led off for the Opposition made rather startling allegations against the Government in relation to the introduction of this Bill.  I am not using his exact words but he said in effect that we were destroying the Constitution and were taking away from the people their bill of rights.  At this stage I want to say that, assuming the Dáil will accept the constitutional amendment in the terms put forward in this Bill, our courts will still have a say in whatever actions, legislative and by way of Order, that we take, consequent on our membership of the European Economis Communities.  It will be a matter for our courts to decide that whatever action we take, legislatively, will be &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; that membership. Therefore, at all times our courts will have that say in relation to actions taken here by way of legislation in respect of our membership of the Communities.  Perhaps I can expand on that later but it is better to say that much at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> Last week when moving that the Bill be read a second time, I mentioned that the purpose of the Bill was to give to the people the opportunity of deciding whether the Constitution should be amended to the extent necessary to enable us to accede to the European Economic Communities and that in making their decision the people would, at the same time, be saying whether they wished to enter the Communities. I do not think any member of the House will object in any way to facilitating the bringing of this important measure before the people.  I hope it will be possible to clear the remaining Stages between now and the Christmas Recess so that the Seanad shall be able to take the Bill, if not before Christmas, early afterwards and so that, given the acceptance of the other parts of the operation in this House, the people, in the new year and perhaps by April, if possible, will be able to pronounce on whether they wish to become members of the European Economic Communities.  Thereafter there shall be required a considerable amount of legislation for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Treaties so as to make sure that our legislation accords with Community legislation.  It is not certain how this will be done.  It may be possible to have a global Bill implemented and, later, to have specific amendments or specific pieces of legislation but whatever way it is done, there will be a long period between April or May and the end of the year during which time further action on the part of the Dáil and the Government will be required.  In the meantime one of the main difficulties that people see &mdash; and I think this was present in this debate also&mdash;in becoming members of the Communities is the alleged threat to our sovereignty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a Bill to amend the Constitution before the Dáil at present.  So far as other possible amendments are concerned, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 1 and 2 of last Thursday, the 2nd December, in which I stated that I would be prepared to consider the setting up of an all-party committee on the Constitution on the understanding that there would be commitment to the conclusions of such a committee; and in connection with which I envisaged that the committee could undertake preparatory work which would set a basis for negotiating a Constitution suitable for a united Ireland as part of an overall negotiation to achieve a united Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that we have a Constitution Amendment Bill before us today, even at this late stage would the Taoiseach not consider scrapping the present Constitution entirely and having a new Constitution?  The Taoiseach must remember that over the weekend at least one of his Ministers, I think it was the Minister for Lands, suggested that we should have an entirely new Constitution.  A tremendous amount of good could be done by having a new <Col N="1562" /> Constitution.  There would be much more advantage in having a Constitution&mdash;this is only my personal opinion &mdash;that would be agreed by the political parties in this country, or should I say the elected representatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe at all that the Constitution should be scrapped.  The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Keating, said here the other day in moving the amendment to the Bill now before the House that there was much in our Constitution which was worth preserving and I agree with him there, but I do agree also that there are certain provisions of the Constitution that we need to look at especially having regard to the passage of time.  I agree also that the wider the agreement we get to the amendment of that Constitution the better it will be.  I do not agree that now is the time because I want, as I indicated before, to get this single question of acceding to the EEC before the people without any confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will appreciate that arising out of his own Bill, and I agree with my colleague that there are some good parts in the Constitution which I am sure we would retain in a new Constitution, that it will be stripped quite a lot, or amended in a pretty drastic fashion as a result of EEC membership, if the people so decide.  There are other desirable constitutional amendments to which the Taoiseach has referred over the last two or three years that could be embodied in a new Constitution.  The cleanest job would be to scrap it, with all due respect to those people who framed it, and to have a Constitution which will suit the aspirations of people in the whole 32 Countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go this far with the Deputy: I agree that we ought to look at it in its entirety and I am sure having looked at it we will not agree to scrap it in its entirety but rather will we retain the bulk of it.  I have referred to what I suggested last week in my reply, that I would favour an all-party committee here to look at it again but with the difference on this occasion that the all-party committee would have a commitment to their findings <Col N="1563" /> or to their recommendations rather than, as in the case of the last committee, that nobody had any responsibility, either collectively or individually for recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and many of his Ministers, outside the House, have made many speeches declaring their willingness to accommodate disagreement with certain sections of the Constitution which they feel was being expressed both from the minority and the majority sides in Northern Ireland.  Would the Taoiseach say whether, in fact, this accommodation to change the Constitution has to do with the Constitution we have at present or simply with a Constitution for a future united Ireland?  I am a little bit confused about the message coming from the recent speeches of the Taoiseach as to which Constitution he is talking about changing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads my reply today he will see that what I envisage is a Constitution suitable to a united Ireland, a 32-county Ireland, and I said already, I think in this House last week, that it would be better, if we are going to have any amendment of the Constitution to do it in that context rather than amending it now and having it amended later on in the context of a 32-county Republic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an urgency now, or so we are told, about changes in the Constitution because of the imminence of a decision on our membership of the EEC.  Might I respectfully suggest that the situation in this country, and particularly in the Six Counties, is also of importance and, if we are to put a date on membership of the EEC or a date for a referendum on a Constitution that will be in accordance with the Treaty of Rome, surely we should be able to put some sort of date on amendments, as the Taoiseach said himself, although I would prefer a new Constitution, of our present Constitution <Col N="1564" /> in order to do as Deputy O'Leary has suggested in regard to the southern part and the northern part of the country?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the provision of an extra £12 or £13 million to bring the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on health on a level with that in Great Britain would provide a comprehensive health service in this country comparable with that obtaining in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The information required by the Deputy seems to be related to the estimation of the additional financial resources which public authorities in the State would need to put into the health services to equate them with those in the United Kingdom.  The figures given in my reply of 24th November are not satisfactory for this purpose as they show only the part of that expenditure which is met by central taxation and, in our case, by rates and health contributions as well. To the extent that I failed to interpret correctly what was aimed at in this question, I express my regret to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fully comparable figures of gross or net health expenditure as between two countries are difficult to compile because of differing interpretations of what items should be included.  However, using the information available to me on the estimated costs for the current <Col N="1570" /> financial year, I have had figures prepared of the <i>per capita</i> gross expenditure and the <i>per capita</i> impact on the different sources of income in the State and the constituent parts of the United Kingdom.  As there are a number of figures involved, the information is given in a table which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The table shows considerable variations in <i>per capita</i> expenditure as between the different parts of the United Kingdom.  It is difficult on the basis of it to make assumptions about the likely cost of a similar service here. The position would be influenced by differences in socio-economic factors, such as age distribution and degree of industrialisation, the different financial basis from which we would be starting and, possibly, differences of emphasis on the components of a comprehensive national health service in order to suit our particular circumstances.  In general, it is considered that the quality of our health service is not inferior to that obtaining in Britain and Northern Ireland and what would be mainly involved is an extension of eligibility to the whole population.  In reply to a question on 2nd November, I gave an estimate of £30 million a year as the additional cost of extending all our services to the entire population.  This was arrived at by roughly costing the extensions in eligibility which would be required and I think this a more satisfactory method of estimating the additional cost.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the <i>per capita</i> difference between Britain and ourselves is only about £4.5 or £4.10 and it is, therefore, not unnatural to assume a bridging figure of £12 or £13 million would enable us to give a comparable service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that it has been stated on behalf of his Department that persons in receipt of a social welfare retirement pension are not liable to pay the 15p contribution for health services, with the implication that persons in receipt of the social welfare contributory old age pension, which is 5p higher than the retirement pension, are obliged to make the 15p contribution per week towards health services; and if he will indicate the steps he proposes to take to remove this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons on social welfare retirement pensions remain insured persons for the purposes of the Social Welfare Acts and are credited with contributions between the ages of 65 and 70, in order to preserve entitlement to other social security benefits, including contributory old age pensions. This crediting of contributions extends to the health element so that they do not have to pay the 15p a week.  If there is an anomaly here, it is only in respect of any of the recipients of these allowances who are not entitled to medical cards and thus exempt in any event from liability to pay health contributions.  It could be claimed that a similar anomaly exists in respect of agriculture labourers, all of whom are exempted even though some may not have medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those in receipt of old age contributory pensions are required to pay health contributions only if not entitled <Col N="1572" /> to medical cards.  Many of them are exempt on this account and those who are liable would have other sources of income.  Their liability is assessed on the same basis as for other retired or self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>I would point out that, in fact, the maximum weekly rate of contributory old age pension is greater than the retirement pension by 55p for a single person and 95p for a person with a dependent spouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that he is, in fact, making confusion worse confounded when he says farm labourers do not have to pay?  Is he not aware that the farm labourers have the stamps put on by their employers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The stamps are, in fact, put on for them.  Does the Minister suggest that, when a person reaches 70 and qualifies for an old age pension on stamps for which he or she paid all his or her life, he or she should be required to pay 15p to the State for medical treatment which, up to that time, he or she had in most cases under the stamps?  The qualification for pension qualifies people for benefit.  Now these people must pay 15p thereby reducing the pensions they are getting. Is that not rather stupid?</P>

      <P>The cost in 1970 amounted to £58.75.  The postage was provided free by my Department.  The accounting procedure is that each Department is charged an annual sum in respect of postage, and the cost of individual items is not ascertainable.  However, on the basis of normal postal charges the cost would have been about £27. The cost of cards on order is estimated to be about £200 and the same arrangements will obtain in regard to postage.</P>
      <P>The cost figures given include envelopes but not staff time.  The dispatch of the cards is integrated into the normal routine duties of the staff in my office and it would not be possible to give an estimate of the time involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the abuse of drugs (names supplied) in the Dublin area and of any deaths which have occured as a result of the illegal use of the drugs; and what action he will take in regard to the abuse of this drug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Two drugs are named in the question.  I am aware of the abuse in the Dublin area of one of these preparations but I understand that the second preparation referred to is not abused to any significant extent.</P>
      <P>I have received reports of three deaths which have occured directly or indirectly through the abuse of the first mentioned preparation.  I first received reports some time ago which indicated that a number of forged prescriptions for the preparation had been presented to chemists in Dublin and also that there had been some thefts of the drug.  Effective action was taken to seal off these sources of illicit supply.  Unfortunately, since then the continuing abuse of the preparation has been made possible through supplies obtained on medical prescriptions issued by a limited number of medical practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board wrote to practitioners generally early <Col N="1576" /> in August, 1971, drawing their attention to the need for care in prescribing the preparation, especially for young people.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers of the preparation also have been concerned as to the position and last week they informed me that they had decided, on their own initiative, to cease marketing the preparation in this country as from 30th November, 1971.  The firm are to be commended on their responsible attitude to the problem but it is regrettable that they have had to take this action.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months, I have had investigations under the Dangerous Drugs Act carried out in connection with the distribution of the preparation to know drug abusers in Dublin. I have reported to the Medical Registration Council relevant portions of the results of these inquiries.  Apart from this, further action regarding persons concerned in the abuse of the drug is under active consideration but it would not be in the public interest to disclose at this stage the measures proposed.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy of the danger of publicity arousing the curiosity of young persons and leading them to experiment with drugs and I would especially ask him not to mention, in any supplementary questions he may ask, the name of the second preparation referred to in his question, which, as I have said, is not, so far, abused to any significant extent in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that both preparations were deliberately left out with that object in mind. The Minister I am sure will agree that the firm should be complimented upon their prompt action in this regard.  Will the Minister's Department keep a keen look out for other drugs which could be abused in a similar manner and if such drugs come to light will he ensure that there is not a nine months delay, as there was in this case, which resulted in three deaths and certain other injuries, before something is done?  In regard to the abuse of drugs will the Minister bring legislation before the House in this session as he mentioned he would do earlier on in the session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation will be <Col N="1577" /> brought in as soon as possible.  There was not a nine months delay.  These drugs were being prescribed legally by certain persons; there was an overprescription. I am not going to say any more about the matter except that the most drastic action that we can undertake is being undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many eminent individuals in responsible organisations concerned with drug abuse hold the view that the Government have been unduly complacent and dilatory in implementing many of the recommendations contained in the working party report and notwithstanding the Minister's considerable concern his Department do not seem to be acting on the matter? This view is also held by some of the police authorities concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to eight years ago St. Felim's was the county medical hospital and county home in Cavan. The question of reconstructing the buildings and providing a lift was under consideration before that time. Because of the age of the buildings, which date from the middle of the 19th century, and their poor structural condition it was decided that reconstruction would not be an economic proposition.  As the Deputy is aware, Lisdarn sanatorium was then converted to a medical and maternity hospital and plans for the provision there of a 100 bed geriatric unit are at an advanced stage.  It is also proposed to <Col N="1580" /> build a new home for the aged in Cavan town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the total cost of drugs and medicines under the health services in 1963-64 and 1969-70 distinguishing between general medical services and hospital services; the principal causes of the substantial increases and how much of the increase can be attributed to each cause respectively; what steps are being taken to analyse the causes and to prevent any avoidable increases; and if he has any plans to prevent abuses under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year 1963-64 the cost of drugs and medicines for the general medical services and for the hospital services was £608,000 and £1,409,000, respectively.  The corresponding figures for 1969-70 were £2,429,000 and £3,070,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal factors which caused those increases were rising prices; the introduction of new and more expensive products; an increase in the number of persons covered by medical <Col N="1583" /> cards; the provision of drugs for &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; cases outside the lower income group and for diabetic patients and a big increase in the number of persons with psychiatric disorders being maintained in the community with the aid of tranquillising and other drugs.  In the case of hospitals, there has also been an annual increase of about 4 per cent in the through-put of patients as well as more intensive treatment involving increased use of medicines but resulting in reducing the average duration of stay of patients making it possible to accommodate the increased demand with a much lesser number of extra beds than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>Details of the expenditure involved are not kept in such a way as would make it possible to relate the appropriate part of the increase to each particular factor mentioned.  The new health boards and the voluntary hospitals are very conscious of the need to control expenditure on drugs and medicines as far as is consistent with the provision of an efficient service to the public.  Pending developments in the health services will also help in this regard.  For example, under the choice of doctor scheme which will come into operation next year and will supersede the existing dispensary service, a new pricing system of drugs and medicines will be in operation, which should prevent possible wasteful expenditure.  I have already announced that regional hospital boards will be established with general functions of review of the finances and administration of hospital services, including the purchase and handling of drugs and medicines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Does the Minister agree that his reply discloses an alarming and altogether unsatisfactory state of affairs in that there are hundreds of children waiting for over three years to get into a suitable institution because they are mentally retarded?  I suggest it reflects a complete dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that absolutely. A plan has been in process of operation to provide these places ever since the report of the Commission on Mentally Handicapped.  Places are being organised largely by religious orders and sometimes by lay associations. Planning is being undertaken on a regular and continuous basis.  I have already given the House the arrangements to provide these places over three years.  As regards the high number of those waiting for over three years, a number of these children unfortunately have multiple handicaps and I have asked the Consultative Council on the Mentally Handicapped, which I established some time ago, to look into this problem to see what can be done for such children where there is difficulty in persuading the managements of the institutions to take them. I have also asked the council to consider perhaps a more systematic approach to the use of residential places and suggested that they might consider setting up a central bureau so that accommodation would be reserved for those most in need.  I am examining the situation of the comparatively large number who have been waiting over three years.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Surely the Minister would agree that when it was possible&mdash;and rightly so&mdash; to provide, within a few months, free post-primary education for thousands of children, it should be possible to provide accommodation for these less fortunate children who are mentally retarded in suitable homes or the best possible homes within a year and not keep them waiting, to the distress of <Col N="1585" /> themselves and their families, for as much as seven years in some cases.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that the American Government <Col N="1590" /> through their ambassador here and through the Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, have had a very clear picture of the situation from me.  There is no question of having a misleading picture from their Embassy here and it would be unfair to let that go out.  I am also aware of some people who are very interested in Shannon now perhaps not being quite as definite in their statements as I was when it was not a public issue.  I do not think the American Government have any doubt about our Government's stand in this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important because there was some misleading of the Americans on this matter.  At a stage when they might have been told the same thing as the Government were telling them, they were misled into believing that only the Government were keeping them back.  Quite apart from my interest in the constituency, my predecessor and myself are on record as having taken a very firm stand on this matter.  The American <Col N="1591" /> Government have no doubt where we stand and this has been pressed strongly on them.  The making of public statements at home has no influence on the situation but it creates a new and difficult situation at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <P>Like all other Irish people I am concerned about this matter.  Has the Minister sought the assistance and co-operation of a very influential American, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, John W. McCormack?  This man has deep Irish interests and in my hearing in his office in Washington five years ago he undertook to advance the interests of Ireland in the United States in any way possible.  If the Minister has not sought the aid of Mr. McCormack, he should give careful consideration to my suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of causing consternation I shall try to make a point.  The assumption by this Parliament that when other Governments behave in a way we do not like the fault lies with us is not a good assumption. Last week I dealt with this in another context and I shall not go further with that.  We should not assume here that an Irish person is at fault always when other nations take actions we do not like.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the consultations between Irish and United States delegations at Washington on 23-24 November, 1971, the Taoiseach wrote to the President of the United States expressing his concern about the landing rights question and drawing attention to the adverse effects which the United States demand for entry to Dublin would have on the Shannon region and on the Irish airline.  As Deputies already know, the United States authorities presented very exacting demands at the talks, that is, admission of three airlines to Dublin with onward rights eastward from Dublin and a stop at Shannon at the option of each airline. On this latter point the United States were prepared to consider further stops at Shannon if an overall agreement, satisfactory to them, was forthcoming. The President has now replied to the Taoiseach to the effect that the <Col N="1595" /> United States had no intention of imperilling the financial position of the Irish airlines or injuring the Irish economy; that the Irish airline has successfully competed against the United States airlines in the past and entry to Dublin by the United States airlines should not prejudice its decided competitive advantage; and that in order to safeguard the Shannon position he was instructing the United States delegation to agree that United States airlines en route to and from Dublin would stop at Shannon, provided that other transatlantic airlines did so.</P>
    <P>The Government are now considering the position in the light of the United States attitude.  No arrangements have been made so far for resuming the consultations with the United States.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have given the House the relevant information which concerns planes stopping each way at Shannon.  The President has instructed his negotiating term to this effect in answer to representations made by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that, when the President of the United States of America writes to the Taoiseach on a matter of such national importance, it is in the public interest that the full text of the letter should be placed before the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it is now crystal clear that formal representations to the United States Government, and negotiations at Civil Service level, have proved fruitless in <Col N="1596" /> ending this deadlock, would the Minister not now agree that new tacties will have to be adopted?  Surely the obvious solution is for a ministerial delegation to go to Washington and try to convince the Senate Transportation Sub-Committee of the United States Government on the merits of the Irish case?  Is the Minister aware that the Transportation Sub-Committee is the whole bogey?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have shots in our locker which will be used at the appropriate time.  The fact of the matter is that by reason of the direct representations made by the Taoiseach to the President of the United States of America he had instructed his negotiating team to make a concession in that it is now clear from his letter to the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the whole burden of the detailed reply I gave to the House.  It is quite clear now that we have gained a stop at Shannon each way to be mandatory on American airlines provided the Irish airline continues to stop at Shannon each way as well.  That is the concession that was not available to the negotiating team who were faced with a blanket refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that six months ago the representatives of the American airlines said that they were offering to stop at Shannon and fly no further than Dublin and that that offer was made before the present negotiations got into full swing?  Therefore, how can the Minister now say that this has arisen only as a result of the Taoiseach writing to the President of the United States?</P>

      <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. are still pursuing inquiries in this matter.  Any question of building a car ferry vessel for the Rosslare-Le Havre route would be primarily a matter for the shipping company concerned.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. in consultation with Bord Fáilte have already undertaken a preliminary investigation of the costs of operation of a new vessel of suitable size for the route.  This investigation has shown that the only type of operation which would not give rise to unacceptable losses would be one similar to that of Normandy Ferries in which the vessel could be assigned to another service in the offseason. To provide a vessel for high season use only would involve losses out of all proportion to the tourist and other benefits to be gained.</P>

      <P>The case referred to in the Deputy's question is a most unusual and complex one.  The position was explained to the person referred to in the question and she expressed herself as satisfied with it.</P>
      <P>It is possible, however, that a change in circumstances may have occurred since and I will have further inquiries made.  I should, perhaps, explain that at present the father of the person referred to by the Deputy is being paid an increase in his invalidity pension in respect of two of the children. Should the inquiry which I am now having made reveal that this person is entitled to full children's allowances then her father will suffer a reduction of £1.80 a week in his invalidity pension as against an increase of £1.75 a month in children's allowances.  A change in the relevant statutory regulations is not considered necessary.</P>

      <P>If, however, a person under 70 years, retired on pension here or in England by his employer, is capable of and available for further employment he can qualify for unemployment benefit in this country subject to fulfilment of the contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>Title to unemployment benefit in the case of certain persons retired from employment in England who return to this country may depend also on the person's position in relation to the reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring presumably to non-contributory old age pensions since contributory <Col N="1605" /> pensions are payable abroad.  Payments of an assistance nature such as non-contributory old age pensions are not normally payable outside the country which makes the payment and there would be serious difficulties in administering such schemes outside the State.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This claim made in early 1970 was disallowed because two of the statutory conditions for payment were not fulfilled.  The first of these conditions required that the pensioner be living alone, the only persons disregarded being the prescribed relative, children under 16 years of age and other persons if they are mentally or physically handicapped.  The second condition required that the prescribed <Col N="1606" /> relative should not be a married woman wholly or mainly maintained by her husband.  The decision was upheld on appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 64 and 65 together, as they raise the same point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the introduction of the PAYE system in 1960, members of the Defence Forces and foresters employed in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands were, in common with State employees generally, excluded from the system as they already had tax deduction machinery available to them.  This machinery provides for the making of provisional deductions as from the beginning of the tax year and is, generally speaking, working satisfactorily. These provisional deductions <Col N="1611" /> are adjusted later in the year when formal assessments are made.</P>
    <P>At the commencement of each tax year the attention of serving members of the Defence Forces and forestry workers is drawn to the availability of the provisional deduction scheme.  The majority of them elect to participate in the scheme.  In the case of a person who does not avail of the deduction scheme from the commencement of the tax year, deduction of tax cannot begin until later in the year and this necessarily results in heavier deductions spread over a shorter period.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements are probably more favourable in the vast majority of cases than if a PAYE system operated.  I might add that it has now been arranged, following meetings between unions representing State industrial employees and representatives of Government Departments, that the Revenue Commissioners will issue a ready reckoner which will serve as a broad guide to an individual employee's tax liability and that the individual will be furnished early in the new tax year with the figure of his total earnings in the previous year. He can then arrange early in each year for appropriate deductions to be made from his pay.  Discussions are continuing with the unions with a view to effecting any other feasible improvements in the method of collecting income tax in these cases.</P>
    <P>Consideration is, I understand, also being given by the Department of Defence to the question of improving the method of collecting income tax from the men of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that many thousands of Army personnel, forestry workers, and other State personnel are at present having their wages slashed by half, by amounts ranging from £5 to £10 to £16 per week, and that these deductions for income tax purposes will continue until next April?  Many thousands of ordinary working-class people have a take-home pay which is inadequate to provide for a subsistence level of existence?  In the circumstances, would he not agree that as <Col N="1612" /> administered, in the absence of the PAYE system, the present arrangement is callous and vicious and needs to be amended immediately?  Is there any reason why those people should not be included under the PAYE system and thereby have these amounts extracted in a much less painless fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion made in the reply that at last something will be done with regard to this anomaly.  I am referring to payments to members of the Defence Forces and I agree with Deputy Treacy that large amounts have been stopped in the recent past. In view of the fact that there is an obvious change of heart in the Department of Finance regarding the withholding of inordinate sums from noncommissioned personnel of the Irish Army will he now, in this Christmas spirit, say that he will not stop any more from them before Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Parliamentary Secretary expect a private soldier, with one child, paying £5 a week for his house and getting a total of £19, to give £6 per week to the Revenue Commissioners?  Is this fair or reasonable?  This is the present position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provisional deduction scheme available to the men.  Some of those who do not avail of that scheme find themselves in difficulty. With regard to the men of the Defence Forces, I understand from the Department of Defence that there are proposals to introduce, with effect from 1st May, 1972, a revised system of provisional tax deductions based on the individual's previous year's earnings and tax free allowances.  It is also understood that consideration will be given to the feasibility of introducing other improvements similar to those proposed in respect of the civilian employees in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention, also, that there would be some disadvantages in some cases to people being put on PAYE as distinct from this provisional scheme.  The principal disadvantage would be that each employee would be <Col N="1613" /> charged tax on the basis of his current earnings instead of those of the previous year.  With the continuing trend towards higher wages, this would mean for most, if not all, of the employees concerned an immediate increase in their tax liability.  I also understand that in most cases the Revenue Commissioners will be agreeable to carry tax liability from one quarter into the next quarter so that the deductions can be taken over a longer period and will, therefore, be smaller.  It is a matter for the individual to apply to the Revenue Commissioners in these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that I have here a cheque for the amount of £41.60 and from this cheque £37.31 is deducted for income tax and the unfortunate man is left with £4.30.  This is the system which I decry in this House.  Is there any reason why PAYE cannot be applied to these people and exonerate them from this kind of vicious extraction? I can give the number of the cheque.</P>

However, portion of his allowances was used to off-set the full tax liability in respect of his social welfare retirement pension so that it could be paid without deduction of tax.  Only the balance of the allowances was accordingly available to set against his other income.</P>

People had pensions based on ten years ago, and so on.  Now they are based on 1969.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if an application has been made for a merger of all banks in the State into one unit; and, if so, if he considers it is in the interest of customers of such banks to permit such a step to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No application has been made to me to approve a merger of all banks in the State into one unit.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House the position is that six separate schemes have been submitted for my approval in accordance with section 33 of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  Two schemes provide for the transfer to the Bank of Ireland of the businesses of its wholly owned subsidiary banks, the Hibernian Bank and the National Bank of Ireland.  A further three schemes similarly cover the consolidation into one bank of the separate banking businesses in the Allied Irish Banks Group, that is, the Munster and Leinster Bank, the Provincial Bank of Ireland and the Royal Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The sixth scheme relates to the merger of two subsidiary banking companies of the Ulster Bank consequent on a recognisation of the business.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering these schemes in consultation with the Central Bank and will give my decision on them, as required by the Central Bank Act, 1971, before 31st January, 1972.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension as there are, in fact, at present 43 firms holding group contracts for Government printing, who were selected on the basis of competitive tenders.  All contracts draw the attention of the contracts to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1963 and require contractors to observe special precautions to preserve secrecy. There is no provision in the contracts against takeover by a foreign firm.</P>
      <P>The foregoing arrangements apply to parliamentary printing which the Deputy may perhaps have particularly in mind.  That work is carried out at present under two contracts placed out to tender every five years.  Both current contracts were secured on a competitive basis by one printing firm.</P>
      <P>For non-parliamentary printing special arrangements have, as occasion and requires, at times necessarily and unavoidably to be made for urgent printing, which usually involve the selection exceptionally of a firm in a position to undertake work expeditiously.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the total number of applicants for contracts to supply potatoes to the Erin Foods plant at Tuam, County Galway, which could not be accepted in 1969, 1970 and 1971; and the reason for the refusal.</P>

      <P>In 1969 and 1970 all applicants for potato contracts were accepted with the exception of a few who either refused to comply with the terms of contract or submitted their applications too late.  In 1971 applications were received from 950 prospective growers for 72,000 tons of potatoes and contracts for 47,500 tons were awarded to 844 growers.  Preference was given to farmers who successfully contracted with Erin Foods in previous years and to farmers in areas where transport arrangements to the Tuam factory could be made at minimum cost.</P>

      <P>82 per cent of the production at the Tuam plant of Erin Foods is sold in the United Kingdom market.  A further 6 per cent is sold on the home market and the remaining production, for the most part, is sold on continental markets.  Because of a temporary glut of supplies of potato <Col N="1624" /> products to the UK market there will be a slow down in production at Tuam after the current campaign.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position is that there is a glut on the United Kingdom market now and what is being produced by these factories at the moment is being stockpiled.  That means that next year there will have to be some reduction not alone in acreage and tonnage but also in contracts. It is hoped this will be of short duration and that the reduction will be small.</P>

These proposals are at present under examination and a full statement will be made at an early date.

Every effort will be made, however, to ensure that redundancies are kept to a minimum. Preliminary consultations have taken place with the trade unions and discussions will be continued when final decisions on the future of the food project are taken.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if his attention has been drawn to a report of a speech by Dr. Mansholt (details supplied) to the effect that foreigners can purchase land on equal terms with Irish citizens in the event of entry to the EEC; if the position in this regard will be clarified in the proposed White Paper on the terms of accession; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the reports referred to by the Deputy, although I am led to believe that there was some misreporting involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event the position about freedom of establishment on land in the EEC context has been stated on many occasions.  To-date only a very limited measure of freedom of establishment on land is operative in the EEC and this, it is considered, will not pose any serious problem for this country.  A draft directive providing for <Col N="1632" /> full freedom of establishment on land has been with the EEC Council of Ministers since January, 1969, but has not yet been adopted.  Under the consultation procedure settled with the EEC this country will be consulted before this directive is adopted.  Ireland will press for the inclusion of such provisions as will meet the needs of the Irish situation.</P>
    <P>The right of establishment on land will be dealt with in the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it most desirable that before the referendum on our entry into the EEC takes place this question should be clarified in view of the fact that there are thousands of smallholders and landowners whose vote may depend on a decision in regard to this matter?  As a result of the purchase of Irish land by aliens in the event of our entry into the EEC we might reach the stage where the Irish will be labourers working for foreigners on their own land?  Any doubts which exist in this regard should be cleared up before the referendum takes place.</P>

      <P>Apart from the Deputy's speechmaking I agree this is a very serious matter.  It is a matter I have referred to already on the Estimate and it is also one that will be referred to in the White Paper which will be published shortly.  It is one in regard to which I can say I will be able to give the necessary assurances to all farmers that they would obviously require.</P>

      <P>There is a matter of some importance involved here.  I observed that Deputy Fox, wishing to enter this House, was restrained by uniformed members of the force in this House.  The ordinary procedure here for the naming of a Deputy is for the Taoiseach, who takes the responsibility for the member of the House concerned, to stand up and do so.  This is of the utmost importance to the control of procedure in this House because sometimes it may happen that a Member of the Government alleged to have named a Deputy does so <i>sotto voce</i> so that he is not appearing to do anything and appears to be sitting idly <Col N="1712" /> by.  In the circumstances this is precisely what happened.</P>

What precautions are at present being taken throughout the State or are there any precautions being taken at present?</P>

I understand that <Col N="1719" /> the 21-day period in which these motions of annulment can be effective expires this evening and I have been advised that it is not likely that the Agriculture Estimate, which is being taken in conjunction with these motions, will be replied to or completed this evening.  I have had, in these circumstances, an informal discussion with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, with a view to resolving the impasse with reference to the motions and discussed by me in this House last week.  He has assured me that the moneys collected to date on foot of the increased levies are still available for the meat research institute and that he, or more likely his Departmental staff, are willing to sit around a table with the trade interests with a view to getting the proposed institute established in the near future.  In this connection I look forward to his reply to the Agriculture Estimate.  On the basis of these assurances and mindful of the fact that similar motions can be moved in the Seanad during the next 11 sitting days, I am not prepared to pursue these two motions and I beg leave of the Chair to withdraw them.</P>

I indicated that the debate on the White Paper on the terms of our accession, in effect, will take place soon after the Christmas recess and that therefore these matters, mainly economic matters, are not relevant to this debate.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies seemed, unfortunately, to invade that part of the territory and I do not propose to reply to any of the points made in that respect today.  I did, however, mention the fact that sovereignty was one of the questions raised and that, from time to time, suggestions have been made that in some way we would be weakening our sovereignty were we to accede to the European Economic Community.  It has been said several times in this House that sovereignty is something which we have to use for the benefit of our citizens.  It is misleading to refer to the limitations on this country's freedom of action which will result from membership and to ignore the very real limitations on our freedom that now exist, especially at the present time when we are not a party to any international agreement or any international grouping such as the European Communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must use our sovereignty as fully as possible in order to advance the rights we possess.  Our real freedom is, unfortunately, circumscribed by our size and our resultant inability to influence decisions taken in other countries, <Col N="1723" /> decisions which unfortunately can affect us and in many cases do affect us, and our vital interests seriously. Membership of the Communities will afford us the opportunity to free ourselves from these present limitations on the exercise of our sovereignty.  Sovereignty is not something to be worn like a badge.  It is something to be used and, with membership of the Community, we will be using that sovereignty to the best advantage of our people.</P>
      <P>The other small countries who are members of the Communities: Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium are three examples of how they have been using their sovereignty to the advantage of their populations.  Since the foundation of the Community, these three countries have participated fully with the large member States in decision making, decision making that is common to the wellbeing and the welfare of all the people within the Community. They have exercised an influence in that Community which was out of all proportion to their size and to their population.  Likewise with us, if we accede to the Community, if the people say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the referendum proposed in this Bill, we will have an influence far beyond our present size and population and gross national product.</P>
      <P>We see membership of the Communities, therefore, as a way of safeguarding and increasing the participation of the Irish people in the determination of their own future.  If Ireland were to stay out, our influence on the enlarged Community would be very, very limited indeed, whereas the effect of decisions of that Community would be very serious so far as our welfare is concerned.  As the Community was strengthened and, more particularly, if the United Kingdom were a Member, influence adverse to our best interest would be constantly growing.  To put ourselves in such a position would, in my opinion, be tantamount to the abdication of our sovereignty and the abandonment of control over our own national affairs.</P>
      <P>In applying for membership, therefore, we are using our sovereignty in order to achieve greater sovereignty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> I think it was Deputy Garret FitzGerald who said that, apart altogether from the member States themselves, there is now and has been for some years a growing concentration in Europe and all over the world of those huge international companies who can affect the interests not only of small countries but of the bigger countries as well.  It is important, therefore, that we use our sovereignty in this way to protect ourselves even from the decisions of these huge international corporations.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Labour Deputies in particular, I think, that this method of amending the Constitution was not necessary.  They recalled a speech made by Deputy Corish some time in the middle of this year in which he suggested that we could have made use of Article 27 in order to effect what this Bill proposes to do.  This procedure would involve two referenda, one to approve the Bill that would be put forward under Article 27, and the second to carry through the necessary consequential changes in the Constitution. There is also the added difficulty in adopting this course that the first Bill would be in itself unconstitutional. It would be unconstitutional until the Constitution itself was changed.  Therefore, this procedure is not practicable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating suggested that we were altering the fundamental rights of citizens and tampering with the mechanisms of appointing judges, <i>habeas corpus</i> and the system of elections.  There is no foundation whatever for these suggestions.  It was pointed out in the White Paper of April, 1970 that the European Communities are primarily concerned with economic and social matters; that most other aspects of our domestic law would be unaffected by our entry into the Communities; that furthermore the proposed amendment ties the Government to action consequent on membership of the European Communities and that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of such action.  I think this also answers Deputy Desmond's question as to who is to decide whether a law is consequent on membership, whether it was to be the Dáil or the institutions of the European Communities. <Col N="1725" /> The answer is that it is open to any person to raise in our courts the question of whether such legislation is consequent on membership of the Communities.  In that case the final decision will rest with our own Supreme Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I think we can leave the people's rights in this case to the Supreme Court.  Deputy Desmond suggested that the Government were indulging in what he called indecent haste in bringing forward this legislation. I explained already why we brought the legislation forward&mdash;in anticipation of the White Paper.  I do not think it matters but it was Deputy Desmond's leader, Deputy Corish, who in October last asked me specifically to bring forward this legislation because by then, he said, we ought to know what type of constitutional amendments would be required.  Deputy Corish was anxious that the Dáil should be informed as soon as possible as to what these constitutional amendments were to be.  I would like to point out again, as I have done in the House on many occasions, that the extent and form of the constitutional changes required have been under close examination for some considerable time by the Attorney-General's Committee to which I referred and by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I could move now to the scope and form of the amendment and deal with some of the criticisms that have been made of it during the course of the debate.  The proposed amendment was chosen after very careful consideration.  We see certain essential requirements for this type of amendment.  First, it should be comprehensive <Col N="1726" /> enough to enable us to fulfil all the obligations required by the three Treaties and the great body of legislation that has flowed from them. As I said in my opening speech, the Supreme Court is competent to decide what Articles of the Constitution will be affected and that if we amend individual Articles, it will be very difficult to ensure that all the necessary amendments are carried out.  It would be impracticable to refer the huge body of Community legislation to the Supreme Court for them to decide the compatibility of each item with our Constitution.  The Court would consider the compatability of each separate obligation only after it became part of the law of this State or if it was referred to them, that is, in the form of a Bill under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy FitzGerald agreed that the only realistic course in approaching this amendment was to have it incorporated in one comprehensive amendment.  An Article by Article approach would have the consequence that each Article would have to be expressed as unaltered for domestic purposes but to read differently for the purpose of membership of the European Communities.  In that case we could finish up with two Constitutions, one for domestic purposes and one relating to the Communities.  Deputy Cosgrave argued in favour of providing that certain Articles of the Constitution should be excluded specifically from the scope of the proposed amendment, particularly those dealing with fundamental rights and freedom.  It would be difficult to make a selection for this purpose.  The Constitution is the fundamental law of this country and there would be no obvious criterion by reference to which any Articles could be classified as being more fundamental than others.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to that part of Article 15 which deals with the right to raise and maintain military armed forces which right, the Article says, is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas. The Deputy referred also to Article 28, subsection 3 which says that:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is <Col N="1727" /> expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion... </P>
    <P>He referred to Articles 40 to 44 which are the Articles that deal with personal rights.  I agree that all of these are very important Articles but there are other very important Articles which could be described as fundamental but which would not be affected by our accession to the European Economic Communities.  For example, there are Article 9 which deals with citizenship, Article 12 to 14 which deal with the Office of the President, Articles 16 and 17 dealing with election to Dáil Éireann and Articles 18 and 19 dealing with election to Seanad Éireann.  Therefore, it is clear that drawing up a list of the type mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave would entail classifying some Articles of the Constitution as being more fundamental than others.  This, at least, would give rise to considerable controversy and, furthermore, it would be assumed that these Articles which are omitted could be affected by our membership of the Communities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned also the transitional period when this Constitution was before the people and he said that there were certain Articles at that time that were excluded from amendment.  I do not think he made the point that they were more fundamental in content but they were excluded specifically at that time because one of them, Article 46, was the Article which enables the Constitution to be amended.  There was no point in having that amended since it was the machinery for amendment itself. The other Articles were called transitory provisions, starting with Article 51 and these, automatically by their own terms, ceased to have effect after the three year transitional period. Therefore, there is no argument there that certain Articles were picked out in the Constitution because of their importance and were deemed to be incapable of amendment.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies criticised the phrase &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; as being vague and too wide or, possibly, embracing legislation <Col N="1728" /> which does not arise directly from the three Treaties as they stand now.  No Deputy referred to the Irish version which, I think, is much more specific although the words used are not very common in ordinary Irish. It refers to acts done &ldquo;de dhroim do bheith ina chomhalta de na Comhphobail...&rdquo; That, I think, is much more emphatic than &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo;. However, I am not completely wedded to the words &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo;.  I can refer to that later.  They do refer to action taken by the Government for the sole purpose of discharging obligations which membership of the Community will create for us, obligations, for example, like legislation to give effect to an EEC directive which, as I mentioned when opening this debate, leaves it to each member State to enact whatever legislation is necessary in order to achieve the result prescribed in the directive.</P>
    <P>A further essential requirement is that the amendment to the Constitution be no wider than is necessary to enable this country to accede to the Communities and to fulfil the obligations imposed by membership.  The amendment proposed in the Bill enables us to accede only to the three Communities at present in existence and to validate laws enacted by the State consequent on such membership. These laws, as I also pointed out, can be tested in Irish courts to ensure that they are consequent on membership of the Communities.  If they are not, they will be rendered invalid by our courts.  It is clear, therefore, that the proposed amendment meets our requirement in this regard.  If, however, we were to proceed by piecemeal amendment, as suggested by some Deputies, there would be a tendency to include a large number of Articles, larger probably than might be strictly necessary, because only the Supreme Court is competent to decide those Articles that do require amendment and the Articles that do not.  By comparison. I think it is evident that the amendment proposed in the Bill can be said to be a more satisfactory way of dealing with the problem of confining possible legislation to the requirements that will fall on us as a result of our membership.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> One further essential requirement is that the amendment should be simple. Both parties opposite have agreed that this should be so, that it should in no way be confusing for the general public and should, if possible, and I think that this will be possible, facilitate a simple answer of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that an amendment Article by Article would be so confusing for the electorate that it would be completely unfair to present the amendment to the Constitution in that way. This procedure was examined&mdash;that is amendment Article by Article, and the exclusion of specific Articles from the scope of any constitutional amendment&mdash;by the Attorney General's legal committee and by the Government and it was only after the fullest consideration that both these courses were rejected. Neither of them satisfied the essential requirement which I have mentioned, that the amendment should be completely comprehensive, not wider in scope than is absolutely necessary and simple enough to make the issue clear to everyone.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies suggested that the proposed amendment before the House might be unconstitutional under Article 46, paragraph 1, of the Constitution.  This Article reads:</P>
    <P>Any provision of this Constitution may be amended, whether by way of variation, addition, or repeal, in the manner provided by this Article.</P>
    <P>The operative word there is &ldquo;addition&rdquo; and the proposed amendment is in accordance with that part of that Article because it involves the addition of a new subsection to Article 29.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, on Friday last I had been speaking for four or five minutes on a number of points arising out of the negotiations relating to sugar beet when progress was reported.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with a number of matters relating to the Estimate in general.  I should like to compliment Deputy Bruton on a very comprehensive contribution which was both interesting and informative.  The Minister's speech contained a number of matters which were of considerable interest to the House and a number of facts which have to be analysed in terms of the policy implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the prospect of our entry into the EEC looms very large we seem, in a rather perverse way, to be expressing tremendous hope and optimism about the effect it will have on agriculture generally and while the impact in many areas will be immense we are still failing to accept the tremendous <Col N="1735" /> imbalance which already exists in the economy.  In the post-war period agriculture suffered as a result of a lack of overall planning of the economy.  Very little has been done to overcome our dependence on the UK market which has never offered adequate returns to our suppliers. The acknowledged advantages which exist have not been used to the optimum extent in agriculture because of a failure on the part of the Government down through the years to create a comprehensive marketing system.  As one who comes from an urban environment but whose family are very much of a rural background I feel that agricultural policy and industrial policy have been developed on an independent basis to an excessive degree.  No attempt has been made in my opinion to build up an integrated rural economy.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;and this is highlighted in the Devlin Report&mdash;has operated an independent sovereign Department.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to implement a progressive land policy.  I am always amused to hear people talk about the way the EEC land policy will affect this country.  We have had half a century in which to create a national policy relating to land structure.  If radical changes had been brought in the rural poverty and social decay which were allowed to develop in the thirties, forties and fifties and which began to be mitigated again in the sixties, would have ended.  We now have an opportunity to do something about it although this opportunity has arisen more as a result of an erosion in the population than from any dynamic policy.</P>
    <P>The basic fault of successive Fianna Fáil administrations&mdash;it is the job of the Opposition to be critical although not critical in an unduly destructive manner&mdash;is that they have treated the agricultural industry as a kind of agricultural reserve for which national policies would be determined at Budget time.  There has been too little appreciation of the economic potential of agriculture, particularly in the food processing industries.  There has been no <Col N="1736" /> real attempt at national agricultural planning in recent times.  Even though I disagree vehemently with many of his political attitudes, Deputy Blaney seems to have come to grips with agricultural problems.  The publication, &ldquo;Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC &rdquo; written by Deputy Blaney and published in April, 1970, will go down as a monument to him.</P>
    <P>The publication of James Deeny, <i>The Irish Worker,</i> highlights the problem in no uncertain terms.  He pointed out and I quote:</P>
    <P>The demographic analysis of the human resources of the agricultural labour force shows that there are four main social problems, all inter-dependent and all threatening not only the industry but the structure, economy and much of the way of life of the country as a whole. All four problems are fast approaching the critical level. </P>
    <P>They are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the depopulation of young adults from rural areas,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the ageing of those engaged in agriculture,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the amazing celibacy rates and,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the distribution of land.</P>
    <P>He went on to say, and I very much agree with him:</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a comprehensive review of agricultural policy.  Hitherto agricultural policy has been framed in terms of production targets without very explicit reference to the serious social problems of this sector of the economy.  The effects of existing agricultural policy on the social structure must be recognised and social objectives must be defined and pursued in new agricultural plans.  A review of our present ideas is needed, a review involving the formulation of a series of national objectives in agriculture with a social as well as a production orientation, the organisation of sound programmes to achieve these clear and defined objectives and the energy, dynamism and leadership to attain them. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> There was a time, I suppose, when this would have formed a very fine statement of intention at a Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  I shall not demean the work of Deeny by such an association. Without being unduly congratulatory of the Labour Party, I think it is directly in line with our policy document which stressed the social nature of the agricultural problems in Ireland today.  We cannot face up to the enormity of this issue without reference to some of the statements we made in that document which was the subject of a great deal of vilification by the Fianna Fáil Government at the crossroads at church gates in the last general election but those who made a more thoughtful effort to read it and who were not concerned with party political propaganda realised that it was a serious effort&mdash;it has been and is being updated&mdash;to get to grips with some of the major problems.  We said in that document that deep problems in agriculture would be solved only within the framework of an overall national policy of planned social and economic development.</P>
    <P>It is startling to read the chapters of Deeny's publication and see where he says, on page 26, that during the five years from 1961 to 1966 47,667 persons left agricultural employment, a fall of 13.8 per cent in the agricultural labour force, or to read on page 27 that 61 per cent of the 177,452 male farmers were over 50 years of age; 14 per cent were over 70; 55 per cent of all farmers with more than 50 acres of land were over 50 years of age and that 10 per cent of all such farmers were over 70 years of age.  I do not think the House, the Government or the Department fully realise how startling these figures are.  I speak of the Department collectively and I think the senior executives of the Department are more than aware of the problems but so much has the Department suffered from what one might describe as one-party rule that most of that staff decide to keep their opinions to themselves never knowing who will be the next Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Deeny also in his publication said that there is considerable under-employment <Col N="1738" /> among agricultural labourers. I shall quote only a few more sentences. He said that in 1966 61 per cent of all male farmers were over 50 years of age and 14 per cent over 70; only 989 of the 23,000 female farmers were under 40 years of age&mdash;quite a startling figure; 23,173 female farmers and only 1,000 under 40 years of age.  That is something we should consider.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the amazing celibacy rates of the agricultural community and if you look at the data in this publication you see what I mean. On page 33 under the heading &ldquo;Marital status&rdquo; he says that in 1966, 33 per cent of all farmers were single; 27 per cent of all farmers with farms of more than 50 acres were single; 93 per cent of all farmers' sons who remained on the land were unmarried&mdash;again certainly startling.  He said that 94 per cent of farmers' brothers and 74 per cent of other male relatives assisting on farms were unmarried; 95 per cent of labourers living in and 61 per cent of labourers living out were single and of the 110,000 married male farmers 64 per cent were over 50 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am taking the figures he derived from the 1966 census of population; I do not believe the 1971 census data when available will show any massive changes in that regard so intractable in many ways are the problems and so slow is remedial action.  One wonders at the complacency of the Government in their apparent belief that all you need is to have, in a Common Market situation, substantial major price increases&mdash;which undoubtedly will be there in a number of cases&mdash;and automatically, by holding such a carrot before the eyes of Irish farmers, there will be a major change and development in social attitudes and that agriculture will be transformed.  I fear the difficulty is much under-estimated and the problem is one that this House has never seriously attempted to get to grips with because agriculture has been very much the political plaything of a small number of politicians and most of their attempts to play with it have not been constructive or inspiring.  I think that is generally a fair comment. I think Deeny's work deserves mention here but I do not propose to make <Col N="1739" /> further reference to it beyond quoting very briefly his comment on our system of agriculture and land distribution. On page 36 he stated:</P>
    <P>In addition our system of agriculture and land distribution in family farms or separate holdings precludes ranching on the one hand or collective or State farming on the other.  The possibility of developing new systems so that more young people can own land and produce effectively has not had sufficient chance, support or action and the social consequences of further rural depopulation do not seem to have been considered sufficiently.</P>
    <P>The publication speaks for itself and while it is not written from a party political or from a destructive viewpoint, it carries a message for the makers of agricultural policy.  In case one is accused of bias one might also refer to some of what I consider is the invaluable work done by E.A. Attwood and the issues he has thrown up.  I often feel that writing in the language of the Department one must couch major serious issues in a departmental-cum-political jargon which may often seem to gloss over some of the major issues but in one of his recent contributions to the paper he prepared on &ldquo;The Structure of Irish Agriculture and its Future Development&rdquo; he pointed out the seriousness of the general situation.</P>
    <P>He stated:</P>
    <P>The holdings with less than 300 man-days employment per year, which accounted for 69 per cent of the total number of holdings over one acre, produced 29 per cent of the gross agricultural product, received 32.2 per cent of the family farm income and accounted for 53.8 per cent of the total employment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Later on he stated:</P>
    <P>The 30,000 holdings with over 600 man-days accounted for only 10.5 per cent of all holdings over one acre, but produced 41.5 per cent of the gross agricultural output, received 36.9 per cent of the family <Col N="1740" /> farm income and accounted for 20.6 per cent of total employment. ... Thus, the estimated 110,000 labour units on non-viable farms represented some 115,000 people, while the viable and potentially viable farms provided employment for 190,000 people.</P>
    <P>These figures are startling.  I am not interested in the methodology of the concept of man-days and so on.  I leave that to the academics because I am not competent to appreciate fully the implications involved, but I am prepared to say that the criticisms that have been made are quite serious.  I would urge Deputies to read the paper and consider how we can evolve our agricultural policy in the light of the facts disclosed.  These facts are known to the Minister but, no doubt, they will not appear in the Government's White Paper on the EEC.</P>
    <P>If I might make a final quote from the paper to which I referred, it is stated that in 1966 there were 23,000 female farmers, nearly half of them being over 65 years of age; nearly 44,000 male farmers over 65 years of age; over 45,000 male farmers under 65 years of age on holdings of less than 30 acres, making a total of 112,250 people.  If we allow for those people on holdings of &ldquo;under one acre and area not stated&rdquo;, the total in the non-viable category is 112,570 and those in the viable category 88,050.  In that context I do not think we need send for Mansholt&mdash;we have a Mansholt-sized problem to deal with in our country and we will need to get to grips with the situation.  Our policy in doing so might not be very popular in many areas but we will be forced to think about these problems, irrespective of whether we enter the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been unduly complacent in his analysis of the contribution of agriculture to the economy. It would be remiss of me not to refer to a major criticism made of the role of agriculture in the Third Programme. Recently, John O'Hagan, Lecturer in Economics in TCD, made a correct and critical analysis of the agricultural targets of the Government&mdash;allegedly still current in the Third Programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> In the summer issue of <i>Studies</i> he made a critical appraisal of the Government publication &ldquo;Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971&rdquo;.  He pointed out clearly why performance is not matching expectations and he stated that agriculture is the most glaring failure in relation to the programme.  He also stated:</P>
    <P>Net output actually declined, despite the fact that gross output increased by 2 per cent.  If the export target had been reached (8.3 per cent as against an actual increase of 5.2 per cent), the gross output increase would have been greater but even this would not have ensured any increase in net output.  The reason is that an increase in the proportion of inputs is required to produce an increase in output.  In fact, one might expect the reverse, namely, increasing or at least constant economies of scale.  Perhaps by proportion is meant price, but it is unlikely that the review would let slip this opportunity for putting further blame on the inflationary tendencies in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The reason for this increase, and thus for the poor performance of agriculture, lies squarely in the continuation of inefficient farming in Ireland.  This could be altered by a radical change in the Government's agricultural policy along the lines of Mansholt's proposals.  The continuation of present policy could possibly be justified, were it not for the fact that agricultural employment has also fared so badly, and that the gap within agricultural incomes is as wide as ever.  In every programme so far, agriculture has been a dismal failure.  Either the targets are set too high for political reasons, or else there is an explanation for the failures or&mdash;as appears to be the case&mdash;there is a combination of both.</P>
    <P>This comment is not unduly harsh.  In a period of major economic expansion in the sixties, when the Government had a relative buoyancy in taxation returns, they had an opportunity of making a major breakthrough in the agricultural sector.  They did not grasp the problems which faced them in the <Col N="1742" /> past decade and they are now relying on EEC entry to get them off the hook in some areas.  These are some of the major criticisms the Labour Party make of Government policy.</P>
    <P>Some Members of the House may think I have been carping unduly about this aspect but we must not forget that three programmes have been produced by the Government.  Many reports on agriculture have been compiled but they are never referred to in this House.  The report of the committee on the review of State expenditure in relation to agriculture, was buried promptly by the Government. The Minister wrote a foreword thanking the members of the committee who compiled the report, in particular people such as Dr. O'Connor from the ESRI, Dr. E.A. Attwood, then a member of the staff of An Foras Talúntais, and Dr. Martin O'Donoghue, Lecturer in Economics&mdash;now Economic Adviser to the Taoiseach&mdash;but I doubt very much if the Government considered seriously the implications of the report.</P>
    <P>This report is of major national importance. It was published about 18 months ago but it was not taken seriously by the Government and no attempt has been made to get to grips with the problems outlined in it.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>While the need to make agriculture as competitive as possible by reducing costs per unit of output is recognised, a major part of State expenditure in relation to agriculture is designed to provide some degree of stability in returns to producers. To this end, a measure of price support has been maintained for milk, pigs and wheat directly, and for barley, oats, sugar beet through restriction of imports to support guaranteed or contract prices. Price support was introduced for carcase beef in 1965 and for carcase lamb in 1966; a system of indirect price support for store cattle and sheep is maintained through their eligibility for British guaranteed prices. </P>
    <P>The report sets out the position as it finds it earlier on and then says:</P>
    <P>An examination of the value of <Col N="1743" /> these schemes is complicated by the fact that the whole system has a social as well as an economic objecttive. No clear distinction between the two has been worked out at any time but it is evident that there is a degree of conflict between schemes which have the laudable purpose of appropriately redistributing national wealth.  Broadly, schemes or projects to enable farmers to work their lands &ldquo;fully and efficiently&rdquo; and to increase productivity could be regarded as having an economic basis and as being the agricultural parallel of the adaptation grants system for industry.  The measures operated to maintain or improve farm incomes, such as guaranteed or supported prices, have a primarily social connotation. </P>
    <P>Again, there is an explanation in relation to the matter.  On page 14, having listed the various headings concerned primarily with what they regard as the more expensive items of direct aid to farmers it says:</P>
    <P>On this basis, the total amount is still very considerable, and the points with which we are immediately concerned are (a) is it necessary to spend all this money on aid to farmers?  (b) is the State (meaning the taxpayer) getting the best value for the expenditure?  and (c) should the pattern of expenditure be substantially altered?</P>
    <P>These are three questions which have never been seriously considered by the Government at this stage.</P>
    <P>At page 18, it says:</P>
    <P>It is insufficiently appreciated that the improvement in global farm incomes which has taken place over the last eight years has been predominantly due to the increase in State aid rather than to the increases in the quantity or market value of what was produced, after allowing for the extra expenses involved.</P>
    <P>Then it makes another cryptic comment, but in fairness to the Minister and the House, I do not think I should unduly refer to it, but I would refer to the comments contained in the <Col N="1744" /> chapter&mdash;&ldquo;Criteria for State Expenditure in relation to Agriculture&rdquo;&mdash;and particularly paragraph 4.4 where it is stated:</P>
    <P>It is necessary to establish criteria by which the existing pattern of State expenditure can be evaluated.</P>
    <P>Then it states the various criteria, and, of course, this was read with a shock of political horror by the politicians and they decided that the best thing to do was to publish it and be damned and be forgotten in that setting.</P>
    <P>Reading this report and reading the statements of successive Ministers of Fianna Fáil, one can only come to the conclusion to which this report comes at page 57, Chapter 7, paragraph 7.1:</P>
    <P>We have come to the conclusion that there is a very substantial case for some major changes in the way in which these objectives should be pursued.  This conclusion in no way invalidates the objectives themselves, but the gradual development of a large number of different forms of expenditure has created a complex pattern of State aid to agriculture in which the relationship between the expenditure and the purpose it is intended to achieve is by no means as clear as it should be.  The reasons for expecting a substantial amount of aid to be a continuing feature of economic and budgetary policy for many years to come have already been set out.  In the light of this continued need for assistance, the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of some scheme of State aid to agriculture needs to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I think that the implication of that has not been fully considered by the Minister, or, indeed, by the Government, if, indeed, there is any serious attempt at Cabinet level to get to grips with the problems posed by this report, which, I believe, is the express purpose of Cabinet meetings, rather than the current preoccupation which I gather is very far removed from that kind of political exercise.</P>
    <P>There are other sections of the report, the attractive section 7.36 which makes a recommendation relating to the abolition of rates on land, a recommendation <Col N="1745" /> that all agricultural land now rated should be subject to a flat land tax&mdash;all innovations of a startling nature which certainly should be the subject of intense Government consideration but this is just an example of what, in effect, has not been done. I, therefore, with regret feel in relation to the Minister's speech in which he moved a sum of almost £73 million an analysis which included almost £36 million for price support as he said himself, which included £22 million for agricultural production and development aids, which included £4 million for livestock improvement and disease eradication and another £7 million for agricultural education research and advisory services&mdash;I do not think that when we talk in the millions of pounds involved, it is inappropriate to talk about some of the work done in analysing the total effectiveness of the entire Exchequer provision in relation to agriculture, now running as the Minister indicated, around £105 million in the current financial year&mdash; this House has not to its credit attempted to analyse the economic cost benefit returns from that expenditure.</P>
    <P>I feel that one could also consider, for example, the paper recently read by Mr. O'Connor to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland on the analysis of recent policies for beef and milk.  It was read in Dublin in January, 1970, almost two years ago. I think it will be seen from his cryptic comments and brilliant analysis of many areas, particularly in relation to milk prices, and certainly one might even say the regional imbalances which policy has created throughout the country, that that kind of criticism, and the associated papers and the work done by Mr. O'Connor, Mr. Attwood and so on, have been very serious.  Certainly the kind of political decisions of the Minister, namely, the changes in milk prices which we have now had announced are welcome.  A farmer said to me: &ldquo;I suppose if it was not for the referendum we would never have got it&rdquo;; &ldquo;I suppose that is true,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;That is part of the March campaign,&rdquo; and he agreed.  I got the impression that he was not terribly impressed by this kind of expensive <Col N="1746" /> fiddling which, while welcome, does not develop the kind of confidence in the agricultural sector which we want to see emerging in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As regards the EEC negotiations on agriculture referred to by the Minister, I have a number of comments to make. I feel that there is a need for the Minister and his Department in particular to consider the impact of dumping and the use of Article 91 of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>On the Order Paper today Deputy Donnellan had questions down to the Minister for Finance asking the total acreage of potatoes grown under contract for the Erin Foods factory at Tuam, the total number of applicants for contracts to supply potatoes to the Erin Foods plant at Tuam, and the future prospects for that plant.  When one becomes aware of the glut on the American market which is, in fact, exporting vigorously into Europe, and when one becomes aware that the Germans are exporting into Britain and that the French have started dehydrating, and when one becomes aware of the serious difficulty facing Cadbury-Schweppes on the British side, one can see that the dumping problem can have serious implications for this country.</P>
    <P>As we know, complaints will be investigated by the Commission and we will be allowed to use our national legislation in urgent cases, subject to <i>post factum</i> approval by the Commission. I would stress this to the Minister in relation to some of our agricultural products and, of course, it applies only to the transitional period; after 1977 no provision against dumping will be permitted.  If the Government's application goes through, presumably we will be in a single market. The Government believe that as a result of the explanations and information given to them by the Community the possibility of effective action against such practices will be available.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts that the explanations and information given to the Department by the Community will allay many of the fears which arise in relation to agricultural dumping. I do not think that kind of information is adequate.  I have very strong views about the way in which the <Col N="1747" /> Department were involved in the EEC negotiations.  I am not quite sure what kind of an empire the Minister for Foreign Affairs is building.  One is never quite sure what he is up to.  I am not sure at times that he is quite certain himself.</P>
    <P>I get the impression that the agricultural negotiators who are in Brussels are not in the tremendously complex areas of product by product negotiations.  They are dealing on the opposite side with men of intense specialisation, competence and information. I feel that agriculture has been dragged in sideways by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Minister does not seem to be involved in the negotiations.  With due respect to him I think that his predecessors, who were strong-minded men, by this stage would have &ldquo;done their thing&rdquo; in a very big way.  They would have insisted on being very directly and very intimately involved in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>If one takes the question of dumping alone one can see that major problems are facing us.  One can express legitimate concern to the Minister.  He has been very optimistic about future prices and prospects for our main farming products.  I would be entirely dishonest if I did not say that I accept a good deal of what the Minister said. For the most part reasonably responsible statements relating to agricultural prospects have been made, that is, in relation to a number of our main farming products.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it looks as if entry into the EEC will be a kind of party political tussle when it should really be a question of the net balance of advantages and disadvantages facing the country.  That should be the real political issue.  We should be considering to what extent we can offset the advantages facing a sector of agriculture against very real disadvantages in certain areas for industry and the other major issues involved such as prices and the increase inflation in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that there will be a good demand for beef <Col N="1748" /> in the enlarged Community and that Irish farmers can be reasonably assured of a developing market for their cattle, provided they have the capacity to undertake this expansion with which I shall deal later on.  We must bear in mind the price for fat cattle which the EEC set out to maintain. At present it is about 50 per cent above the average Irish market price.  This will mean that coming towards the end of the transitional period in 1978 an Irish farmer, because of membership, will get over £50 more for a top class ten cwt. animal.  This is not disputable on the basis of available information.  I would be entirely dishonest if I did not accept that implication.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that I have been enormously enamoured by the document produced by the Department of Foreign Affairs EEC information service, any more than Deputy Keating was last week.  These documents could be best produced and issued at Departmental level rather than making a general allocation of some £34,000 to the Department of Foreign Affairs to spend on material of this nature, I presume, in the hope of convincing Irish farmers of the benefits they will get. While these statements are correct generally in the document prepared at Foreign Affairs level, nevertheless a good deal more could have been done in its presentation, in stating the facts and giving information, for example, on the policy on the sale of land.  There is no reference to that in the document.  We could have had a much better statement from the Minister or the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister holds out considerable prospects for milk.  I would be shot out of the homes of my relations in north Cork if I went down there and said I rejected the statement by the Minister. One must accept that no longer will our exports be tied down to fixed quotas, and no longer will our dairy exports have to be subsidised at considerable cost to the taxpayer.  With free entry into an enlarged market, the prospects for milk have been stated with considerable accuracy by the Government.  It is a question of the net balance of advantage, taking the <Col N="1749" /> other disadvantages into account, that on the basis of the terms negotiated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and in relation to agriculture, apart from the correct reluctance on the part of the Minister to concede anything on the animal health field, I gather that very little else has been negotiated by him on the agricultural front.  Certainly, I support the Minister on facing up to the real problems involved in the negotiations on animal and plant health.  We should not yield at all in these negotiations towards accepting the Commission's viewpoint because to do so would pose, in the long term, severe eradication and disease control problems for this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly rejected an attempt by the Commission to have us accept their current proposals. Therefore, on a number of fronts, on the general fronts of beef, in terms of milk, in terms of sheep and lamb production, in terms possibly of the bacon industry, our prospects are reasonably good.  Nevertheless, we are faced with a very serious problem in relation to marketing.  The Minister has stressed and rightly so that the markets will be highly competitive and discriminatory. At present our farm produce is sold to a British market of about 50 million people, a market where food prices are kept at a rather low level.</P>
    <P>While we will have higher prices available to us, with the tremendous emphasis on free competition within the Common Market and with the great emphasis on free trade and the guaranteed high prices for agricultural goods, the competition will be extremely keen, not merely on the question of prices which seems to be an obsession with Fianna Fáil, but increased sales will have to be won by the quality of the agricultural goods exported and by our capacity to meet consumer needs.  The continental housewife in deciding what she will buy, will determine virtually what we will produce.  There is a real failure on the part of the Government to make Irish farmers aware of the fact that the markets within the Community will be highly competitive and most discriminatory, that production <Col N="1750" /> and processing must be geared to these market requirements and that that will be a principal criterion, that technological inputs will be of extreme importance, that unless capital is available we will not have extra production and that the organisational structure in this country must be changed substantially.</P>
    <P>All of this will require transformation of existing attitudes in Irish agriculture. In other words, if Irish agriculture is to benefit from the higher prices that are available within the EEC, the industry will have to be transformed in terms of productive capacity and marketing techniques. Perhaps the Government have no wish to frighten some of the farmers with the implication of what is involved but this particular lack of awareness is notable throughout the country.  Products going from this country will have to be practically tailormade to suit the very precise consumer needs and preferences within the Community.  I have pointed out that product quality characteristics must be very carefully controlled at all levels, at production, processing and sale levels.</P>
    <P>Another problem that has been stressed very strongly and stressed in particular by Dr. Tom Walsh concerns free trade and I quote from a comprehensive paper of his on the subject in which he says:</P>
    <P>Another problem on which I find lack of awareness is that with free trade within the EEC we may see some food products from outside competing on our markets.  It will not be all one-way traffic.  Free trade will give free rein to the doctrine of comparative advantage.  We are all aware of market developments elsewhere; the self-service store, the supermarkets and the major integrated multiples in the food field. We will be competing in a market where there will be considerable change in demand as a result of increasing affluence, where ringing the changes on the product against the background of inelasticity in demand is a major marketing weapon.  Marketing techniques must be developed to bear on the consumer so that our <Col N="1751" /> traditional products of high quality are acceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not think that he is under any illusion as to the gearing of production and marketing methods to meet the new situation within the EEC.  This particular paper read by Dr. Walsh, in Waterford, must have had a very sobering effect on the professional personnel who were present and must have ensured that the requirements in production and processing will be geared systematically to meet market requirements. He pointed out that:</P>
    <P>At farm level, there will be an increasing need to operate farming systems specifically developed from research findings to meet market demands.  These systems will be intensive, capital-demanding and specialised.  They will need to be efficient with strict attention to the inputs required and to productivity. They will make new demands on resources of land, labour and capital. To meet these requirements we have, as has already been clearly shown, relatively limited land resources&mdash; about one-third of our total land area.  Processing also will increase in importance as the housewife demands more convenience, readyto-serve foods.  Our capacity for product and process innovation will be especially important.</P>
    <P>I endorse every word spoken by Dr. Walsh in that particular statement. Further, Dr. Walsh continued:</P>
    <P>There will be a growing tendency to specialisation of function also, although this may not come immediately. This will result in a reduction in the number of components in the production process on farms.  Some components will be transferred from the farmer to other farmers and to others outside farming. Farmers will buy more of their inputs from other farmers and from the non-farm sector.  It has been estimated that 30 per cent of 1967 Dutch farm production was harvested with equipment from outside the farm where the crops were produced. The days of the traditional mixed farm with a wide variety of <Col N="1752" /> enterprises are numbered.  Farm employees will also become much more specialised.</P>
    <P>I endorse his comment in that regard. He said:</P>
    <P>Intense competition based on high quality goods will place increasing emphasis on technological development in the food sector.  Innovation and technological development in this sector is already high with new and improved food products arriving on supermarket shelves every day.  This is very evident in the US. The position is similar in Europe where the housewife is perhaps even more selective in terms of food quality. </P>
    <P>May I suggest, therefore, that any farmer who thinks, or any politician who is advising farmers that there is an automatic bonanza in terms of current production, marketing and technological techniques is in for a rather rude awakening because in agriculture the price and the pricing policy is not the major criterion.</P>
    <P>One other aspect he referred to was the evidence available on the organisational structure of the sector.  He pointed out in this paper:</P>
    <P>Marketing oriented firms have bought established production facilities in order to control them and to serve consumer needs better.  A process of integration is occurring where every stage of production from the supply of raw materials to sale to consumers is under unitary control.  Vertical integration is under way.  This process has been particularly evident in the food industry. Food manufacturing firms have bought their way into the retail business. In some cases they have also control of the supply of raw materials to their factories.  Some retail firms have established their own manufacturing arm.  By extensive advertising these have substantially increased their share of the market and their profits.  This process of integration of the whole food industry could leave the individual farmer in a weak position due to his lack of bargaining power.</P>
    <P>The manifestation of this development <Col N="1753" /> is quite evident in some areas of the Irish food processing industry which is at present getting a terrible dose of salt in some sectors.  That trend is something which the Government will have to take major care of to make sure that one does not find oneself, even with massively increased prices in the EEC for some products, out on a limb.  His strictures are of major consequence.  As the position stands today the majority of Irish food manufacturers and of Irish workers are too small to carry on an effective marketing programme in the EEC. Indeed, changes in the present structure of the marketing agencies of An Bord Bainne, the Pigs and Bacon Commission and others are necessary and should take place.  We must have an integrated marketing programme for Irish food products which will demand very considerable discipline not only on the part of Irish politicians but on the part of Irish farmers in the production of high quality products.  These are areas which are of serious concern to members of the Labour Party and areas in which the Government have not been very active.</P>
    <P>One of the areas where more intensive efforts should have been made by the Government is the area of the co-operative movement within agriculture. For the marketing of Irish agricultural products in the EEC and for proper integration of production and marketing the most effective way is through the co-operative movement.  I do not think the co-operative movement has received the maximum support from the Government or from the Fianna Fáil Party down through the years.  Rather has it been allowed to develop in its own <i>ad hoc</i> way.  Much more intense co-operation will be required within the Common Market.</P>
    <P>At farm level, in servicing and processing, packaging and merchandising and in the direct sale of agricultural produce and the development of ancillary enterprises which should provide increased employment there is ample room for tremendous expansion of the co-operative movement.  There is very real evidence available to us of the collective expertise and ability of many managers and people in the <Col N="1754" /> co-operative movement who could provide a further expansion of co-operative effort within the climate of higher prices.  I think that the climate within the Common Market, if it is to be anything, will at least be a bit more favourable for the expansion of the co-operative movement.  This House should now undertake, and the Minister should make a very special effort to give, extra assistance to the IAOS.  It should be given further particular assistance in its planning, co-ordinating and general developmental services for Irish agriculture.  The Minister should make a special effort to help the IAOS in this field.</P>
    <P>These are my views on some of the aspects facing the country in relation to the EEC.  In an agricultural debate I do not think one need be as pessimistic as some people might be.  Many of the projections that have been made have been reasonably optimistic.  My principal concern is that such is the age structure, such is the innate reluctance of so many Irish farmers to increased production unless they are absolutely on a &ldquo;dead cert&rdquo;, that the projections of increased production may not come about even with the increased prices for a number of products. It is with that reservation that I should like to welcome, for instance, the very considerable work done recently and the paper presented to the Irish Agricultural Economic Society on 22nd October by fellow Corkman, Dr. Denis Lucey of UCC and Dr. T. Josling of the London School of Economics.  This is a very interesting paper on the market for agricultural goods in an enlarged European Community. In their paper the word &ldquo;phenomenal&rdquo; appears in terms of some of the projections made.  At the end of page 16 they speak about a phenomenal Irish increase in exports of beef and dairy products.  That is the kind of projection made in a very comprehensive paper.  I do not understand the methodology of the projections made.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I accept in good faith, and with some understanding, the levels of output of major farm commodities which they project right up to 1980, assuming EEC enlargement <Col N="1755" /> and assuming no great change in the common agricultural policy.  These projections and the excellent work done by Dr. Lucey and Dr. T. Josling are most welcome.  One has difficulty in following the analysis of the effects of membership by Raymond Crotty, for example, for entirely different reasons. With due respect to Raymond Crotty, I tend to have greater faith in the assumptions made by Dr. Lucey and Dr. Josling and by many other Irish academics and their projections for the main products up to 1980.  However, in strict fairness to the Raymond Crotty approach, I would enter one reservation which I would ask the House to take into account.  There are a number of disquieting features about this common agricultural policy of the EEC.  Virtually all of our assumptions in relation to price support and the future of Irish agriculture are based on the fundamental assumption that there will be no change in the common agricultural policy.  I am afraid that there are so many disquieting features about the common agricultural policy of the EEC as to suggest that there may well be changes in future and that these changes may not be to the benefit of the Irish agricultural community. This is one of the major reservations of the Labour Party in this debate.</P>
    <P>There is the considerable failure of many persons engaged in agricultural production to appreciate that the long term EEC food price policy does not look inherently very strong.  One must also appreciate that it is rather inefficient in administration and that it is most likely to diminish in long term benefit to farmers and that in the short term it will certainly lead to substantial increases in domestic food prices.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to read some of the British criticisms of the common agricultural policy and also some of the worldwide criticisms.  It is impossible to read these criticisms and not to appreciate that even with the presence of the four applicant countries in the council chamber and the Council of Ministers, such is the universal international hostility towards the common agricultural policy that there may well be substantial changes in the years <Col N="1756" /> ahead.  We have not yet had a White Paper here.  I gather that they are grinding away in the Department of Finance trying to quantify some of the figures.  It looks as if we will have nothing until the middle of January. However, the British White Paper says, in paragraph 81:</P>
    <P>Under the common agricultural policy the level of market prices for the main agricultural commodities is maintained in two ways.  The price of imports is kept up to a minimum or threshold price by means of variable import levies; and the internal market is supported at an intervention price, slightly below the threshold price, at which any surpluses are bought by the Communities agricultural fund. </P>
    <P>What that paragraph means, in plain man's language, is that consumers pay high prices for EEC farm produce in order to guarantee farmers' living standards and that imports of the same food from cheaper markets abroad are taxed up to the point where the consumer has no advantage. Instead of an agricultural support system which both guarantees farmers' incomes and allows the import of cheap food, such as has existed in Britain for the past 20 years, the common agricultural policy controls imports, using machinery which is almost identical with that of the Corn Laws which Britain abolished a century ago.  This alleged error is compounded by support buying, which means that if, despite the exclusion of imports, the market price still falls below that fixed as necessary for EEC farmers, then the Commission resorts to creating an artificial scarcity to bring the price up again by purchasing excess produce on the market.  It is not so long ago since a huge butter mountain was built up in France and West Germany&mdash; butter which the housewives of the Six could not buy because it was so expensive.</P>
    <P>At briefing sessions in Brussels when the intricacies of the common agricultural policy were explained to us, we were not enormously impressed and did not find ourselves looking forward to a situation in the 1980s where we in this country would be defending the <Col N="1757" /> basic criteria of the common agricultural policy because no one outside the Common Market&mdash;not one single agricultural economist&mdash;and precious few within it, had anything complimentary to say about the common agricultural policy.  One of the most vociferous critics of it is Senator Hubert Humphrey who recently made a special visit to Britain to speak on this matter and put the case most succinctly.  I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the common agricultural policy has become a major disruptive force in world agricultural markets. Its workings have gone far beyond the original objective.  The import-levy system that the Common Market has introduced is much worse than import quotas because they make imports a matter of residual supply...</P>
    <P>The EEC is thus operating a farm-support system at a phenomenally high cost which does not benefit in any significant way the small farmer it is supposed to help... Surely it is within the realms of possibility to find the means for assisting the income of small farmers without providing windfall gains for large farmers and without forcing consumers to pay more than they need for their daily fare. </P>
    <P>Indeed, the Senator was extremely critical and the British have been extremely concerned about the overall effect of the common agricultural policy.  By no means can it be said that it is likely that in future the common agricultural policy will be maintained to the degree to which it now exists, with all its force and all its benefits to the Irish farmer in the interim period.  The common agricultural policy is in for major changes when it becomes evident within the EEC that it requires considerable adaptation.</P>
    <P>I would now make the point in relation to the EEC that, such is the complacency of the Government, it is only very slowly trickling out in our national newspapers and in other sources that there will be problems for Irish agriculture.  Those problems are <Col N="1758" /> very, very slowly coming to light.  Jim Norton, who was complimented by Deputy Keating, and I would like to add my voice in compliment too, had this to say last Saturday in the farming supplement to the <i>Irish Independent</i> after spending six days in Italy.  He wrote what can only be described as a disturbing report.  He asked several pertinent questions:</P>
    <P>Can our existing cattle trade survive under EEC conditions?  Have Irish farmers got anything like enough information about what is going to happen to agriculture&mdash; particularly to the livestock trade&mdash; when we go into Europe?</P>
    <P>What about the live trade in cattle to the UK?  What about our meat factories?  What about the livestock marts?</P>
    <P>What can we do to stop the situation developing where we would be powerless to prevent an organised invasion by Italian buyers coming to Irish marts to buy our young calves at prices which our Irish dairy farmers would consider &ldquo;out of this world&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Could the average Irish farmer, big or small, compete with the Italians who are now ploughing Europe for calves, and paying anything from £65 to £80 apiece for them at a week to ten-days-old? Could our feeders compete with the Italian buyers willing to pay up to £120 or £130 for a well-done six to eight-months-old single-suckled calf?</P>
    <P>If this happens what then will our carcase meat factories do for their raw material?</P>
    <P>Has any serious thought been given by the Government, the Departments of Finance and Agriculture or any of our big bank groups to how the finance is going to be made available to allow farmers willing to gamble on buying young stock against the well-heeled Italian buyers?</P>
    <P>If this question has been considered, then it is a well-kept secret.</P>
    <P>In view of the exceptionally high prices which dry cows are making in Europe&mdash;up to £16 per cwt. is fairly <Col N="1759" /> common in Italy, double what they bring at home&mdash;is there any hope for the much-publicised and very valuable boneless beef trade which was worth £16.5 million last year?</P>
    <P>Spokesmen for our carcase meat trade have said that even under EEC conditions a major part of the trade would remain with the UK.  This however is always presupposing that they would be able to buy in competition with Continental buyers.</P>
    <P>The argument can be put forward that it is cheaper to transport meat than live cattle and that because of this, the factory man will always have the edge on the live exporter or the foreign buyer.  This, of course, overlooks the fact that the continental meat man wants his carcases presented and put in a manner completely different to what the UK trade wants.</P>
    <P>He makes the comment:</P>
    <P>The big danger as I see it from my talks with Continental meat men is that our negotiations for EEC entry are being carried out by senior officials in the Civil Service who are far removed from the realities of the live cattle trade or carcase meat trade.</P>
    <P>The big drawback appears to me to be not so much that the people are getting too much information as Dr. Hillery said recently, but that they are not getting enough.  If mistakes are made by the failure of the negotiators to contact trade interests, the price is going to be paid by the thousands of Irish farmers who won't be able to buy young stock to replace those sold.  As a result they could find themselves forced to sell land and get jobs in industry, perhaps not at home either.</P>
    <P>The questions asked by Jim Norton should be answered.  They have not been answered in the White Paper, Irish Agriculture and Fisheries in the EEC, and one looks in vain for any serious consideration by the Government of the capital investment factor in the development of Irish agriculture within the EEC.  There is a reference <Col N="1760" /> to State aids and to the financing of the common agricultural policy.  This is related to the capital investment programme. There is very considerable concern at agricultural level for the future because of the problems facing the industry and the country in relation to investment if we are to face up to the problems that will confront us in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I want now to bring to the attention of the House a very interesting interview with Mr. Maher in the <i>Federation of Irish Industries Economic Review</i> in October last.  Mr. Maher said:</P>
    <P>What is good for the farmer is good for the community in general and, apart from the fact that the farmer and his family are one of the basic units of society, making up directly 20 to 30 per cent of the total population, indirectly he is responsible for providing work and employment for 60 out of 100 persons at work in the State as a result of activity generated from farms.</P>
    <P>He went on to make a special plea, a plea which I endorse, a plea which Mr. Maher referred to in his Press conference yesterday, that there is special need for a complete transformation of the agricultural policy of the Government in relation to the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cause any undue alarm but I would strongly urge the Government and their advisers to consider, for example, the scale of investment indicated in a recent lecture given by Mr. Michael J. Walshe, the agricultural adviser to the World Bank, one of the most brilliant men who ever worked in this field.  He maintains that Irish agriculture is being starved of finance and investment.  He says an investment of £1,000 million is needed to enable the agricultural industry to develop to its full potential.  That is the statement he made to the Irish Grassland and Animal Production Association in Dublin a few weeks ago.  He suggested that investment in agriculture next year was unlikely to exceed £10 million to £15 million compared with £95 million in industry.  He made projections showing the need for a major investment programme in agriculture on a national basis.  I might stress that that plea by <Col N="1761" /> Mr. Walshe was strongly endorsed by the NFA yesterday.  They have suggested, and I strongly support their view, that the Government should provide £200 million over the next five years to finance an annual 10 per cent expansion of sheep, cattle and milk production.  They also suggested that the investment of £40 million a year to capitalise this expansion would increase milk output and cattle output through a 500,000 head increase in cow numbers. I support this plea for substantial improvements in the investment policies of the Government in relation to cattle and milk production in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I believe that the policy in relation to education, research, <i>et cetera</i>, is inadequate. I am very conscious of what must be done.  What must be done was stated specifically by Dr. Tom Walsh the director of An Foras Talúntais. He delivered a 40 to 50 page paper at the annual congress of the Agricultural Science Association in Waterford last September in which he made a series of recommendations on the radical changes which must be introduced by the Government in relation to the whole system of agricultural advisory services in the field of education, research and development.</P>
    <P>I support the recommendations made by Paddy Jennings, President of the Irish Agricultural Advisers' Association in today's <i>Irish Times.</i>  I would urge the Government to have an immediate and close look at the deficiencies in our advisory services and the deficiencies in our system of agricultural training. There is no body such as AnCO for the agricultural industry and there is no cooperative college.  I would strongly urge the Government to consider major improvements in this area and bring them in as a matter of urgency because otherwise our farmers will face the EEC ignorant of the full implications of what the EEC holds for the agricultural industry in general and the public at large.  I commend the changes I have outlined to the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Dublin Deputy, I should like to say a few words on this very important Estimate.  Having heard some of the speeches, I think they could be classified as beef and <Col N="1762" /> bull.  We had academic examinations of the cow and other animals in the Common Market but I want to make an examination from the point of view of housewives in this city.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to set up an inquiry into production prices and prices paid by the consumer because housewives are being robbed by middlemen.  Dick Turpin or Al Capone have little on some of the people who are operating in this field today.  These people have no interest whatsoever in production; they merely want to get their greedy hands on the produce as it passes on its way from the producer to the consumer.  They are robbing the defenceless housewives.  My concern is for the housewives in Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Drimnagh, Inchicore, Walkinstown and the other areas I represent because they are being fleeced by these middlemen.</P>
      <P>A farmer gets £15 per ton for potatoes.  He has to pay £2 a ton to have them transported to market and he pays fees in the market of £1 or £1.50, which makes them approximately £18 a ton and, sometimes, much less.  We find the end product in supermarkets in 5 pound bags at 9p unwashed and 10½p washed.  This means that unwashed potatoes fetch £40 a ton and washed potatoes fetch £47 a ton.  The difference between what the farmer gets and what the housewife pays in relation to unwashed potatoes is £22 and in relation to washed potatoes is £29.  Middlemen are collecting these vast amounts of money. If potatoes are cheaper, the housewife has to pay the same price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the farmer is getting a fair price for his produce.  He has to buy the seed and the fertiliser and he has to pay for labour in the setting of the seed and the harvesting of the crop.  He has to store them for 12 months and he gets £18 a ton compared with the middleman who sits in an office up to his knees in carpet, who may only hold the potatoes for a couple of days but gets more for doing that than the farmer who produces them.  I will look after the housewives but the Department should look after the farmers because they are not getting a fair deal. <Col N="1763" /> It is time the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries together with the pricing section of the Department of Industry and Commerce looked into this because in many ways farm produce is being used to subsidise foreign biscuits and other commodities.  The middlemen must not be allowed to soak the housewives.  Housewives and workers do not mind paying a fair price because they do not mind giving the farmer a fair return but in this case the farmer is not getting a fair return and the housewife is being robbed by a small group of people. These rings and cartels must be broken and we must ensure fair play.</P>
    <P>The housewife in this city pays taxes in a variety of ways.  I, for one, do not begrudge the subsidies which farmers get in relation to incentive schemes, silage pits, farm buildings, the agricultural adviser <i>et cetera.</i>  By the time the beast is produced the housewife owns it, yet she has to go into the butcher's shop and buy back her own meat.  The housewife does not mind paying these subsidies provided she can get the end product at a fair and reasonable price.  Those of us who are fortunate enough to be able to buy it know only too well the price of a pound of steak, but there are many people in this city who are unable to buy meat.  When the price of cattle at the market goes up the butcher, naturally enough, passes on the increase to the consumer but when the price of cattle goes down he does not reduce it.</P>
    <P>This is the situation in regard to the beef that goes with the potatoes.  Not alone is the worker stung for the potatoes, but he is also held up to ransom for the beef.  It is time some inquiry was undertaken to get a realistic assessment of the situation.  I want to emphasise that when the price of cattle goes down the price of beef does not fall in the butcher's shop.  I have often watched the little bull's eye on the butcher's scales winking at me and it is very hard to follow.  That is all you see; you see it winking and then the meat is taken off and thrown on a board and the butcher then proceeds &mdash;and this, again, is irritating to the <Col N="1764" /> housewife&mdash;to chop off little bits of fat suitable for mince but he has a very bad shot when he comes to the bone and he misses that.  Again, the housewife must pay for this bone.  The whole business should be examined in regard to all these gimmicks and slick moves and people who are not giving the housewife a fair deal should be severely dealt with.  This is robbery on a par with the actions of Al Capone or Dick Turpin.  For the sake of the farmers we must ensure, and the Department must ensure that the situation is remedied.  We shall also ask the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce to keep an eye on the situation and we want the Minister to ensure that people get a fair deal.</P>
    <P>There are other items on which I wish to comment.  There are fish fingers in which there is no fish; they are full of breadcrumbs and grease.  Again, the housewife is hoodwinked with a tray labelled &ldquo;Fish Fingers&rdquo;.  I do not know if this comes under this Estimate but the Parliamentary Secretary is present and I am sure he will note my comments in regard to a situation that needs examination.  If somebody carried out the same type of examination as was carried out on cattle earlier in this debate we might find out the type of fish used in fish fingers, how these fingers are manufactured and the ingredients in them.  The pound of steak for which they must be substituted is so dear now as to be almost beyond reach of the housewife.</P>
    <P>A mutton cutlet is beyond the reach of the ordinary worker and notwithstanding that sheep prices were not too good last year the price of mutton in the butcher's shop is far beyond the reach of the housewife.  Something will have to be done about prices here at home.  There is much talk about the Common Market.  Listening to farmers speaking on previous occasions I did not know whether the cows going into the Common Market would have two horns or four horns, such a variety of them has been mentioned.</P>

      <P>As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted and the housewives of this city attacked, I am anxious that the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce should make a realistic examination immediately of the difference between the production prices charged by the farmer and the prices charged to the consumers.  In the process of explaining this it is unfortunate that I may have referred to friends of some of the Deputies here and they became annoyed.  Nevertheless, if they are the middlemen they must be dealt with, no matter whose friends they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not labour the point.  There are other matters I should like to have examined.  In the shops or supermarkets at present we find cabbage at 7½ new pence per head and if one measures that against what the farmer gets for buying the plants and fertilisers and his labour one can see that the middleman is an extortionist dipping his hand into the housewife's purse whenever she buys a cabbage. This must be stamped out no matter whose friend these middlemen or fiddlemen are.  It is up to the Department to see that farm produce goes from farmer to consumer in a way that will give everybody a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cauliflowers cost 10 new pence or 2s.; lettuce, 6½ new pence.  These were yesterday's prices.  Five tomatoes in a little box covered with cellophane cost <Col N="1767" /> 15 new pence.  It is obvious that that cellophane must cost more than the tomatoes judging by the size of the tomatoes.  Apples cost 5 new pence each and I understand it is now difficult to get children to go into an orchard because there are so many apples available in the country.  It is hard to understand why we must be charged five new pence or one shilling for an apple.  With regard to eggs, this is an item&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Eggs are used in a considerable quantity by the housewives but they are being held to ransom as the price has been increasing steadily.  I agree with Deputy Desmond that there is room for co-operatives and I see no reason why commodities such as potatoes could not be packed in 5 lb, 10 lb, or 1 stone packets in packaging stations throughout the country and sent directly to shops in Dublin.  This would cut out the middlemen&mdash;or perhaps I might call them the fiddlemen&mdash;it would give valuable employment in areas such as Donegal or the west coast and it would be beneficial for the farmers and the housewives.</P>
      <P>The marketing procedure with regard to the commodities I have mentioned is appalling.  I would ask the Minister to set up an inquiry immediately to examine the position.  There is much talk about encouraging the consumption of cheese but in many restaurants the charge for the cheese board is 25p or 30p although the amount of cheese given to the customer would not cost more than 5p.  Instead of offering cheese at a reasonable price it is treated as an extra and this is not encouraging the use of cheese in restaurants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>This would <Col N="1768" /> appear to be a matter to be dealt with on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This commodity has been referred to in the Estimate we are discussing.  I might add that the amount of cheese one gets in hotels often is not worth putting into a mousetrap although a charge of 30p is made.  We have a good selection of cheeses in this country and one would think that the Department would encourage hotels to put cheese on their menus but it is regarded as an extra, it cannot be obtained in lieu of dessert, and is considered by many people as beyond their reach.  In marketing procedure no regard is had to the consumers in the large cities.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that a comprehensive examination of this matter is carried out and an inquiry held to determine where the money goes along the line between the producer and the consumer.  There are some people occupying plush offices who never leave their offices, who direct the shipment of potatoes and other commodities from one area to another and who get more money for this than do the producers.  It is about time the farmers investigated the position and thereby ensured that they get more for their commodities.  They are entitled to more than the middlemen who have no trouble with regard to the production or the storage of the goods.  Year after year we have allowed this small group of middlemen to rob the housewives in this city and other areas.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to examine the situation of packaging of potatoes in particular, and other farm produce. If he does this I am sure he will find out that there is considerable potential for employment.  If we cut out these middlemen we would have cheaper farm produce and foodstuffs at a more realistic rate than at present obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to the interesting speech by Deputy Dowling &mdash;he spoke about beef and bull, we have heard about the middlemen and the &ldquo;fiddle men&rdquo;.  I am pleased to see that Deputy Dowling is so concerned for the housewives of Dublin.  He has mentioned at considerable length the <Col N="1769" /> difficulties with which they are faced with regard to prices of common foodstuffs such as potatoes, beef, mutton and vegetables.  He has asked the Minister to refer to the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce the middlemen who are exploiting the situation.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that Deputy Dowling has not done this before now. He has made his statement in this House to ensure that he will get maximum publicity and bring to the attention of Dublin housewives all that he is doing on their behalf.  There was nothing to prevent the Deputy from mentioning this matter privately to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of informing the Minister if there was a racket operating with regard to potatoes or any other commodity. However, if the Deputy's speech today results in any good to the housewives I will be quite satisfied.  His speech was humorous and I enjoyed it.</P>
      <P>This discussion has tended to range towards a discussion on the Common Market and, as this is probably the last debate we will have on agriculture before we enter the EEC, this was to be expected.  The Government have given us some documentation and a small publication has been made available recently to the public entitled <i>The Common Market and Irish Agriculture.</i> However, as Deputies have stressed, there are many questions left unanswered and possibly a number of questions cannot be answered at the moment.  Judging by some questions I put down, it appears there are some matters still under negotiation.  I assume that even after we have entered the Common Market, there will still be a lot of tidying up to be done and a lot of matters, even important matters, still to be negotiated.  Probably if we were to wait until all the bits and pieces were completed, we would never go in because the negotiations would be so protracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters which immediately comes up for consideration is this question of aids to agriculture. Substantial aids have been given to agriculture here down the years.  Some of these aids are not of direct benefit <Col N="1770" /> to the farmers, while others are.  It is difficult to know, and I find it difficult to decide or even to find out, what percentage of these aids will be retained. Deputy Desmond has dealt with these aids from a different standpoint, from the standpoint of their general usefulness.  We have an awful lot of them and our Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is very busy at the moment administering these numerous aids.  One often wonders if some of them are really worthwhile. Certain it is that if there was a good realistic price for agriculture, it would be of far more use to the farmers than a lot of the aids we have at present.</P>
    <P>In 1967-68 State expenditure in relation to Agriculture was £68 million and the figure has increased to £105 million in 1971-72.  These aids are given to us every year at Budget time, covering a variety of helps, directly and indirectly, to the farmers, or to agricultural in general rather than the farmers.  I should like the Minister to tell us at this stage how much of this £105 million will be available to agriculture after we go into the Common Market.  We understand straight away that an estimate of £30 million in the form of price supports, chiefly to dairy produce, will be saved.  That is the figure which I think has been generally agreed on, but there are substantial aids also to beef and bacon, and even small aids to oats and wheat.  Do these prices supports go?  I am assuming they do, but I should like a clear answer from the Minister as to whether price supports for these products will be removed the moment we enter the Common Market during the transitional period, or will they be phasing out.  My own view is that as far as I can judge they will be removed immediately and that the supports we have got will be replaced by a sum of £30 million which we will get from the European fund.</P>
    <P>More difficult, however, to get answers on are the other elements in our expenditure on agriculture, for example, production incentives paid direct to producers.  We have under this heading beef cattle incentive grants, sheep grants, grants for farrowed sows, small farm incentive <Col N="1771" /> bonus and calved heifers.  Does the exhibition of these grants conform to the terms of the Rome Treaty?  Does it give an unfair advantage to Irish farmers <i>vis-á-vis</i> farmers, other members, of the EEC?  Are there similar incentives operating on the Continent? If there are, well and good; if there are not incentives of a comparable nature operating on the Continent, does that mean that we must abolish or phase out these various production incentives. I am speaking now of production incentive as distinct from price supports.</P>
    <P>The other heading of our agricultural supports is the provision of payments to reduce production and overhead costs.  Here is one of importance to us again.  I think that here also this support will disappear.  It includes lime and fertiliser subsidies, the reduction of the land annuities and the relief of rates on agricultural land.  The relief of rates on agricultural land is a very big thing, £20 million a year, and we are giving in the present year £24 million.  The lime and fertiliser subsidies amount to £7 million and the reduction of the land annuities has been pretty well the same down through the years, something over £1 million. That has been there since 1932.  Are these compatible with equality of competition which is the keystone of European agricultural marketing conditions, of the common agricultural policy in Europe?</P>
    <P>This is of importance to us particularly because in relation to the use of fertilisers, we occupy a very poor position. Our use of fertilisers per acre of land is the lowest of the Ten, very much the lowest, and does this mean that there is a risk that, bad though our utilisation of fertiliser is here, it will worsen when the substantial subsidy of £7 million is removed?  There are other aides to agriculture, mainly of a capital nature, and these cover such matters as land reclamation, farm buildings, water supplies, machinery grants, capital from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, rural electricification, arterial drainage.  This is, in effect, a form of subsidy, very indirect but yet a form of help to agriculture.  How <Col N="1772" /> does that conform to equality of competition which is inherent in the Rome Treaty?  Again, I am merely expressing my own viewpoint when I say that I think that much in that is probably allowable, in so far as it would be even considered under the structural farming re-organisation of the Mansholt Plan&mdash;some of it&mdash;but the first three I have mentioned are far more doubtful.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of disease eradication.  We spend a lot of money on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  We are proceeding with the eradication of brucellosis along the same lines, a radical policy, a radical slaughter policy.  For an indefinite period, and perhaps for ever, we will have to face an annual expenditure of a couple of million pounds to keep tuberculosis under control because it is a peculiar, insidious disease and, unless there is continual supervision with regard to animals and humans, it can flare up unexpectedly particularly when you think it has been completely eliminated, and resistance is gone.</P>
    <P>Nowadays that flare-up is probably more likely to occur in the animal kingdom than in humans.  We have had our people vaccinated against tuberculosis but we have not done that with cattle.  We pursued a policy of eradicating the disease in animals by slaughter if they are mantoux positive. We have pursued the other policy in relation to humans.  We try to make them mantoux positive because we cannot slaughter them.  They are two diametrically opposing approaches.  We will have to continue to expend a considerable amount of money on the eradication of tuberculosis.  This entire matter may be associated with what is being discussed at present on the question of animal health: whether our approach to brucellosis&mdash;a more radical approach which we are adopting in the north-eastern counties and which we will have to adopt in the southern counties where it will be a much bigger problem as TB was too&mdash; will be acceptable to the Common Market or whether they will insist on their own system of vaccination not only for brucellosis but also for foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that much <Col N="1773" /> difficulty will arise with regard to the money we spend on agricultural research and education and on the advisory services, and the amount of money we spend on the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, on international bodies, agricultural shows and Macra na Feirme.  I do not think this will present much of a problem.  I am satisfied that price supports, the outstanding one being the milk price support, will disappear and be taken over by the Common Market fund which will bring us in £30 million a year whereas at the moment we are paying £35 million in price supports to milk.  These are the types of questions to which we have not got clear cut answers.  They cover a very wide field.  We are pretty clear on the price supports but there are many other aspects of agricultural aids which may present us with a difficulty as not being reconcilable to the equality of competition which is inherent in the Rome Treaty.</P>
    <P>The next matter I should like to deal with is the question of capital investment in agriculture.  In his speech the Minister put that last and I am deliberately putting it first because I believe that agriculture in our society has been starved for capital for generations and generations&mdash;in my father's time and in my grandfather's time.  The reason is not far to seek.  We have never had a worthwhile market. Our market has been particularly difficult since we got our political freedom.  The amount of political freedom we possess was paid for largely out of the pockets of Irish farmers who, since the State was founded, have enjoyed a position inferior to that obtaining for the Northern Ireland farmer or the British farmer.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the community may have made economic sacrifices but not comparable and not with the same consistency as those made by the Irish agricultural community and the farmer in particular.  For many years the farming organisations have been drawing attention to the lack of capital investment.  The public in general have become more alive to that matter in recent years.  It is only now, on the eve <Col N="1774" /> of entry to the Common Market, when we see the capital possibilities for agriculture, and the full economic potential of agriculture, that people are awakening to the necessity for and desirability of a massive capital investment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that our capital investment in agriculture for 1970 was £60 million, £40 million of which would come from our own resources and £20 million from the public capital programme.  This is low spending.  This is low capital investment for an economy like agriculture.  By nature farmers are conservative and as a class or a body they have been very slow to invest or to put money into agriculture. Admittedly some of them have gone overboard and bought machinery which they did not need.  But, by and large, they were not inclined to plough back money into agriculture.  That was more so in the past, the reason being that they had to go to the bank to get the money and they were afraid of being swamped economically.  Credit facilities were not made readily available to them.  All that was available to them for many years was the local joint stock bank and the local bank manager.  They were dependent on him as to what capital they could raise.</P>
    <P>We established our Agricultural Credit Corporation.  This is a corporation with limited resources and one that has been chary of advancing much money.  In fact, the average increase in loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation during the past decade has been only £4 million and, according to the Minister's figure the total loan of the corporation for 1971-72 is £13.5 million.  According to the agriculturalists and, in particular, according to the agricultural economists, this type of investment is completely inadequate as far as agricultural development is concerned and, apparently, by comparison with other countries there is a complete under investment in agriculture here.  New Zealand has been mentioned but I do not know whether comparable figures are available in respect of agricultural investment in the various European countries and in places such as New Zealand, Australia and Canada.  Such <Col N="1775" /> figures would be very interesting and I venture to hazard the opinion that they would be very instructive for us and would bring home to us very clearly how far we have failed in that regard.  This failure has not entirely been our own fault but was due to the fact that down through the years we have not had an assured market.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned that in terms of volume our agricultural output has increased during the past decade by 28 per cent.  That is a very poor increase.  It is far below our potential.  One must be happy that there has been an improvement but we should have been able to achieve much more.  If more of our land was developed, there could be a much greater expansion.  Had we obtained good prices and had available to us a good market, it is my belief that we could have doubled that 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>There has been much reference by Deputies to a paper read by Mr. Michael Walshe, who, until recently, was head of the Dairy Section of the Agricultural Research Institute.  Mr. Walshe has made the amazing assertion that the average milk output per acre in this country could be increased sixfold. During the past five or six years our milk yield has increased.  Input to the creameries has almost doubled during the past decade and our number of suppliers, while it has varied, has averaged usually about 100,000. According to Mr. Walshe he could and presumably should increase our cow population from the present 1.8 million to 5 million, our in-calf heifers could be increased from the present figure of more than 200,000 to 1 million and our beef cattle for sale could be increased from the present figure of more than 1 million to 3.5 million.  He estimates that that would give us a potential output of £1,500 million. These prospects are exciting and would suggest an industry that not alone is capable of powerful economic expansion but which is capable also of increasing employment and not a falling employment rate as at present.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there has been a decline in the numbers engaged in agriculture but such a decline has been <Col N="1776" /> experienced in every other country in the world.  Some years ago 38 per cent of our population was engaged in agriculture, ten years ago it was 35 per cent, now the figure is 28 per cent and still very much higher than any of the Common Market or other applicant countries and very much higher also than Britain where the figure is 3 per per cent.  However, that does not necessarily mean that the pattern which has obtained in other countries should obtain here because the position would be entirely different.  Essentially, we would be a food producing country as we have been up to now and to my mind there is a tremendous future for development in the marketing and in the processing of agricultural produce. Scientific research in the future will modify tremendously the processing of food and the multiplicity of arrangements by which food may be presented. This is a field which is open to us so long as we have the imagination, the enthusiasm and the energy to enter into it.  If it is approached on these lines, we need not necessarily be faced with a continuing decline in the number of people engaged in agriculture because although the actual number in the production line may decrease, there will be compensatory increases in the paraagricultural activities.</P>
    <P>The head of the NFA, Mr. Maher, who is a neighbour of mine, suggested the other day that a capital input of £200 million during the next five years was desirable.  Mr. Walshe's figure was £100 million over a ten-year period and a further suggestion was made that by diversion of some of our heifer population, we could get increased cattle production by introducing the slaughtering of heifers after one calf.  I do not know exactly what is our cattle birthrate but if we assume that there is a female birth rate of 700,000 per year we have ample room to follow that line of thinking and divert a small percentage of our cattle so as to increase within a year or two or over a period of years our cattle population.  We have a high percentage of grassland here, a high percentage of cattle and a high percentage of cows in proportion to our population, far in excess of that in other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> Furthermore, as everybody knows, our rainfall and our climate, our wintering conditions, are such as to give us a great advantage in grass production and grass is the cheapest food that can be got.  Unless some other highly sophisticated scientific method evolves for feeding cattle it looks as if our grass will give us an economic advantage over any other form of feeding so far devised.</P>
    <P>The Government have promised us a White Paper and I am hopeful that it will endeavour to answer many of the points that have not yet been answered in this debate.  I am particularly interested in three points.  We have heard much comment here in respect of our sovereignty and our independence during the debate on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I am concerned in this debate with preserving for our own people as much of our natural resources as we can.  I recognise that in the EEC a fundamental thing is non-discrimination. We accept that.  We have to accept it.  However, there are three outstanding points about which many people are still unhappy.  One is the purchase of land by non-Irish persons. This is a thing that touches the mind of every Irishman very quickly.  Being a poor country our people are not in a position to buy land against well-heeled foreigners, many of whom have made their money at other more lucrative disciplines.</P>
    <P>The second point is the control of our dairy and meat processing industry. We have had some indications already along these lines and the answer the Minister will give me, I am sure, is that the farming organisations should get together, pool their resources and control the processing and distribution, in so far as they can, of their own produce and if they fail in that, as they say in the German, &ldquo;Es gibt Leute, die niemand helfen kann&rdquo;, there are people whom nobody can help.  I still would like some reassurance on this point.  I shall not emphasise it because we already have an indication that on the question of our processing industry which will, I believe, become a bigger industry in the future, we would like to take all steps possible at this stage and not <Col N="1778" /> later when it will be clearly discriminatory and maybe not possible to see, in so far as we can ensure it, that this developmental work will remain in Irish hands.  The same, of course, applies to the processing of fruit and vegetables.  It is not as important as the other but it still exists and there is the possibility of merger controls of such processing activities.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer and not being a lawyer one is always suspicious of lawyers and how they can manipulate things.  I tabled a Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is not in any way responsible for this.  It was:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce what records are kept of the ownership by non-nationals of the share capital of Irish companies, industrial concerns and property.</P>
    <P>That question is fundamental to the points I have been discussing, to our anxiety to preserve for our own people as much grasp as possible of our resources.  It is little good to get political freedom if on the morrow we find out that our resources have passed into the hands of foreign capitalists. The reply he gave me was as follows:</P>
    <P>Records are kept in the Companies Office of the shareholders of registered companies including industrial concerns registered as companies but these do not disclose the nationality of shareholders other than directors.  Records of ownership of property in the sense of real estate are not kept in my Department. As regards industrial property, that is patents and registered trade marks and designs, records are kept in the Patents Office of the ownership and nationality of each Irish patent, registered trade mark and registered design.</P>
    <P>That is an unsatisfactory answer but I did gather, in the course of supplementaries, that we did not have much information along these lines.  Then on the question of mergers, takeovers, outside company control of our resources we are apparently in a very uninformed position.</P>

      <P>It might be a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in regard to the question of processing plants.</P>
      <P>Our dairying industry in the past decade has had its ups and downs.  Our cow population has increased.  It is standing now at 1.8 million and our creamery intake has nearly doubled. It has gone from about 250 million gallons a decade ago to over 500 million now.  Unfortunately, we had to pay year after year an increasing amount of money to subsidise the end product of our milk.  We have been exporting butter all over the world and we have had difficulty with the British market and, despite the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, they have welshed on us three times.</P>
      <P>I wish at this stage to pay a tribute to the work of Bord Bainne.  They have done an excellent job.  It is to be regretted that some sort of central marketing organisation of that nature was not begun many years ago.  We have been very immature in our marketing methods.  We have adopted the most extraordinary system of sending out butter from every second creamery throughout the country under the name of the creamery, without having a controlled and established product. Bord Bainne has rectified that for us. The product is good and has met with increasing success on the British market, so much so that our butter prices are now superior to those of New Zealand and Australia in the British market and sometimes higher even than for British products.  Kerrygold is now selling at quite a high price, higher than we have ever secured for butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have been unable to get a proper quota for butter.  Our basic butter quota was fixed in 1965 at 23,000 tons under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  It was subsequently advanced to 26,000 tons. These quotas are usually fixed on 1st April.  Our quota of 30,000 tons for last year was increased to 33,000 tons in 1971-72 and at the same time our <Col N="1780" /> quota for cheddar cheese was advanced from 17,500 tons to 20,000 tons for 1971-72.</P>
    <P>There are 20 different countries supplying butter to the United Kingdom, the most important being New Zealand whose quota has been running around a figure of 160,000 or 170,000 tons&mdash;an extraordinary figure compared with our miserable quota.  The quota for Denmark is 83,000 tons, for Australia, 66,000 tons, for The Netherlands, 12,000 tons.  The extraordinary part of this is that as a buyer of English manufactured goods Denmark is practically no better than we are.  Yet she was able to secure that magnificent quota.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we have been trying to sell butter to 50 different countries.  We have been selling it in practically every country at a loss. The glut of dairy produce on the world market and the inability of many of the countries to which we export our butter, for instance, Morocco and places like that, to give more than ninepence a pound has raised the problem for us of having to subsidise so heavily our agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>In two respects the position has improved. Up to recently there was a mountain of butter on the Continent and the cow slaughter policy introduced by Mansholt, in which he got rid of a huge number of cows and put others out of milk production, and the policy of putting a lot of land out of agricultural production generally and cutting down the number of farmers, plus the dry summer which reduced dairy production in New Zealand has placed us in the position that now we are able to sell all the milk and all the butter we can produce.  Indeed, the quota which was to be introduced as regards butter last April was never implemented and since 1st September the agreement we have with regard to cheddar cheese has ceased to be operative.  That, of course, improves our prospects considerably.</P>
    <P>The figures produced for us in the Department of Agriculture booklet 12 months ago as to the degree of sufficiency in the Common Market will have to be adjusted.  The degree of sufficiency in dairy produce is now considerably <Col N="1781" /> reduced.  Taking that with the agreement entered into with New Zealand as regards her butter supply to Britain should improve the outlook for our dairy position considerably.  One can never foretell the future.  One cannot guarantee that a situation such as existed a couple of years ago might not arise again but under controlled marketing conditions one would expect that it should not occur and a more rational approach to the production of milk, which we could probably insist on when we are a member of the Common Market, would certainly improve our position and make it more guaranteed.</P>
    <P>The EEC farmers produce a substantial amount of dairy produce.  That constitutes about 25 per cent of the EEC farmers' income and back in 1965 the EEC itself was exporting a large amount of dairy products.  The position has been considerably improved by the fall in dairy production in the Common Market and, with our advent to it, the self-sufficiency of the Ten will be improved because Britain is the largest butter importer in the world. The importance of the United Kingdom as an importer of dairy produce may be judged on the figures I shall now give the House.  In the year 1968 total world imports of butter were £528 million and total imports of cheese were £316 million.  Of that total the United Kingdom imported £439 million, 83 per cent, and, in the case of cheese, she imported £177 million, 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is a notion in some quarters that our agricultural exports might become directed towards the Continent after some years.  I doubt that.  I believe our agricultural exports will still largely remain in Britain.  The importance of the British market as distinct from the Common Market and our position in 1970, for example, in regard to exports shows a striking difference.  I have examined our export figures and, for 1970, our livestock exports to the United Kingdom totalled £50 million and our meat produce totalled £46 million. Exports of livestock to the EEC were £1 million and meat exports were £7 million.  In dairy products we exported to the United Kingdom £20 million worth and to the EEC £1 million.  We <Col N="1782" /> exported £2 million worth of fish to the United Kingdom and £1.5 million worth to the Common Market.  We exported £2 million worth of cereals to the United Kingdom.  For 1970 our agricultural exports to the United Kingdom totalled £120 million while our exports to the EEC came to only £10 million.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of somewhere to which to export our agricultural produce our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Common Market has been truly lamentable.  The levy system they operate virtually excludes us.  If there is any question as to whether or not we should join the EEC, if we had to face a tariff wall like that with our exports into Britain, it would appear as if we would occupy an important position.</P>
    <P>There are some questions to which I should like to get answers from the Minister.  If I put them down as Parliamentary Questions I may get an answer tomorrow or next week.  I have dealt with aids to agriculture, £105 million per year.  I went over these aids item by item and I asked for information as to which of these aids will still be with us and which will we still be able to implement on entering the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Have the Government in contemplation any Irish land policy which could be introduced now and which would help us in the future to hold as much Irish land as possible for Irish people?  It should be possible to formulate some kind of land policy which could be introduced now at a time when it would not appear to be discriminatory.  The introduction of such a policy at a later stage would be regarded as discriminatory.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Government and its economic advisers to devise some policy which would be an improvement on the present policy and which would give our people some reassurance.  I am told that this question of land is not regarded in Brussels as important.  The idea seems to be that it just will not arise.  In the minds of the Irish, particularly the farming community, this thought is always at the back of their minds because they have seen wealthy people, recently a millionaire, buying up large tracts of land.  This causes <Col N="1783" /> our own people concern and very naturally so.</P>
    <P>What control will we have in the Common Market over the purchase of agricultural stock?  Are we open to the risk of being depleted of stock because of Continental buyers paying higher prices than our farmers will be able to pay?  This may not present a problem, but the Minister may like to comment on it when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to either the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the Minister for Foreign Affairs on quota restrictions.  I understand quota restrictions in regard to butter, cheese and sugar will disappear on our entry to the EEC but that the position of bacon is under negotiation.  Bacon comes under the common agricultural policy and I should like to know why bacon is under negotiation.  Bacon and eggs do not form part of the continental breakfast but when the Minister is replying I would like him to state why bacon occupies a special position.  Is the abolition of quota restrictions on accession to the EEC limited to items for which there is a common agricultural policy?</P>
    <P>Since 1965 the Land Commission have operated an agricultural structural policy which in some ways resembles the Mansholt Plan.  It provides capital and pensions for those who want to retire from farming but uneconomic holders and small farmers have not availed of it to any appreciable extent.  This may be because the money side of it is not big enough, but a more probable reason is that these people have nowhere else to go and in the environment in which they find themselves there is no alternative source of employment.</P>
    <P>This question of structural reform is a very important one for us and in my view it may eventually prove to be more important and more useful to us than the price advantages which we will gain in the Common Market.  Will we be allowed to continue this policy under Common Market conditions? Will we be allowed to utilise this policy or some extension of it to supplement what we can get under the regional policy which is financed largely from the agricultural fund on <Col N="1784" /> the Continent?  I presume regional policies will largely be framed by local governments at local level, but when the Minister is replying I would like him to tell us if there will be any difficulties in this direction.  A council to administer the regional policy has been established but the planning and design of regional policy will largely be left to local initiative.  The function of the Council will be to co-ordinate and supervise the regional policies as worked in different areas.</P>
    <P>Meat exports to the US, mainly of boneless beef, amount to £16 million a year.  In view of the present monetary policy of the US what is the future for these exports?  Can the Minister also state what effects the common external tariff and animal health agreements will have on these exports? I know the animal health agreements have not yet been clarified but I understand if we depart from the rigid criteria which we observe here as regards animal health we might jeopardise this market in the US.  Apart from animal health considerations am I right in assuming that entry to the Common Market with its common external tariff may mean this market will be put in considerable risk to us?</P>
    <P>Our recent experience with sheep has been anything but a success.  Judging from the booklet published by the Department of Agriculture on the Common Market the possibilities for sheep and mutton on the Continent seem to be good.  There is no common agricultural policy for that product in the Common Market but it will apparently vary and keep pace with the price obtaining on the open market. Mutton is not consumed very much on the Continent and it is not produced there.  I understand that Britain consumes 24 pounds <i>per capita</i> per year the same as ourselves, and France consumes 6 pounds.  We have had to try and sell our sheep against a levy which varies from 15 to 20 per cent. and in view of the low production of sheep on the Continent there was hope that there would be a future for sheep production.  That may still well be so but our production figures and our exports have been extremely unsatisfactory. In respect of the British market, mutton and lamb seem to have <Col N="1785" /> gone the same way as bacon and pork. In 1970 in fresh, chilled and frozen mutton and lamb we produced 39,000 tons and all we exported to the UK was 1,787 tons, the worst figure ever. Not only that, but the British seem to have displaced us from whatever chance we previously had of getting into the continental market.</P>
    <P>As far as I can deduce from the figures, our entire exports of sheep, lambs, mutton and wool in 1969 were worth £8.9 million and in 1970, £7.1 million.  I have already given the figures for quantities but in terms of cash our exports to the UK of mutton and lamb were worth £630,000.  These are very distressing figures and as a consequence our sheep population has remained almost stationary being four million, four million and four million in 1969, 1970 and 1971.  Yet we are spending a considerable amount of money helping the sheep industry.  Our sheep subsidy scheme is costing £1,750,000 and we have beef, mutton and lamb export aids also.  This is a rather distressing picture.  I believe the position has improved recently as regards prices but in general for the past year or 18 months the position of the sheep and mutton industry generally has been extremely unsatisfactory.  I do not know whether the Department or those who compile views on our prospects for lamb in the Common Market are still hopeful: there may still be a future for the sheep industry but I should like to hear the Minister's views.  Does he regard this as merely a temporary setback?  Does he think there are still good prospects for sheep and mutton under Common Market conditions?</P>
    <P>In regard to pigs, unlike the prospects for dairying and beef, we have a rather unsatisfactory picture.  Our factory input is about 2,000,000 pigs and to process that number we have 34 or 35 factories.  Northern Ireland, with only half our population, produces the same number of pigs and they have a much smaller acreage&mdash; about one quarter, I suppose&mdash;and less than half the number of factories.  The question of over-production potential here has been with us for a considerable time and, like the dairying industry, it seems that <Col N="1786" /> while people have talked of rationalisation and having fewer and more efficient units, we do not seem to be making the necessary progress.  On the face of it, it seems that if we need 34 or 35 factories to handle 2,000,000 pigs and if in the North they can do it with 12 or 13 factories&mdash;I do not know the precise figures but it is around that&mdash;it seems we are going wrong somewhere.</P>
    <P>I understand there has been criticism of our factory efforts in regard to bacon, ham and pork products. Even as late as last autumn I believe considerable pressure was being exerted from British sources urging us to upgrade our factory conditions.  Again, the Minister may be able to enlighten me on this.  I understand that at that time the suggestion was made that some of our factories should be declared redundant and a subsidy of £3 or £4 per pig based on the 1970 figures paid to redundant factories. I do not know what steps have been taken on these lines and I should like the Minister to deal with that when replying.  It appears that bacon factories as such, as an investment proposition, will become less fashionable in the near future, if that is not already the position.  This is of importance to us because, as several Deputies have stressed, the production of pigs is the small farmer's industry, apart from the large production units that have been established in certain parts of the country.  In the past this industry has been carried on by small farmers in the south and west.</P>
    <P>In the next year or two we shall face stiff competition from the nine countries in the EEC.  In particular, there will be keen competition from Denmark and Great Britain with regard to our bacon industry.  The emphasis in the EEC is on pork rather than bacon, but Germany is a substantial producer of pork.  The prices obtaining will be somewhat better but I understand that the price of barley will rise so that one will balance against the other.  Apparently those people who are in the best position to judge this matter are doubtful how we will fare under Common Market conditions with regard to pig production. <Col N="1787" /> Pig production has always been a mercurial type of market.  It has been the history of this sector that no sooner do farmers engage in this industry on a large scale than the price drops.  While this can be stated about many other agricultural products, it is particularly applicable to pig production.  The year 1970 was not particularly good for this country with regard to bacon or pork. Our production of bacon and ham in 1970 was 104,000 tons.  We exported to the United Kingdom&mdash;our main market&mdash;27,000 tons.  We produced 37,000 tons of pork; we exported 7,000 tons.  These are not good figures.  This sector of the industry is highly competitive and it will require a tremendous amount of effort to re-establish ourselves in this market.  It is an industry which is extremely useful to farmers in certain parts of the country, not excluding Limerick.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what will be the future position of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  It may well be that boards such as the Pigs and Bacon Commission, the Meat Marketing Board, Bord na gCapall and An Bord Bainne, which occupy a monopoly position, may be deemed to be incompatible with EEC membership. The Minister in his speech stated:</P>
    <P>As regards marketing, the monopoly export position which An Bord Bainne now enjoys is not in conformity with EEC regulations.  Under EEC the maximum co-operation in processing and marketing between the dairy co-operatives will be essential for success.  Pigmeat exports which are at present centralised through the Pigs and Bacon Commission will face a similar situation. Ireland is not a big country and our entire exports of dairy products or pigmeat are not large by world standards.  It will certainly not be in our interest to have these exports handled by individual exporters selling relatively small quantities with variations in quality and seasonal irregularity in supplies.  In our circumstances, co-ordinated exporting by central agencies using modern techniques will be indispensable.  I <Col N="1788" /> am glad that, in the case of dairy products, the farmers' organisations and others concerned are, in fact, actively considering the type of marketing arrangements which they should have in EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not know what conclusions the farmers' organisations may come to, but I agree with the Minister that, with our small output, we cannot run the risk of having fragmentation of our exporting agencies.  That is one of the reasons it might be undesirable that foreign combines or mergers could get control of our processing units.</P>
    <P>We have the example of An Bord Bainne as a central marketing organisation producing a standard product in the face of difficult circumstances.  A few years ago we were accused of dumping on the British market although at that time An Bord Bainne were getting a guaranteed price.  However, the National Farmers' Union in Britain appealed to the British Board of Trade; they did their utmost to accuse us of dumping and put obstacles in the way of exports.  I am not quite sure, but I think this was subsequent to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  That problem was resolved and now we cannot supply what they want in England because we are in a sellers' market.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give help to our exports.  There was a time in a less sophisticated age when this country was one of the largest butter exporters in Europe.  The famous Cork Butter Market was operating; much of our butter was made under rather primitive conditions and was not produced in creameries.  Much of the heavily salted butter was exported from the Cork Butter Market.  One of the biggest exporters were in Cashel and they sent their products to the London market.</P>
    <P>However, we appear to have fallen on somewhat evil times.  One would have thought that with the establishment of creameries the position would have improved but we did not keep up-to-date with our marketing conditions. In that respect the co-operative movement seems to have failed because they did not realise they should have some kind of central organisation to <Col N="1789" /> market their products.  In the industrial field, if you buy a standard product from any worthwhile manufacturer and it goes wrong, you contact him and he immediately sees that it is rectified. Exactly the same conditions must apply to agricultural produce and will increasingly apply to agricultural production. It is quite senseless for us as a people to think that we can stand still and yet hope to obtain a market.  We are moving into a highly competitive field, a highly competitive world, and unless our standards, and particularly our hygienic standards, and the quality of our produce are kept up to competitive level with the produce of every other country, nobody will buy our produce merely because we are Irish.</P>
    <P>We are on the fringe of a big market but we will have to produce a quality product to sell.  We had a marketing organisation apart from the agricultural organisations, a butter board, for a while.  That, too, did not evolve a standard product, and while the Danes were getting a grip on the British market, we here failed to live up to modern commercial demands. This is one of the reasons why we find, and did find, that when we looked later for a quota on the British market, based on our exports for previous years, which had fallen down, we were unable to get a realistic quota.</P>
    <P>When I am on this question of over-production, over-processing, equipment, I might say that I put down a question to the Minister some time ago with regard to the number of creameries.  I think that everybody accepts now that rationalisation is something we must face up to but rationalisation of our creameries has been there for a long time.  I remember calling on the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society about 12 years ago and at that time they had prepared a plan for the rationalisation of our creameries, and rationalisation means, in effect, that you shut down some of them.  Let us be blunt about it.  This has been with us all these years, and I feel that I am justified in taking successive Minsters for Agriculture and Fisheries to task for not taking this matter more seriously.</P>
    <P>We applied to enter the Common Market first in 1963 and we knew then <Col N="1790" /> that rationalisation was necessary.  It is not a story of today or yesterday, but we now find ourselves, on the eve of entering the Common Market, with a Minister who apparently is making a first move towards rationalisation by the introduction of legislation here which permits the vote to be reduced from 75 per cent to a simple majority. That legislation could have been introduced in 1960 as well as in 1970, and I believe that had it been done here and had sufficient impetus come from the various Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries, our agricultural position, our competitiveness, our potential competitiveness, would now be considerably better in the dairy industry than it is.</P>
    <P>One other matter on which I want to say a few words is the question of regional development.  Regional development, as I said already, probably may ultimately be more important to us than the price improvements which we may expect to get in Common Market conditions.  These price improvements may not stay with us.  Britain is a country accustomed to a cheap food policy.  She produces half her own food and imports the other half.  At one time she imported more than half.  Her market is a world food dump and she imports that food at world prices.  She gives it to her people at world prices and her farmers will not produce at world prices, so she subsidises her own farmers from the Exchequer.  She hopes to save £130 million&mdash;to save her Exchequer&mdash;by movement into the Common Market but the housewife will have to pay out of her pocket. That is the contrast with the continental system where the people pay, and have been paying, a realistic price for food.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much British influence may determine future policy on the Continent.  She has had generations of cheap food and it will be difficult to get her thinking away from that.  Her cheap food made her a competitive nation and she was able to produce manufactured goods, because, apart from coal, Britain is an overcrowded island of 50 million people with no resources except her own brains and industry.  She imported food from the four corners of the <Col N="1791" /> earth, became a manufacturing country and exported to the four corners of the earth.  The cheaper she could make the food for her people, the more competitive she was, and, of course, that policy was difficult to fight, and in ordinary circumstances could never have been offset because you had the two most powerful forces, the industrialists and the workers, the ordinary rank and file consumer for whom food is ordinarily the biggest item in his household budget.</P>
    <P>This has been the pattern of British growth and British economics.  She has never had a large population engaged in agriculture.  At one time it was 5 per cent.  Now I think it is down to 3 per cent.  As a lobby and as a ballotbox force, the farming community in Britain are not important.  Therefore, Britain adopted the cheap food policy against their interest and then, in order to preserve them in the event of war or any other catastrophe, she subsidised them, particularly since the 1914-18 war.  It was shortly after that time that we left the British Commonwealth and found ourselves outside the special helps which the British agricultural community were getting from then on.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know, therefore, what impact British entry into the Common Market may have on agricultural price policy in the future.  The present agricultural price is based on the concept, as announced by Mansholt, that the man engaged in agriculture should have an income comparable to the income of a man in any other occupation in his own area. That does not obtain here.  There is a gap in our society&mdash;the economists give you different figures&mdash;of £6 or £7 per week between the average income accruing to the farmer and that accruing to his counterpart in industry or in other occupations.  The impact of British entry may in the future put a control upon advancing prices.  I know that some price increases have been given in the Common Market and I believe increases will be given next February.  I mean the prices which the farmer gets as a producer, not necessarily the retail prices which can vary from place to place and have not <Col N="1792" /> very much bearing upon the producer's price.</P>
    <P>All that is necessary is to hold prices at a standstill for one or two years and the normal inflation process will then catch up with them and the food-producing members of the Common Market society, the Ten, will find themselves in a gradually worsening position. To my mind, therefore, the second aspect of Common Market entry may be more important than the mere question of getting extra money.  Regional development <i>per se</i> is important, taken into consideration with the Mansholt plan.  We have had a type of Mansholt Plan here, operated by our Land Commission. It has not worked because people would not leave their holdings even though they were uneconomic and unproductive.  The occupants would not leave them because they could not get alternative employment.  The Mansholt Plan offers them employment and a pension.  It offers to retrain them.  It offers scholarships to their children and, most important of all, the policy is to develop industry in their own area.</P>
    <P>Regional development and the funds for regional development will be determined outside this country.  The criteria on which it is judged are an area with the highest proportion of its population engaged in agriculture and an area with the highest proportion of its population with a low <i>per capita</i> income. We qualify under both these headings. We qualify just as much as Southern Italy or the borderline between Germany and Russia qualified.  In fact, we might say that all our western seaboard and, perhaps, some other areas will qualify.  Unfortunately, we have not developed any worthwhile policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Common Market Commission will not come in here and develop a regional policy for us.  In large measure we have failed to develop a regional policy.  Yet, we knew for a long time that this was one of the most important aspects of agricultural and industrial developments on entry to the Common Market.  We have failed to evolve a regional policy.  I put down a question to the Minister for Local Government on November 4th asking him what were the salient features of our regional <Col N="1793" /> policy.  The importance of a regional policy is that 75 per cent of development funds could come from the Common Market fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave me a long reply. When you get a long reply from a Minister you know that he is in difficulties. He is trying to talk himself out of an awkward situation.  Also when you find that so many different people are interested in doing something, you can always be quite sure that it will be very badly done or not done at all. Here we have a situation in which these criteria obtain.  It is the same as in the case of pollution.  It is anybody's and everybody's business and it is eventually nobody's business.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The positive steps taken to implement these policies include:</P>
    <P> (a)  the establishment of the regional development organisations to co-ordinate the programmes for regional development in each region, their first task being the preparation of reports on the potential of each region, and the establishment of a regional unit of the Industrial Development Authority in each region,</P>
    <P>(b)  the wide range of special measures designed to favour development in the designated areas, including the county development teams backed by the special regional fund, differential aids and incentives for industry and infrastructure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;I knew that would appear&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;as well as measures in relation to agriculture,</P>
    <P>(c)  the small industries programme of the Industrial Development Authority,</P>
    <P>(d)  the programmes of Roinn na Gaeltachta and Gaeltarra Éireann, as well as the special attention given to the Gaeltacht by State Departments and public bodies generally,</P>
    <P>(e)  the encouragement of industry to site itself outside Dublin through the administration of industrial grant incentives.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee are at present considering future regional policy.  They have before them the <Col N="1794" /> reports furnished by the regional development committee and are also aware of the work being done by the Industrial Development Authority on regional industrial planning.  I expect to receive a report from the committee shortly.  I would envisage bringing recommendations on future regional policy for consideration by the Government at that stage. </P>
    <P>We are 12 months away from entry to the Common Market and we are now considering the formulation of a regional policy.  We have done bits and pieces here and there.  We have told a few people to meet in such and such a place.  We will probably have a few papers produced showing the population trends.  Somebody will analyse the census of population figures.  Graphs will be drawn and will appear on shiny paper in our post.  This will pass muster for a regional policy.</P>
    <P>Here again is a form of procrastination for which the Government must be condemned.  Apart altogether from the question of Common Market entry, surely after all these years of self-government and so much talk of saving the West there should be in existence some coherent policy which one might term a regional policy.  This answer indicates clearly that the Government do not know where they are going in so far as regional policy is concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to be excused for placing so much emphasis on this matter but because it is a matter of such extreme importance, it warrants much emphasis.  If I were asked to give an opinion on what is the most important question for us in regard to Common Market membership I would say that it is regional development. I have here a newsletter from the Confederation of Irish Industry.  This is an objective report setting out what the confederation consider to be the position in this regard.  This is not necessarily an anti-government publication. Indeed, it is entirely neutral and objective in its content and has this to say in relation to the decline in population from the most sparsely populated areas:</P>
    <P>Ireland has suffered from these problems acutely.  People and wealth have not only drained out of <Col N="1795" /> the country as a whole to Britain and other places, but within the country most development has concentrated in Dublin and one or two other big towns.  The reasons for this are a complex mixture of history, physical and geographical considerations, economics and politics.</P>
    <P>Measures taken to reverse this tendency are known collectively as regional policy.  While the Irish Government has for some years had various schemes that would come broadly under the heading of regional policy, the whole subject has taken on a new interest and urgency with our prospective entry into the EEC.  In free trade the tendency towards unbalanced development is much greater if specific action is not taken to counteract it. Despite the useful work of individual Government agencies, such as the Industrial Development Authority, the Regional Tourism Organisations and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, for example, Irish regional policy still remains in a bureaucratic tangle. The re-development problems of an area actually interlock&mdash;they do not divide up neatly into separate parcels of responsibility for each different government department. Regional policy is in danger of becoming an &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing.  Every government agency and government department wants to get into the business.  Already responsible for some aspect of regional policy are the Department of Industry and Commerce working through the Industrial Development Authority, the Department of Finance working through County Development teams, the Department of Agriculture with its responsibility for agricultural development, the Department of Lands with the same responsibility, the Tourist Board with its regional tourism organisations, the Department of Health with its Regional Health Boards, Local Authorities responsible for some important investment decisions, the Department of Local Government supervising these, Regional Development organisations trying to co-ordinate the <Col N="1796" /> whole lot... From all this, with the exception possibly of the mid-West, there is no comprehensive development plan under which all aspects of development can be co-ordinated in each area in proper phasing to each other and according to a clearly understood framework of priorities.  Instead divided responsibility and lack of co-ordination result in constant frustration in the launching and carrying through of development projects. </P>
    <P>This is the position in which we find ourselves and I would ask the Minister to give this particular problem his immediate attention.  The House will realise from what I read that everybody is in this fiddle and I am sure everybody will agree that in such a jumble it is impossible to expect any businesslike co-ordinated action.  I am not blaming the Minister nor, indeed, am I blaming the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, because the Department are only one cog in the chain of events.  If blame must be laid anywhere, it should be laid with the Department of Local Government because, possibly, regional development comes more within the ambit of that Department than any other.  On the other hand, the matter is so important that it might merit the attention of a special Department.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has been reading Devlin will have been aware of the many fanciful ideas in that Report. Among the suggestions were rearrangement of functions and new Departments and I now add my own suggestion and say that there should be some co-ordination in respect of regional development.  If the matter is not worthy of a new Department, it certainly is worthy of the attention of one specific Department with which all the other Departments would be expected to co-operate.  There is a Deputy from Limerick sitting on the Labour benches and he has been listening to what I have been reading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, what plans have we got in respect of these things apart from setting up various committees?  We are awaiting some kind of policy decision from the Government and so far nothing has materialised.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier the question of the improved prospects for our dairy industry as a result of recent world conditions for which we can claim no credit and which culminated in our being able to give an average of two pence extra to our farmers.  Our cattle production during 1970 amounted to over £100 million.  A Government estimate, based on the 1967-68 figures, was that there would be an over sufficiency of butter in the Common Market.  The figure given at that time, based upon supply and demand, was 111 per cent but in so far as Britain was the biggest butter importer in the world, these figures were revised in respect of the Ten and the figure of 111 per cent for 1967-68 became a figure of 100 per cent within the Ten. In other words, based upon consumption and production levels, judging by the 1967-68 figures, when the four applicant countries joined the Common Market we would have just a self-sufficiency. Britain, being a net importer of butter, would have changed the picture from the Common Market being an exporter or a potential exporter with a production figure of 111 per cent to having a figure of 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was based also upon the idea that non-member imports to Britain would cease.  That was, of course, merely conjectural at that stage, because nobody knew exactly what would <Col N="1798" /> happen, although everybody felt that the British would make every attempt to help New Zealand.  Eighty-five per cent of New Zealand's butter is exported to Britain and it was vital for New Zealand's economy that she should retain some grip on that market&mdash;not so vital for Australia.  It was to be expected that Britain would make every endeavour in the negotiations to secure some phasing out of her arrangements with New Zealand.  These figures were based upon the idea that there would be no non-member imports into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>In a similar way, cheese, which was estimated as being an over-produced commodity in the Six, was estimated again to be just self-sufficient in the Ten, the figure here being about 103 per cent and with the advent of Britain &mdash;which was of course an importer of cheese also&mdash;to the Common Market the position was reduced to 100 per cent.  That position has altered because certain developments took place which were not anticipated.  It was anticipated, for example, that New Zealand would secure some portion of the market but what was not anticipated was that New Zealand supplies would fall pretty steeply due to the weather conditions of recent times, the dry weather and the fall in the production of milk in New Zealand.  Another matter was that the position of self-sufficiency anticipated in Common Market conditions or over-sufficiency, which has obtained prior to the arrival of the four into the Common Market, that position was upset by the cow slaughter scheme and there has been a decline of dairy products within the EEC.  Everybody is aware that there was what is called the mountain of butter in the EEC.  At that stage it was most difficult for us to sell our butter in any market.  It was that position on the Continent and the difficulty of the British market which forced us to seek markets in 50 different countries.  That was what forced us to try to establish processing plants even as far away as the Philippines, to look for markets in Algiers, Morocco, the Canary Islands, Japan.  These markets were expensive as regards transport.  The prices we got were abominably low.  Ninepence was the price we obtained for a substantial <Col N="1799" /> amount at one stage that we exported to Morocco.  Now that position has altered and the target price for milk has increased to 20 new pence. That was a 6 per cent increase.  There is another increase of 4 per cent promised next April.  These are reasonable increases and will improve our prospects and make the prospects for milk still more attractive under Common Market conditions.  It means, according to one economist who has worked on these figures, that if the common agricultural price level is applied in six equal steps over the transitional five-year period, 1973-1978 it is estimated that the price of milk should be increased.</P>

      <P>This means that under our phased entry into the Common Market over six equal steps a price rise of 1.2p. can be expected and that if we take the Irish price of creamery milk for 1970 at, say, 11p per gallon, we can expect a substantial improvement in <Col N="1800" /> agricultural prices during the phasing-in period into the Common Market.</P>
      <P>There is a common misconception which has received wide acceptance, I fear, that the Mansholt proposals and the future for our dairy industry under Common Market conditions will mean the wiping out of the small farmer.  In point of fact, of course, any farmer, big or small, will be in receipt of the same improved conditions under the common marketing framework.  To be sure, under those circumstances, as of now, the inefficient farmer will still be inefficient and will not be able to secure the advantages which improved marketing conditions will secure for him. The Mansholt ideas have been varied considerably from time to time.  It is not realised that the Council of Ministers did not agree with the original Mansholt Plan.  The original concept was a radical concept in which one quarter of a million cows were slaughtered and another quarter of a million were put out of commercial milk production.  That was carried out in 1969 under a system by which approximately £80 was given out for every cow slaughtered but, last March, a new approach was made as regards the Mansholt proposals.  Mansholt found the original proposals did not find favour with Common Market Ministers and he had to alter them radically.  In the Government's publication there is a synopsis or summary of the main features of the Mansholt Plan as we now know it, not the original Mansholt Plan, which was a very radical document and which may have been necessary and certainly was good for this country because of the mountain of butter that had accumulated and the over-production there was corrected by radical means; but it did make it possible for us and for our Minister the other day to offer an increased price for milk to our farmers.</P>
      <P>The Mansholt Plan of 1968-69, the cattle slaughter plan, may seem remote to Irish eyes and maybe the tie-up with that and the 2p a gallon they will be getting in the coming year may seem remote, but they are closely related. The one led to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent Mansholt proposals are <Col N="1801" /> quite reasonable and I do not think that our farming community should feel in any way nervous about what is proposed in these matters.  It mainly deals with what we have had in operation here already except that we did not have a regional policy to go with it and it is by virtue of having alternative employment in their own area for the people who are displaced on the land, and having the necessary funds to do that, that is the basis of the regional policy which is so important for us in the next few years.  It is on that basis that I am criticising Government action as being too dilatory, too late, in formulating positive regional proposals.</P>

    <P>(i)  Single shares are held by each of the Directors of the Company and by the Secretaries of the Departments of Transport and Power, Finance, and Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>(ii)  On 1st April, 1969, Aer Rianta assumed responsibility for the managment of Shannon and Cork Airports on the same basis as the Company manages Dublin Airport as the agent of the Minister for Transport and Power.  The surplus earned on the management of the airports is surrendered annually to the Minister.  The surplus is an operating surplus and is not related to the capital asset represented by the airports which are owned by the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>

    <P>There are adequate tangible assets to repay the capital employed and depreciation provisions.</P>
    <P>NOTE (i): The rate of return reflects the proportion of the Board's capital requirements financed from internal resources.  It also reflects the effec t of the rural subsidy, the varying rates of interest payable and the amortisation, out of revenue, of loan capital during the duration of the loan.  The overriding consideration is that, by Section 21 of t of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, the Board's revenue in each year must be sufficient and only sufficient (as nearly as maybe) to pay all outgoings, including interest and sinking fund payments.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as set out in the table below.  It is assumed that the question relates to trading companies only, and that by &ldquo;capital employed&rdquo; the Deputy means the total of share and loan capital.  Whether the tangible assets of a company are sufficient to repay the total of capital and depreciation is not regarded as meaningful.</P>

    <P>NOTES: <i>(a)</i> State and local authority assistance for local authority houses&mdash;other than grants for improvements to these houses&mdash;is in the form of contributions towards loan charges and losses borne on the rates and is included at (5) above.  The expenditure of £3,000 shown for local authority houses at (1) represents grants for improvements to these houses.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> Information on the value of income tax relief on mortgage interest is not available.  While details of the cost of rates remission on new, and reconstructed dwellings are not available it is estimated that the cost would be of the order of £4 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i> The figure for subsidies towards loan charges on local authority housing comprises £4.24 million in subsidy payments by the Department of Local Government and £5.0 million in losses borne on the rates.</P>
    <P>2.  Payment of housing subsidy</P>
    <P>At present, housing subsidies are paid on the basis of a percentage contribution to loan charges subject to prescribed limits of capital cost and to the loss to the housing authority arising on a particular scheme.</P>
    <P>Subsidy is calculated in relation to each housing scheme and in the case of any scheme where the loss for a particular <Col N="1706" /> year is less than the maximum amount of subsidy payable, the subsidy actually paid is equivalent to the amount of the loss.  As and from 1965-66 the procedure was modified to allow the maximum amount of subsidy to be paid for any scheme financed by a loan sanctioned in the case of urban housing authorities before 1st May, 1953 and in the case of rural housing authorities before 1st April, 1960.  I do not propose to make any additional modification to the procedure for payment of subsidy on the basis suggested by the Deputy.</P>
