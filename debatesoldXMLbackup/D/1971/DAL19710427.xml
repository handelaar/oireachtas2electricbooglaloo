    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make immediate representations to the British Government to ensure that searches for arms in Northern Ireland, and in particular in Belfast city, are carried out in an impartial manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The views of the Government on the need for impartiality in arms searches in the North and on allied matters are well known to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>If the views of the Government are so well known, could the Taoiseach even now tell the people of the country what are those views? Surely the Taoiseach is aware that there is selective justice in Northern Ireland, just as we have here?  Raids are being carried out at all hours on the homes of the minority, doors are broken down and people are being roused from their beds.  Does the Taoiseach intend to stand idly by while all this is happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made continuous representations on these matters. I should like to refer the Deputy to a public statement I made in February, adverting specifically to this fact. Before and since then we have continued to make our views known to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach state if he has had any results from <Col N="474" /> this?  Surely the Taoiseach is aware that last week a man was sentenced to one year in jail because he shouted &ldquo;Up the IRA&rdquo;?  People who were shouting &ldquo;To hell with the Pope&rdquo; and &ldquo;Up the UVF&rdquo;, <i>et cetera</i> were not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards searches for arms, has the Taoiseach now the zeal of a convert?  Can he see nothing wrong with the British Government or the actions of the British Army in Belfast at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as there are discriminatory practices in this matter or in any other way, it will be our continuous duty and our purpose to ensure that these are eliminated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no formal communication from the Northern Ireland Government but, as Deputies will be aware from the recent meeting in Dublin between senior officials, there is no barrier to, or difficulty about, informal communications at various levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if a precedent was created by the Minister for Finance in appearing on the RTE programme <i>7 Days</i> on 13th April, 1971, just prior to the Budget; and if he is in favour of this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance was invited by Radio Telefís Éireann to discuss on the <i>7 Days</i> television programme on the 13th April, 1971, referred to by the Deputy, a wide range of subjects relating generally to the national economy.</P>
      <P>It has been customary for members of the Government to take part in discussions on television on subjects of national economic interest in the period leading up to the Budget and I am in favour of their so doing in order to promote a wider understanding of these questions in the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The occasion referred to in the question did not create a precedent.  I think about three or four years ago a former Minister for Finance had the same type of interview. The Taoiseach will probably remember that he said on that occasion that indirect taxation fell heaviest on the poor; he proceeded two days afterwards to salt them further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Finance a short time prior to a Budget cannot answer frankly and truthfully questions put to him?  Indeed, he may give away more by the questions he refuses to answer rather than the questions he answers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there has been delay in the publication of the report of the working party on drug abuse.  I indicated in a reply to a question by Deputy Timmons on 30th March, 1971, that it was being examined in my Department.  Since then arrangements for publication have been in train and these are now well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not admit that the drug problem is going from bad to worse and that many people think that Nero is fiddling while Rome is burning?  Does he not think it is time that something definite was done to face up to this growing menace to our community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already taken action.  It would take too long to give the Deputy the details which have already been given in the House of the <Col N="478" /> action we have taken in dealing with drug abuse.  This report was examined from the first moment we had it in our hands.  There was no delay in the publication of the report.  The total length of time which has elapsed since I got it is about two months so I am not aware of any great delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The number of fever hospital beds in the Dublin area in 1965 and 1968 was 435.  In 1970, the smallpox unit of 24 beds attached to Vergemount Hospital, Clonskeagh, was converted for use as a psychiatric unit, thus reducing the total fever bed complement to 411.  The situation in 1971 is that a further reduction to 385 beds has been brought about by the use of a 26 bed ward in Cherry Orchard for the accommodation of student nurses.</P>
      <P>However, a new ten bed smallpox unit is in course of construction at Cherry Orchard Hospital and the bed complement will be added to by this number in the near future bringing it to 395.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that with the increase in the population in Dublin, and particularly the increase in the number of children in the Dublin area, it is unusual to see the complement of beds decreasing rather than increasing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the answer to that is given in reply to another question, as the Deputy knows.  The bed occupancy of these hospitals is not such as would give cause for alarm that there should be a slight reduction in bed complement in 1970.  For Cherry Orchard bed occupancy was 77 per cent and for Vergemount it was 77.8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the increased number of young families living in the northern suburbs of Dublin city, he will consider transferring one of the two fever hospitals from the south city to the Ballymun/Finglas district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="481" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of accommodation for infectious diseases cases in the Dublin area is adequate and, therefore, any question of new accommodation, such as suggested by the Deputy, would only arise as a matter of convenience to relatives of patients. Fortunately, the numbers of infectious diseases cases arising among children have declined and at present infectious diseases hospitals are utilised to a large extent for minor communicable diseases.  The long-term concept suggested in the FitzGerald Report is that major infectious diseases should be catered for in special isolation units attached to general hospitals, and it would be entirely contrary to this concept that a new hospital catering for infectious diseases should be set up on the north side of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that due to the vast expansion in the population in the northern suburbs of Dublin, and the numbers of families with young children, the inconvenience caused in getting to the other side of the city, not only to the patients but also to the parents who want to visit and keep in contact with the children, is undesirable and that there is a definite need for a fever hospital on the north side of the city?</P>

      <P>I understand that the patient concerned was discharged from the hospital on 4th April, 1971, following a normal confinement.  She was seen on eight occasions for ante-natal examination prior to the confinement which was normal in every way.  I appreciate the concern which prompted the Deputy to raise a question about the sudden and tragic loss of the mother of a large family but my advice is that it is impossible to foresee the condition which caused death.</P>

      <P>Pensioners who retired before 1st April, 1963, and who were not included in the recommendations of the Commission on CIE Pensions and Sickness Benefit Payments have, at the request of the Government, been granted by CIE a number of <i>ex gratia</i> increases in their pensions, most recently an increase of 50p per week with effect from 1st March, 1970. The minimum total income of married pre-April, 1963, pensioners now amounts to £10.25 a week.</P>
      <P>As recommended by the commission, pensions payable since 1st April, 1963, are intended, together with social welfare benefits, to provide a total income of about two-thirds of retiring wages.  Thus in the case of a man over 70 years the minimum income is £10.67½ while the maximum in a similar case is £13.17½.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the general secretary of the association on 24th March, 1971, in reply to his letter of 11th March and explained the position fully.  The liabilities of the CIE wages grade pensions fund greatly exceed the amounts standing to the credit of the schemes. The financial position of CIE is such as to exclude any further increases in pensions unless the members of the schemes agree to pay increased contributions to cover the extra costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I take it the Minister is aware that many old people who would be in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions have near relatives, sons and daughters, married in England who would be very glad to take them over there but the old people are not prepared to go and leave their pensions behind?  The result is they have to live in the loneliness of isolation or be institutionalised. If the Minister accepts that as a fact, would he not think it would be a kind and humane thing to give them the pensions in England for the few years they have to live?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are permitted 13 weeks absence under existing legislation, but to extend it further for a scheme that is subject to a means test has obvious difficulties.  Furthermore, if the facility were being extended to permit them to reside in England, it must be borne in mind that many of them have relatives in the United States as well and that a wider field would have to be considered.</P>

      <P>With regard to parts (a) to (c) of the question I would point out that balance of payments data are available only on a calendar year basis.  In the <i>Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971</i> which was published today the following information is given for 1970:</P>
      <P>(a) merchandise imports totalled £669 million and merchandise exports totalled £460 million.</P>
      <P>(b) the adverse trade balance was £209 million.</P>
      <P>(c) the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments was £62 million.</P>
      <P>In answer to part (d) of the question I would refer the Deputies to the <i>Review of 1970 and Outlook for 1971,</i> page 26, paragraph 66, which indicates that the balance of payments deficit on current account in 1971 is expected to be of a similar order to last year's deficit but, when imports of ships and aircraft are excluded, an improvement in the underlying trend in the balance of payments is anticipated.  I will deal with the more detailed aspects of economic policy in my Budget speech.</P>

There is a slight misprint in the question which should read &ldquo;dispensary doctor or junior hospital doctor&rdquo;.  It is a fact that a dispensary doctor does not receive tax allowance for either his motor car or his telephone.  This is an old regulation which is possibly out of date.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, which provides for tax exemption of certain earnings of writers, composers and artists.  It is provided that, for the purposes of the section, the Revenue Commissioners may consult with any person or body of persons who may be of assistance to them in determining whether an individual has produced a work which is generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit.</P>
      <P>It is not considered necessary or desirable to divulge the names of bodies of persons with whom the Revenue Commissioners consult but I am satisfied that they are bodies which would be regarded as authoritative in the field of culture and art.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the section for an appeal in connection with a determination as to whether a work or works have cultural or artistic merit.</P>

      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Working Group to appraise the expenditures in the Public Capital Programme was set up over a period commencing in July, 1967.</P>
      <P>2.  Membership of the Working Group consisted of 23 officers of Assistant Principal rank of the Department of Finance, 21 from other Departments and 22 from State bodies, as well as three from outside the central government service, namely from Dublin University and the County Sligo VEC.  An Assistant Secretary of the Department of Finance acted as Chairman, a Principal Officer as Vice-Chairman and an Assistant Principal as full-time secretary.  The members formed themselves into smaller groups each charged particularly with one or more of the areas of investment listed below.  In general the work was done in the spare time of the officers concerned except that various officers worked full time for periods so that between spring 1968 and spring 1970 there was on average the equivalent of eight full-time working members.</P>
      <P>3.  The terms of reference of the appraisal were:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to appraise the Public Capital Programme by considering the cost of each of the constituent items of the programme in relation to the economic and social benefits which it yields or may be expected to yield to the community&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>4.  For the purpose of the appraisal the Working Group divided the public capital programme into 50 constituent items or areas of investment as follows:&mdash;</P>

They did not deal with third-level education building because building needs in that area were under review by the Higher Education Authority, nor did they deal with Taiscí Stáit because of the impending discontinuance of its operations.</P>

      <P>A scheme for the drainage of the Maigue catchment was put on exhibition in the spring of 1969 but as a result of legal proceedings it was declared to be <i>ultra vires.</i> In the circumstances it became necessary to prepare an amended scheme for exhibition. The preparation of the amended scheme is well advanced but at this stage I am not in a position to indicate when construction work is likely to commence.  As the Deputy will be aware it will be open to all interested parties, following exhibition of the scheme, to submit observations which will have to be investigated and considered.  It is possible that as a result of this and of necessary statutory consultations some alterations may have to be made in the scheme before it can be submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured the lady in question was not being victimised.  The fact is that she was appointed as a model on the recommendation of the professor and he is obviously the best qualified person to judge the type of individual suitable for this work.  The conditions of employment provided that the employment was purely temporary and could be terminated by one week's notice on either side.  The professor and other staff expressed their dissatisfaction with the manner in which this lady was carrying out her duties and asked that she be dismissed.  As the college authorities are <i>de facto</i> her employers, and they had decided she was not satisfactory, I formally agreed with their proposal.  The Deputy will accept that, even had I wished to, I could not insist on the college authorities continuing to employ a person who did not meet their requirements.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the situation in the <Col N="508" /> National College of Art at the moment is an intolerable one?  The police have been brought in there over the last week or so.  The police have been in and out constantly and the students cannot possibly work under these conditions. Would the Minister not agree that for an educational body under his control to give the example of bringing the police in, which no other educational institution here has done, is to give very bad example and to make conditions impossible for the students to work whatever the difficulties may have been?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked myself, but would the Minister not agree that even if there are internal difficulties in an educational institution it is well established that they cannot be dealt with by bringing in the police and that no institution of higher education here has ever attempted to do that?  In the universities if there was any suggestion of that the first thing the authorities would do would be to send the police out, and they have done it.</P>

      <P>If the night students were to be prevented from doing their examination students who had nothing at all to do with what is going on at the present time in the College of Art, would the Deputy think that it would be preferable to allow those who would wish to disrupt these examinations to continue or to permit the students who have studied all year to do their examinations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no details of import prices of onions.  Sale prices in the Dublin Market on 23rd April ranged from 130p to 250p per 56 lb bag for Dutch and from 225p to 250p per 50 lb bag for Canadian and Chilean.  The number of import licence holders is 70.  Import licences are issued to established importers of onions and to purchasers of substantial quantities of Irish onions from growers.  The quantities covered by individual import licences are related to the licence holders' onion imports in 1969 and 1970 and to their purchases of home-grown onions of the 1969 and 1970 crop.  The total quantity licensed to be imported is that estimated to be required to supply demand until the 1971 Irish home crop becomes available.  The fact that there are 70 holders of import licences provides adequate market competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>If no increases had been made for the year 1970-71 in the guaranteed price levels that had applied in 1969-70 the total cost of the export support payments on the basis of the 1970-71 market prices would have been approximately £970,000.  As a result of the increases made in the guaranteed price levels in April and October, 1971, the total actual cost of the support payments on exports in the year 1970-71 was approximately £3,550,000, of which approximately £910,000 fell to be met by the British Government and the balance of approximately £2,640,000 by the Irish Exchequer.  It is estimated that the April and October increases cost the Irish Exchequer an extra £1,870,000 approximately as compared with the two predicted amounts totalling £2,100,000 referred to by the Deputy.  It is not possible with the data available to show the actual cost of the two increases separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that by putting out predictions of this nature which are subsequently proven to be exaggerated, and the Department are continuing to do this, the Department are doing a disservice to the agricultural industry by conveying the impression to the public that a great deal more support is being given at a particular time to the farming community than is in fact being given and that in doing so the Minister is weakening his own case in the Cabinet in seeking improvements for the agricultural community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the basis on which his Department calculates that the increases in payments under the Beef Export Guarantee Scheme, announced on 30th March, 1971, will amount to an extra burden of £2 million on the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would point out that what my Department's announcement of 30th March stated was that the increase being made for the year 1971-72 in the level of export support payments on carcase beef &ldquo;could&rdquo; cost the Irish Exchequer &ldquo;nearly&rdquo; an extra £2 million in that year.</P>
      <P>This potential extra cost was calculated on the basis that the amounts of the support payments which would actually fall due throughout the year would be not less than the amounts by which the guaranteed price levels were being seasonally increased and that there would be an increase of about 20 per cent in the quantities exported during the year 1971-72 as compared with 1970-71.  The total potential extra cost on this basis would be approximately £2,650,000 but the amount in respect of the increase in the guaranteed price levels which would fall to be met on the same basis by the British Government under the Free Trade Area Agreement on 25,000 tons would be approximately £680,000, thereby reducing the potential extra cost falling on the Irish Exchequer to approximately £1.97 million.  I am hopeful that beef market prices will continue strong and that the actual extra cost in 1971-72 will not reach this figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state how he can square this prediction of an extra expenditure of nearly £2 million by the Irish Exchequer with the Estimates for 1971-72 which show a reduction of over £1 million on the amount actually expended in beef and lamb exports support in 1971-72?

      <P>Might I ask, considering that this motion has been ruled out of order, what is the practice of the Ceann Comhairle in relation to Private Members' motions, whether they are in order or not?  We had a similar experience last week when we gave notice of intention to discuss in Private Members' Time our motion in relation to the Lissadell estate.  It was only on Monday afternoon of last week that we were told it was out of order. Surely the Ceann Comhairle should give a quicker decision than he gave on our motion in relation to Lissadell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might come in here.  A suggestion was made last week through the newspapers, <Col N="517" /> emanating from the Fine Gael Whip's office, that there was such an agreement as that referred to by Deputy Corish.  I made immediate inquiries and I was told the Fine Gael Chief Whip rang the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and spoke to the Parliamentary Secretary's private secretary informing her that Fine Gael proposed to take Motion No. 18 in Private Members' Time this week.  That is as far as it went.  It was 25 minutes to six in the evening, and the lady in question took a note of it.  There is no justification whatever for anybody to interpret that simple transaction as agreement by Fianna Fáil that the motion would, in fact, be taken and that the motion would be put at the conclusion of Private Members' Time this evening.  You ruled out the subsequent motion as not being within Standing Orders at this time&mdash; the motion on the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;and as far as my party are concerned we abide by your decision.  If there is a motion to suspend Standing Orders, whether it is taken now or at 6 p.m., we propose to oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Order 46 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, the motion in the name of Deputy Liam Cosgrave regarding Mr. James Gibbons, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, may be moved in Private Members' Time on Tuesday, 27th April, 1971; and that notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Order 87 debate on the motion shall be brought to a conclusion at 7.30 p.m. on that day by the putting forthwith from the Chair of the question necessary to bring it to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of moving this motion, which is similar, if not identical, to a motion put forward on behalf of the Taoiseach on the 29th October last, is to enable a matter that has directly or indirectly been the subject of discussion in the House to be considered within the rule known as the six months rule.  The circumstances in which I have put down this motion at the present time is because of a document sent to the Committee of Public Accounts by the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="529" /> and Fisheries which would appear to conflict with information given to the House in May last.  I, at this stage, do not propose to elaborate on the terms of the document, because I think Deputies have already seen it and members of the Committee of Public Accounts are aware of it.  The matters that were the subject of discussion here as recently as May last are sufficiently fresh in the minds of Deputies not to need repetition.  However, because of the apparent conflict between the terms of the communication addressed by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to the Committee of Public Accounts and the statements made, both by the Minister, and by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government as well as on his own behalf, on a number of occasions, in particular on 14th May, 1970, I submit the requirements of Standing Order 46 should be suspended.  This should be done for the purpose of discussing the motion which has been tabled in my name and which is referred to in the motion I move now.  Because of the advent of financial business with the proposed introduction of the Budget tomorrow, it is unlikely that time will be afforded in the immediate future for Private Members' Business and, accordingly, I submit that this particular motion is necessary to suspend the Standing Order to which I have referred, and to enable the matter to be discussed and put not later than 7.30 p.m. this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We have wasted a lot of time and we have created and demolished a number of precedents.  It is just as good that we should get some kind of decision on this as quickly as possible.  The motion was ruled out of order; it now appears to be in order.  In any case, I was under the impression that there was a discussion between the Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael Whips, that they had agreed to take this motion tonight in connection with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and that, by agreement, it would be concluded tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in between I do not know.  The Ceann Comhairle said he gave as his ruling that this particular motion was out of order in view of the <Col N="530" /> fact that there was a motion of no confidence in members of the Government some time last autumn.  However, things have happened in between.  If a Member of this House wants to single out in a motion of no confidence a Minister, no matter who he may be, and if there is serious reason for doing this, I think it should be allowed. There have been conflicting evidence and statements between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in recent weeks.  These things must be cleared up.  For that reason, the House should agree to take this motion so that members of the Government party and members of the Opposition will have an opportunity of expressing their opinions and expressing them by way of vote.</P>
    <P>The events that are occurring in Fianna Fáil are known to the public and they cannot be cloaked forever. We all know that the motive of the Fianna Fáil Party is to try to stick together.

      <P>I appreciate the contributions by the leaders of the Opposition parties and that they have not gone into the merits of this matter because I think that is only proper when we are discussing a simple motion to suspend Standing Orders. First, to refer to Deputy Corish's understanding that there was agreement, I mentioned already that the Fine Gael Whip's Office rang the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and informed his private secretary at 25 minutes to 6&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In any event I shall give the Deputy a present of whatever time it was.  They informed the private secretary that a certain motion No. 18, which is the substantive motion to which this motion to suspend Standing Orders refers, was the one selected by Fine Gael, as was their right under the <Col N="531" /> arrangement for the taking of Private Members' Business.  It was suggested subsequently in a newspaper&mdash;I do not know on what grounds they made the suggestion&mdash;that it was agreed that this motion would be taken this evening and that it was further agreed that it would be put at 7.30 p.m. notwithstanding that there would be at least one-and-a-half hours yet for that motion to run according to normal practice.  There was no such agreement. Apparently the Ceann Comhairle interpreted the situation as there being no agreement and under the six-months rule&mdash;which provides that a matter already decided within the House may not be debated again by motion until after six months have elapsed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not interfere in any way with the other speakers; I think I am entitled to the same courtesy. As six months have not elapsed the Ceann Comhairle ruled that the matter was not in order.  This motion has been on the Order Paper for several months past.  It was open to Fine Gael at any time to suggest that the motion be debated.  In any event, we would have resisted it and, no doubt, the Ceann Comhairle would have ruled as he did today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substance of that motion dealt with statements made by Deputy Gibbons, as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in this House last May.  I submit that that was what Fine Gael wanted to debate.  Deputy Gibbons, myself and the other members of the <Col N="532" /> Government are prepared to stand over it.  In addition to that, in a motion of confidence before this House last November, I specifically included every individual member of the Government in that motion.  We got a vote of confidence on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I am not one whit afraid of the outcome of any debate concerning the statement that I made to this House last May that I had exhaustive inquiries made and that I was satisfied from these inquiries that public moneys were not used in the purchase of illegal arms or in the purchase of arms that might be illegally imported into this country.  That statement was made not only following exhaustive examination in the Department of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would just like to remind the Minister, in case he has forgotten, on this question of persons who are being declared redundant in a haphazard way without being given the proper notice, that there should be some special protection for them.  The amendment we have just withdrawn was an effort to provide protection. The Minister should consider, in the light of what has happened, that this sort of thing should not be allowed to continue.  The Ryan v. Limerick Health Authority class of payment is one of the examples we cited here the other evening.  This is a loophole in the Redundancy Payments Act of which <Col N="535" /> mean employers are taking advantage and the Minister might do something about it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 4 to add the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() the Tribunal shall take judicial notice of Statutory Orders made by the Agricultural Wages Board, the Labour Court, and any other Statutory Wage Fixing Authority and shall not have regard to any contract, wage or remuneration less favourable to the employee than the appropriate prescribed statutory minimum wage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment which has been tabled by the Labour Party seeks to get over a difficulty in which some workers find themselves, workers who are not properly informed as to what their legal rights are in regard to wages.  Certain boards, including the Labour Court and the Agricultural Wages Board, make agreements which have the force of law.  There is a situation in which farm labourers, particularly, who are not aware that by law they are entitled to a certain minimum rate enter into a private agreement with an unscrupulous employer&mdash;because there is no doubt or very little doubt that the employer is aware of what his obligations are under the law&mdash;for less than the legal rate.  This amendment seeks to ensure that, irrespective of what private contract, arrangement or agreement may be entered into that is for less than the legal rate, the tribunal would take into account nothing lower than the statutory minimum rate.  We ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not fail to have a certain amount of sympathy <Col N="536" /> with this amendment but the cases to which it would apply would involve statutory wage fixing bodies.  I am not too sure that the Appeals Tribunal would be the right people at any time to decide what the correct wage rate should be.  Would the Deputies suggesting the amendment leave it to me to have a suitable amendment drafted which would cover the position without placing the responsibility on the tribunal to adjudicate as to what was or was not a correct wage in each individual case?  In cases where a statutory wage is fixed there are bodies or there should be to determine what the wages should be and I think it is more appropriate that such bodies, and not the tribunal, should determine what the correct statutory wages are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may misunderstand the meaning of the amendment and I must accept responsibility for that.  Possibly I did not explain it properly.  We are not for one moment suggesting that the tribunal fix a rate for a job where legal rates are already laid down.  If an agreement is registered with the Labour Court for a particular type of worker, that agreement has the power of law and if a man is paid below the minimum rate the employer is breaking the law.  A number of workers who are not members of trade unions are not aware of these agreements and are being taken advantage of by certain employers. What we are asking here is, if a person is being employed below the legal rate already established by one of the bodies which the Minister mentioned, not the tribunal, that when fixing redundancy payments the tribunal would have regard only to the minimum rate&mdash;nothing below it.  For example, if the legal rate for a job was £10 a week and a person was being paid £8 that the tribunal would regard him as being employed at £10 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party <Col N="537" /> amendment has been carefully phrased and urges the tribunal to &ldquo;take judicial notice of Statutory Orders made by the Agricultural Wages Board, the Labour Court and any other statutory wage fixing authority&rdquo;.  We in no way suggest that the tribunal itself should have formal unilateral power to determine a particular minimum rate of remuneration. This is in fact the essence of the proposed amendment.  We do not want to see a situation developing where the lump sum payment or the weekly payment received by industrial workers would be less than that which they are in the normal course of events entitled to under the national statutory wage minimum orders made by the various wage-fixing authorities.  This is something of major importance because as we have pointed out only half of the manufacturing workers are in trade unions.  As a result they are most likely to be in the kind of employment which could be subject to intermittent redundancy.  They might well be exploited and they should receive their actual entitlement rather than something which an employer might feel like giving them.</P>
      <P>The Minister might find the phrase &ldquo;judicial notice&rdquo; hard to stomach but in any event the intent of the Labour Party amendment is that the tribunal should have full and due regard to the orders made by these bodies.  This is of considerable importance because there are in excess of 100,000 workers involved.  It would be a pity if the tribunal's work was not simplified as we have suggested here.</P>

      <P>I assume from what the Minister said that he did not understand the point we were trying to make.  It is not unusual to find agricultural workers, particularly those looking after stock, working seven days a week.  The minimum rate for the area might be £16 per week but the rate to which they are entitled by law would be around £21 or £22 a week because of the hours they are working.  When these people are dismissed, if they are <Col N="538" /> not members of a trade union, there is no one to show the tribunal that they are in fact entitled to a rate higher than what the farmer or the employer says is the rate for the job.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 4 to add the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() an appeal, in a case where the employer has not given a Redundancy Certificate, shall automatically be deemed to be an appeal against the decision of the employer to refuse to give the Certificate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes, where an employer has not given a redundancy certificate, that workers be automatically deemed to be in appeal against a decision of the employer to refuse to give the certificate.  The Minister is possibly aware of case No. 116 of 1970 where the Workers Union of Ireland was involved in a particular dispute with an employer who refused to give a redundancy certificate.  In our opinion such a refusal should constitute an appeal because the key is, in many respects, the claim to a redundancy certificate.  The adoption of this amendment would simplify the procedure and avoid second and third appeals.  The amendment is a reasonably constructive one and I strongly recommend it to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not necessary because there is nothing in the Act which precludes the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal from stating that an employee is entitled to a redundancy certificate.  In any event, payments are made on tribunal decisions and the only purpose the certificate would serve is the collection of weekly payments.  In the case of a tribunal decision the necessity for an employee to have a certificate does not arise.  The amendment is, therefore, superfluous. The matter is thoroughly covered.  The decision of the tribunal specifies the particulars on which the employees' entitlement to weekly payments are based and the Department makes the payments on foot of these decisions irrespective of whether or not the employees <Col N="540" /> have redundancy certificates. That is sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as simple as the Minister tries to make out.  I have come across cases in which employees have not been given redundancy certificates and all sorts of ramifications have to be gone through before certificates can be got or claims finalised.  I have two cases at the moment which I have asked the Department to investigate.  In one case the man was told he would get a certificate and he would be paid all right.  After six or seven weeks he went back to the employer and the employer said: &ldquo;I have no money and I cannot give you any money and you are not getting anything&rdquo; and the man got no redundancy certificate.  All the employer had to do was give him a certificate and the man would have got his money from the Department.  In fact, this employer has the money; he is just being damn mean.  The employee is the fellow who has no money and he is on very short rations at the moment.  Over the last several months I have had at least 20 cases.  Employers disappear or refuse to answer letters or applications.  If an employer meets the employee he tries to be smart; he sends the employee back to the Labour Exchange, saying he sent in the form, or he makes some other stupid excuse. If the law says that the mere fact that he did not issue a redundancy certificate empowers an appeal to be started immediately we believe such a provision would make these smart alecks change their habits.</P>

      <P>I take it this amendment was put down for the purpose of clarification.  The words proposed to be deleted are vital.  It is necessary to provide a time limit and that time limit is subject to the extent <Col N="542" /> specified in subsection (2).  I could not accept this amendment.

      <P>Where an employer fails to give notice does the Minister not consider that the employee should have the right to make a claim even after a lengthy period?  I know we argued this on another section but do not forget that very often somebody is let go when there is a scarcity of employment for a short period.  He can be hanging around expecting to be re-employed for a very long period.  Eventually, he is not re-employed.  Maybe the place is sold out or maybe the fellow does not take him back.  We feel it should be wide open.  It would be a deterrent to people who would attempt to take advantage of workers.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Tully in the case of the particular worker about whom he spoke but I must agree with the Minister on several points.  It is very difficult for any employer to finish his accounting for the year if this is hanging over his head, if a man can claim in two years or three years.  Where a company goes into liquidation if the period is 104 weeks shareholders who have their money frozen or creditors cannot really be paid.  They cannot pay so much in the pound until such time as they finish the accounts.  This cannot be done if there is a group who can claim within 104 weeks and do not claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know but if they have to wait until such time as they know there is no claim coming in it holds them up with their accountancy. <Col N="544" /> There is also the case of creditors and shareholders.  We are trying to be fair here mainly to the employee because the job is all he has got but we must also be fair to, say, the small employer. I feel 104 weeks is reasonably harsh. Deputy Tully gave one example on which I agreed with him but I can give another.  A person could have an injury claim and rather than put in his claim for redundancy payment he could hold it over until such time as the court gave him his money.  He could claim in court that he got no redundancy payment and then when he got his money he could put in his claim for redundancy payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>What I am saying is that he can go to court and say he is not getting or has not got it and the court will take that into account.  We must be fair both ways.  There must be a date from which to start again.  It is wrong to hurt one person but one could hurt ten or 12 people who would be shareholders in a small company.  I think the Minister has been quite generous in the period he has given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity to tell the House on this section, of a further amendment to the Bill which I hope to introduce on Report Stage to allow weekly redundancy payments to be made to residents of Northern Ireland who become redundant in the Twenty-six Counties. One or two cases have arisen to date in which persons living in Northern Ireland who travel across the Border daily to work in the South have been made redundant here.  The workers concerned received the lump sums from their employers in the normal way.  A difficulty arose, however, in giving them <Col N="545" /> weekly payments because paragraph 14, Schedule 1 to the 1967 Act, provides that:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be entitled to a weekly payment unless he is normally resident within the State.</P>
      <P>I was legally advised that that provision would not allow weekly payments to be made to persons resident in Northern Ireland.  We had a few claims in this respect and I felt that, if only on grounds of equity, the Northern Ireland residents who became redundant in the South and who may have contributed to our redundancy payment scheme should be entitled to receive weekly payments as well as lump sum payments.  We decided, therefore, to introduce an amendment to the principal Act to enable this to be done.  I propose that the amendment will also enable weekly payments to be made to people from the Twenty-six Counties who go to reside in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>That is the type of case we have already met in practice.  In order to implement the proposals it would be necessary to have the assistance of the Northern Ireland authorities in verifying any claims that might arise, and my Department have been in touch with the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Social Services who have promised full co-operation.  I am sure Members from all sides will welcome this and will join with me in expressing appreciation of the co-operation shown to date by the authorities in Northern Ireland and the promise of further co-operation in the future.  I wanted to say that on the appropriate section.</P>

      <P>We are very glad to hear this is being done and I should like to remind the Minister that it was as a result of a question I put down to him some years ago that he introduced a change or an amendment which enabled him to pay one of his former constituents who was in an Omagh hospital.  He was very interested in the matter when it was brought to his notice and he succeeded in getting legislation which we were all very glad to hear worked out effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which he proposes to introduce on Report Stage is something <Col N="546" /> which we must welcome as a good idea.  The Minister has said it will apply to residents of the Republic who go to work in the North and residents of the North working here who will go back.  I should be interested to know if there are to be reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

I am quite sure it is the British Ministry who would have to OK any arrangements between the North and the Republic.  Will there be reciprocal arrangements with Britain? This is a very important matter and I am not sure whether reciprocity operates now.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 9, at the reference to section 2, to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The addition of the following definitions:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(a)  &ldquo;offer&rdquo; in relation to re-engagement or renewal of a contract of employment or an offer of employment, means a written offer, received by the employee.</P>
      <P>(b)  &ldquo;diminish&rdquo; in Part 2, means either temporarily or permanently and from whatever cause.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks two additional definitions.  In page 19 of the main Act there are a number of definitions. We have &ldquo;cease&rdquo;, &ldquo;lock-out&rdquo; and quite a number of others.  The word &ldquo;diminish&rdquo; also appears on page 21 of the main Act.  There is reference to employees carrying out work at a particular time in the place where he is employed.  The word &ldquo;diminish&rdquo; is not defined.  We want the word &ldquo;offer&rdquo; to be defined as &ldquo;written offer&rdquo;.  We also wish to have &ldquo;diminish&rdquo; to be defined as meaning &ldquo;either temporarily or permanently and from whatever cause&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to comment on each paragraph in the amendment separately.  In relation to (a), I agree the ideal situation would be if all offers were written, provided it could reasonably be done.  However, one can visualise cases not involving big concerns where this might happen and I think it might not be reasonable. I do not think it would be reasonable to ask that all employers would be asked to make their offers in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that because there are smaller employers it would be unreasonable? Surely it would not be too much to ask that all firms would write the offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are so many safeguards in the Act in relation to redundancy that it would be unreasonable to expect in certain circumstances that all offers would be in writing.  It might concern only one employee or it <Col N="548" /> could concern a number.  I do not think it is worth pursuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>I am afraid the Minister would want to go back and check carefully.  I can see no reason why the term &ldquo;written offer&rdquo; should not be included.  I think it is only fair. We have got to make redundancy legislation and industrial relations a bit more formal in this country.  It may mean hard work, it may mean that people will have to sit down and think out what they are offering and put it down on a piece of paper and give it to somebody, but this is only the elementary entitlement of people in employment.  If an offer of employment is being made it should be a written offer.  Otherwise there will be all sorts of excuses, all sorts of evasions.  I know it may be inconvenient for employers but I do not think it is that big an inconvenience.  There is nothing to prevent an employer having a stereotyped form which he merely fills in for the particular category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing here an offer in relation to re-engagement or renewal of a contract of employment. I have in mind a particular case&mdash;I do not wish to give the name of the employee or of the employer&mdash; where a firm went into liquidation. There was a clever solicitor involved who did everything by word of mouth on behalf of the liquidator.  Any information conveyed to the employees or any offer of renewal or re-engagement was made verbally.  When this case came before the Redundancy Tribunal there was not any written evidence to show what had been <Col N="549" /> offered.  The solicitor kept his mouth shut at the tribunal and got away with it.  The trade union members of the tribunal could give many examples like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been looking at the section which relates to the case of re-employment to which the Deputy is referring.  It reads:</P>
      <P>(2)  An employee who has received the notice required by section 17 shall not be entitled to a redundancy payment if in the period of two weeks ending on the date of dismissal&mdash;(a) his employer has made to him in writing an offer to renew the employee's contract of employment or to re-engage him under a new contract of employment,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said covers one eventuality.  Suppose the employer does not give an offer, but gives a verbal offer, and at the tribunal he denies that he gave such an offer, the employee has no way of proving it.  We suggest that the offer in writing would have to be accepted. What is the Minister's objection to accepting this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a case where the employer says that he gave a particular offer and the employee says that he did not get this offer.  There is no evidence, apart from the conflicting evidence on both sides.  My sympathy tends to go to the employee who is out of a job.  I would remind the Minister in relation to section 17 that it is all right for an employer who proposes to dismiss shall give to the employee notice in writing of his proposal to dismiss him.  We pointed out in relation to our amendment that offers in relation to renewal or re-engagement should mean a written offer received by the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is adequately covered already in section 15 (1)  which reads:</P>
      <P>An employee who has received the notice required by section 17 shall not be entitled to a redundancy payment if in the period of two weeks ending on the date of dismissal&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> (a)  his employer has offered to renew that employee's contract of employment or to re-engage him under a new contract of employment,</P>
    <P>(b)  the provisions of the contract as renewed, or of the new contract, as to the capacity and place in which he would be employed and as to the other terms and conditions of his employment would not differ from the corresponding provisions of the contract in force immediately before his dismissal,</P>
    <P>(c)  the renewal or re-engagement would take effect on or before the date of dismissal, and</P>
    <P>(d)  he has unreasonably refused the offer.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>(2)  An employee who has received the notice required by section 17 shall not be entitled to a redundancy payment if in the period of two weeks ending on the date of dismissal&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section requires him to make it in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It says that if he has given it in writing it is evidence that he has, in fact, offered a job and the man has no claim against him, but if he does not give it in writing there is nothing to say that that takes away the employer's answer to the claim.  In effect, he can say that he has offered him a job verbally and then offered it to somebody else.  The offer could be passed around from one person to another and there would not be any evidence that the offer was ever made, <Col N="551" /> but if the offer was in writing it would be different.  If there is no writing it lets somebody off the hook.  I have seen numerous cases of people having been laid off.  Where there is a big lay-off and many people are laid off through redundancy the thing is clear enough but where there are a small number of people and some are laid off, this is a different matter.  This happens particularly in the agricultural industry where a farmer may realise that one of his sons is big enough to do a certain amount of work.  Such a farmer may lay off an employee who has been with him for 30 or 40 years and who may be over 60 years of age.  I know of one man who was laid off after 27 years, and my advice to him was to go back and tell the farmer of the amount of money due to him in redundancy pay.  There are instances of employees being told that they must go and that somebody else will do the job, and then when the employers hear about the redundancy pay involved they start seeking around and when they discover that an appeal has been sent in because they have not paid redundancy money they allege that some time, in conversation, an offer of a job was made.  This is the trouble.  If all offers of employment after redundancy have to be given in writing, the problem would be settled.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I was going to suggest that to the Minister. The Minister seems to be convinced that there are several provisions relating to this in other sections.  We are a bit sceptical about this and we suggest that the Minister should consider this matter between now and Report Stage and, if possible, bring in an amendment then.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 9, at the reference to Section 7, to delete &ldquo;The substitution in subsection (5) of &lsquo;104 weeks&rsquo; for &lsquo;208 weeks&rsquo;&rdquo; and substitute:</P>

      <P>&lsquo;(reduced to 104 weeks as and from 22nd January, 1971)&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>May we point out to the Minister that this amendment simply proposes a new qualification &ldquo;commencing on the 22nd January, 1971&rdquo;?  The net effect of this amendment is to change the date of publication of the new rules. It simplifies matters rather than making any material change in the Bill.</P>

      <P>When the original Bill was going through this House a number of us pointed out that unless the operation of it was made retrospective to the previous July a number of persons would be laid off before the Bill became law because of the fact that by this means employers would succeed in dodging their responsibilities in regard to redundancy payments.  We were assured such a thing could not happen. I know people who were dismissed the night before the Bill came into operation because of the fact that their employers realised they could get away with it.  Individuals who had been employed in family jobs for many years <Col N="553" /> were dismissed the night before the Bill came into operation.  We suggest that the way to prevent this happening and to catch the people who have done the same thing again is to date this back to the date of publication of the Bill.  If the Minister does that it will solve the problem.  There is no big principle involved in this for the Minister. It is something which he can do quite easily and I suggest he should do it.</P>

      <P>I made my position quite clear on this question of retrospection at the outset and I do not want to go over it again.  The very first amendment dealt with retrospection. I do not want to repeat what I said on the first amendment which dealt in a more global way with the whole question of retrospection.  I pointed out then that this is where one has to take a decision to have retrospection or not to have it, the question of what date one should go back to, what date would be justified and the whole principle of retrospective legislation.  I firmly decided I would not have any retrospection.  I am afraid I must stand on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We know why he did not do it.  Fianna Fáil would love to <Col N="554" /> suggest why he did not do it.  He did not do it because of the fact that he realised he had bitten off more than he could chew, so he had to backpedal all the way.  Incidentally, he set a pattern which is being followed even by the present Minister.  He has got into the habit of backpedalling now. I suggest he should backpedal on this one because this is an Amendment we will insist on.  We will have a division on it.  If the Minister is not aware, we can give him instances where persons have been laid off since the 22nd January to date.  It is only a matter of a little over three months.  We are talking about retrospection for a short period.  We are not talking about going back years or even one year but just three months.  This will in effect put a few shillings in the pockets of persons who have been laid off in order to avoid the effect of this Bill. We are, therefore, asking the Minister, whatever he does, to insist on those persons getting their rights by making the legislation operative from 22nd January.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to consider this we are prepared to give him an opportunity of doing so but if he is not prepared to reconsider it we will at some stage have a vote on it.  If the Minister does not introduce an amendment to cover this on Report Stage we will have a vote on the section.  It is a principle as far as are concerned and it must be put into the Bill if it is to be effective at all because otherwise a group of smart Alecks will get away with something they are not entitled to get away with.</P>

      <P>We spoke about this on the introduction of the Bill.  We pointed out on the Second Reading that the date we wanted it operative from was the date of the publication of the Bill. There is no question of people not being aware of the fact that this would be asked for nor is there any doubt that people took advantage of the fact that they thought it would not happen. I can remember distinctly when the parent Bill was going through this House that again and again we were told: &ldquo;Nobody will be so mean as to lay-off people if the Bill is not made retrospective in order to avoid this&rdquo;. When the time came they dumped some of their employees out.  They let them go.  As I said to the Minister a few minutes ago they let them go as late as the night before the Bill came into operation and got away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know one poor farm labourer who came to me crying when he was dismissed on the last day of December and the Bill came into operation on the <Col N="556" /> 1st January.  This man had 39 years service and had a large family but the farmer had no hesitation in telling him he was letting him go because if he kept him another day and had to let him go then he would have to pay a couple of hundred pounds to him. The State was paying most of it but that did not worry the man who dismissed this farm labourer.  This man has found it almost impossible to get any employment since then while that farmer was able to employ somebody else in a month or six weeks time when the spring arrived.  This was done all over the country by employers the last time and the Minister can prevent it happening again by making this retrospective. We are asking for only three months retrospection.  I again appeal to the Minister either to do it now or to agree to look at it and bring in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I wonder if I could seek some information from the Chair. Motion No. 59 in the name of Deputy Cosgrave had been arranged for discussion tonight.  I understand that the Ceann Comhairle's Office have informed my party that this motion was not considered to be in order.  I wonder would the Chair mind indicating on what grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The position with regard to Motion No. 59 <Col N="559" /> in the name of Deputy Liam Cosgrave is that on 29th October, 1970, a Government motion reaffirming the confidence of the Dáil in the Taoiseach and in his Ministers was moved and this motion was passed on 4th November. As far back as that date the Ceann Comhairle took the view that Deputy Cosgrave's motion regarding the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was covered by the Government motion. Accordingly, under Standing Order No. 46, on a question already decided during the preceding six months, Deputy Cosgrave's motion could not be moved before 4th May next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair's indication of the reason but I wonder would the Chair consider what is now involved in this ruling.  The ruling seems to mean that a motion of confidence or no confidence is governed by Standing Order No. 46 although, as events may transpire, by reason of something that may in fact a week after winning a motion of no confidence, a Government may in fact be deserving of losing the confidence of the House.  Our Constitution provides that the instant the Taoiseach loses the confidence of the House he must resign.  I fail then to see how a question of confidence can be governed by Standing Order No. 46.  The Government and the Taoiseach and all the Ministers must at all times retain the confidence of the House.  That is what the Constitution provides.</P>

      <Col N="561" /> Deputy Cosgrave's motion asks Dáil Éireann to express the opinion that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Gibbons, by reason of a misstatement in the Dáil is, by his conduct unworthy of being a member of the Government or of the Dáil.  On what basis does the Chair rule that that is covered by the motion passed on 4th November?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

There may be Deputies who wish to vote for Deputy Lynch as Taoiseach and for other members of the Government and express their confidence in them but might have strong reservations about voting for Deputy Gibbons.  If the Chair rules that that motion covers a motion individual to Deputy Gibbons, the Chair must appreciate that there are entirely different issues involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in view of the deteriorating situation with regard to air and water pollution and the lack of up-to-date legislation to deal with the position, Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to introduce legislation forthwith to rectify this state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a song which was very popular at one time and possibly still is: &ldquo;Thank God we're surrounded by water&rdquo;.  The constituency that I have the honour to represent, Dublin North Central, is surrounded by water.  The river Liffey bounds it on one side; the river Tolka flows right through it and then it is open to Dublin Bay.  Whatever else the people of Dublin North Central may thank God for, they will not thank God for being surrounded by the polluted water of Dublin.  It is now two years since we started this agitation.  During the election campaign of 1969 the weather was extremely fine and very suitable for canvassing. Anywere I went canvassing &mdash;and I am sure it was the same for all the candidates from Dublin North Central&mdash;I was asked what we would do about the state of the river Tolka or would anything be done about it. At that time the people living adjacent <Col N="563" /> to the River Tolka told me they preferred the weather not to be too fine because when the weather was fine they could hardly stay in their homes because of the stench from the River Tolka.</P>
    <P>Soon after that election I tabled questions to the then Minister for Local Government who is no longer a Member of this House.  The replies I received were that the pollution of a river was a matter for the local authority in whose area the river happened to be. He disclaimed all responsibility for the state of the River Tolka.  We then contacted Dublin Corporation and certain departments of Dublin Corporation told us they were not aware that anything was wrong except that there was an abnormally low level of water due to the fine weather.  As soon as the weather deteriorated and it began to rain they felt the conditions of the Tolka would improve.</P>
    <P>We were a voluntary body at the time and we took it on ourselves to have samples taken of the water in the River Tolka.  We had those samples analysed by the Institute for Research and Standards.  I am not qualified to give details of those analyses, I am sure most laymen would not be but one does not need to know a great deal about water pollution when it is explained as it was explained to us.  Under one heading, oxygen demand, the normal reading for a healthy river in rural Ireland should be from four to six but in an urban area a figure of between six and eight is acceptable.  We found the reading in one instance under this heading to be over 200.  If the figures of four, six or eight are regarded as reasonable Deputies can judge how unreasonable the reading of 200 is.</P>
    <P>This river flows through the Botanic Gardens which is supposed to be one of Dublin's tourist attractions.  Many people who visited the gardens found they simply could not stay there.  This river flows through a playground near the Botanic Gardens and the reading there under the heading I have already mentioned was between 150 and 200. Members of the medical profession have expressed the view that this could lead to different forms of disease or fever.  I wonder what would happen <Col N="564" /> if a child cut his foot and had to get into this polluted river?</P>
    <P>Dollymount Strand is one of the finest strands not alone in Ireland but in Europe but for the last couple of summers people have been reluctant to use Dollymount Strand because of its polluted state.  The Dublin Bay Preservation Association, which is a very strong and active association, knows all about the polluted state of Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has ever been to Dublin can tell of the polluted state of the River Liffey yet Dublin Corporation were at one stage unaware of the polluted state of the River Liffey.  The Medical Officer of health for Dublin Corporation informed me in writing that he was fully aware that the River Tolka has stunk to high heaven for a number of years.</P>

      <P>I do not know who is at fault and who is not, I do not know who is telling the truth and who is not but I recently noticed that Dublin Corporation have taken some steps to remedy the position in the case of the River Tolka.  There is an extra pumping house now up at Finglas and both the City Manager and the City Engineer believe that in the not too distant future the River Tolka will again be a free-flowing clean river. Surely this is an admission that it was grossly polluted?</P>
      <P>I have spoken to people who remember when it was possible to fish along the River Tolka.  I do not think anyone at the present time, unless he came out of a mental home, would think of fishing in the River Tolka, or that part of it which flows through Dublin North Central at present.  It is quite possible that one may be able to fish in the part of it which runs through County Meath.</P>
      <P>This motion states, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the deteriorating situation with regard to air and water pollution and the lack of up-to-date legislation to deal with the position, Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to <Col N="565" /> introduce legislation forthwith to rectify this state of affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any legislation which exists at present is archaic and in most cases it is practically impossible to operate it.  Four or five different Ministries are concerned with water pollution: the Minister for Local Government is affected; the Minister for Lands has a say in it; the Minister for Finance has to provide the money, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a say in it because anything done might interfere with an industry which would be set up in the area.  No one Ministry is solely responsible for dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to find some effective means of bringing this matter to a successful conclusion.  The Fine Gael Party have a Bill on the Order Paper in which certain remedies are suggested and I would ask the Minister to consider them.  The Minister might ask the local authorities to see that the rivers in their area are brought up to a certain standard.  We would ask him to impose reasonable fines on anybody found guilty of polluting rivers.  At the moment there is only a nominal fine.  If a firm pollutes a river it does not mean very much to them to have to pay a nominal fine; they can continue to pollute the river. I do not for a moment want to be taken as being against industry: industry must go on.  Industry is vital for the purpose of providing employment. At the same time industry has a responsibility to the public and it is not, I think, too much to ask that industries should not pollute our rivers and seas.  Industries should take every precaution to ensure that noxious effluents do not destroy natural amenities. I urge the Minister to accept this motion and to do what he can to remedy this evil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  We are, perhaps, in a more favourable position from the point of view of controlling pollution than other countries are because our rivers serve only our own territory and we are not in any degree dependent on another country from the point of view of any legislation we may introduce.  Literally <Col N="566" /> nothing has been done up to the present moment to curb or control pollution. Deputy Belton has given the House a general resumé of the situation. If it can be definitely proved that someone is polluting a waterway the county council may institute proceedings against him on medical grounds. That is obviously insufficient to deal with the modern problem, a problem every country in the world is facing today.  In actual fact it is not, of course, just one person who is polluting a particular river.  It is modern industry as a whole, silage, dumping and so on.</P>
      <P>There are three major ways in which water can be polluted.  It can be polluted by the discharge of untreated sewage into the river.  It can be polluted by the direct discharge of noxious industrial waste and by noxious effluents flowing down from surrounding areas into the river.  There is, too, the risk of all pollution from the waters around our coast.  The threat of pollution is grave.  We want to bring home to the Government and the Minister&mdash;we believe he has a receptive ear&mdash;the fact that something must be done before it is too late.  In 1965 a motion was introduced in the Council of Europe by Mons.  Hausau, a Belgian socialist, asking that notice should be taken of the appalling situation then existing in Europe.  One of the lakes in Switzerland had reached the point at which no marine life or vegetation could survive. We have not reached that state yet but, unless we do something now, we will reach the stage at which it will cost millions literally to restore the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, Mr. Boland, refused to take any action, refused to recognise that we faced the risk of pollution.  It is only when disaster hits that action is taken. At that point coping with the disaster costs the ratepayer and the taxpayer a great deal of money.  The <i>Torrey Canyon</i> disaster was a blessing in disguise because Britain was alerted to the danger.  Since then quite a number of similar disasters, or near disasters, have occurred.  Of course, the problem there is all the greater because of the narrow waters of the English Channel. Down in Cork now we have an oil refinery at Whitegate and the peril is at <Col N="567" /> our doors.  Huge tankers come in and out and there is the additional hazard that these tankers are no longer manned by fully trained seamen.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any plans to cope with a major disaster off our coast? I expect we will be told that such a disaster will not be his job; it will be a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.  We want to put control under one Minister and we want that Minister to be in a position to take action immediately a disaster occurs off our coast.  I live in a maritime constituency.  If a tanker got into trouble off the coast of Wexford and our coastline was polluted I am quite sure that we would be told that it was a matter for Wexford County Council. How on earth could Wexford County Council deal with a major problem like that?</P>
    <P>Other countries recognise the seriousness of the situation and other countries have taken action and have specifically designated one overall authority. We have not done that.  Our rivers are seriously polluted to the detriment of the tourist industry and our inland fisheries.  New diseases in fish have appeared. These are due to pollution.  I know scientists have said they could not actually determine the cause, but the fact is that the recent salmon disease did not appear until pollution occurred.  The Minister must take these factors into consideration.  As Deputy Belton has said, we have a Private Member's Bill which we have not had a chance to introduce.  From what I know of Irish parliamentary life after 20 years, when any member of an opposition introduces a Bill, no matter how good it is, he has no chance of getting it through.  What Deputy Belton and I, with the other signatories to this motion, hope is that we will get the Government to introduce a Bill.  If we get the Government to introduce a Bill I can assure them we will give them all the support we possibly can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are very anxious to support this motion.  If action is taken now in time we can be ahead of other countries <Col N="568" /> who have failed to cope with the problem.  Prevention is better than cure.</P>
      <P>I know the Local Government Act provides a certain amount of protection but it has been stated in Dublin, and not contradicted by the Minister or his Department, that there are too many loopholes in the law that came into effect on the 1st January.  Therefore, it is important that this motion should be supported.  It is said that the atmosphere of Dublin is as badly polluted as the atmosphere of Birmingham, Coventry or any of the industrial cities of Britain.  A figure of 60 tons of pollution per hour in Dublin has been mentioned.  This is a diastrous state of affairs.  London has completely cleared its air of pollution and there are birds back in London that have not been seen for generations.  It is terrible that we have such air pollution in Dublin and to a lesser extent in Cork and the other major towns.</P>
      <P>We have sufficient pollution of the sea to deter tourists and natives from going near the sea.  There were 12 doctors who were keen swimmers in Dublin Bay.  They protested about the degree of pollution and their statement was contradicted by, I think, the City Medical Officer who said that while there was a high sewage content in the sea it was not very harmful or it was harmless.  One doctor said he dived into Dublin Bay and came up with toilet paper across his face.  He said the amount of sewage in the sea was enough to deter anyone from going near it and that all our tourists would be turned away if they knew the amount of sewage floating in our sea which has not been properly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rivers are being polluted unnecessarily, by the discharge into them of effluent.  There are not sufficient safeguards against the indiscriminate discharge of effluent into rivers.  There is in my constituency a river the condition of which is perhaps the worst in the whole country&mdash;the Camac river.  It is a disgrace.  I have often stood and looked into it.  One would never think it was a river.  One would think it was just a discharge from a factory.  The colour of the water is very interesting. There is never normal water there, just a white, milky liquid which flows down <Col N="569" /> through Inchicore.  I had occasion to check recently on the sewage beds at Clondalkin and I understand that there is some discharge but I have been assured that the sewage has been well treated before being discharged into the Camac river.  I was astonished to hear this.  How sure are we that this sewage which has been discharged into a river that runs through housing schemes has been properly treated?</P>
    <P>There are too many loopholes in the law and we would appreciate it if the Minister now took action to prevent indiscriminate polluting of the atmosphere, the rivers and the sea.  I brought to the Minister's attention on a number of occasions the discharge from incinerators, in particular one at the Maguire and Paterson match factory. I watch this almost daily and one could hardly credit the amount of pollution it is causing.  It was only when I brought it to the Minister's attention that they said they would provide an up-to-date incinerator.  This discharge is regurgitating over the city.  It is no wonder there are so many bronchitics in Dublin.  I think we have more bronchitics than in any other city in Europe. Many industrial firms are allowed to pollute the atmosphere without restriction.</P>
    <P>One way to deal with this is to legislate properly so that there will be no loopholes in the law.  This was pointed out by an expert on air pollution. I think it was Dr. Chapman of Baggot Street Hospital who is associated with air pollution and who has a special pulmonary unit in that hospital dealing with the results from air pollution.  Either he or someone in a similar capacity pointed to the fact that the present legislation is inadequate to deal with this problem.  The Minister should agree to this motion so that there will not be a division on it and we can get something done and take action before it is too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Belton feels very strongly about this matter. This is a problem that faces the civilised world.  Pollution is a penalty of civilisation and the uncivilised world has not got this problem.  Since we have the problem we must face it and to face it in the most effective and best possible <Col N="570" /> way is a task for this House as the Legislature.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Dr. O'Connell says I do not think Dublin city is as bad as some of the British cities but that is not a boast.  Their pollution should be a warning to us.  We have a chance to prevent our city becoming as bad as other cities.  I do not think we will ever reach the same degree of industrial pollution as they have across channel because I do not think we will ever reach the same rate of industrialisation. We can learn from the British authorities and what they are doing in order to allow over 50 million people to live there without being poisoned by pollution.</P>
      <P>One big feature of the Dublin scene is that some beaches are being polluted by refuse dumping.  Refuse is being dumped there because the local authority found it the cheapest way to dispose of refuse.  They dumped it first of all at Ringsend and at Fairview and then moved further out.  In recent years people became more conscious of this type of menace and the protests started. We must face the fact that if we want to preserve the rivers and beaches we must pay for it.  If the corporation decide to get rid of rubbish by incineration we must face the fact that it will cost a great deal of money, much more than the present lackadaisical method of dumping on the strand at Irishtown and Sandymount.  I believe the three Deputies for that area have questioned the corporation as to when it will declare that there will be no more dumping in that area.  I mentioned this to show we are facing up to it in some way. But we must face the great expense of getting rid of rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Getting rid of the sewage of the city is another problem and the corporation have plans for the provision of a new outfall works and treatment plant. I do not know when the work will be begun and I do not know if the plant will be sufficient to deal with the ever increasing problem of sewage disposal. We must be sure of one thing, and I hope the Minister will insist on it: that the new plant will be constructed on a scale large enough and that the methods will be sufficiently modern to ensure that no more untreated sewage <Col N="571" /> will be allowed into the rivers or into Dublin bay.</P>
    <P>Deputies Belton and O'Connell specified the rivers in the city.  It is interesting to note that there are 28 rivers and streams.  Some of them are merely streams and some of them are underground. However, we have three or four large rivers.  We have the Liffey, the Dodder, the Tolka, the Camac, the Swan and many others.  Joyce referred to Anna Livia plurabella and it has been said that Dubliners have a love-hate feeling for the river.  They will do nothing to improve it, yet when there is a move to cover part of it in we have an outcry.  Their aim should be to beautify the river because Dublin is reputed to be the only capital city in Europe which has a salmon-bearing river running through it.  I know about Galway, but Galway is not a capital city.</P>
    <P>The Camac is the most polluted river in Ireland, and the Tolka, which flows through the Botanical Gardens, emits a frightful stench at times.  The Dodder which flows through my constituency is being destroyed not so much by factory effluent as by people casting their rubbish into it.  However, I think a new spirit is awakening and that the people are more co-operative in efforts to see that our rivers are not despoiled. I am afraid that the law which prohibits pollution by industrial effluent is too weak.  I served for many years as a member of the Dublin Board of Fishery Conservators and I can tell how hard it is to make a pollution charge stick against an industrial firm.  Even when the effluent discharge has been seen entering the river, one must prove that the effluent came from the factory concerned and that it was dangerous to fish life generally.</P>
    <P>In this respect, many of our industrial firms seem to be entering the spirit of the 20th century.  Their attitude to water pollution is undergoing a change and I know one firm which voluntarily have undertaken to put in a more elaborate filter plant than is required by law.  Of course, pollution of rivers cannot be stopped entirely by the law.  It can be stopped only if the people, particularly those living near <Col N="572" /> rivers, are determined to stop the despoiling of rivers by careless and indeed criminal acts of dumping rubbish and other filth into them.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing with water pollution particularly because it is a big problem in the city.  Air pollution is probably more important.  If one stands at a bus stop in a busy thoroughfare or at a junction one has to move back from the kerb to avoid the fumes.  If one tries to drive behind a heavy lorry one must close all the windows to keep out the polluted air being given off by defective engines.  I suggest that our public transport undertaking should look at their buses more carefully to ensure that they are not contributing greatly to air pollution in the cities.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha are examining this matter in several cities and they have announced that their preliminary studies will be completed in about a year.  We can then look forward to very definite action being taken by the Government.  The USA spends a fantastic amount of money on anti-pollution measures in respect of rivers and lakes.  We do not have to spend a fraction of that in order to preserve our rivers and our pure air.  We must however face the problem energetically. Otherwise we cannot conquer the problem and our people will consequently suffer lung disease and other ailments. When we think of the amounts of money we spend to try to cure people, surely our motto should be that&mdash; prevention is much better than cure.</P>

      <P>We must be tough with anybody found polluting rivers or carelessly contributing to air pollution, one of the curses of the 20th century.  We deplore the fact that many people take drugs.  They suffer from a decision of their own making but disease from pollution of the air is not the result of a decision of any child on his way to school or of any old man or woman who suffers from weak chests and who have their sufferings increased one hundred times by inability to breathe pure air.  If the law is too lenient in these matters it is time we looked at it again and saw to it that the penalties <Col N="573" /> are sufficient.  I know we should not have to threaten people with the law in order to make them fight pollution, which can do as much damage to the rebel as to the conservative.</P>
      <P>I hope that when they come round to examining all the measures that can be taken against pollution the Government will have a centralised unit or a department which will ensure that all anti-pollution laws will be consolidated so that they can be enforced more effectively.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned the case of an oil tanker running ashore on our beaches.  This is a possibility but it is unlikely to happen.  Oil tankers do not break up very often.  The amount of oil consumed in various ways in our community creates problems.  In the port of Dublin when there is an oil leakage from a vessel the Dublin Port and Docks Board have an oil boom cast around the vessel and the oil is taken away.  It would not be possible to do this if a tanker were beached off Wexford.</P>
      <P>We must tackle the problems of air and water pollution.  We must modernise the means of disposing of the city's refuse and sewage.  We must educate our people to care for our rivers and beaches.  We will improve the quality of life in this island by doing so.  We may not have the resources of the larger nations but we have a smaller problem in regard to pollution than other countries have.  Many other nations have great industrial plants. Britain, the US, France and Germany have many industries.  We have an opportunity of seeing for ourselves the fate of other countries, and it would be a crime if we did not benefit from their experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde has mentioned that one of the lakes in Switzerland has no marine life in it because of pollution. We must pay tribute to the Greater London Council and the London Port Authority for the work they have done on the River Thames.  A few years ago a fall into the Thames meant death from poison.  These authorities have worked hard and fish life has again appeared in the Thames at London. The river has been cleansed.  The Liffey is smaller than the Thames and <Col N="574" /> is not as polluted as the Thames was. We can tackle the problem of the Liffey pollution.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of pollution and as individual citizens we must try to prevent it.  We must be careful in regard to legislation which we intend to pass in order to ensure that the coming generations will have really fresh air. Pollution must be regarded as a disease which must be conquered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very impressed by Deputy Moore's speech and by his frank recognition of the scale of the problem.  I hope we can infer from the Deputy's speech that his party will agree with the motion which is before the House and that the legislation which is asked for will be forthcoming. Such legislation would receive support.  It is clear from the discussion that it would receive support from all sides of the House.  This problem need not become an issue in party politics.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore made one point which I would like to differ from, but not in any very controversial way.  The Deputy said that Dublin was not so bad as some English cities.  This may be so.  The Deputy recognised what had been done in London.  I have seen it stated authoritatively that the level of pollution in Dublin is higher than that in London, not proportionately, but absolutely.  I would like to hear comment on that.  We have no reason to be proud of this situation when we compare the relative sizes of Dublin and London and the level of industrialisation of the two cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore made the point that this problem of pollution was one which could not be dealt with entirely by the law and that the people must be encouraged to play their part.  We would all agree with that with the qualification that certain owners of factories have a definite economic interest in pollution.  It would cost them money to rectify the problem in their own premises.  Life being what it is, they are not likely to do anything until they are obliged to do so.  This essentially is where the law comes in.  The State, in exhorting members of the public to set about cleansing operations, is in a better position to do so if it shows by <Col N="575" /> positive action that it is seriously concerned about the matter.  There is as yet very little concrete sign of serious active concern about the problem.  I am informed that harbour authorities can only fine shipowners £10 for discharging oil into a harbour.  The cost of paying the fine may be much less than what would be involved in refraining from discharging the oil, which surely should be discouraged.</P>
    <P>I lived in New York for some years and it has the sad distinction of being one of the most polluted cities in the world both in regard to water and air. The air pollution was so bad that the act of breathing during certain days of the summer months was accompanied by a positive sensation of disgust and discomfort.  On certain bad days during the summer months appeals were broadcast for people to shut their windows and not to go out on the streets if it could be avoided because of the health hazards of air pollution. In New York, as distinct from London, there is a strong tradition of unrestricted free enterprise.  One does not interfere with business if it can be avoided.  Derisory fines are imposed on firms whose plants and chimneys are belching refuse into the air constantly throughout the day and throughout the year.  In London and Paris, as in most European cities, there is a tradition of public responsibility and control, and the public interest coming first and of the right to control anti-social activities by business enterprises being firmly asserted.  We on these benches feel that this country is inclined in practice, whatever language we use, to drift more in the New York direction, that is to say to let business rip.  There is a significant index there in that the degree of pollution in the city of Dublin in relation to the degree of industrialisation must be one of the highest if not the highest in the world.  When I came back here nearly two years ago from New York one of the things I looked forward to was the pleasure of breathing unpolluted air and having unpolluted water around.  I found it was not as bad as New York but it certainly was not very good.  In fact it was extraordinarily bad for a city of the <Col N="576" /> size of Dublin.  Around Howth, where I live, the water is heavily polluted by untreated sewage.</P>
    <P>In the constituency I represent the little streams are foul smelling, full of effluent.  I was on a deputation today to Dublin Corporation about the state of the Santry River which flows through my constitutency and compares with the Camac River which other Deputies have spoken about here.  This problem affects the daily life certainly of everybody in Dublin.  People want to know when some halt will be called to this.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a relatively new Minister and he has an opportunity to serve the country very well by action on this.  The tendency so far has been to treat it as something which can be handled more or less by piecemeal methods, as a matter of routine.  The condition of other cities shows it cannot effectively be handled that way.  It has to be handled under a general plan and with a policy which puts anti-pollution high on the list.  Deputy Moore mentioned the cost of dealing with this problem.  The cost may be high but the cost of not dealing with it may be far higher.  This has been shown by the example of other cities.</P>
    <P>It is clear that tourism will for many years be a major source of revenue for us and one of the opportunities we have in that regard is to offer people from the crowded cities of Europe and America a cleaner and more open environment, which we have had, and which we are in process of letting slip. This is not the main reason for dealing with this problem.  The main reason is for the health and comfort of our own citizens and for our concern for the state of this island.  We on these benches would like to express the hope that the Minister, in winding up this debate, will hold out to us the clear promise of early legislation, spelling out an integrated conservation policy and a conservation policy with teeth in it which will make it unrewarding for free enterprise to pollute the air and the water.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to make an appeal to the public, who can play a large part in reducing some of the pollution which <Col N="577" /> takes place by indiscriminate dumping on the roadsides, into the rivers and elsewhere.  A start must be made in the schools.  We must educate the children and the public at large to ensure that this indiscriminate dumping, which has become part and parcel of life on the perimeter of the city, ceases.  People dump things into the small streams and rivers which become polluted.</P>
      <P>The Camac, one of the rivers in my own area, can only be described as an open sewer.  The city medical officer told us on one occasion that the river was not polluted but an examination by an outside body indicated there was a high level of pollution, that there was no fish life whatever there, that the industrial waste which flowed from the factories adjacent to the Camac was responsible for the large-scale pollution which has taken place in this particular river.  You would not need a map on a warm day in summer to find the Camac River which flows through Inchicore, because if you had any sense of smell whatsoever you would find it. The food in the few houses adjacent to this river becomes contaminated if it is kept in the cupboards or presses for long periods during the summer.</P>
      <P>The local authority have not taken the necessary action in relation to the elimination of pollution in this particular area.  It is unfortunate that for many years the people on the banks of this river had to endure this type of pollution.  The colour of the water is an indication of the high level of pollution in this river.  We know it comes from industrial centres.  I would not advocate that industry should be closed down because of this problem of pollution but I believe industry should be able to equip itself to ensure that the waste which flows from the paper mills and the other factories on the banks of the Camac should be disposed of in the sewers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago the corporation sent a number of people to study the problem of pollution in other countries in relation to the paper making industry and other industries. They found the type of pollution which <Col N="578" /> takes place in the Camac from the paper mills cannot be eradicated because there is no type of equipment in those mills and factories to do this work.  If the pollution from the paper mills and the factories was diverted into the sewers the rivers would become clean.  There is a sewerage problem in this particular area at the moment and I know it is not possible to have this waste siphoned off into the sewers. The necessary action should be taken at this stage, where industries are being developed, to ensure they have the necessary devices and the necessary means for eradication of pollution from their factories.</P>
      <P>When this matter was raised at the local authority we were told that the alternative to the pollution of the Camac was the closing down of industry. I do not advocate this and I am quite sure no Deputy in the House advocates that industry which has been there for long periods should be closed down.  However, I believe every effort should be made to eliminate pollution.</P>
      <P>We know that CIE are another concern who pollute the city.  What I can only describe as a kind of &ldquo;black death&rdquo; is pumped out at bus stops. In many cases CIE buses have their terminus stage in the centre of housing estates.  When these vehicles are started people who live in nearby houses must close their doors and windows because of the fumes that are caused by the buses.</P>

      <P>I have established an all-Department committee which is considering fully the question of air and water pollution.  They will make recommendations to me on the need for any new legislation if they consider such legislation desirable.  I appreciate the tone of the debate.  I am very concerned about this matter; it disgusts me to see polluted water.  I am also concerned about air pollution.  There is legislation available to us at present which I am anxious to see enforced more rigidly.  The committee to which I have referred are carrying out a thorough investigation into this matter and they will be making a report to me.  The committee was appointed some months ago&mdash;I thought the House was aware of this fact.</P>
      <P>In relation to the pollution of the sea by oil spillage from tankers, full responsibility has been given to me by the Government to set up machinery to cope with any disaster in this area. I have been in touch with the coastal local authorities and I have asked county engineers to take preliminary steps in the event of such a disaster while I am making overall arrangements to cover this position generally in the future.</P>

      <P>It is only too easy for a Minister to say &ldquo;very soon&rdquo; or &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  It will take a considerable time to carry out a full investigation and to submit positive recommendations. The water resources division of An Foras Forbartha are carrying out extensive quality tests on all the rivers throughout the country.  This kind of information is essential before any positive decisions are made in order to establish the extent of pollution.  However, we must be thankful that the situation certainly is not critical in this country.  I would be keen to ensure if legislation was required to preserve the natural environment that we would have that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the situation is not critical.  We have <Col N="580" /> localised water pollution.  The river Camac is in a disgusting state and other rivers in Dublin are in a bad state.  However, in regard to this problem generally we are lucky.  The operation of the 1963 Planning and Development Act gives local authorities and the Minister dealing with appeals very strong powers to ensure that new industrial development is constructed in such a way that it will not contribute to pollution of water and air.  There are very strict regulations, and regulations regarding atmospheric pollution came into force at the beginning of this year.  We have been doing a lot and the situation is still under close examination by an all-Department committee.  I take it this motion will not come before the House again before the autumn, by which time I hope to have the report.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business (Resumed): - Redundancy Payments Bill, 1970: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 9, at the reference to section 7, to delete &ldquo;The substitution in subsection (5) of &lsquo;104 weeks&rsquo; for &lsquo;208 weeks&rsquo;&rdquo; and substitute:</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House went into Private Members' time at 6 p.m. this evening the Labour Party were strongly pressing the Minister to agree to have retrospective effect given to the Redundancy Payments Bill to the 22nd January, 1971.  In submitting amendment No. 21, we consider we were being reasonable.  Section 7 of the proposed Bill reduces from four years to two years the qualification for redundancy payments.  I do not propose to press the Minister at great length on this matter but I would point out to him that this Bill was circulated first in July, 1970.  We had the First Stage in February and we are now taking Committee Stage.  I assume we shall <Col N="581" /> finish Committee Stage tonight but, I suppose, it will be several months at least before the Bill has passed through the Seanad and before the signature of the President is obtained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, employers have been alerted that the qualification period is being reduced to two years.  Advance notice has been given to them that if they were to lay off people some months or weeks ahead of the new statutory minimum period, in effect, they would not be obliged to pay redundancy compensation.  Therefore, the Labour Party have put in a modest, conservative and very circumspect amendment, namely, having the operative date applicable from 22nd January, 1971.  This is not legislative retrospection to the extent the Minister might allege.  As the Minister is aware, this is known in the Finance Act and in the proposals made by the Government in relation to the Prices and Incomes Bill, which the Government withdrew in indecent haste.  Therefore, the concept of retrospection is not unique in legislation.  We are simply ensuring that any industrial worker who has more than two years served will qualify as from 22nd January, 1971.  On that basis we commend the amendment to the Minister.  We are aware of his fear in relation to retrospection but we think this amendment is worthy of consideration. The cost involved would be quite fractional and the amendment proposed will not materially change the Bill.  In fact, it rather simplifies matters so far as the Bill is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael supported this amendment.  I do not believe in retrospection but the Government have brought this into other Departments; for example, in regard to the collection of money.  In this instance, it is only a case of paying out money given by the workers and employers.  This Bill was introduced in July last but the delay in dealing with it was the fault of the Government.  During the last year we have spent more time discussing the troubles in Fianna Fáil with the result that legislation was not dealt with.  As Fianna Fáil are responsible for the delay in this case, they should at least help in the matter now and agree to the 22nd January, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> I said earlier that it would be better to pass the Bill straight away without any amendment to have it enacted at least a month earlier and provide benefit for more workers.  Since this was mentioned last July and was introduced in January many employers both good and bad&mdash;the good employers have been holding on to their staff so that they may benefit from it and the bad employers have been trying to get rid of them before it becomes law&mdash;have felt that they cannot hold on to their employees <i>ad infinitum.</i> If the Minister accepted this amendment and if these people had to be let go they would get the benefit of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given my views on the retrospective part of the legislation earlier on.  It is not correct to say that the amount of money involved would be small.  I think it would be quite formidable. It would depend on the date on which the Bill is finally passed through both Houses and goes to the President for signature.  I do not think it would be wise, apart from the difficulties of administering the legislation retrospectively.  The cost to the fund would be fairly heavy.  Certainly, there should be no principle of retrospection in legislation of this kind.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the Government had difficulties that held up the Bill.  The Bill contains many matters all of which were the subject of full discussion with the interested parties.  I do not think it is even fair to say that time was lost in the preparation of the Bill for Second Stage, or any stage for that matter.  This legislation was prepared honourably and in the proper spirit.  The interested parties were given an opportunity of knowing what we were aiming for and of making suggestions as to what form the Bill should take.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be pushed into the side lanes of discussions that are not relevant but I do not think anything that happened in the House in relation to the Government position consumed any time other than what the Opposition consumed in trying to stunt on the Bill in order to jockey themselves into position for their own benefit.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's concern with regard to retrospective legislation if he is dealing with the cost, but I cannot understand these repeated references by the Minister to objections in principle.  He is a Minister of a Government which enacted retrospective legislation, and threatened to do so again in the very recent past in relation to the Prices and Incomes Bill.  This is the big stick that was waved by the Minister for Finance at that time.</P>
      <P>I can readily appreciate the Minister's difficulty if he is worried about the cost and whether the fund will bear it, but all we are asking is that he should undertake to look at this matter again, between now and the Report Stage.  We are anxious&mdash;possibly more anxious than the Minister&mdash;that there should be no delay in the passing of this legislation.  There are some very good sections in the Bill.  There is no doubt about that.  We are anxious that people should be able to avail of the improvements as quickly as possible. Irrespective of whose fault it is, a certain amount of delay has occurred in the enactment of this legislation.  We are not looking for anything unreasonable. We are suggesting that the date should be 22nd January.  We are not anxious to press this amendment but we will press it.  We are asking the Minister to give an undertaking to look into the financial aspects of the amendment and give up this nonsense of talking about objecting to retrospective legislation in principle.  They are a crowd who have done that time and time again.  Will the Minister look at it?</P>

    <P>This amendment is a straightforward addition to the Schedule.  Unfortunately in existing redundancy legislation both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic there are no guidelines which would help us with this amendment we are proposing.  We are suggesting that there should be some provision whereby it would be possible to link up the various periods of seasonal employment for workers who can be classified by and large as being seasonal workers. We have given a definition which may seem to be rather tortuous but it is the best we can get from available legislation.  In simple terms we are suggesting that if an employee was or is laid off or dismissed or his employment was interrupted, and it was or is reasonable for the employee to believe that he would be permitted to resume employment at the end of the lay off period or the interruption, that interruption shall be deemed to be a lay off as distinct from a redundancy. We have also put in a paragraph providing that &ldquo;notice&rdquo; means a written notice.</P>
    <P>We feel that these two propositions are fair and just, bearing in mind that there are quite a large number of industrial <Col N="585" /> workers in manufacturing industry, notably in the food manufacturing industry, working on a seasonal basis, who could claim that this legislation does not cater for them. Accordingly we strongly recommend to the Minister that he should consider amendment No. 22 most carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the type of amendment with which I would have no quarrel except that I consider it is unnecessary.  The provisions made in the Bill for continuity of employment are more than sufficient.  In section 9 we make provision whereby continuity is presumed until determined otherwise by the appeals tribunal.  That in itself is a tremendous step forward in relation to the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>I do not think any of the experience we draw from the past would indicate a serious need for a subsection of this kind.  The Redundancy Appeals Tribunal has invariably taken the view, in determining the question of continuity of employment, that the important factor is the general pattern of that employment, the employment looked at in retrospect.  I would cite the case of dockers, and I think this is the type of person the Deputies proposing the amendment have in mind.  In the computation of continuity for the purpose of rationalisation or decasualisation in the docks, continuity of employment has been accepted in the spirit of this legislation. The provision we propose to make for a presumption of continuity in section 9 is another safeguard.  The Deputies are only seeking to make assurance doubly sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly there is an improvement in this Bill, section 9 (a) of which says:</P>
      <P>a person's employment during any period shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been continuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dislike putting a redundancy tribunal under the obligation to act on a presumptive basis, on the basis that one is guilty unless one is proved innocent; we prefer to approach the matter from the other angle, that if the person is in continuous employment then, by definition, he most certainly is.  I am pleased <Col N="586" /> the Minister has said that the general pattern of employment is taken into account by the tribunal.  It is unfortunate that is not contained in the legislation.  I know that intermittent lay-off in relation to employment such as that of dockers is taken into account by the tribunal; nevertheless, in the light of our comments on this, I would ask the Minister to reconsider it with a view to providing a better definition of continuous employment than saying: &ldquo;We will take it you are continuous unless you are proved not to be continuous&rdquo;, which is a rather cumbersome way of approaching the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The background history of the Principal Act and the processing of cases, strengthened by the presumption of continuity of employment in section 9, goes a long way, if not all the way, to cover any cases that one could imagine.  I would remind the Deputy that presumption of continuity until it is proven otherwise is a safeguard for the employee, because he is held not to be in the same position to lay his hands on records.  It is much easier for the employer to find the necessary records to prove his case.  The provision in the Bill makes it easy for the employee.  I am not opposed to the proposal; I just think it is unnecessary.</P>

    <P>From the Labour Party point of view this is a major amendment and I would give the Minister advance warning&mdash; and we are not acting in a threatening manner&mdash;that if we cannot reach some agreement we intend to divide the House on this.  Unless our amendment is accepted it is quite possible that a worker who is laid off and who subsequently goes back to work and finds that his employer has put a new employee in his place, can be told by the employer, without being specifically declared redundant: &ldquo;I am sorry.  I have enough workers.&rdquo; The worker is, in effect, redundant.  The net effect of adding this subsection is that, if an employer fills what one would call lay-off vacancies, the laid-off employees would be deemed to be redundant. This is a very important amendment because we are of the opinion, with admittedly only 18 months or two years experience of the 1968 Act, that this particular contingency, one might <Col N="588" /> say the doomsday contingency, to borrow a Government word, should be taken care of under section 11.

      <P>I want to say at the outset I am totally opposed to this amendment which runs contrary to one of the basic principles of the Act.  The amendment appears to take no account of the principle in the Act that redundancy does not occur when a worker who is dismissed is directly replaced in precisely the same job. This would be actually using the provisions of the Redundancy Act to compel an employer to retain or re-employ a worker.  It goes a bit too far in that direction and I would not accept it at all.  It is not necessary to talk long or loudly on this amendment which seeks to use the very generous provisions of this Bill and the Principal Act to intimidate an employer or, to use a nicer word, to prevent an employer from laying off employees whom he might for legitimate reasons want to get rid of.  Surely an employer must have some freedom to lay off employees if he wishes to?</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I heard the Minister correctly or not.  I can agree with him up to a point, but I cannot agree that an employer can use redundancy to get rid of a man whom he has taken a dislike to, which in the normal circumstances would be argued out between the employer <Col N="589" /> and the trade union concerned. An employer cannot use redundancy to get rid of a man simply because he does not like the colour of his eyes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister really meant what he said.  I could not understand the Minister for Labour seriously using the expression he has just used.  In effect what he has said is that if an employer wants to avoid paying redundancy and he feels that in 12 months, 18 months or two years his firm may in fact be going to reduce its work force or lay off men, he can find an excuse and sack men with 40 years experience and replace them by men who will not have any claim under the Redundancy Payments Act.  This is, of course, a matter between the trade unions and the employer and employers will not be allowed to get away with it.  What the Minister has done tonight, and it is terrible thing, is to put into the minds of people who make it their business to employ non-trade unionists whenever they can get hold of them, to avoid paying redundancy pay by simply dismissing those who would be entitled to redundancy and take on somebody else in their place. According to the Minister if an employer dislikes the fact that he might have to pay a couple of hundred pounds redundancy pay in a few months or a year's time, that is sufficient reason for him to sack an employee and replace him with somebody else.  If that is the Fianna Fáil philosophy on worker/employer relations I am not a bit surprised that we have so much trouble with workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If we give him time to reflect on this I am sure the Minister will concede that we have a very serious point.  Under the existing Act it appears that there is nothing to stop an employer saying, &ldquo;Right, I am laying you off, lads, for a couple of weeks; it is purely a temporary lay-off in your employment.&rdquo;  The business may not be doing very well and in good faith an industrial worker, and any one of the 800,000 covered under this legislation, would have no option but to accept that temporary lay-off because of the limited powers of workers.  When they report back for work, the employer under this legislation can say, &ldquo;I have taken on somebody else.  The job you were laid off from is filled.  I am terribly sorry, but there is no employment.&rdquo;  In this way the employer does not become liable and there is no legal defence on the part of the worker who makes application. In this situation the very purpose of the Redundancy Payments Act could be self-defeated because a noxious incentive to employers is being left in the Bill.  This should be eliminated.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of employers who lay off workers take back workers in the same positions as they have previously vacated but with the question of redundancy compensation entering into it employers take a closer look at their employees' records in terms of length <Col N="591" /> of service because they now have statutory obligations under the Redundancy Payments Act.  When it comes to hard cash we all tend to look at our liabilities very sharply.  I cannot see why the Minister is unduly worried or why he is acting on the presumption that we in the Labour Party are being unduly harsh on employers.  If an employer comes to the conclusion that a particular worker should not be taken back that is an industrial relations matter.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, it can be thrashed out. We say here &ldquo;on a date which is four weeks later&rdquo;, which means the employee would have to go back within a month.  That is a fair and reasonable proposition.  He could not go back at any old time and claim back his employment. This amendment was very carefully drafted and I think it is worthy of consideration by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be adamant. This is a contravention of one of the principles of the Act.  This is not the place at which to deal with wrongful dismissal.  We have been talking about the preparation of legislation in regard to that for some time and we have a great deal of information compiled on it.  This amendment expressly states &ldquo;shall be deemed to have been dismissed for reasons of redundancy&rdquo;. I think that is going too far.  Irrespective of what he was dismissed for, if he is not re-employed within a certain period an employee will be deemed to have been dismissed for redundancy. Deputy Belton argued that this is fair. I think it goes too far.</P>

Is the Minister contending that that is legitimate?</P>

      <P>This is the third amendment the Minister has completely misinterpreted this evening.  When he was half way through reading this amendment now it was quite clear to me that he had misinterpreted because nowhere does it say that there is insistence that people should be re-employed within four weeks.  The amendment says that if eventually an employee's job is filled but he is not re-employed to fill the job he &ldquo;shall be deemed to have been dismissed for reasons of redundancy&rdquo;. That is a different thing altogether.  The Minister should give credit where credit is due.  We went to a great deal of trouble preparing these amendments and we are now trying to argue them reasonably but, in the face of the <Col N="593" /> opposition on the part of the Minister, we would be better off not wasting time here and waiting for a change of Government to get something through. Because of what has happened to other amendments I am quite certain the Minister has not taken the trouble to study this.  If he were not an intelligent man I could understand it, but he is a very intelligent man; he should easily understand what is meant here if he takes the trouble to find out.</P>
      <P>We are saying that if a number of men are employed and their jobs close down temporarily and subsequently other people are put into their jobs, then they should be entitled to claim redundancy pay.  Even if the employer says they are not redundant, the jobs are there but he has put other people into them; as far as these people are concerned they are being declared redundant. The Minister has issued a clarion call to any employer who dares to lay off people when they become qualified for redundancy pay and to replace them with others who are not so qualified.  The Minister will not get away with it where the trade unions are concerned, but unfortunate unorganised workers will be caught, as they were caught before.  The Minister is taking up a disgraceful position.  We will put this to a division and see how many of the Minister's supporters will be prepared to vote for it and justify it to the House afterwards.</P>

      <P>It is not sufficient to argue that my reason for refusing to accept the amendment is that I do not understand it.  It is all very well to cite a case in which a firm closes down and reopens with different employees; this is a situation I could hardly visualise. It is something no one could expect to get away with.  According to the amendment, if a firm lays off a man for any good reason and does not re-employ him he will be deemed to be entitled to a redundancy payment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I read the whole amendment because a selective reading of portions of the amendment might give in the Official Report an impression which is not correct?  The amendment simply says:</P>
      <P>An employee who has been laid-off and who is not subsequently allowed to resume the work for which he was employed to do (as soon as the employer is able to provide the work) shall be deemed to have been dismissed for reasons of redundancy, at the time at which resumption of work is not allowed or on a date which is four weeks later than the date of lay-off, whichever is the sooner.</P>
      <P>The amendment is quite clear.  First of all, the job closes down.  The man is laid off.  Subsequently the job restarts and someone else is employed to do it. It is as simple as that.  We claim that, when that happens, the person who loses his job under those circumstances is redundant and should be entitled to redundancy pay.  The Minister says that is wrong; it would allow someone to steal the pension fund, or hit the employer on the head, or burn down the factory.  This is what the Minister says we are talking about.  The Minister knows quite well we are talking about nothing of the kind.  We are talking about the genuine worker and the redundancy tribunal is the body which would subsequently interpret this.  At present they cannot do that.  This should be included in the Bill because it will be years before another such measure comes before the House providing an opportunity of amendment.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is extremely suspicious of our amendment it is open to him at Report Stage to bring in his own amendment.  Let us take the example of a garage in Dublin or down the country.  At a seasonal peak the employer takes on a large number of motor mechanics and keeps them for a number of years.  At the end of the second or third year they are qualified for redundancy compensation in the event of a normal lay off.  He has a lay off, say, around the summer period and when he finds business picking up again we maintain that if he does not offer that employment to those whom he has laid off then within a four weeks period they should be declared redundant.  That is fair and reasonable and I do not think it in any way sets out to catch an employer. The four weeks period is very fair and it stops employers from simply laying people off and deliberately not re-employing them.  The Minister admitted that there could be a genuine anomaly under the Bill and it is the genuine cases that make good law.  While we are talking repetitively now on section 24 it is simply in an effort to get the Minister to see the merit of it because it is worthy of very serious consideration by him and by his advisers.</P>

      <P>I do not know if there is much good in continuing on these lines.  At its best this is an undesirable amendment and at its worst it is an amendment which seeks to use the Redundancy Act as a vehicle for ensuring that people will be re-employed. In other words, it can also be argued they will not be laid off if an employer knows that he must in certain circumstances re-employ them or else; it is using this legislation as a vehicle for preventing lay off.  I believe the way to do that is in a separate Bill, which is overdue in this House, dealing with wrongful dismissal. If this is what the Deputies are arguing, this is not the place to do it because it could cover cases that it would not be desirable to cover.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that we are trying to embody in this Bill a protection against wrongful dismissal?  What we are trying to do by this amendment&mdash;and if the Minister really understood the amendment he would realise it&mdash;is to stop abuses of the Redundancy Act.  The Minister seems to think that the cases that might be covered by this amendment are so few and far between that they do not count.  The Minister is not right.  The dead meat industry comes to my mind.  It is normal practice every year in that industry to lay off quite a number of people at a particular time of the year.  That is a fairly big industry in which thousands of people are employed.  If 20 men are laid off on seniority the lay off should take, say, six weeks.  At the end of the six weeks 20 men are re-employed but five of them are new workers and five of the people who were laid off and accepted the lay off in good faith are told that their jobs are gone.  It is not redundancy because 20 men are back at work.  Redundancy does not occur. All we are trying to do is to ensure that this Bill will not be used by employers for various reasons&mdash;they want to get rid of people, they do not want to re-employ them, they tell them they are going because of redundancy.  This is accepted by the people who are going but five of them do not get back. There is no redundancy because the employer still has 20 men.  That is what this amendment is meant to cover. Surely the Minister can see that?</P>

If an employer regards a particular employee as being quite unsuitable for his continued employment nobody in the Labour Party will dispute the employer's right to say: &ldquo;You can no longer remain in my employment&rdquo; subject to trade union agreement if there is a trade union there. If there is no trade union the employee has no redress anyway.  We do not dispute that at all but we do not want Mickey Mouse lay offs, in other words an employer saying: &ldquo;We will let you go for four or five weeks.  Come back and see us in a month.&rdquo;  When the fellow arrives back a month later he finds the vacancy is filled.  The employer says: &ldquo;I never declared you redundant. I only laid you off on an intermittent basis.  I am very sorry for you but that is the end of the matter.&rdquo;  In other words, the purpose of the amendment is to put industrial relations on a more democratic basis in the broadest and most humanitarian sense.  This anomaly does exist under the Redundancy Act and the Minister should consider the matter again.</P>

      <P>The Minister was talking about the protection of the employee and the question of unfair dismissal. This whole question is going round and round now.  I am a trade union official and one thing I will never do is to ask an employer to retain a man if he can prove that that man is either undesirable and not prepared to do his job or unable or unwilling to do it.  No responsible trade union in this country or elsewhere should try to keep a man in a job in such circumstances.  What we resent is a situation in which an employer would lay a man off with other people, not tell him why, and then bring somebody else in the back door to replace him.  If an employer wants to lay a man off for a good reason he should be man enough to face him and do it.  This brings us back to the Minister's reference to legislation. It is of this that employers are scared.  An employer, for instance, can lay a man off with others and later take the others back, leaving the man without a job.  Our aim is to protect the worker from such treatment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy behind redundancy payments is not that they should tide a worker over a period of unemployment; earning related benefits are intended for that purpose.  The stated purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate for a loss of security, and to encourage workers to accept redundancy without damaging industrial relations. A redundancy payment is compensation for the loss of a right which a long-term employee has in his job.  Just as a property owner has a right in his property and when <Col N="599" /> he is deprived he is entitled to compensation, so a long-term employee is considered to have a right analogous to a right of property in his job, he has a right to security and his rights gain in value with the years.  Therefore, when he is deprived of them by reason of redundancy, Parliament has provided that he is entitled to a redundancy payment as compensation for the loss of that right.  The purpose of redundancy is to compensate a worker for loss of job, irrespective of whether that loss leads to unemployment.  It is to compensate him for loss of security, possible loss of earnings and fringe benefits, and the uncertainty and anxiety of change of job.  These may all be present even if a man gets a fresh job immediately.  Unemployment benefit on the other hand, is designed to provide a regular source of income during unemployment. There is a distinction between the compensation for loss of office, and the relief of hardship.</P>
    <P>By this amendment we are not forcing any employer to take a worker back. What we are trying to do is to ensure that if an employer refuses to take a worker back that the worker is deemed to be redundant.  If, on the other hand, the employer says: &ldquo;I will not take you back, you are a so-and-so employee&rdquo;, it is an industrial relations matter.  If he says: &ldquo;The job has been filled, you have had it, out you go&rdquo;, a different set of circumstances arises. The Minister should be able to see the point and I do not propose to speak further on it unless the Minister persists in his interpretation.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be repetitive on this.  Would the Deputy not agree that it is in contravention of the whole principle in the Act that a person is not redundant if he is replaced by another worker?  That is one of the principles accepted&mdash;that redundancy does not occur when there is a replacement.  My fear is that there are many such cases which the amendment would cut across.</P>

      <P>In this case, where there should be a straightforward sacking, the employer wants to get rid of a man.  All right, he can sack him because the man is not good enough for his job.  What the Minister is doing is trying to use the Redundancy Bill to sack such a man.  Deputy Desmond said this is one thing that will ruin industrial relations because you have an employer who is not man enough to face up to this task.  The employer should face the man straight, tell him he is not good enough and get another man.  The employer could get rid of three or four men and take in three or four others.  That is disgraceful.  If it were allowed to happen you would have no industrial relations left anywhere.</P>

      <P>I will conclude on our amendment.  It is time we had a vote on this.  Some of the statements made by the Minister this evening in support of his reluctance to accept our amendment could have a detrimental effect on industrial relations in the country.  All I can say is that recently I have had the pleasure of reading some sharp views on some aspects of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, <Col N="602" /> by a man well known to the Minister, Mr. Murphy of the Federation of Rural Workers, who wrote:</P>
      <P>Trade union officials will readily agree that the lay-off provisions of the Act put very difficult obstacles in the path of an employee seeking compensation, especially as only the employer is in a position to know when the situation of temporary redundancy is likely to come to an end. When the employer is &ldquo;unable to provide the work for which the employee was employed to do&rdquo;, the cessation of employment is regarded as a lay-off.  There appears to be no limit to the lay-off period unless the employee takes steps to make a claim and gives notice of intention to terminate his employment&mdash;and he might need Counsel's advice to ensure that a claim is properly made.</P>
      <P>In all probability there are two implied obligations on employers, namely, that the employer who gave the notice of the lay-off should also terminate the lay-off and that the employer should let the laid-off employee know when the lay-off situation comes to an end.  It would also seem that the lay-off situation comes to an end when the employer is &ldquo;able to provide the work for which the employee was employed to do&rdquo;&mdash;but clarification is needed.  Be it noted that lay-off is not dismissal.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Minister that he is suffering from the fatigue of the battle-scarred Cabinet at this stage because there is a major distinction between lay-off and dismissal and between lay-off and redundancy and unfortunately in the Minister's mind these distinctions have not yet been clarified.  In the circumstances we have no option but to ask for a vote on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before the reference to section 12, to insert a reference to section 11 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 11&mdash;The addition of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo; ( ) Where by reason of a diminution in the work provided for an employee by his employer (being work of a kind which under his contract the employee is employed to do) the employee's reduced hours of work for any week are less than one half of his normal weekly hours, he shall for the purposes of this Part be taken to be kept on short-time for that week &rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision made in the existing legislation to define that people in this category are in fact workers on short time.

      <P>&ldquo;Section 11&mdash;The addition of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>( ) &lsquo; Notice &rsquo; in this section means a written notice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As in the case of all our amendments, this amendment is very simple and easily understood.  We are anxious to ensure that there will be no question whatever of an employer being able to say that he gave notice to an employee and, subsequently, the employee being put in a position where he is not sure if he got that notice.  This point can be covered by including the words &ldquo;that the &lsquo;notice&rsquo; in this section means a written notice&rdquo;.  It is a simple matter to give a written notice.  We have argued this on another amendment and I suggest that the Minister should not have any difficulty in accepting this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so happy about the matter.  To provide by statute that all notices must be in writing is imposing some difficulty on employers. Probably it is desirable that written notice be given but I am not sure that we should write this into legislation. On amendment No. 19 we argued the wisdom or otherwise of this.  The same arguments have been made in this case and I am not happy about writing it into legislation.  It is a hazard and I do not think it accomplishes very much in <Col N="606" /> the overall context of this Bill which makes so many provisions for so many things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Time and again the Appeals Tribunal have had to deal with people who say they gave notice to an employee but did not give written notice.  In many cases there are grave doubts as to whether notice was given. People have their own way of expressing certain things.  As was evidenced here tonight, we can be very devious if we want to do something and to be able to get out of it afterwards. The unfortunate employee who has been told by the employer to get out of the place and who takes the employer at his word may find that the employer claims he gave him notice to get out. If it suits the employer, he can also say that he did not give notice, that he only said something to the employee in a moment of temper.  Whether an employer employs many people or very few, there is no reason why he should not sit down and write out a notice. Even if the employer does not know how to write, I am sure he will not have any difficulty in finding somebody who will write the notice for him.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate thing is that there is no other way to guarantee that an employee is sure he has received notice of redundancy.  The Department could supply, through their local offices if necessary, very simple forms to which the employer could sign his name or they could publish in the papers a notice setting out how the form should read.  In one way it is rather like making a will.  Wills have been drafted on rather peculiar pieces of paper and the same applies to notices.  It should not be left in doubt whether notice has been given.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the wording of our amendment, we ask him to put in an amendment of his own either on Report Stage or when the Bill is being discussed in the Seanad.  We shall be happy if he specifies in some way that written notice must be given.  It is the only way by which the person will know if he has been dismissed for reasons of redundancy.  It might cover some of the matters we referred to on the previous amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy speaks about having prescribed forms in the employment offices.  We have forms for every conceivable purpose; they are so numerous that I suppose the addition of another one would not be a problem. However, I am thinking of the building industry where people are taken on and laid-off very frequently. Dockers and some other sections also come to mind.  It would mean that someone must always be giving those people pieces of paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not correct.  In the building industry in most cases they get termination slips. In most cases it used to be redundancy and the word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; was put on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of the case where the quite genuine employee and the genuine employer part company and the work is terminated for a time.  If such an employer fails to give the employee this slip of paper he finds himself in trouble although there is nothing deliberate about the fact that he did not give that notice. It is a pity to put a man in the position that the notice must be in writing, particularly when we have made provision for presumption of continuity in redundancy until it is proved otherwise.  This is a fundamental safeguard for the employee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 9 at the reference to <Col N="608" /> section 12 to delete the proposed amendment and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>The deletion of subsection (2) and the substitution of the following:</P>
    <P>(2) An employee shall not be entitled to redundancy payment in respect of lay-off or short-time unless either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he has been laid off or kept on short-time for four or more consecutive weeks, or</P>
    <P>(b)  he has been laid-off or kept on short-time for a series of six or more weeks (of which not more than three were consecutive) within a period of thirteen weeks,</P>
    <P>and at any time after the expiry of either of the foregoing periods, as the case may be, he has given a notice in writing of intention to claim, (which for the purposes of this Act shall be deemed to be a notice of intention to terminate his contract of employment) or, he has given a notice in writing of intention to terminate his contract of employment.</P>
    <P>We suggest that this will simplify section 12 (2) of the Principal Act, and will reduce the number of claim forms. The Minister was talking a few minutes ago about all the different forms that were available for practically every conceivable purpose.  We are offering the Minister an opportunity of reducing the number of forms or at least simplifying the forms that have to be filled.  Most of us who are asked from time to time for advice on form filling find the number of irrelevant questions asked a terrible nuisance.  Sometimes I think someone sits down and decides to put on the forms every question he can think of which will be difficult to answer.  A number of them come to mind with regard to income tax forms or applications for housing loans on which questions, which could not by any stretch of the imagination have anything at all to do with what is being applied for, are included.</P>
    <P>I will grant that an effort seems to have been made to keep the number of questions on the redundancy forms <Col N="609" /> down to a minimum, but on one or two of the forms there appear to be more questions than are really necessary. As I said, this is one way by which the number could be reduced. If the Minister thinks this is a good amendment we would like him to accept it.  If he does not think it is a good amendment we do not propose to force it to a division.</P>

I think, and I am advised too, that consequential changes would be necessary.  I should like to be free to bring in an amendment that will cover what Deputies are seeking to do here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot oblige the Deputy because this is just a straightforward effort at making provision for the amount an employee can receive.  It is an improvement on the 90 per cent total that he can receive.  This is on an actuarial assessment of what the fund can carry.  We have gone as far as is reasonably possible.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is chancing his arm.  On the original Bill we were told that the 90 per cent was on an actuarial basis and, as it turned out, within a year and a half there was a profit of £1½ million in the fund.  Either the Minister must not be very good at his job or the Minister, who introduced the original Bill, chanced his arm in putting it through this House and got away with a lot more than he should have.  We are suggesting that the same thing will happen again.</P>
      <P>It would be easy to give us what we are asking for if the Minister was prepared to concede it.  He does not want to concede it, not because the actuarial report shows that it is not possible, but because it is easier to say no than to get down to doing a bit of work to find out whether it is possible.  If the Minister were prepared to give me figures as to what it would cost I would be prepared to go along with him, but if he will not do that and just says it would cost too much I am not prepared to accept that and in this case we propose to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>We are always being told in these Bills that there is an actuarial basis for this or that. Actuaries are the certainty men, the men who never take a chance of any sort.  It was a great day in the ESB when the actuaries admitted that the manual workers pensions fund could afford to be more generous.  That was a big day.  The heavens had opened. In Germany this 50 per cent is never utilised.  It is usually 75 per cent or three-quarters and yet no one suggests that the Germans work any the less hard because they take three-quarters where we are inclined to take 50 per cent.  That is not so.  The Minister comes into the House after a few <Col N="613" /> years and admits that the original calculation on which the principal Act was based was all wrong.  Nobody will hold it against any Minister if he comes into the House and says: &ldquo;We did not know how it would work out.&rdquo; However, when an amendment of this sort is put before the Minister he will have to do a little better than telling us: &ldquo;The actuarial basis says &lsquo;No&rsquo;&rdquo;. A fig for the actuarial basis on an issue of this sort.  It is not worth tuppence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there must be a certain amount of conjecture in making an estimate of this kind but there are basic limits which one can see should not be exceeded.  One of the things that worry me is that we are putting a strain on the surplus that has accumulated.  The Principal Act is in operation only since 1967.  It is a rather short time in which to judge trends.  We have taken the precaution in time of using the surplus to bring in a very generous amendment.  It should be remembered that the contribution of 1s a week and 9d a week for females has not been changed, except for adjustments arising from decimalisation.  Wages keep moving up and nobody can accurately estimate the disbursements that will be made from the funds in a given year. However, we can make reasonable estimates that will not too far exceed the surplus or will not be too low having regard to the amount in the surplus.  An estimated cost of £450,000 a year could be quite conservative and will depend on how redundancy claims go in the years ahead.  I think I could not be pushed much past the 90 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking factually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me talk factually for a moment.  The Minister is well aware that recently he has made a modest extension in the limit of insurability, from £1,200 to £1,600, and he has brought in an estimated 30,000 <Col N="614" /> people most of them in the higher wage group, the people who do not get sacked.  It is the people at the bottom of the ladder who usually get sacked. All these people he has now brought in will be entitled to pay even the modest 1s. and 9d.  The Minister is not guaranteeing to us that that contribution will not go up.  As things go, I know quite well if the Government want an extra few shillings they will not be very long about deciding that.</P>
      <P>I could understand the Minister being worried about the question of the draw on redundancy pay in regard to the large number of close-downs that are occurring.  I could understand that he would be worrying about the fact that, with the economy in the state it is in at the present time, he is not saving for the rainy day.  The rainy day is here and has been here for the last few months, and the rain is getting heavier.  If that is what the Minister is thinking of, for goodness sake, let him say so, but do not let him say the estimate shows something other than we think it does.  It would be much better for the Minister to tell us honestly what the position is.  Somebody has got to face up to the situation which exists at present if there is to be hope for the economy, hope for the working class of this country. They just cannot continue to be laid off not only from employment but to be laid off completely, after a few months, from the dole as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister could quite easily accept both of these amendments and the difference would not be so great as he suggests.  If he wants to find extra money, I am quite sure he knows all he has to do is to add on a very small amount, and if he wants to do it for other reasons he will add it on anyway. Maybe that is the reason why he is not terribly anxious about this now.  I am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to accept what we have suggested here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Tully, because this Bill was ordered by the Dáil to be printed on 7th July, 1970.  The whole climate has changed in the interval.  If the Minister came clean, that is assuming there is anything to come clean <Col N="615" /> about, and said to us: &ldquo;We are in a difficult situation.  We do not know how it will go and therefore I cannot accept the amendment&rdquo; that would be understandable in present circumstances. I am sure the Minister is not the only one who is not sure about the future.  I agree with Deputy Tully that if the fund gets into any trouble there is an easy way out of it.  I think these two amendments are quite reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the amendment.  If anything unprecedented occurred in the matter of claims for redundancy payments in the near future, then we could go for an increase in the contributions, but we are not basing our plans on having to do that. We are going on what we have in the fund and I think we have made a sound estimation of what it is likely to carry.  The generous provisions that are provided are sufficient to meet the situation in the time ahead.  If at some stage, as could well happen, this good Government could bring about, as it has always done, a tremendous improvement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to put the Minister to the trouble of telling us all the good things the Government did nor do I intend to delay the House enumerating all the things they have failed to do.  Let me simply say that our reason for putting these amendments in now is this: the original Bill was a big step forward in social legislation, and in less than three years we have an amending Bill.  It is only reasonable to suggest that we should <Col N="616" /> not be expected to deal with another amendment in three years' time, and it would be unfair to the Minister's successor to have to be thinking up such an amendment after so short a period.  The proper thing to do is, now that the legislation is before the House, to introduce the improvements which are necessary.  There is no big reason why this should not be done.  I am often amazed at statements made, particularly by Government Ministers who seem to think that it would be a sin if some worker got as much when he was unemployed or ill as he was getting when he was working.  It is the same philosophy which was used by the Minister for Health, Deputy Childers, when he was Minister for Transport and Power, in insisting that a retired worker should not be entitled to more than half his wages between social welfare benefits and any State pension or pension from his employer.</P>
      <P>The same philosophy seems to be running through this provision.  One thing the Minister does not want to do is to give too much to a redundant worker, although he is in a worse position than if he was working because he may be travelling around the place looking for a job and spending more money while looking for a job than when he was actually working.  The Government seem to think it would be a terrible crime&mdash;a crime against whom I do not know&mdash;if these people succeeded in getting as much money while unemployed or redundant as they would get if they were working.  It is this mentality, and not reports or anything else, which is preventing the Minister from accepting the amendment.  I am afraid if he does not accept the amendment before the House we cannot let the matter go at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a plain way of saying, &ldquo;This is a very good Bill. You are improving things generally. We want you to improve them more.&rdquo; The Bill confers tremendous benefits on the workers and is a considerable improvement on the Principal Act of 1967 in that it reduces the qualifying period from four years to two; it improves the redundancy payments, it increases the lump sum payments, it improves the weekly payments; it <Col N="617" /> generally improves the entire qualifying conditions and the actual amounts payable under the Bill.  This is an attempt to improve them still further but I think we are doing quite well.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised at that remark which brings out the difference in approach between the wealthy and those who represent the working class. We are not a bit surprised at the attitude being adopted.  We are not a bit surprised that Deputy Belton, who is a very decent man, agrees with Deputy Brennan, who is also a very decent man, provided no one steps on their toes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what anybody says, I am firmly convinced that if a man who has been working for many years, who through no fault of his own is declared redundant, is attempting to find work and is travelling hither and thither in that attempt, he is just as entitled to have a week's wages, particularly as the fund can afford it, as the man who is working. He is not looking for something for nothing.  The Government from time to time attempt to give the impression that they have a special fund of their own to which they contribute and out of which they withdraw money to distribute to the poor of the country. This is not so.  These people are being paid this money out of the contributions made by the employers and workers and there is no question of the Government taking something out of the Government's pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People looking for a job should get the best that can be given to them. The Minister has said this is a wonderful Bill, there are great improvements in it and we want to make it better. What we are saying is that we have been clamouring for this Bill since the last Act was passed.  A large number <Col N="618" /> of the things we have asked to be included have been included but an equally large number have been left out.  We are now attempting to get the Minister to accept some of the remaining ones and if the Bill goes through without these two amendments being included we feel the Bill will be the worse for it.  We are disappointed that that point has not been taken by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return the compliment to Deputy Tully but if a man gets the same money whether he works or does not work he will not work.  Why should he work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a group of workers who very often find themselves unemployed and again and again they come to me and say they would prefer to be working a full week rather than drawing unemployment benefit from the labour exchange.  Unless he is a very lazy person a man would prefer to work rather than draw unemployment benefit or assistance.  Even those who, because they have a big family, get almost as much when they are unemployed as when they work prefer to work.  I do not think it is fair to say that anybody who gets full wages for a period will remain unemployed.</P>
      <P>I had a case last week of a man who was drawing in unemployment and redundancy pay within ten shillings of what he would have drawn if he had been working and he asked if I could recommend him for a job because he would prefer to be working. I got him a job but I also pointed out that he did not have to take it because he could continue for the balance of 20 weeks to draw almost as much as he would earn but he said that he was tired knocking around at home and would much prefer to be working.  That is the attitude of genuine workers and I feel it would be unfair not to put that on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is being fair to us.  The Minister has not said that experience over the last six months has shown that the fund has been seriously reduced in amount.  There has been a serious period of redundancy over the last six <Col N="619" /> months and the Minister and his Department should have plenty of information which would indicate whether or not these two amendments, if accepted, are likely to create trouble for the fund.  In other walks of life men are paid as much when they are not working as when they are working and this is put into their contracts.  There is no reason why a man cannot be paid nearly as much when he is not working as when he is working.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked earlier about &ldquo;notice&rdquo; but in most worthwhile organisations a week's notice is normal and very rapidly it will be a month's notice for both manual and clerical workers or whatever period is involved. If the Minister can prove that this would be too great a strain on the fund we would be quite prepared to listen to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that I am afraid we would be putting too great a strain on the Fund.  Despite the estimates with regard to the cost of this we must keep within safe limits. If the strain on the Fund is too great we would have to increase the contributions. The principle of allowing a worker who is unemployed to draw the equivalent of 100 per cent of his earnings when working is one that should not be conceded.</P>
      <P>One thing I said earlier which I should like to correct is that I said that an amending Bill could be brought in if further benefit improvements were possible because the Fund was found to be in surplus.  In fact, however, it would not be necessary, in order to raise the rates of benefits to bring in an amending Bill.  The Minister has power to vary Schedules I and III by order to provide for increased rates for lump sum and weekly payments and amending legislation would not, therefore, be necessary if, at any time it was found possible to increase the rates.</P>

      <P>The rates increase automatically with the increases in wages We know quite well that legislation is not necessary to increase them.  We are looking for a different thing altogether and apparently the Minister is not prepared to agree to it.  Before we put down these amendments we prepared for some time.  We have put down several questions to the Minister who always gives us plenty of information in his answers.  It is only fair that we should use this information now because the Minister may not have it with him.  In Question No. 98 of 9th February, 1971, I asked the Minister for Labour:</P>
      <P>the estimated net cost over the existing redundancy payments scheme of (a) relating the lump-sum to twice weekly pay under age 41, (b) relating the lump-sum to twice weekly pay over age 41 and (c) relating the lump sum to 1½ weekly pay over age 41 (with a lump-sum limit in each case of 30 weeks).</P>
      <P>The figures were £700,000, £420,000 and £280,000.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>About 60 per cent of each amount would be borne by the redundancy fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a further pile of information which I do not propose to use now, except the answer to Question No. 153 of 2nd February, 1971, which gives the estimated annual cost to the redundancy <Col N="621" /> fund of improvements in redundancy benefits as follows:</P>
    <P>Extending the scope of the Act to cover workers for four years after they cease to be insurable under the Social Welfare Acts&mdash;£45,000; Reduction in the qualifying period from 208 to 104 weeks&mdash;£140,000&mdash;providing for a minimum of four weekly payments is included in the same figure; Reducing the waiting period for weekly redundancy payments from two weeks to three days&mdash; slight; Allowing each year of service over 41 years of age to count for two weekly payments instead of 1½ as heretofore&mdash;£50,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure should read £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only quoting the information the Minister gave me.  If the Minister has since discovered that the figure is £100,000 he has not informed me and I suggest he should have done so.</P>
      <P>Providing for an extra week's pay for each qualified redundant worker &mdash;£45,000; Increasing the maximum lump sum from the equivalent of 20 weeks' pay to 30 weeks' pay, the fund to bear the full cost of the lump sum over the 20 week equivalent&mdash; £80,000.</P>
      <P>This totals £360,000 and the £50,000 the Minister has just mentioned makes it £410,000.  This is a relatively small sum of extra money.  The fund over a period of less than two years has built up a reserve of £1¾ million.  What I am trying to point out to the Minister is that on the existing insurable limit, and with the extra limit, the people who do not normally become redundant will not be claiming on the fund.  Why the Minister does not take the limit off altogether is something I cannot understand because, in my opinion, the higher you go all you get is subs from them.  In most cases they will be people who will very seldom draw benefit at all because it would be embarrassing for them to do so.  The Minister would, in fact, be building up a tremendous fund.  The Minister is making a grave mistake in penny pinching in this way.</P>

      <P>In page 10, at the reference to Schedule 1 before the proposed amendments to insert:</P>
      <P>The insertion before paragraph 4 of the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>3A.  A weekly payment shall not be paid to a person entitled thereto until the expiration of two weeks (reduced to 3 days as and from the date of the passing of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1971) beginning on the date of the termination of his employment and shall not be paid in respect of that two-week (or three-day) period, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>The related amendment, amendment No. 34, reads:</P>
      <P>In page 10, at the reference to Schedule 1, to delete the proposed new paragraph 4 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>4.  A weekly payment shall not be paid to a person entitled thereto until the expiration of the period of 3 days beginning on the date of the termination of his employment and shall not be paid in respect of that 3-day period.</P>
      <P>This emphasises the reduced waiting period which takes effect on the passing of the Act and retains the effective adjudication in the hands of the Tribunal instead of in the social welfare system.  This is important and I would ask the Minister to make his comments on it now because I am sure he has views on it.</P>

      <P>I do not think anything the Deputy has said so far would justify my acceptance of the amendment. The reduction in the waiting period for redundancy weekly payments is designed to bring into line with the waiting period for social welfare payments and this represents a substantial improvement in the Bill.  It is the same principle as the one applying to the two-thirds and the 90 per cent.  This is a considerable improvement.  The <Col N="623" /> amendment seeks to still further improve the position.  The terms of the Bill are generous and I could not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>What the Minister said in the last couple of minutes is gross exaggeration.  There is no question about that.  He exaggerates the effect of putting this into the Bill. Coming events cast their shadows before and the traumatic experience in the last fortnight may have affected his approach.  I do not say it has, but it may have.  It seems to me he is concerned about minutiae here at times. We got the figures of what this would cost.  If my recollection is right, it would cost about £80,000.  It is no use the Minister cavilling about a fund in which there is, as Deputy Belton said, a surplus of £1,750,000.  The Minister will not even give us an odd quarter of a million or even £100,000 of this fund. But the figure is less than £100,000; it is £80,000.  People are wasting their time here working on Bills and putting down considered amendments when all they meet with is stonewall opposition of this sort.  It is no use the Minister telling me that all wisdom is to be found in his Department.  That is, in fact, what he has been telling us for the last few hours: all wisdom is to be found in his Department and there is no wisdom anywhere else.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In pages 10 and 11 to delete the last entry opposite Schedule 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have something which must be dealt with by the Minister.  Here an <Col N="624" /> effort is being made by somebody in the Minister's Department to try to introduce Social Welfare conditions to the Redundancy Payments Bill.  The proposed new paragraph 15, page 10, is unnecessary.  A similar proposal was deleted from the 1967 Act.  Obviously the fellow who put it in and had to take it out is still hanging round the Department or some of his disciples are still there and decided that they could not get away with this in 1967 but would try it again.  Title to redundancy payments should not depend on social welfare rules or social welfare adjudicators and we will fight this tooth and nail.  The entry opposite Schedule 1 is:</P>
    <P>Schedule 1.</P>
    <P>The substitution for paragraph 4 of the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.  A weekly payment shall not be paid to a person otherwise entitled thereto for any period during which that person is, by virtue of section 15 (2) of the Act of 1952, disentitled to disability benefit or unemployment benefit.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The substitution for paragraph 5 of the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;5.  (a) A weekly payment shall not be paid to a person in respect of any period unless during that period the person was not gainfully employed and the fact that he was not so employed could not reasonably be attributed to the person's own failure or refusal to seek or accept or continue in suitable gainful employment.</P>
    <P>(b)  A person who is entitled to and in receipt of unemployment benefit or disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1970, may be deemed to be not gainfully employed for the purposes of this paragraph.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The insertion in paragraph 6 after &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; of &ldquo;or by whom he was employed when he terminated his contract of employment under section 12; provided that he shall, subject to paragraph 5, in every case be entitled to receive not less than four weekly payments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The substitution for paragraph 7 of the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" />&ldquo;7.  In calculating years of continuous employment for the purposes of paragraph 6 in relation to a person whose employment is terminated after the commencement of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1971, each period of one year during the whole of which the person entitled to the weekly payment was 41 years of age or older shall be reckoned as two completed years of continuous employment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We suggest in pages 10 and 11 to delete the last entry opposite Schedule 1.  The whole idea of redundancy payments is being attacked by the attempt to bring them under social welfare conditions.  I suggest that whatever the Minister does he can never claim to have improved redundancy payments if he includes in a Bill under his name a provision supporting those who have been responsible for throwing so many people off disability benefit.  For instance, people whom their own doctors say are unfit for work are declared not unfit for work by a referee of the Minister's Department. Today I had a letter from a man who has been suffering from arthritis and chest trouble for four years.  He has a wife and two children to support. Some fellow drove down from Dublin to the town of Navan to look at him and decided that he was not unfit for work.  His local doctor tells him that he is unfit for work.  I do not think there is anybody in the country who would give him a job.  The man is hardly able to walk.  For several weeks, while an appeal is being heard, that unfortunate man and his family can be hungry as far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned.</P>
    <P>What the Minister wants to do now is to include in the Redundancy Payments Bill a section which will allow those same people to adjudicate on people who apply for redundancy compensation. We do not want that and I would appeal to the Minister to use his commonsense and to take this out completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is not seriously contending that the provisions of this proposed amendment should be applied to persons directly involved in a trade dispute?  The State <Col N="626" /> should be neutral and to use money contributed for this purpose of redundancy compensation to subsidise one party as against another is a principle I could not concede.  This Bill cannot be all give and no take.  I am not prepared to concede this principle and I do not think the Deputy is seriously contending that persons directly involved in a trade dispute should be paid out of the redundancy fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>The Minister unfortunately was not listening.  I am contending that a proposal similar to that contained in paragraph 15, page 10, was included in the original Bill and was deleted.  Can the Minister tell me why he now considers it necessary to include it in this Bill?  It was included as proposed rule 5.  Why does he now consider it necessary to include in this Bill something which was in the previous Bill and was deleted?  What has happened in the meantime which has persuaded the Minister to introduce it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the case in as few words as possible.  I do not think it would be correct that workers involved in an industrial dispute should be qualified to receive payments from the redundancy fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different sections.  In one you have included that title to redundancy payment should not depend on social welfare rules or social welfare adjudication.  The Minister should agree with that.  What has happened since that the Minister now wants to have put in something which was accepted as being wrong before? The Minister very glibly says he does not want anybody involved in a trade dispute to receive payments from the fund.  The Minister is as well aware as I am that from time to time trade disputes have occurred and people who by no stretch of imagination could be considered to be involved in the trade dispute are unemployed.  The cement strike last year is an example, where we had the Department of Social Welfare saying: &ldquo;We cannot pay these people because of the fact that there is a dispute.&rdquo;  The dispute is not at their place of employment and yet <Col N="627" /> the Department have ruled that they are ineligible.  The people in the Department who do not seem to be aware of what is happening in the country make the rules.  I described what happened to the man who was sick.  These people make the rules and expect them to be accepted.  We have had again and again trade disputes where people are involved and are in receipt of strike pay and other people who are not involved in the dispute and therefore not in receipt of strike pay, yet the Department of Social Welfare will rule that some of these people are in fact involved in the dispute and will leave them depending on charity.  Some of them have been depending on collections of fellow workers while the Department of Social Welfare have been in receipt of contributions over the years, have made no objection and have said that if they needed help they would not get it.  This is the same idea again. Paragraph 15 (3) sets out:</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (1) shall not apply to a person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  is not participating in or financing or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work, and</P>
      <P>(b)  does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at his place of employment any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute.</P>
      <P>(4)  In this paragraph &lsquo;trade dispute&rsquo; means any dispute between employers and employees, or between employees and employees, which is connected with the employment of non-employment or the terms of employment or the conditions of employment of any persons, whether employees in the employment of the employer with whom the dispute arises or not.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>They go to great trouble to define those who will not be affected but when you revert to paragraph 15 (1) you find the insertion after paragraph 14 of the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> A person who has lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the factory, workshop, farm or other premises or place at which he was employed shall not be entitled to a weekly payment so long as the stoppage of work continues, except, subject to paragraph 5, in a case where he has, during the stoppage of work, becomes <i>bona fide</i> employed elsewhere in the occupation which he usually follows or has become regularly engaged in some other occupation.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the cement dispute had a countrywide effect and the Department of Social Welfare declared that the people affected were involved in a trade dispute and consequently they were unable to get benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to admit this is the procedure laid down in social welfare legislation but I still argue that whatever else we may provide in the Bill one cannot go so far as to subsidise trade dispute by payments out of the redundancy fund.</P>

If it was not in line then how can it be in line now.  I do not think the Minister is seriously considering these amendments.  Deputy Tully is quite right.  Many people were put out of employment last year by the cement strike but those people had nothing to do with the firm of Cement Limited.  This redundancy fund is not by a long stretch of the imagination the same as social welfare benefit.</P>

The 26 weeks would not bridge the gap between the 17th May, 1967 and the 1st January, 1968.  If this had been done, as I suggested at the time, many people would have been included who were subsequently disallowed following the passing of the Bill into an Act.  I would suggest to the Minister that if for no other reason than this was missed out previously he should this time make sure that it is well-covered and increase the 26 to 52 consecutive weeks.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 11, at the reference to Schedule 3 of the Principal Act, after the proposed amendment of paragraph 6, to insert:</P>
      <P>The insertion after paragraph 6 of the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P>6A.  If an employee's employment is interrupted (including voluntarily leaving the employment and the employee resumes employment at the employer's request, or with the employer's consent within 52 weeks, continuity of employment shall not be broken by such interruption.</P>
      <P>6B.  Where before or after 1st January, 1968, an employee is or was indirectly employed or engaged by an employer (through an agency, contract or otherwise) and subsequently that employee became employed directly by that employer, that employee's employment shall be deemed to be continuous.</P>
      <P>6C.  For the purposes of this Schedule employment at the same place of employment with successive employers shall be taken to be continuous, unless the employee voluntarily leaves the employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6D.  For the purposes of this Schedule a &ldquo;take-over&rdquo; of an <Col N="636" /> employee by an employer shall not break continuity of employment.</P>
    <P>This protects, for example, women who voluntarily leave to get married and employees who are invited back and when a change in management occurs the new management may plead that the person had voluntarily left the employment and so broke continuity of employment.  There is inadequate provision where the employee and not the business is taken over.  The Minister appreciates the difference that the employee may be taken over but the business may not.  The tribunal decisions 37/70, 101/69, 334/69, 70/70, 133/68, 134/68, 13/70, 420 and 42369 are all relevant to this and show that this is a big bone of contention in existing legislation and an effort should be made to try to deal with it now.  The Minister I am sure appreciates the fact that cases which keep recurring before a tribunal hold up the work of the tribunal.  When legislation is going through the House an effort should be made to try to ensure that those cases can be dealt with so that in future there will be no necessity to refer them to the tribunal and save everybody's time and indeed money.  I suggest this is one amendment which the Minister should find it very easy to accept and it will improve the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presuming too much here.  I should like to deal with each part of this amendment separately.  The first part, 6A, to which Deputy Tully has just referred, seeks to provide that an employee's continuity of employment with a particular employer is not broken by an interruption nor is employment for any reason whatsoever provided he resumes employment with the same employer within 52 weeks from the date his interruption commenced.  I am totally opposed to that.</P>

      <P>The second part 6B, is related to amendment 10 which we have already discussed, asking the employer to take on a liability.  The Deputy may not have been in the House earlier when we discussed amendment 10.  This is a repetition of the same argument and it would be inconsistent with our decision in that case.  I could not accept it.</P>
      <P>The third part of the proposed amendment, 6C, is most objectionable in principle.  Its acceptance could in effect mean that an employer who buys a business premises and re-employs workers who have worked with a previous owner, possibly not even in the same line of business, would be obliged to accept responsibility for that previous employment despite the fact he may have had no connection at all with the previous owners.</P>

      <P>I cannot visualise circumstances, unless very extreme exceptional cases, where this would be necessary.  As I said before on amendment 10, this proposal could act as a deterrent to the re-employment of people.  The Deputy must admit this.</P>
      <P>The fourth part of the amendment, 6D, could also have wide implications, as I said in relation to the other one. I am not sure that I know what the Deputy has in mind here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be aware that a number of firms may close together and an employer may switch an employee from one firm and may take over the employee or a number of employees and employ them.  By doing so they lose continuity of employment for redundancy purposes.  If the employer does this and he knows it will affect their redundancy claim there is no reason why he should not be responsible for that redundancy claim.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is thinking of 6C, where it is stated that for the purposes of the Schedule employment at the same place of employment with successive employers shall be taken to be continuous, unless the employee voluntarily leaves the employment. 6D is different, where it is the employee and not the job that is taken over by a different firm.  A firm may take over the employees but may not take over the place of employment; in fact, it may take the employees out of it.  This happens from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> At Question Time today I asked the Minister for Education if he would explain the delay in giving the County Cavan Vocational Education Committee authority to proceed with the erection of a vocational school at Tullymongan, Cavan, and if he would make a statement on the matter.  In his reply the Minister stated that the committee wished to build the school on a site at Tullymongan and that his Department thought it should be built on another site and there the matter rested.  I was completely dissatisfied with that reply and for that reason I raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years past the County Cavan Vocational Education Committee have been satisfied that the existing school in Cavan town is inadequate. As far back as 1963 the then Minister agreed with the committee. He sanctioned the provision of a new school and authorised the committee to procure a site.  The committee <Col N="639" /> experienced some difficulty in this matter but in 1966 they purchased a site from Cavan UDC at Tullymongan on the Dublin road immediately beside the town.</P>
    <P>It was considered by practically everyone that this was the most suitable site.  It contains approximately 12 acres, which means there is plenty of space for playing grounds and for the extension of the school in later years should this be necessary.  The site is situated near the Royal School, which is a co-educational establishment. It is beside the Poor Clare Convent, a girls' secondary school which caters for many pupils, and the site is within a reasonable distance of St. Patrick's boys' secondary school. The site at Tullymongan is in the immediate vicinity of factories, such as the Cavan Engineering Company which it is hoped will provide good employment in the not too distant future. The site is beside the firms of Cavan Crystal Limited and Breffni Textile Limited.  Three large garages which employ many apprentices are nearby. The site is near two post-primary education establishments and it is also located in the industrial zone of the town.</P>
    <P>The purchase of the site was sanctioned by the Minister for Education in 1967.  It cost £7,000 and the committee were authorised to have plans drawn up.  An architect was appointed with the sanction and approval of the Minister; plans were prepared for a 30-room building and, after discussion with the Department, these plans were approved.</P>
    <P>To date, the committee have spent approximately £11,500 on the purchase of the site and on the preparation of plans.  The committee then sought sanction from the Department for the preparation of working drawings, which is the last step preparatory to inviting tenders.  At this stage&mdash;late 1967&mdash;the Department appeared to stall but no suggestion was made to the committee that the building should not proceed at Tullymongan.  As the Minister is aware, in relation to the building of a vocational school, the committee select the site and the <Col N="640" /> Department approve or reject it.  In this case the Department definitely approved of this site.</P>
    <P>As Vice-Chairman of the Vocational Education Committee for the county and as Deputy for the constituency concerned, on 10th June, 1970, I put down a question asking the Minister to explain the delay in proceeding with the erection of a school.  To my surprise, and to the utter amazement of the members of the committee, I was informed by the Parliamentary Secretary that there was a question of another site.  After putting some supplementary questions I was informed that the site was in the grounds of St. Patrick's College.  This is about 1½ miles from the present site, more than a mile from the Royal School and about a mile from the Poor Clare Convent.  Apparently negotiations regarding the second site had been proceeding for some time over the head of the committee.  Here I should point out that when the committee advertised on two occasions for a site, the site at St. Patrick's College was not offered on either occasion.</P>
    <P>It had been reported in the newspapers that a 30-room vocational school was to be built at Tullymongan and I fear the authorities in St. Patrick's College were afraid that this new technical school would interfere with their enrolment.  I can understand that but I think their fear is completely unjustified. In the new conditions, with free post-primary education, it is obvious that more and larger buildings are required.  At this stage I should like to pay a tribute to the religious orders of this country who provided post-primary education in years gone by and made a good job of it at a very reasonable cost to the State.</P>
    <P>However, different conditions obtain at this time.  We are now concentrating on vocational education and we are providing for a much greater number of pupils.  I do not believe St. Patrick's College have anything to fear from the vocational school.  In the vocational school in Cavan a priest is released to provide full-time religious instruction there and I thank the Minister for having sanctioned that arrangement. <Col N="641" /> The other religious denominations, Church of Ireland, Presbyterians and Methodists, also provide religious instruction in the school.</P>
    <P>The committee have given full consideration to the Minister's proposal to change the site.  In this case the proposal came from the Minister, not from the committee.  That is the only part of this whole performance that seems to be a bit unsavoury.  The committee were not consulted.  They were not given an opportunity to select the site. The committee have given full consideration to the proposal to change the site on a number of occasions and decided unanimously to proceed with the school at Tullymongan for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the site which we have obtained and paid for at a cost of £11,500, including architects' fees, is the most suitable site in or around Cavan town.  The site at St. Patrick's College which was mentioned is very much up in the air as far as the committee are concerned.  We wrote to the authorities of St. Patrick's College asking a number of questions.  We also wrote to the Department.  We asked whether this school would accommodate boys and girls, whether it would provide full technical education, whether it would provide for juveniles by day and adults at night.  We received a letter to this effect:</P>
    <P>The members of your committee are apparently unaware that a draft scheme of co-operation between secondary and vocational schools on a nation-wide basis is at present being prepared by the Department of Education.  In the circumstances it is obvious that it would be premature and inopportune to anticipate the Department's plans and it is equally clear that, until the details of the proposed association between the post-primary schools have been formulated by the Department and studied by the interested parties, no final decision can be taken in regard to the acceptance or the rejection of any or all of the methods of co-operation suggested and the offer of a site and the conditions pertaining thereto.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> We also sought information from the Department about the new school, as to whether the site at St. Patrick's College would be large enough to provide a regional college later on.  We were told that that did not arise and, generally speaking, we got no satisfaction from the Department.  The whole thing seems to be up in the air. In fact, a resolution was passed at the March meeting of the Vocational Committee and forwarded immediately to the Department.  When no reply had been received one month later, the Vocational Education office telephoned the Department to learn that not only had the Minister not received it, not only had the Minister's secretary not received it, but the resolution passed by the Vocational Education Committee had not reached the head of the section dealing with it.  Was it thrown in the waste paper basket or was it treated seriously?</P>
    <P>Vocational education is becoming of great importance in this country. Eighty-five of the jobs to be secured, we hope, over the next number of years will come from manufacturing industries which will require trained personnel from the vocational schools. The draft report for the North Eastern Regional Development Organisation has this to say&mdash;and I know the Minister agrees with what I am about to say now because we discussed it across the House before:</P>
    <P>The greatest increase in new jobs in the region in future years will be in manufacturing industry.  This would indicate the need for a much higher proportion of national school leavers to obtain technical and vocational education rather than secondary education if they hoped to obtain jobs at home or in the region. A significant change in attitude to the vocational education system whereby a much higher proportion of primary school leavers would choose technical education would be a major factor in solving migration and emigration problems in the region.</P>
    <P>Ninety per cent of the school leavers in Cavan seek post primary education because it is a poor county.  Only a fraction of them seek third level education. <Col N="643" /> I believe this is a plan to downgrade vocational education in County Cavan to the absolute detriment of the students in that county and, as a result, they will be deprived of jobs in industry which we hope will be available in the years to come.</P>
    <P>There is another problem.  We have a religious minority problem in County Cavan.  There is a sizeable minority of members of the Church of Ireland, Presbyterians and Methodists.  The Protestant Bishop of Kilmore, Most Rev. Dr. Moore, and the religious minority, are very apprehensive that, if this school is built in the grounds of St. Patrick's College, it will not be a nondenominational school in spirit or in fact.  That is something we should guard against because the vocational school is the only school which is fully non-denominational at present.  Religious instruction is given to all creeds and classes.</P>
    <P>We really cannot understand the Minister's attitude or the delay in sanctioning the provision of the school. If this school is built where the committee want to build it&mdash;and I may tell the Minister now where the committee will insist on building it&mdash;it will be on an excellent 12 acre site.  It will serve the girl pupils of the Poor Clare Convent which is very near it.  It will serve the boys and girls from the Royal School which is the nearest school to it.  It will also serve the Loreto College and St. Patrick's College if they want to avail of it.  I believe&mdash;and I think the Minister agrees with me because we discussed it across the House &mdash;that from now on the emphasis must be on vocational education.  There will always be the people who will want to avail of the traditional academic education and there will be plenty of institutions for them.  They can avail of that education in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>This site was purchased and paid for.  This very necessary vocational education establishment in Cavan town has been held up unreasonably over the past three years.  The Minister saw fit to discuss alternative proposals without discussing them with the committee. The committee cannot be said to be anti-anything.  The chairman is a <Col N="644" /> Canon of the Catholic Church.  There are representatives of the religious minority on the committee.  The committee were prepared to discuss these matters with the Minister but, for some reason or another, all this talk went on over their heads and behind their backs.  I did not bring this matter up hastily on the Adjournment.  I discovered this proposal of the Minister's as far back as 10th June last.  We have made every effort, through correspondence, through parliamentary questions here, and otherwise, to get the Minister to see reason, to get him to talk, to get him to have a meeting of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Nothing like that has been done. This is bad for education in Cavan. It is bad for co-operation in Cavan. The reasonable thing to do is to go ahead with this vocational school in Cavan.  There are four other post primary education establishments none of which, I emphasise, is providing any instruction in vocational or technical subjects.  It is not unreasonable to say that, in this county town, a county in which 90 per cent of the pupils seek post primary education, we should have an adequate vocational school to cater for the needs of all the people of the town and to ensure that there will be people available for the industries in the town, because I know that, as a result of the inadequacy of our vocational schools and our vocational system there, the town and county are suffering in failing to attract as many industries and manufacturing concerns as we would otherwise attract.</P>

      <P>I might begin by repeating what I said in reply to a supplementary question here today, that is, that the overriding consideration must be the provision of the best possible educational facilities for the children of Cavan.  If the vocational school in Cavan has to share a range of activities with any school in Cavan town, then the school with most to offer in relation to the co-operative aspect is St. Patrick's College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy must realise that the introduction of free post-primary education in 1967 changed the whole <Col N="645" /> future position and brought to the forefront the necessity for co-operation.  In the case of the boys, in particular, it is necessary that a core of practical as well as academic subjects be available and this can be done in Cavan by siting the new school in the St. Patrick's College grounds.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said that considerable emphasis should be laid on vocational education, particularly in relation to boys.  This is exactly what we are doing here, because we are not only making vocational education in the practical subjects available to the children who will attend the vocational school but we are also seeing to it that these practical subjects will also be on offer to St. Patrick's College.</P>

      <P>The location of the new vocational school beside the boys' secondary school will enable us to provide better facilities for the children of Cavan and will ensure that the pupils in both of these schools will have first-class facilities available to them.  It is most unusual to have objections raised by one post-primary school to being located beside another post-primary school.  As I have said here on many occasions, it is our aim in all parts of the country to locate post-primary schools as close as possible to one another, because we have found that one of the biggest obstacles to co-operation is the distance between schools and the ensuing loss of time for teachers and pupils in commuting between the various schools; and also because there can be time-tabling complications. In many parts of the country this is recognised and both vocational and secondary schools have been very willing to implement this policy. As I say, it is extraordinary to find a public authority objecting to something like this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very well aware that considerable changes have taken place in the whole field of <Col N="646" /> education in recent times because of the introduction of free education.  Let me mention the main practical advantages of locating these schools beside one another.  First of all, there is the sharing of specialist facilities such as halls and gymnasiums and provision for practical subjects, science rooms and so on.  The movement of pupils and teachers is made very much easier and the formation of a joint class for subjects for which there is a very big demand is encouraged.  The boys in the secondary school&mdash;and I want to emphasise this&mdash;have easy access to the practical subject provision in the vocational school.  There is the sharing of specialist teachers.  It is also very important that subject specialities can be developed within each school to which the pupils of the other school have access.</P>
      <P>It is very important to stress that this new school will be a vocational school under the management of the County Cavan Vocational Education Committee.  The question of the Protestant children has been raised here by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I want to point out clearly that issues such as the admission of Protestant pupils and the provision of adult education and other community activities simply do not arise here.  These are all normal in vocational schools and any suggestion from any quarter that the new school in Cavan will be restricted in any way has no foundation.  I want to stress that the vocational school in Cavan will be under the management and control of the County Cavan Vocational Education Committee.  The fact that we would prefer to have it sited in the grounds of St. Patrick's College on a site which, of course, will be bought, does not alter this.</P>
      <P>I would again ask the County Cavan Vocational Education Committee to reconsider this whole matter.  It should be obvious that both schools will benefit very considerably from the fact that they will be in close proximity to each other.  This would in fact do what Deputy Fitzpatrick has in mind, that is, to make available education in practical subjects to the young people in St. Patrick's College as well as in the vocational school.</P>

      <P>There evidently has been a considerable amount of correspondence between the Vocational Education Committee and my Department. However, we should not quarrel on the question of the site as such. What we should seriously concern ourselves with is the question of where <Col N="648" /> we can locate this vocational school so that it will be most effective in providing further educational facilities for the young people in Cavan.  From all the examination I have made of this matter it is quite obvious to me that, because of the very large number attending St. Patrick's College, the facilities will be made available to far more people, and particularly to boys, by siting it there than by siting it anywhere else.</P>
