      <P>Grants totalling £104,000 and £129,000 were paid to the Medical Research Council in the years 1968-69 and 1969-70 respectively. No portion of these amounts was, to quote the Deputies' words, &ldquo;channelled towards the provision of alternative means of experimentation not involving the use of living animals&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The answer to the final part of the question is in the negative.  The Deputies will be aware of the restrictions and safeguards contained in the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the reason why fathers of families are separated from their families in Griffith Barracks, Dublin; the total number of families living in Griffith Barracks on 7th July, 1971; the total number of people in Griffith Barracks on that date; and if the Eastern Health Board will arrange that <Col N="1073" /> homeless families remain intact as family units while accommodated in Griffith Barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The accommodation available at Griffith Barracks is of the dormitory type and would not be suitable for the accommodation of entire family units.  On the 7th July there were 18 mothers with 30 children living in Griffith Barracks.  There was a total number of 51 persons living there on that date.</P>
      <P>It has not been the policy of any health authority to provide family-type accommodation for able-bodied persons and their families who find themselves in need of shelter and maintenance. The provision of appropriate housing accommodation is, of course, the responsibility of the housing authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with this at some length on a previous debate and I would invite the Deputy to read the remarks I made on that occasion. It is not the custom of the Dublin Housing Authority to require us to give accommodation on a family basis and the length of time which these people reside in Griffith Barracks has been shortening continuously.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that this is a Local Government problem really and not a Health problem and <Col N="1074" /> that when houses are in short supply in the Dublin region the number of people in Griffith Barracks rockets upwards? It should not be a Health responsibility at all and, in fact, it only remains an embarrassment to the relevant health authority because it is not transferred to Local Government.</P>

      <P>I had a meeting with the British Foreign Secretary on 6th July.

      <P>Can the Minister state whether on that occasion the &ldquo;Shoot to Kill&rdquo; speech of Mr. Faulkner, which has resulted in the deaths of two unarmed Derry men, was discussed during that meeting?  Is there anything in the Minister's brief which suggests that that speech of Mr. Faulkner's was discussed and its tragic implications of which we have seen the fatal results in Derry during the past week when two Derry men were evidently shot on that kind of suspicion?</P>

I wonder would the Minister be good enough to answer that and say in particular what arrangements have been made to ensure that when an alarming situation develops in the North of Ireland, such as we now have, what lines of communication will be open and what personal contact will be made to ensure that the right decisions are taken and that the bad situation is not made a great deal worse because of ineffective communications between Dublin and London?</P>

      <P>Arrangements for a Taiscí Stáit loan to Ballingarry collieries are well advanced but a formal loan agreement has not yet been concluded.  The conditions attaching to the loan offer are confidential and it would be a breach of commercial secrecy to disclose any particulars in this regard.

However, I am not prepared at this stage to give an absolute, cast-iron guarantee for the continued operation of the collieries for ever.  I believe the arrangements being made will be satisfactory but I should like to see them in operation before being more specific in regard to the long-term future of the collieries.

      <P>Surely the Minister is aware of this because, in fact, he was present when the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave this global assurance?  In fact, on that occasion he was rather shocked, if I recall correctly, but he made no effort to contradict the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I was present in the House that day.  Could the Minister indicate the amount of the loan now being provided by Taiscí Stáit and an indication of any possible prospect of improvement beyond 26p in the £ to RD creditors other than wage creditors, over four years, which is a very low composition?</P>

I should like to make it clear that the State has no responsibility for all the trading debts of this company, nor is the State accepting such responsibility. The composition which has been arrived at, and approved of by the creditors, is the best available in the circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not obligatory for firms to notify my Department of their intention to close.  In some cases such notifications may be received; in others information about the likelihood of closure becomes available from official sources and through representations made by Deputies, other public representatives and trade unions.  In all such cases my Department, together with the Industrial Development Authority and any other State body in a position to offer specialist assistance, endeavour to keep the firms in operation where this is possible by arranging an alternative line of production, seeking to bring about a merger or, where this is not possible, seeking to secure the establishment <Col N="1099" /> of a new industry to take the place of the firm which is closing down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice how many prosecutions involving indictable offences are awaiting hearing in the Courts; if he will state in respect of each prosecution how many of the accused were charged in each of the law terms in the years 1968, 1969 and 1970; if any of those accused were charged earlier than 1968; and, if so, if he will state the law terms in which they were charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought in these questions is not available and could not be compiled without a detailed examination of records in all the Circuit Court and the District Court Offices throughout the country.  This would entail an amount of work altogether disproportionate to the value of the information.</P>
      <P>Delays may be due to several factors, including, for instance, applications by the defence for an adjournment.  As regards delays attributable to the Court itself being in arrears, the general position is that, outside Dublin, there are no arrears and no delays in bringing persons to trial.  The same applies to the District Court in Dublin.  There are arrears, affecting approximately 1,200 cases, most of which are District Court Appeals, in the Dublin Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> None of these cases involves persons held in custody.  The arrears are due principally to a substantial increase in recent years in criminal trials and criminal appeals from the District Court.  The delay at present is of the order of six months.  Steps have already been taken to reduce the arrears and the position has been showing some improvement in the last few months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that both the gardaí and the people are appalled and concerned at the delay in bringing criminals to justice?  They are also concerned at the number of criminals out on bail, some of them out on as many as eight bails and one particular man on 28 bails. They are also gravely concerned at the number of crimes being committed by these people while on bail.  Is the Minister further aware that in cases even of armed robbery there are people out on bail for as long as two and a half to three years and that there is an accelerated drift to anarchy and the Government are standing idly by and what do they intend to do about it?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Surely the Minister appreciates that in many of the country circuits, while there may not be arrears of criminal work, there are certainly arrears of civil work.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are to provide statutory authority for the payment of £10 million Government subsidy to the Electricity Supply Board in respect of a programme of expenditure of £18 million on rural electrification during the four years ending 31st March, 1975, and to increase the limit of authorised capital expenditure by the board for all purposes, including rural electrification, from the existing combined limit of £340 million to a new figure of £450 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, rural electrification has been in progress now since 1946, a period of 25 years, and the time has come for an all-out effort <Col N="1115" /> to complete the programme.  A brief review of the situation is, therefore, not out of place.</P>
    <P>The original programme for rural electrification was on the assumption that, given a subsidy of 50 per cent of the capital cost, supply could be offered at standard rates to about 86 per cent of rural homes and that about 70 per cent of the total rural households would accept supply on these terms. Among the 14 per cent to whom standard rates could not be quoted, because of the high cost of connection, there were many who wished to have supply and the ESB programme provided for connections to them if the persons concerned were prepared to pay an extra charge, over and above the standard charge sufficient to bring the return up to the minimum acceptable as sufficient, at the time, after taking account of subsidy.  This was, in fact, the origin of the special service charges.  The distribution networks for the scheme were designed with a view to connecting the maximum possible number of consumers with the money available and expenditure on distribution capacity unlikely to be used for many years ahead was avoided.</P>
    <P>By the time the original rural electrification scheme was nearing completion in 1962 about 75 per cent of total rural households had already been connected compared with the original target of about 70 per cent. The Government at that time decided that a second comprehensive scheme, known as the post-development programme, should be carried out to give a further opportunity to obtain supply to all those houses which, for one reason or another, were still without electricity.  Since most of the households qualifying for standard charges had by then been connected, the post-development programme required relatively greater capital expenditure to connect houses to the system.  Consequently, under the Electricity Supply Amendment Act, 1962, the rate of subsidy was increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent with a limit of £75 per house for domestic connections.  This financial limitation had the effect of increasing substantially the level of special service charges for the very <Col N="1116" /> high cost connections while qualifying a greater number for standard charges. To cater for such households, a scheme for the payment of grants of up to £10 for the installation of bottled gas as a more economical alternative source of power for lighting, cooking and heating was introduced.</P>
    <P>The rural electrification programme was reviewed prior to the introduction of the Electricity Supply Amendment Act, 1968.  This Act extended the limit of capital expenditure on rural electrification to £50 million which then was considered sufficient to complete the post-development scheme by 31st March, 1973.  At the same time as the Act was enacted, arrangements were made to effect substantial reductions in the higher special service charges to be effective from 1st June, 1968, the cost being borne by the ESB.  In addition, the maximum grant for bottled gas installations was increased from £10 to £35.</P>
    <P>At the time of the commencement of the original rural electrification scheme in 1946, only about 14,000 rural households had electricity installed. At the 31st March, 1962, when the original rural electrification scheme was virtually completed, a total of almost 280,000 rural houses were connected to the supply.  At the end of March, 1967, 325,000 houses had been connected and the estimate then made was that a further 26,000 connections only would be required to complete the scheme, bringing the total estimated number of rural connections to just over 350,000 houses.  It was planned to achieve this total by March, 1973.</P>
    <P>The 1967 forecast of 350,000 rural connections proved in practice to be an under-estimate.  The substantial reduction in special service charges in 1968 made electricity supply a much more attractive proposition for many households and this added up to a considerable increase in demand for connections.  Increasing prosperity and a growing demand for TV reception increased the numbers seeking supply. As a consequence, progress on the completion of the programme in the different areas fell well behind schedule, and the backlog was increased <Col N="1117" /> by new houses constructed in the meantime and seeking connection. The position was aggravated by the need to allocate an ever growing proportion of the capital provided for rural electrification to system improvement, that is to strengthening the distribution network in order to improve the standard of supply sufficiently to keep up with increased demand.  The rate of growth in consumption of electricity in rural areas is now about 13 per cent as compared with an increase rate of about 9 per cent in urban areas.  This growth in demand which is continuing at a high rate has necessitated considerable investment in strengthening the distribution system to maintain adequate supply.  The development of rural industries and the growth in rural areas of new hotels, registered guesthouses and new homes built by existing consumers as well as new installations for the mechanisation of farms have all added to the problem of completing the scheme of rural electrification within the programme planned from 1968.</P>
    <P>The 1967 estimate of the number of further rural connections required to complete the scheme was 26,000.  In fact, in the period from April, 1967, to March, 1971, about 34,000 connections had been made under the scheme and as Deputies are very well aware, the rural electrification programme is still far from complete in many areas.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, requested the ESB to carry out a further detailed study of the position, district by district, throughout the country so as to be able to forecast as accurately as possible not alone existing requirements for electricity connections, but to take into account also new house building programmes and developments likely to require priority connections for new rural industries, guesthouses, <i>et cetera</i>, as well as farming developments.  The ESB have recently completed this review and they have proposed a four-year programme designed to achieve by 31st March, 1975, connection of all outstanding connections at the present time, estimated at 14,000, together with other demands for new connections, estimated to amount to a further 14,000 likely to arise in the four-year period. <Col N="1118" /> The cost of these 28,000 new connections is estimated at £7 million.  At the same time, the ESB realise the necessity to improve substantially the whole rural electrification network and they will need to spend £11 million on system improvement in this four-year period.  The total cost of this programme is, therefore, £18 million from 1st April, 1971, which will bring total expenditure by the board on rural electrification to £67 million.</P>
    <P>The Government have accepted this programme and the provisions in the Bill are designed as, what I might term, a crash programme to enable rural electrification to be completed within the next four years.  The capital provisions for expenditure by the ESB on rural electrification in each of these four years have already been determined and notified to the board so that there should be no obstacle to the ESB achieving success in completing this scheme as planned.  The board are already planning on this basis and I earnestly hope that all parts of the plan can be achieved according to schedule.  This should eliminate entirely the unfortunate situation we have had for some years past where the commencement of work in particular areas has had to be deferred time and again because of the heavy work programmes developing in areas getting prior attention.</P>
    <P>For comparison purposes I might mention that the total expenditure on rural electrification in the 25 years of its operation up to 31st March last was about £49 million, including Government subsidy of £17 million.  We are now proposing expenditure in the next four years totalling £18 million, including subsidy of £10 million.  In the past four years annual capital expenditure on rural electrification has ranged from about £2 million in 1968 to £3.1 million in 1970-71.  The new programme envisages expenditure of £3.7 million this year, £4.1 million next year, £4.7 million in 1973-74 and no less than £5.5 million in the fourth and final year of the programme.</P>
    <P>Our existing level of rural connections to the electricity supply system is very high by international standards, more particularly when account is <Col N="1119" /> taken of the very many scattered households in rural Ireland&mdash;a position that does not obtain in most other countries where rural households are concentrated in small villages or townships. By the time the new programme is completed, we expect to have total rural connections of about 386,000 houses or something approaching 98 per cent of total rural households.  Such an achievement is something that I think we can be proud of.</P>
    <P>In the new programme of bringing supply to those households not yet connected it is not intended to make any change in the existing reduced rates of special service charges which will continue to be calculated on the same basis as has obtained since the Government arranged for a reduction in these charges in mid-1968.  This reduction was designed to reduce particularly the highest special service charges and electricity is now available to rural dwellers at very reasonable terms.  While special service charges are necessary in some form or another in every electricity distribution tariff I can assure the House that those who are asked to pay these special charges are, in fact, paying very much less than the cost of the service they are getting. The availability of grants of up to £35 for the installation of bottled gas equipment for lighting, cooking and heating is an alternative available to those liable to very high special service charges.  I might mention that in the past three years, that is, since the new rate of subsidy was introduced over 1,600 bottled gas grants have been given, so far, at a total cost of about £46,000.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the new programme of rural electrification which we are introducing is not a mere continuation of the scheme which has been proceeding on an area-by-area basis for some years past.  This is a scheme to complete the original programme once and for all by provision of the increased finances which I have mentioned.  Under the existing planned post-development scheme, something like 520 areas have been completed out of a total of 792 rural areas.  It is planned not alone to re-canvass and re-develop the remaining 272 areas, <Col N="1120" /> but also to offer electricity again at subsidised rates to all unsupplied households in the 520 or so areas where the post-development scheme has been completed.  There will not be an individual canvass in these 520 areas. Supply will be offered by way of local advertisement and it will be a matter for householders in the areas concerned to apply immediately for connection.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the four-year plan which this Bill is intended to finance is aimed at completing the massive task of rural electrification on which we embarked in 1946.  It is aimed at bringing electricity to all rural homes which it is possible to connect at any kind of reasonable cost.  To keep down costs the ESB propose, as I have explained, to tackle the job area by area.  After each area is completed the connection of rural homes for electricity in such area will have to be made on an economic basis without the benefit of subsidy.  Rural dwellers, concerned to ensure that they are connected for electricity, should apply immediately for connection whenever the ESB announce the provision of supply in each of the 520 areas in which the rural electrification planned post-development scheme has already been completed.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to deal with non-domestic connections such as industrial consumers, registered hotels and guesthouses and farming activities requiring supply on commercial or industrial tariffs on the basis of completing the programme in each separate area. Subsidy will be available, therefore, in respect of such connections up to the end of the four-year programme. After the end of the programme we will have achieved one of the highest levels of rural electrification to be found anywhere in the world and it should then be possible to provide and extend the supply of electricity on the same self-supporting basis as in urban areas and, indeed, the growth of the economy throughout the country which has itself been fostered by the spread of electricity supply should help to put rural electricity supply on a sound financial basis.</P>
    <P>Completion of the proposed programme <Col N="1121" /> will require an additional £18 million over and above the above £49 million expended by 31st March, 1971. This means a total provision of £67 million as compared with the existing statutory limit on capital expenditure by the ESB on rural electrification of £50 million.  It is necessary, therefore, to increase the limit of expenditure by £17 million to £67 million.  Because of the acceleration of the programme and the very considerably increased expenditure on system improvements now being provided, a new approach is being made to the amount of subsidy to be made available.  Instead of the old arrangement of 75 per cent with a maximum of £75 per house the Government have agreed to make a global £10 million available as subsidy in respect of this programme and the ESB will complete the programme with this amount of subsidy but will maintain the 1968 terms to householders for new connections.  Total subsidy payments up to 31st March, 1971, amounted to £17 million so that the total Government provision by way of subsidy towards the cost of the £67 million programme will amount to £27 million in all.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one more comment before I leave rural electrification.  The ESB now have firm plans to offer electricity in all rural areas over the next four years.  It is essential that they plan their programme on an orderly basis in order to keep costs at the lowest level possible as well as achieving the maximum progress on the scheme.  Any departure from the planned scheme can only increase costs and delay progress.  It is clearly impossible to connect at once all who are seeking supply.  Some areas must be at the end of the board's plan.  I would ask Deputies, therefore, not to be impatient if some areas in their constituencies are not high up in the board's timetable. The longest any householder should have to wait will be the 31st March, 1975, but the great majority of rural households will have connection long before that date.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provision of capital for general purposes for the ESB.  Under existing legislation, the ESB are entitled to incur capital expenditure for all purposes other than <Col N="1122" /> the electrification of rural areas up to a limit of £290 million as fixed by the Electricity Supply Amendment Act, 1970.  At present, the board have approved expenditure under this head amounting to £240 million and the balance remaining would be sufficient to cover general expenditure likely to arise for approval up to about March, 1973.  In order to avoid coming back to the Dáil again within such a short time, it is now proposed to extend the statutory limit to cover expenditure likely to arise for approval in the period to 31st March, 1975, that is for the period covered by the programme for completion of rural electrification now proposed.</P>
    <P>During the next four years, the ESB expect to approve of expenditure for purposes other than rural electrification amounting to about £140 million.  Of this total about £85 million will be required for additional generating plant.  The plant to be commissioned will comprise two 120 megawatt plants at Pigeon House B, another 120 megawatt plant at Great Island, the pumped storage plants totalling 280 megawatts at Turlough Hill, the 40 megawatt extension to Shannonbridge milled peat plant and then the erection of the first 250 megawatt units to be installed in our system.  Two of these will be at Tarbert and the third at Pigeon House B.  A small 25 megawatt extension to the Erne Station is also planned.  This plant programme will be necessary to meet increased demand for electricity which has been growing for some years past at between 10 per cent and 11 per cent.  Deputies will note that no provision is made in this programme for the construction of a nuclear generating station.  As I explained recently in this House, on the Second Reading of the Nuclear Energy (An Bord Fuinnimh Núicléigh) Bill, 1971, no final decision has yet been taken to build a nuclear station.  The ESB have for some time past been training engineers in nuclear work and have got together a special project team to examine in detail all the technical, economic, social and financial problems connected with the installation and operation of a nuclear station. The board will need to consider all aspects of the project before coming <Col N="1123" /> to a decision to recommend such an installation to the Government.  The advice of the new Nuclear Energy Board will be required by the Government before any decision is taken on this project.  If a decision is taken to proceed with the commissioning of such a station which, as I have already indicated elsewhere, could cost up to £70 million at current cost levels then additional capital will need to be provided for the ESB but, of course, such expenditure would not arise for some years to come.</P>
    <P>In addition to expenditure on generating plant, a sum of about £55 million is estimated to be required for other essential items, mainly transmission and distribution networks.  The total required for approval by 31st March, 1975, will, therefore, amount to about £380 million.</P>
    <P>Increasing the limit on ESB capital expenditure will not involve demands on the Central Fund.  Since 1955, the board have raised their own capital without recourse to the Exchequer, except, of course, for the State contribution to the capital cost of rural electrification.  The board's programme for capital expenditure within the statutory limit is required to be submitted in detail for my approval from time to time.</P>
    <P>At present, the ESB maintain separate rural and non-rural accounts and separate provision has been made by statute from time to time for the capital necessary for rural electrification and for other purposes.  Now that well over 90 per cent of potential rural customers have already connection to the electricity supply and that we are making provision for accelerated connection of the remaining rural households, I consider that the time has come to integrate the two separate accounts and to make one general provision for total capital expenditure. Integration of the accounts and of the statutory provisions will not affect rural subsidy arrangements, but it should help to simplify ESB account procedures and thus to some extent at least reduce costs.  As I have already stated, expenditure on rural electrification by the ESB is expected to reach £67 million by 31st March, 1975, <Col N="1124" /> while expenditure required for general purposes by the same date is expected to be £380 million.  The combined total of requirements is, therefore, £447 million and the Bill proposes to fix the limit of £450 million.</P>
    <P>One of the main difficulties of any electricity supply authority is the variable rate of demand for current arising during any 24 hour period.  In Ireland, so far, due to the absence of any substantial three-shift industrial base, the daily load curve has had a high peak and low valley.  The erection of pumped storage plants of the type being commissioned at Turlough Hill will enable cheap electrical current from the valley period to be used to pump water to the upper reservoir which will then be available to generate current during the high cost peak demand periods.  This operation is, therefore, obviously designed to flatten the demand curve to some extent.  An electricity authority has to have available sufficient plant to meet peak demand together with sufficient reserves to cope with plant outages.  This means at any one time an electricity authority must have far more plant capacity than is necessary to meet average demand.  I might illustrate the point by stating that in the year ended 31st March, 1970, the ESB had total plant capacity of 1,410 megawatts to meet a peak demand of 1,128 megawatts, while the average demand during that year was just under the equivalent of 600 megawatts.  It is essential, therefore, that the ESB should do all in their power to increase valley hour usage while reducing peak hour usage.  In recent years, there is definite evidence of progress in this regard by the board.  In the year ended March, 1967, for example, peak usage was 5.21 times valley usage. This figure was reduced progressively each year in the next four years so that the peak in the year to March, 1971 was reduced to 3.78 times valley usage.</P>
    <P>It is because of the need not alone to meet peak demand, but to have a reserve or security margin in addition and because it is not practicable to store electricity in large quantity that such very large capital investment is necessary in an electricity system. <Col N="1125" /> Ireland is not unique in having peaks and valleys in the daily demand curves for electricity and, indeed, neither are we unique in having to invest an ever growing proportion of our national resources in electricity generation.  Electricity has, of course, become the most acceptable of all types of energy and the ever growing demand for it is evidence of increased national prosperity and an index of our continuing industrial and commercial growth.</P>
    <P>I think the capital expenditure figures I have given should bring home to Deputies the extent of the growth of this our largest industrial unit and the extent to which this industry has grown and requires to grow in order to supply power to our growing industrial, agricultural, commercial and domestic needs.  Expenditure of £157 million by one semi-State body in the short period of four years is very heavy expenditure, indeed, which poses very considerable problems for the Government and for the board.  The sums of money now involved are such as to require the ESB to have recourse to foreign borrowing to an increasing extent. Common prudence apart, resort to borrowing from financial institutions abroad requires that the affairs of the ESB be managed as efficiently and as economically as possible.  It is essential that the board be enabled to balance their accounts taking one year with another as any action to unduly depress prices or force the board into a position where they are not able to recover their costs could be disastrous not alone for the ESB themselves, but for the success of any development programme we may wish to undertake over coming years.  I am, of course, very concerned that the ESB continue to supply electricity at the cheapest possible cost and in the most efficient manner possible.  I have already indicated that I am personally quite satisfied that the ESB are in the forefront of electricity authorities throughout the world in supplying cheap electricity, but to ensure that the affairs of the ESB continue to be conducted efficiently, I am, as already announced, arranging to have a special investigation made into the efficiency of the board's operations.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill reflects the continued growth and development of the ESB and highlights in a dramatic way the tremendous progress that has been made, particularly in recent years, in relation to the extension of rural electrification.</P>
      <P>This Bill has a number of purposes. The most interesting development here is the fact that the Government are now proposing to make an extra £10 million available to the ESB in respect of a programme of expenditure of £18 million on rural electrification during the four years ending March 31st, 1975.  The Minister devoted most of his speech to the history of the development of rural electrification.  It is no harm that attention should be directed to the manner in which the extension of electricity has transformed rural Ireland in recent years.  The statistics given by the Minister for the number of households which have been connected and also the rate of increase in the consumption of electricity in rural Ireland&mdash;it is running at an average rate of 10 to 11 per cent as compared with the urban increase of 9 per cent &mdash;indicate the tremendous economic and social transformation that has resulted from the extension of electric current to rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of this fact by reason of my former very close association with that well-known rural organisation, Muintir na Tíre, and particularly by virtue of the number of years apprenticeship I served to the founder of that organisation, the late Canon Hayes.  I recall the tremendous field work that was done and the co-operation that was given to the ESB by Muintir na Tíre in its earlier days. I remember, in particular, and I think it is only right that we should acknowledge outstanding contributions by public servants, Mr. William Rowe, who was a deputy chief engineer in the ESB and who was the man who spearheaded the rural electrification programme and who was also a member of the National Executive of Muintir na Tíre, a man whom I had the pleasure of knowing and whose friendship I enjoyed for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> The transformation that has been effected in rural Ireland by the advent of electricity has been colossal.  As a person who has had a keen interest in rural Ireland, one thing that strikes me is the fact that despite the arguments put forward by sociologists and economists prior to the advent of rural electrification that one of the reasons for the high rate of depopulation was the drudgery and darkness of rural life, despite the fact that electricity has brightened up rural Ireland and has effected a tremendous transformation in rural industry, agriculture and domestic life, unfortunately, the rate of rural depopulation has not slowed down.  There is no doubt that whatever progress has been achieved in agriculture, particularly in the dairying industry, has been made possible, to a large degree, by the availability of electric current to farmers.</P>
    <P>The other advantages to rural Ireland following the extension of electricity have been outlined by the Minister. He has referred to agriculture, rural industry and the development of the tourist industry in the rural areas and the role which electric power has played in all these developments.  It is also well, when we look at the ESB as it is today and look back on the history of the ESB and see the tremendous contribution it has made to national development and to social progress, to recall and pay tribute to the great men who pioneered the development of electrical current in this country.  I refer in particular to what must have been the colossal undertaking in the 1920s of the harnessing of the River Shannon and the establishment of the hydro-electric power station at Ardnacrusha and particularly the two men whose names will be ever synonymous with the ESB&mdash;our former very distinguished colleague, Deputy Paddy McGilligan, and the late Dr. Tommy McLaughlin.  As one who comes from a constituency adjacent to Ardnacrusha, I feel it is only right, now that we are approaching the 50th anniversary of many great happenings associated with the foundation of this State, that apart from the securing of national freedom the men who built this State and laid the foundations for economic <Col N="1128" /> and social progress should be recalled to mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing £10 million more for the ESB to complete the job of rural electrification.  I understand that about 90 per cent of households are now connected and whatever part of the remaining 10 per cent as can be connected at what the Minister calls reasonable costs will be completed by the end of four years from now.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the special service charge.  Because of my background and association with rural development generally I cannot but say that my great desire is to see every household in rural Ireland with electricity. I think the Minister wants that also.  I do not believe in making political speeches in relation to highly technical matters such as are involved in this Bill.  I realise very fully that there are difficulties.  I welcome the decision to accelerate completion of the rural electrification programme but I have grave doubts about it because the Minister has suggested in relation to the special service charge that the price quoted for connection is reasonable. I know, and I am sure so does every Deputy including the Minister, of cases where completely unrealistic figures have been quoted to householders seeking connection.  I do not know if the Minister can supply the figure but I should like to know the total cost of abolishing the special service charge altogether particularly when only 10 per cent of households in rural Ireland now remain to be connected.</P>
    <P>I have seen what appears to me to be outrageously high figures.  In one case recently £200 was quoted to a widow living in a very small house. Perhaps, at a later stage the Minister by way of question and answer, might be able to furnish information to me on the cost of abolishing the special service charge or considerably reducing it.  I know it was reduced in 1968 and that that reduction resulted in a considerable number of households being connected but as we move towards completion of the rural electrification programme we shall be dealing more and more with isolated households which are more difficult to reach and the cost per house, therefore, will <Col N="1129" /> be greater in view of the fact that the number of houses remaining is becoming smaller all the time.  I wonder would it be possible to introduce a special low rate which would enable almost 100 per cent connection to be effected.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's optimistic forecast in regard to the final mopping up operation in relation to the extension of rural electrification, I cannot see this being achieved if the ESB continue to quote the prices they are, and have been quoting, judging by instances I have come across.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues have complained about this and questions have been asked here about it, particularly by Deputy Murphy whose constituency, because of its geographical location, has, perhaps, more scattered households than any other part of Ireland.  This special service charge is a bone of contention.  Perhaps, now that the Minister is making a special effort to complete this colossal programme of electrification it might be possible to abolish this charge.  I have already acknowledged the tremendous transformation effected in rural Ireland by electricity, apart from the economic advantages in regard to modern agricultural development, development of rural industries and tourism and the growth of hotels and guesthouses and so on.  Most of this development would not have been possible without electricity.  A special case can now be made to ensure that the remaining 10 per cent, or whatever the figure is, of households in rural Ireland would be connected with the electricity supply.</P>
    <P>People frequently do not appreciate the tremendous difference electricity has made in the lives of people in rural Ireland.  I was very conscious of this some years ago when the Galtee area of east Limerick was in the constituency I represented before it was transferred to the west Limerick constituency before the last election.  In my time as a Deputy for that area we had a number of isolated pockets there and I was personally involved in negotiations to secure electricity and about 35 or 36 households were connected there at that time.  With <Col N="1130" /> electricity came modern agricultural methods such as milking machines and cooling equipment which are now so necessary for the dairying industry, domestic equipment and television.  I have studied this very closely as a student of the sociology rather than of the economics of rural Ireland.  I have been tremendously interested by the way in which the whole way of living of the people in this rather isolated, semi-mountainous area was transformed by electricity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the interests of the remaining households which the Minister now proposes to have connected in a massive operation, I hope this aim will be realised but I am prepared now to forecast that the Minister will have to come back to the House again if he and the Government are serious in ensuring that everybody gets an electricity supply.  Some scheme will have to be devised to make it financially feasible for every household to be connected. This must be the aim within the limits of reason.  I could not quantify it at this stage and give the number of houses that it would be physically impossible to connect to an electricity supply but there are such houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes in this Bill to effect what I would call perhaps, in my ignorance of accounting procedures, an integration of the two accounting systems.  I think that that is the best way to describe it.  Up to now rural electrification capital was separate from general purposes capital for accountancy purposes and it is now proposed to integrate the two.  The Minister used the word &ldquo;integrate&rdquo;; he said he considered the time had come to integrate the two separate accounts and make one general provision for total capital expenditure. Rural electrification is desirable on social grounds and, therefore, the community will be asked to pay the cost. I have said here before in discussions on Bills relating to other State or semi-State bodies, CIE, the air lines and so on, that there should be a more realistic system of accounting and presenting accounts.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of a system that would separate what might be called <Col N="1131" /> the true economic cost of a development from the community or social cost.  A classic example of this is the railways and the cost to the community of maintaining uneconomic transport services.  In regard to the ESB, there have been developments during the years, particularly with regard to the peat fired stations and a number of two or three megawatt stations around the western seaboard which, if assessed solely on an economic basis, would not be justified in comparison with alternative sources of power.  The cost of generating electricity through the peat fired stations and the smaller stations in the west is greater than by using other types of generating stations.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a system whereby the cost of providing electricity by means of what could be termed the less economic forms&mdash;such as peat fired generating stations which are justifiable for community or social reasons&mdash; would be spelled out.  I have also been advocating that the cost of maintaining the railways should be stated clearly and in relation to the airlines their contribution to the tourist industry should be assessed.  It is unfair to a State-sponsored body, such as the ESB, to judge their performance solely on commercial balance sheet returns. Some assessment should be made of the social contributions of these bodies through the provision of services which are desirable on social grounds.  However, the cost should be identifiable in the annual reports.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the general capital requirements of the ESB.  It is not inappropriate that the Dáil should have an opportunity at this stage of looking at the ESB <i>in toto</i>, particularly having regard to the recent public outcry following the announcement of increased charges.  This led to my calling, on behalf of my party, for an inquiry into the performance of the ESB and in reply to a parliamentary question recently the Minister stated that he had decided to carry out an independent investigation in this connection. The Minister repeated this in his speech today, although Deputy O'Donovan is totally opposed to it.</P>

      <P>Since I have been elected to this House I have always tried to be in a position to stand over any statements I make and fortunately I have rarely been caught out.  In the latter part of his statement the Minister gives a general review of the ESB. When I advocated an independent examination of the ESB I did not say that they were an inefficient organisation&mdash;I have not said so at any time, I am not saying it now.  However, there was general consternation among the public when the ESB announced their recent increases.  It is the duty of a public representative to reflect the views of the people, not to propound his own theories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> In view of the fact that charges were increased some months ago it was extraordinary that a second increase should be made out of the blue and a third increase is pending.  The necessity for the increases is difficult to understand, particularly when one takes account of the continuous growth in the consumption of electricity.  The Minister referred to the fact that the average annual increase in the consumption of electricity in recent years is higher in Ireland than in any other country in western Europe.  The man in the street would take the view that as consumption of electricity is increasing, revenue to the board is rising also and therefore costs should be stabilised.</P>
    <P>I took the trouble to investigate the situation.  Last week in reply to a question which I tabled in regard to the investigation of the ESB, the Minister stated that the ESB were an efficient organisation but, for the purpose of convincing the public that the ESB are efficient, an independent investigation should be carried out.  This is a desirable course to adopt.  State-sponsored bodies are accountable to the taxpayers and this is as it should be.  Not merely must they be efficient, they must be seen to be efficient.  It would be a poor reflection on the intelligence of the people if they did not question the recent announcement of increased charges.  It is foolish to pretend to the public that we will allow this to go without making any comment. A public representative who does not take notice of what the public are saying is falling down on his job. Since I called for an investigation, and since the Minister announced that he had decided to have an independent investigation carried out, I have taken the trouble to study the ESB's performance. I have been given every facility by the ESB from the chairman down.  They were prepared to open any door, answer any question, or place any information at my disposal that I looked for.  I could not carry out a comprehensive investigation of the type for which the Minister will pay £7,000 a week or a month to McKinsey. From the point of view of satisfying myself as a public representative I got <Col N="1134" /> every facility from the ESB.  I looked into it fairly thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I am a bit surprised that the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to spell out some of the figures which I secured over the past week in relation to the performance and efficiency of the ESB.  The demand for electricity has been increasing at an enormous rate in recent years.  In 1966-67, the increase was 8.6 per cent.  In 1967-68 it was 10.3 per cent.  In 1968-69 it was 11.8 per cent.  In 1969-70 it was 10.5 per cent.  The average annual increase in the OECD countries was 5 to 6 per cent only.  The sales graph shows a corresponding pattern.  Of course, sales are related directly to the consumption of electricity.  The public have been puzzled by this.  Sales are going up all the time and, at the same time, it has been found necessary to increase charges.  When I looked into the reasons for the increased charges I found a rather interesting situation.  I found that the increased charges were necessary for three main reasons.  One is the colossal increase in fuel charges. The second is the increase in the cost of capital and the third is the higher salaries and wages which had to be paid within the guidelines of the national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>The public are not aware that in the past two years the increase in the cost of oil was more than 50 per cent.  On an annual fuel bill of £4.3 million, which was the figure for 1969-70, this represents a colossal increase in costs. It serves to emphasise what was said here a few weeks ago in the debate on the Nuclear Energy Bill about the vital importance of looking for alternative sources of supply to fuel supply.  The ESB are dependent to the tune of 50 per cent for the generation of electric current on imported oil.  As I have just said, one of the factors leading to increased charges was the colossal increase in the cost of fuel&mdash;50 per cent in one go, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The cost of capital was a very important factor also.  Heavy capital borrowings have been necessary to meet the ever-growing demand for electricity.  The ESB have borrowed from many different sources: from the International Bank for reconstruction and development, and from Irish, German, <Col N="1135" /> Swiss, and United States banks. The cost of servicing borrowed capital has also increased.  I understand that loans from the World Bank are available for the specific purpose of increasing generating capacity at 6½ to 7¼ per cent.  Capital requirements for network extensions have to be met by the issue of stocks at about 9 per cent. From what I have read about the capital requirements of the ESB and how they have been met one striking thing emerges, that is, that it is estimated that additions to network are now costing the board nearly 12 per cent per annum in interest and sinking fund provisions alone.  As I said, the third factor was the increase in wages and salaries.  I think £13 million or 28 per cent of the board's operating costs went on wages and salaries last year.  Therefore, wage and salary increases will have an impact as well.</P>
    <P>Those three factors, the increased cost of fuel, the cost of capital, and wage and salary increases, were absorbed by the ESB up to comparatively recent times.  Of course, the board are compelled by legislation to equate revenue with expenditure.  The aim has been to absorb increased costs by higher productivity.  Here is the point, and here is the catch, and here is where the real key to the recent increases can be found: due to the generally higher inflationary tendencies, increased productivity is no longer sufficient to meet increased costs.  This is the key to the whole thing.  Increased inflationary tendencies and this insidious spiral of inflation have been with us for quite a while and have hit the ESB as well as everyone else.  They could not equate revenue with expenditure without increasing their charges.</P>
    <P>The question still remains&mdash;and, perhaps, here is where the Minister's idea of an investigation into the ESB might be useful&mdash;can productivity be improved or increased?  As a result of the independent investigation which the Minister is carrying out it may be found that at the moment there are certain areas where efficiency might be improved.  I do not know.  I am not competent to judge and I have no intention of making pronouncements or judgments of this nature.  The only <Col N="1136" /> thing I can take is the general situation in the ESB.  It would appear that there is little scope for increased productivity. I have found a very interesting set of figures which show the comparison between ESB electricity tariffs and the tariffs of a number of electricity boards in the United Kingdom. I got a list of 16 of them.  I suppose the Minister has it as well.  I think I am doing the Minister's job today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has done very well to get that.  It is very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very interesting. I have commented publicly on the recent increases and I have called for an investigation but, at the same time, I want to be honest and fair and say at this stage what I have found from my investigations and then see can we arrive at an answer to whether an investigation is called for. As I said it is possible that there are certain areas where efficiency might be improved, where productivity might be improved and so forth.  I want to compare the ESB tariffs with the tariffs of various electricity boards in the UK. I will quote from the <i>Electrical Mail</i>, which is the journal of the Electricity Supply Board, for July, 1971.  This was sent to me by the ESB after I had my discussion with them.  Out of 16 boards in the United Kingdom there are only two which show more favourable tariffs than the ESB.  One of the two is the Belfast Corporation and the other is the North Western Board.  The more favourable terms they show are in respect of certain categories in the 1,500 to the 3,000 units.  Electricity charges here compare very favourably. The figures I have got&mdash;I assume they are accurate&mdash;reveal a very striking situation.  Electricity here is cheaper than it is in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As we know, the ESB is compelled by law to equate revenue with expenditure and the board had no option but to increase charges recently.  However, these increased charges have an implication, in my opinion, more for the Government than for the ESB and blame for the increases must be shouldered to a very <Col N="1137" /> large degree by the Government because of a policy which has led to the serious inflationary situation we have, an inflation affecting all spheres of national life.</P>
      <P>As I say, the ESB charges compare more than favourably with those of similar boards throughout the United Kingdom.  I have not got the figures for the Continent&mdash;I was supplied with them but I did not have time to analyse them&mdash;but I am sure that the ESB compares favourably with Europe as well.  The significant aspect, in my opinion, in relation to my seeking an investigation, and the Minister announcing he would carry out such an investigation, is the importance of properly informing the public and any such an investigation should convince them that the ESB is as efficient as it can be and should be and is doing a good job.  What kind of investigation should the Minister carry out?  I do not know.  I would hesitate to recommend the employment of the famous McKinsey people again, remembering the fees they charge.</P>
      <P>We have had a number of debates here in the past eight or nine months on the relationship between State-sponsored bodies and Parliament and the public accountability of such bodies.  Deputy O'Donovan moved a Private Members' Bill some months ago on this very matter.  If there were a proper system of parliamentary accountability introduced much of the ill-informed and, in many cases uninformed comment and criticism in regard to State-sponsored bodies from the public generally and from Members of this House could be avoided.  This was brought home to me very forcibly the other day when I was having a discussion with the chairman of the ESB.  If there were a proper system of accountability we would not have to go around seeking information. The executives of the board could meet a parliamentary committee; in that way there would be parliamentary control and we would also know what the situation was in the ESB and, more important still, the public would know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has more State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of his Department <Col N="1138" /> than has any other Minister and it is becoming an impossible task for Deputies to keep abreast of developments and to make a proper assessment of the performances of these companies, most of which deal with highly technological and highly sophisticated developments. If we had this system of parliamentary committees to examine the performances of State-sponsored bodies it might not be necessary to employ foreign consultants to the same extent that we have been employing them up to this and the public would be better informed and would have a better understanding of the problems involved.  From my experience of State-sponsored bodies I believe they would welcome a situation in which we could be properly informed of their progress.</P>
    <P>The ESB has made tremendous strides.  It was the first State-sponsored body to be established.  Its history has been one of continuous growth, development and expansion.  We had a debate a few weeks ago on nuclear power and obviously the next decade will be a period of tremendous development. The Minister referred to the financial difficulties involved.  I believe the ESB will more than adequately meet the challenge of the future and I believe the staff will prove equal to whatever challenge may be presented technologically.  The development of nuclear energy is inevitable and it is vital that we get away now as quickly as possible from our very dangerous over-dependence on fuel oil as a source for generating electricity.</P>
    <P>One point in relation to the ESB which I want to mention in passing is that of safety.  I was rather alarmed to read that over 600 accidents, including two fatal accidents, affecting ESB employees occurred in the last year.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the question of safety in relation to the general public.  It is essential that the public be properly informed about the dangers which can result from faulty communications and from the improper use of instruments or machines powered by electricity.  Scarcely a month passes by without one hearing of somebody being electrocuted.</P>
    <P>I understand the ESB are tackling <Col N="1139" /> the problem of safety.  They have appointed a special officer and established a special section to deal with it. I am very conscious of the dangers of electricity because a member of my family, who was using an electric drill which was live, was saved by the quick action of a workman.  I am sure others are aware of personal experiences of this kind as well.  I would urge on the ESB the desirability of ensuring that the public are fully informed of the dangers of faulty connections and so forth and that proper standards will be introduced in the matter of electric installations in private residences and particularly on farms.  I understand strict standards are applied in relation to industrial installations and hotel installations but I am concerned about people on farms where rough and ready jobs have been done and where there are electrical appliances which are connected to plugs which have not been properly wired and so on.</P>
    <P>I hope the ESB will continue to progress. I am confident the ESB will continue to play an important role in the national development of social programmes. I am confident in the likelihood of our entering the EEC that the ESB will prove their worth and show themselves to be as efficient as electricity boards on the Continent.  I hope the ESB will be able to provide electric current for industry and agriculture at the lowest possible rate and thereby enable our industrial and agricultural exports to be competitive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should admit straight away that I have not applied the same energy to the affairs of the ESB as Deputy O'Donnell has.  I have given some thought to the affairs of the ESB.  The last increase in charges was made about a fortnight ago and certain comments were made through the news media about these increases.  I made no comment because I could not be found.  The Minister was at the launching of a boat and I was on the bogs with Bord na Móna on that day.  I do not think they thought the day was all that suitable but it was all right as far as I was concerned as the only new engine which they had brought into <Col N="1140" /> the place was able to work.  I had seen all the others previously.</P>
      <P>I am going to start in reverse and talk about the Minister's suggestion that he is going to have a new inquiry into the ESB.  Different Governments approach things in different ways. There was one Minister who thought he had solved a problem when he made a nice rotund statement about it.  There was another Minister whose speciality was setting up companies.  He would set them up in a hurry and if something went wrong he would pass a new Bill through the House to fix it up; it did not bother him a thraneen that the whole thing turned out to be ill thought out.</P>
      <P>If there is any particular facet of the Government's operation that is very apparent to people it is their desire to set up consultancy bodies to look into various affairs.  I do not disapprove absolutely of consultancy bodies but I should like to be sure that they know something about what they are investigating.  I have no great belief in American consultancy bodies in relation to a country the size of this country which is about the size of the State of Maine.  The State of Maine is situated in the north-eastern corner of the United States and it is hardly ever mentioned except in connection with Presidential elections because the first primaries occur there.  That is almost the only time that one hears Maine or New Hampshire mentioned.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister saw the programme about MIT on television last night; I only saw part of it.  When I was in the United States 40 years ago MIT was a very interesting place.  It was nothing compared with what it is today.  I was shown over it at that time by a student and it was then rather like our engineering schools are today, almost entirely technological.  The programme last night showed it to be an entirely different kind of place.  It was just fabulous, with miles and miles of huge buildings and an expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds mentioned off the cuff, £100 million for this and £100 million for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think consultancy bodies <Col N="1141" /> who are accustomed to that kind of territory are much good to us.  I do not think the appointment of a businessman from inside the country to act as chairman of a committee or commission to inquire into the public service is very much good.  I like people to know what they are inquiring into. The words of St. Augustine which I used recently in this House were: &ldquo;I measure it, Oh my Lord, my God, but I know not what it is that I measure&rdquo;.  He was talking about &ldquo;time&rdquo;.  As we all know nowadays we go in for measuring much more complicated things than time.  These words written by St. Augustine 1,500 years ago are very apposite.  If one is going to get people to measure the efficiency of the ESB one must be sure that they know what it is that they are measuring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, they might get a shock.  Very often they might catch the wrong switch or something like that.  The fact is that I am extremely sceptical of this kind of thing. When an organisation of this kind is set up it very often takes on decided elements of being an organism, that is to say, it takes on a life of its own and develops in a certain way.  It has been said about political parties that men may join and think they can change but they find out in fact that that party have a certain kind of life and it is not that easy to push them around.  Therefore, I would refer again to the Minister's statement:</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that I am personally quite satisfied the ESB are in the forefront of electricity authorities throughout the world in supplying cheap electricity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>OK, what else is it there for?  What other purpose is it supposed to be there for?</P>
      <P>&mdash;but to ensure that the affairs of the ESB continue to be conducted efficiently, I am, as already announced, arranging to have a special investigation made into the efficiency of the board's operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not announce that. He announced that he was considering <Col N="1142" /> it.  This is the first time he has announced it.  He did not announce that he was having a special investigation. He announced that he was thinking of having it.  Now he obviously has come down in favour of having it.  I do not mind being quoted quite categorically as saying that there have been enough investigations into the ESB in recent years.  Any organisation like the ESB which is continually being investigated loses elan, loses impetus; the people who run it inevitably become discouraged.  It is rather like the other angle which affects people and which does not affect the ESB at all but which is affecting too many of the other State bodies&mdash;a much more serious matter&mdash;that is to say, having big losses year after year.  That affects their efficiency and they get upset and public opinion comes out very strongly against them.</P>
    <P>I notice Deputy O'Donnell said the public should be convinced that the ESB is as efficient as it should be. What good is that going to do?  What difference would it make?  Suppose there is an investigation and the investigators all come out and say: &ldquo;Very good.  The public are now convinced that the ESB are as efficient as they should be,&rdquo; what difference does that make?  The ESB is a monopoly organisation.  It has a monopoly of the market.  It fixes its prices for current, as a matter of fact, at, appropriately, just sufficient to cover its cost.  It does this, so that to use the phrase, year to year, taking one year with another, it will pay its way and, unlike 90 per cent of the other semi-State bodies, it does pay its way.  That is the difference and we have had it admitted here today both by Deputy O'Donnell and the Minister, both of whom are so keen on this new investigation into the affairs of the ESB, that electricity is just as cheap here as it is in England.</P>

      <P>Has the Deputy ever heard of an investigation that increased efficiency?  Give me an example. Admittedly, it is answering the Deputy's question by asking another but there is a point in it.  The proof of any organisation is simple.  There are certain proofs that the public like to see: is it paying its way and are the charges it is making for its services reasonable?  On both these tests the ESB passes with first class honours, whereas a large number of the semi-State bodies would not pass at all.  They fall flat on their faces.</P>
      <P>I was thinking about this problem last week, apart altogether from this Bill.  To the best of my knowledge the ESB, the Sugar Company and the Dairy Disposal Company are almost the only State bodies that are really paying their way.  If the Minister disagrees he can give me an example.  If he does I will deal with it because I know these bodies fairly well.  Can he give me an example other than the Sugar Company and the Dairy Disposal Company, which is relatively small?  The others do not pay their way.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave me the text.  I have not really developed it.  I have been speaking for only about a quarter of an hour.  I have not really got into the subject.  There is no question about it that if the Minister wants to set up bodies to investigate Departments of State, or this or that, they would be much better employed than directing their attention to the ESB.  This is much the same as people who talk first and think afterwards.  There are lots of them around.</P>

      <P>On my right hand side, up on the right bank.  It is interesting. I want to say one more word about Deputy O'Donnell.  I did not hear what Deputy O'Donnell said about this increase in the ESB charges.  Unfortunately, I was away. I gather he said it was deplorable.  It did not take him long to change his mind.  This is an example of talking first and thinking afterwards.  The evening he was asked by the news media what he thought of it he said a lot of things.  As I say, I am vulnerable. If Deputy O'Donnell says to me: &ldquo;I did not say any such thing; look, I said it was inevitable&mdash;that with inflation these increases in charges were inevitable,&rdquo; I would have to admit that I did not hear them; but what I suspect he said was that this was outrageous, that it was not good enough. This is the kind of thing I would expect him to have said.  It did not take him very long to change his mind because here this evening, having gone to a good deal of trouble and having worked very hard on the matter as far as I can gather, he now says that these increases were all justified, that they are due, from what we have heard from the ESB announcement, to increases in the price of fuel oil, due to increases in the price of capital&mdash;and of course in this country the rates are higher than anywhere else in the world; we have the highest interest rate in the western world&mdash;and due to <Col N="1146" /> increases in wages and salaries.  Of course, wages have been put up when men are at rockbottom rates and at the ordinary cost of living rates, the subsistence level becomes different in different times and the rates have to go up with an inflation of 10 per cent per annum.  It will be better of course than 10 per cent this year.</P>
      <P>I amused myself by making some calculations.  If the Minister would like to hear about electricity generation, I want to give him a few calculations I made while he and Deputy O'Donnell were speaking.  It interests me greatly that all that was given for the installation of these gas units in the 1962 Act was a grant of £10.  There are cases where it costs many hundreds of pounds to bring electricity to certain rural users and of course this was an altogether wrong approach&mdash;let me say <i>post factum</i> and having looked at it&mdash; stringing miles of wire to bring electricity to a couple of families instead of using other methods that might have been used.  The oldest approach was to put in an internal combustion engine and generate electricity for these three or four houses.  It could be done at a lower cost than the cost of putting up the poles and stringing the wires, but there was yet another method of doing it.  There are two forms of gas available &mdash;kosangas and calor gas, which are both much the same, and the only answer one gets when one suggests the use of kosangas or calor gas is that they could not run their television or radio sets on that.  Of course they can run their radio or television sets on ordinary batteries and the only trouble would be to get these recharged periodically or get new ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an element in this that &ldquo;everybody must have everything&rdquo;, but the trouble is that everybody cannot have everything and the person who, whether by being born there or by choice, decides to live on a distant mountain will have to do without electricity.  Mind you, he may have other compensations for living on the distant mountain that may appeal to him but he cannot have it every way and this is one of the well-known facts of life.  As was said by a professor of metaphysics on one occasion, if you marry one woman, you cannot marry <Col N="1147" /> another, which was not a bad comment from a professor of metaphysics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so questionable here in the Republic of Ireland legally&mdash;it is true all right here.  This grant was increased to £35 in 1968 and that showed an element of common sense coming into the Government when they increased the grant for these gas units to £35.  Mind you, it should be increased still more because the further you go in trying to fill in all these little bits and pieces electrically, the more expensive it is going to be.</P>
      <P>I come now to my own calculations which amused me arithmetically.  I found that on an expenditure of £49 million, there was a subsidy of £17 million, which is about 33? per cent, and on an expenditure of £27 million in respect of the present development, there is to be a subsidy of £17 million. The subsidy was 33? per cent on the earlier expenditure up to now and it is going to be 60 per cent from now on. The subsidy element is to be £10 million on the £17 million as against £17 million out of £49 million.  If you twist the figures around what is amusing about it is the arithmetical aspect that the £49 million is going up to £67 million&mdash;that is going up 33? per cent as well&mdash;and strangely enough the subsidy is going up from £17 million to £27 million.  That is going up by 60 per cent also, the amount as distinct from the ratio of subsidy.  This happens to be an arithmetical trick.  The figures from their nature have come out that way&mdash;they agree with one another and you get these kind of peculiar&mdash;it is like fiddling with figures &mdash;things happening.  You get this kind of coincidence.</P>
      <P>There is no question about it that when we consider that it was only in 1970, that we had the last limit&mdash; a year and a half ago we had the ESB Bill which fixed the previous amount, to the best of my knowledge, at £340 million.  Am I right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not disagree with the Minister but I am justified in pointing out that even if it is going to cover us for a longish period of time, it is an extraordinary increase in relation to a job which in effect was already done.</P>
      <P>I then come to expenditure on electricity in which we have indulged in this country.  The Minister points out that we have an increasing demand for electricity of 13 per cent in rural areas and he now says that urban areas are 10 per cent at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a period in the middle sixties when the rate in urban areas was going up at a higher rate but this would be expected.  What I do not understand in connection with this matter is why the State, or the ESB, will not face up to something which I mentioned, I think, to the Minister on the last occasion the Bill was before us, that in England time and again they have had excessive use and had to have blackouts.  Blackouts are not the worst things in the world. If you are paying 10 per cent for capital and you have an excess of power installed, it might be a great deal worse than having an occasional blackout.  The Minister has said:</P>
      <P>It is because of the need not alone to meet peak demand but to have a reserve or security margin in addition and because it is not practicable to store electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know about its not being practicable to store electricity, but as to <Col N="1149" /> the reasons for security margins in addition, I am one of these strange people who see nothing wrong with having no reserve for peak demand. Let me also say this&mdash;as I said already &mdash;that I am informed that our Electricity Supply Board are meticulously careful to observe the limit the manufacturers set and not to go over the limits in the use of the generators set by the manufacturers, whereas I am again reliably informed that in Germany and in England, they push these generating sets far beyond the limits set by the manufacturers because the manufacturers naturally allow themselves a wide margin of safety for their own good names.  I am told that one could, with safety, push these generators to a greater capacity than they are being pushed at present.  This would reduce the massive capital costs involved.  My only criticism of the ESB is that they are too careful about safety standards.  There may be many people who would not agree with me on this but I am aware that in both Germany and Great Britain these generators work to a greater capacity than ours.</P>
    <P>It has taken much longer than envisaged originally to complete rural electrification.  This project was to have been completed by the year 1960, but 11 years later it is still uncompleted. Of course, in the world of today people want everything but it would be impossible to provide them with everything they want.  Before reaching this stage at all it might have been better if the Government had not paid so much attention to certain rural Deputies who came here and asked, for instance, &ldquo;When will electricity be supplied to Ballylickey?&rdquo; Ballylickey is a hamlet which is very much isolated but they have electricity.  The nature of democracy is such that people representing such an area make the best case possible. In the words of Deputy O'Donnell this is not rural economics, but rural sociology.  I might say that there is no such subject in reality as sociology. Subject to these comments I approve of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to stress the importance of rural electrification.  This <Col N="1150" /> question affects my constituency very much.  In particular, it affects that part of the constituency from outside Galway city extending to the coast and, further, to the Aran Islands. Deputies such as Deputy O'Donovan would not have many people calling at their doors inquiring about when electricity will be supplied to their area but I have many people calling at my door making such inquiries and it is not mere hamlets that are involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is talking about the main roads. I could take him along by-roads where there are many people who have no electricity supply.  I could take him to many places in my constituency where people still depend on the paraffin lamp or the candle.  Indeed, I might say that it is hardly possible now to buy a globe for one of these lamps.  People come from Dublin and buy the lamps as antiques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past some old people would not agree to have a supply connected to their homes and the result is that the younger people are deprived of this very necessary amenity.  All over the countryside new houses are wired for electricity but supplies are not available to them. Central heating units are installed in many of these houses but they are useless because of the non-availability of power.  It is time that we made life worth living for these people.  I would stress the priority of west Galway because the people in that area depend to a large extent on tourism.  Many farmhouses and other houses provide accommodation for visitors but the tourists who come are not prepared to accept a paraffin lamp or a candle as a means of lighting.  Supplying electric power to this area would be a very definite way of helping the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a real need for the laying of a heavy line from Rahoon, through <Col N="1151" /> Furbo and further along the coast.  It is galling for people out there to look down on Galway city and see the lights flooding the sky while they themselves have no supply.  Apart from domestic lighting and heating there are people in these areas who rear pigs and it would be very helpful to them to have electrification.  It is important that anyone in an area such as west Galway or in any other area for that matter who is anxious to start a small home industry, should be encouraged to do so, so that emigration might be stemmed.  Service charges are crushing in some areas and I am sorry there is nothing in the Bill to indicate that these charges may be reduced.  However, it is the bill that comes from the ESB which interests these people.  Perhaps the Minister will give an indication of some hope in this respect.  All of this is a far cry from the time that the proposed Shannon scheme was referred to as a white elephant.  Of course, it is not very popular to mention that point in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>Regardless of whether it was a white or a pink elephant, we must get on with the job.  I have mentioned here previously the question of nuclear energy.  This seems to be on the long finger.  The Minister mentioned Turlough Hill where, I understand, water is pumped all day to the top of the hill and then let run down at night. I wonder what are the economies of such a scheme.  Previously, too, I referred to the harnessing of the tides. There is a continuous supply from the tides.  Time and tide wait for no man and I hope that something will be done towards harnessing the tides&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not mind where it comes from.  The Shannon is a dirty word as far as some of these people are concerned in relation to electricity. I should like the Minister in his reply to say what the hopes are. I think it could be done at a very low cost.  I have mentioned the question of electricity <Col N="1152" /> for the Aran Islands.  I mentioned it many years ago.  I should like to know whether the Minister has anything in this Bill; he has not mentioned it but they are at the talking stage about the provision of electricity in that area.  Aran is one of the greatest tourist areas in the west and I should like to know what they are doing. Are they getting on with the job and seeing that people will have this amenity to cater for tourists?</P>
      <P>I do not propose to hold up this Bill one minute.  In fact, it is many years late.  The spending of this money is to be spread over four years.  People have already been told they will not get electricity until 1975 in my area. These people are catering for farmhouse holidays.  The Minister has said they will get priority.</P>

He has to prove himself first.  There are many people in this area crying out for electricity. Hardly a week goes by that I do not have people calling about it. I have pressed it in this House and I will continue to press it and to question the expenditure of this money.</P>

      <P>The success of the rural electrification scheme can be gauged by looking around this House today and seeing the number of rural Deputies who are prepared to contribute to this debate.  I should imagine that on a similar debate some years ago quite a number of extra Deputies would have come in to contribute. Perhaps, the problems of rural electrification exist only in the west and in Wicklow.  I hope that is so.  I hope all the other counties are now more or less up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Difficult counties <Col N="1153" /> such as ours, mountainous areas and the like, are being left until last.  County Wicklow on the eastern side of the country has undoubtedly been left until last.</P>
      <P>One of the first speeches I made when I came into this House was on the Estimate for Transport and Power.  On that occasion I raised the question of special charges.  It was obvious to me from the number of complaints I had received from rural areas that the ESB never refused anybody electricity.  They just sent out an estimate which was so high as to be impossible for the ordinary rural householder to meet.  I produced three letters which on that occasion had been sent to me by three householders in my constituency.  The estimates for the special charges were something like £68 in one case, £170 in another and £350 in the third case.  It was simply a way of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It was a polite way, perhaps, but it meant that these people were put off indefinitely.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, there are three types of household remaining to be connected.  There are households in the more remote areas which have never been canvassed.  These are the households which the Minister says will be connected in the next four years.  These are in the more difficult areas.  They are the most costly connections, the more scattered houses and, therefore, I must admit that possibly they should have been left until last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second type of household which remains is in an area which has already been canvassed.  For one reason or another the people refused or were not in a position to avail of the service when they were canvassed.  There are quite a number of such cases outstanding. The situation has changed in a number of these households.  Perhaps, the head of the family on the occasion of the initial canvass was not in a financial position to accept the extra burden.  Perhaps, there is now some extra prosperity in the household, more wage-earning individuals in the household and they are in a position to afford electricity.  Perhaps, simply after seeing the advantages of it they have decided they want <Col N="1154" /> the service.  These people, I think, are in a majority in Wicklow because it is from this type of case that I get most complaints and this is the type to which I have already referred who have got very high estimates for connections.</P>
    <P>In some areas I believe people were not canvassed at all.  I wrote last year to the ESB area office at Brewery Road, Stillorgan.  I made representations on behalf of three in the Tittour area of Newtownmountkennedy which is only 22 or 23 miles from Dublin. They were never canvassed when the area got its service.  They state categorically that they were never approached even though they were willing to have service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is downright shabby.  A mistake could have been made on the first occasion but I cannot understand it on the second occasion when I left them in no doubt that I was rather annoyed with the treatment I have received.  It makes me feel that these people were, perhaps, left out and that there is no excuse for it. Since there is a team now working in the Calary area of Wicklow, perhaps, they could do the job in the Tittour area of Newtownmountkennedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third group are people with new houses.  There are too few of these <Col N="1155" /> in rural areas in Wicklow.  The house building programme by the local authority there is downright disastrous. In the past few years there have been only 46 houses built by the local authority so it has not been a great problem for the ESB to service them. There has been quite a lot of building by individuals with SDA loans <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that in 1967 the estimate was 26,000 new installations required.  I do not know what period that covered, whether it was to be done immediately or in the four years.  He went on to point out that 34,000 installations were made in the last four years leaving a balance of 14,000 households still to be connected. It appears to me that the estimate was out by 22,000, although I may be in error.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think that is a low figure judging by the demand for houses in my own area.  We would certainly need to build 1,000 houses almost immediately to meet the demand in rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Half of that would certainly be in the rural areas.  Perhaps, my estimate is wrong but judging by local demands, 3,500 houses annually for the next four years seems a low figure for rural areas in the whole of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wanted to make those comments <Col N="1156" /> about Wicklow in particular.  We have a problem which, perhaps, is solved in some of the surrounding counties such as Kildare, Dublin and Wexford.  I suppose when the ESB begin to complete some of the more inaccessible areas in Wicklow, comfortable people in this city will object to the ESB stringing wires across the countryside. We find this happening in Wicklow for various reasons time and again; people from outside are inclined to object to either house building or wiring installations. The ESB spend a good deal of money trying to make their installations blend with the surroundings.  The storage scheme at Turlough Hill, which will help to even out the peak and valley periods in the use of electricity, will be a great advantage to the ESB and possibly this type of venture will have to be repeated if consumption continues to rise by the 9 to 14 per cent annually which the Minister says is the present rate.</P>
    <P>I would not go as far as Deputy O'Donovan in saying there is no need for some reserve.  There is need for a reserve and, with consumption expanding at the present rate, the reserve will be narrow enough and spending of money on generating plans will continue for years to come.  There seems to be no abatement in the use of power. To some extent this is a measure of prosperity and to some extent it represents a change from traditional sources of energy.  If this is to continue I welcome the Bill and I hope it will solve the problem of the outstanding households. The Minister has almost guaranteed that households not already connected will now get an opportunity of getting a supply.  It will be a blessing to all who come from rural constituencies that at the very worst it will take four years to meet outstanding demands from rural dwellers for electricity. I think nobody in the House would wish to deny the few remaining thousands the benefits of electricity in their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take first the final point emphasised by Deputy Kavanagh about the people in the 520 areas completed who did not apply for connections under previous <Col N="1157" /> schemes in these areas.  Public advertisements will be issued by the ESB in the local and national Press inviting those who are not connected to apply for connection.  I should like to urge all such people to apply immediately to the ESB when the advertisement appears.  This is all important. This is their final chance. Whether it was because of their own neglect or their predecessors' that they did not apply in the past 25 years is now regarded as water under the bridge and they are getting a final chance.  I urge them to apply now and everything Deputies can do in their constituencies to ensure that this is done will be of social benefit to these areas.</P>
      <P>In the 272 areas that have not been completed there will be a total personal re-canvass.  There will be public advertisements in the 520 completed areas to enable those not yet connected to apply and in the 272 areas not yet completed there will be a house-to-house canvass to ensure that they can all participate in rural electrification.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. Our target is to get 98 per cent utilisation of rural electrification and this, in practice, is the maximum.  That is our target in the next four years.  The additional finance is being made available. It is a good example of planning ahead to achieve a target in the right way.  Last year £3.1 million was the capital expenditure on rural electrification. The programme envisages that this year the figure will jump to £3.7 million; next year to £4.1 million; in the third year to £4.7 million and to £5.5 million in the fourth and final year of the programme.  The ESB will have the required capital when this Bill becomes law.  They know the job to be done and they can plan accordingly over the next four years.  This is highly desirable because in recent years waiting for annual grants slowed down the rate of connection.  We want to ensure that the job is completed once and for all, that we provide the necessary <Col N="1158" /> capital and get rid of the back-log of accumulated applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a very positive benefit because these people, prior to 1968, were quoted charges that were far above the charges now operating since 1968 when the special service charge was reduced by reason of the additional Government subsidy to enable up to 75 per cent of the cost of installation to be met.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the point about the abolition of the special service charge.  It is estimated that it would cost £2 million to do this and I am afraid it is not possible.  The Deputy also referred to safety and the importance of safety instructions so far as electricity is concerned.  The ESB are very keen to ensure that there is maximum realisation by people of the importance of safety in regard to electrical devices.  As Deputy O'Donnell stated, they have established a special safety section within the board and I can tell the House that this section is planning a national newspaper campaign on elementary safety rules, of which all should be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state if the functions of the safety officer will apply only to the board or will he have external functions in relation to informing public opinion?  This is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will apply to both aspects.  Of course, it is primarily to ensure that the public are made safety-conscious in relation to electrical devices that this newspaper campaign is being initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the inquiry into the ESB.  I agree with Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donovan&mdash; and this point of view has been shared by the World Bank who have loaned the ESB substantial moneys in recent years&mdash;that the ESB are a highly efficient organisation.  Any inquiry into their affairs will reveal this fact to the fullest extent.  I am concerned that the public are made aware to a sufficient degree of the efficiency of the ESB. The most acid test of their efficiency is that during the years they have been able to raise their capital requirements on the money market, without any help from the State.  They have received substantial loans from the World Bank and they will be securing further loans on the international money market to finance their very considerable investment programme until 1980.  They have been able to raise these funds because of their efficiency, because they have been able to balance their books, present balanced accounts and show the overall picture of a well-run, efficient public corporation.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment Deputy O'Donnell for pointing out that in a publication issued yesterday there is a table setting out electricity price comparisons and it is apparent that in comparison with other electricity area boards in these islands&mdash;taking the various categories of unit into account&mdash;the prices charged by the ESB are the cheapest in these islands. In fact, the ESB have the most reasonable rates for domestic and industrial consumers in western Europe at the moment.  That is linked with the fact that they have the highest growth rate as regards consumption in western Europe&mdash;11 per cent per annum in recent years.  It highlights the necessity for this Bill when one considers that while the national average is 11 per cent, the average in rural areas is 13 per cent per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it is unfortunate for the ESB, from the point of view of public opinion, that there were two increases in one year and a third increase is pending?  Could this not have been phased over a longer period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1160" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The major problem facing the ESB in this matter&mdash; and this comes back to the point I made in the debate on the Nuclear Energy Bill a fortnight ago&mdash;is their growing dependence on oil supplies. The ESB must look to a future where oil prices will not be reduced, to put it mildly.  The pattern at the moment shows a steep rise in oil prices by reason of the new attitudes adopted by the producer countries in North Africa and the Middle East.  Unfortunately so far as the ESB are concerned, this is a fact of life; some 50 per cent of their fuel requirements are met from oil.  As I emphasised in the debate on nuclear energy, this is undesirable; so far as possible their fuel and energy requirements should be diversified.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan raised the point about the utilisation of tides.  The ESB have investigated this matter.  Generation of power by way of tide utilisation has been done at Le Rance in Northern France.  In that region there are enormous tides in a narrow estuary but there is not conclusive proof as yet about the success of this method. We have investigated the various estuaries in Ireland but the only one that could be considered in this connection is Shannon Estuary.  However, the tidal strength is not anything like what is necessary having regard to the present level of attainment in regard to machinery.  There may come a time when it may be utilised but the ESB assure me that it is not on at the present time, having regard to the lack of appropriate type of estuary, which requires a massive volume of tide, changing from a high to a low level fairly rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the Turlough Hill project.  This idea of storage generation, where by the storing of water it is possible to utilise the hydro-power generation at valley and peak periods, is being investigated.  This project is being pursued in regard to similar sites elsewhere.  One has been examined at the Comeragh mountains in County Waterford and another site is being examined also.  We consider there is scope for extension of this storage hydro-electric operation which does not generate new power but enables <Col N="1161" /> it to be stored so that the valley and peak periods are evened up and, when required, the power can be obtained. It is a principle similar to the interconnection principle that operates in regard to the Six Counties.  In this case the valley and peak periods are levelled up, by taking from one and giving to the other, as is needed between north and south.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputy Coogan that priority is given to registered guesthouses in extending supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The main purpose of the Bill has been emphasised sufficiently already.  It is to ensure that in a planned crash programme over four years we will achieve a 98 per cent connection as far as rural households are concerned.  We will then have really achieved the <Col N="1162" /> objective set out in 1946 when rural electrification commenced.  We want to ensure that in five years time the figure of 14,000 rural houses then connected will have reached the figure of 400,000 rural houses connected to electric power.</P>
      <P>We are also making use of this Bill to ensure that the new capital level of £450 million looks after the ESB requirements in the capital sense, primarily for new generation and new connection and distribution systems and that the capital programme over the next four years will also be looked after.  In this two-pronged Bill we have a target for the next four years that will enable rural electrification to be completed and the capital requirements of the ESB to be taken up by them to a level of £450 million.  I am certain that during that period the ESB will raise this capital on the money market as they have in recent years, and continue as an expanding organisation to meet interest repayments from their own resources as they have heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to participate in an international scheme to collect charges from airlines for en-route air navigation services which we supply.</P>
      <P>In common with other aeronautical authorities, we incur expenditure under two broad classifications in respect of air traffic control, radio navigation, communications and meteorological services provided for air transport.  The first head comprises terminal services at airports such as approach and takeoff control, instrument landing aids, radar monitoring and meteorological and general information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second type of service comprises those provided to aircraft en-route <Col N="1164" /> to ensure safe and accurate navigation and these are provided not only for aircraft travelling to and from our airports but for aircraft crossing our airspace on their way to other destinations. These services, generally described as en-route air navigation services, include air traffic control, radio aids, radar, telecommunications and meteorological services.  Up to the present the only charges we have made are landing charges for aircraft using our airports and a special telecommunication charge per contact for aircraft on the North Atlantic route using our telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>The recovery of en-route costs by an individual State presents difficulties where the air routes traverse the control area of several States and/or vertical sectors of routes subject to control by different authorities.  In such cases the only satisfactory means of recoupment is on the basis of inter-State co-operation. Such co-operation is possible under the aegis of the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, known as Eurocontrol. This organisation, of which Ireland is a member, together with Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, was set up with the object of controlling air traffic in the upper airspace of the seven member States&mdash;above 25,000 feet in the case of Ireland&mdash;while the member States are directly responsible for these services in their respective lower airspaces.  Meteorological services in both the upper and lower airspaces are the direct responsibility of the member States.</P>
    <P>The cost of route air navigation facilities and services has been constantly increasing and will rise considerably in the years ahead owing to the automation of control services which will be necessary to cope with the growth and density of air traffic in western Europe.  Eurocontrol member States have been considering the ways in which they could recover the cost of these facilities in the form of charges levied on the users.  Following lengthy study of the problem, the member States eventually decided that Eurocontrol should introduce a charging system which is in line with recommendations of the International Civil <Col N="1165" /> Aviation Organisation which has also carried out a study of the problem.</P>
    <P>Under the charging scheme proposed, there will be a single charge for each flight calculated according to the distance traversed and the weight of the aircraft.  The scheme will come into effect from 1st November, 1971. Eurocontrol will operate the scheme and collect the receipts.  The receipts less the actual cost of collection will be distributed to the member States in proportion to their costs in providing these services.  For the first two years it is aimed to collect only 15 per cent of costs plus the cost of collection but the long term aim is that the full costs of these services should be met by the air transport industry for whom they are provided.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1963, provides for the making of regulations for the payment of fees to Eurocontrol, or to the Minister for Transport and Power for transmission to Eurocontrol, in respect of air navigation services provided by Eurocontrol.  The section also covers payment of fees to the Minister in respect of services provided by the Minister.  The section, however, would not enable Eurocontrol to act as agent for the Minister in the collection of route charges.  The purpose of the Bill is to replace section 12 by a new provision which will enable the making of regulations to provide adequately for the new system of charges. Regulations, as provided for under the Bill, will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Because the proposed charge will be a single one applying to the lower airspace, which is the responsibility of member States, as well as to the upper airspace it is necessary that a multilateral agreement be entered into by the member States, the main provision of which is to require the member States to establish the proposed charge in the airspace falling within their competence.  For the collection of the charge it was necessary to complete a series of bilateral agreements between each member State and the Eurocontrol organisation, the main provisions of which are that each member State entrusts to the organisation the collection of the charge on its behalf and <Col N="1166" /> undertakes to take statutory powers to make it obligatory on airlines to pay the charge to the organisation.  The organisation is required to distribute the receipts to the member States less the cost of collection.</P>
    <P>These agreements were signed by the Irish Ambassador in Brussels in September, 1970.  The multilateral agreement was signed with reservation as to ratification, to be followed by ratification when this Bill becomes law.  The bilateral agreement with Eurocontrol will not become operative until the multilateral agreement enters into force following ratification by all member States.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an extension of the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1963.  There is nothing controversial in this measure.  It is a straightforward piece of legislation rationalising the arrangement in respect of the charges for the utilisation of airspace over different countries. This Bill emphasises the colossal growth of aviation in recent years and the colossal problems created as a result of that growth.  The introduction of larger and faster aircraft plus an increase in the volume of air traffic have created immense problems for air traffic control.  We have fortunately escaped the increased volume and the problems created for air traffic control operators in places like Heathrow, Kennedy Airport and other international airports.</P>
      <P>Air traffic control has been made more difficult with the advent of air piracy, which has come to be known as &ldquo;hijacking&rdquo;.  I happened to be at Shannon Airport last Sunday when an aircraft was diverted to Shannon en route from London to Washington because of a hijack or bomb scare. This is a factor with which airlines have to contend today and it presents air traffic control personnel with certain difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Air traffic control is a most fascinating and highly sophisticated business. I have sat in on practical demonstrations at Shannon and tribute must be paid to our air traffic control staff. They are involved in the wider context of Eurocontrol.  We should be <Col N="1167" /> immensely pleased at the way in which our staff have maintained the high standards they have.  They were, of course, sent to Europe for training. They are the equal of, if not better than, their colleagues in other countries. That should be a source of great satisfaction to us.</P>
    <P>Our record in the matter of air safety has been outstanding.  I am not aware of any accident blame for which could be pinned on a slip-up on the part of air traffic control personnel.  I have no hesitation in giving the Minister this Bill.  The Minister must have established a record since Christmas from the point of view of legislation here.  I think it is not generally recognised that a great deal of constructive work is done here in Parliament.  I like to give credit where credit is due.  I have always found the Minister most reasonable.  He has been most courteous in meeting suggestions put forward by Opposition Deputies and very ready to bring in amendments to meet points raised by Opposition Deputies. It is only right that I should pay him this tribute.  Personally, I am very grateful to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to air traffic control.  This exemplifies the benefit of European co-operation.  This has been in existence now for some years. I support what the Deputy said in regard to our air traffic control.  Those trained in Europe have done excellently. They are a credit in every sense of the word.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, this is highly sophisticated work.  It is of growing importance because of the growing number of aircraft.  The Bill is, of course, designed to ensure that charges are collected on behalf of the various member States which subscribe to Eurocontrol.  It is an enabling measure to ensure the work is done.</P>

      <P>On section 27, I understand the Chair has ruled that certain provisions in this section would be inappropriate to a Money Bill.  The purpose of this section was to remove, with effect from 1st July, 1971, a requirement which was held to be discriminatory under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement that certain vodka of United Kingdom origin must be warehoused for at least three years before being delivered for home consumption. In view of the Chair's ruling, I propose to remove section 27 but I also propose to introduce legislation at the first suitable opportunity bringing the provisions which were contained in section 27 into operation with effect from tomorrow, the 14th July, and in the meantime I am asking the Revenue Commissioners to remove the restriction administratively on this understanding.</P>

      <P>In this case these amendments are deemed necessary to preserve the Money Bill character of the Finance Bill.  The deletions are some matters which are incidental to the operation of the dual-channel customs system which have been included so as to make the section comprehensive.  I am proposing now to take these particular portions out, but their removal will not, of course, affect the powers which the Revenue Commissioners have at present to deal with such matters. They are simply being taken out to make the Bill comply with the Chair's requirements as a Money Bill but the section, as amended, would still provide the necessary powers to enable us to introduce the dual-channel system of control.  It would not, however, be possible both for physical reasons of adaptation of customs rooms and also because of the fact that the legislation is not enacted yet to introduce these changes in this tourist season but it would be hoped to do so as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I think I know what the Revenue Commissioners are trying to get at on this but, in fact, it is not correct.  A statutory instrument is not an enactment and the word &ldquo;made&rdquo; is intended to cover statutory instruments as I see it.  If they want to stick on enactments they cannot talk about enactments being made.  There is another way to do it and that is to say: &ldquo;In this Act and every other enactment for the time being in force and in all statutory instruments (whether passed or made before or after the passing of this Act), <Col N="1171" /> unless the contrary intention appears, `death duties' &rdquo; and so on and so forth but it is not right as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the various Finance Acts from about 1930 onwards the term &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; has been used as a general term to cover estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.  It has also been used in various statutory instruments, for example, in relation to the transfer of Government securities in payment of death duties that phrase has been used.  The term was defined as having this meaning, that is meaning the things I have outlined, in section 13 (3) of the Finance Act, 1894, but only for the purposes of that section. Doubts have arisen as to whether it would necessarily be interpreted in the same sense apart from that section and to remove any such doubts it is proposed that the term &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; be defined for all statutory purposes as having the meaning assigned to it by section 13 (3) of the 1894 Act.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 30 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 30 it is proposed to alter the rates of estate duties and the effect of the alteration will be to bring about what seems to me to be a punitive increase on what may be termed, comparatively, as the larger estate.  Under the rates of estate duty in operation at the moment, on estates up to £50,000 the rate per cent of duty is 30 per cent and from £60,000 to £75,000 the rate per cent of duty is 30 per cent and then from £75,000 to £100,000 the rate is 37 per cent and from £100,000 up the rate is 40 per cent.  Those are the existing percentage rates for duty.  Under the section now proposed there is a provision that from £50,000 to £55,000 shall be at 30 per cent; from £55,000 to £60,000 shall be at 33 per cent; from £75,000 to £100,000, at 41 per cent; from £100,000 to £150,000, at 45 per cent; £150,000 to £200,000, 50 per cent and £200,000 at 55 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that it is very easy to say that this is an effort to distribute wealth <Col N="1175" /> by imposing taxation on the larger estate and it is in that way that this kind of proposal has been put forward and defended in the past but I am bound to point out that we are now living in a highly inflationary situation and I am going to suggest that the estate which is valued now for estate duty and death duty purposes and market value, and so on, say, a farm in the midlands or in Meath or in County Dublin or in any part of Leinster, £60,000 valuation is not infrequently met and it by no means represents a person who is normally regarded as a person of wealth and means.  A farm that is properly run and therefore well-stocked, with a house that is well-kept, under the provisions of this legislation will frequently reach a valuation for estate duty purposes of £60,000 and more and this section proposes to increase the rate of duty significantly from that figure up.</P>
    <P>This is a taxing section and I believe the alteration in the rate of duty is unfair.  Without any alteration in the scale of duty and the rate per cent of duty, in any event, the Revenue Commissioners would have been getting an increasing revenue by reason of inflation and this is taking advantage of inflation to the detriment of the people who have to pay.  These are the persons who are accountable after the death and it will mean such a crippling load of taxation in certain cases that people will be forced to sell.  At this time &mdash; and I am going to say this in relation to other sections &mdash; with the intimation being given to us on behalf of the Government that we are about to enter Europe in the next 12 or 18 months, it is essential that we should not in any way create a situation in which Irish families, young Irish farmers, people who inherit land, find themselves financially embarrassed and tempted by reason of that to sell out their holdings.  I think this increase in death duties can have just that effect and I am opposed to the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that one has to view this section, if one is taking the line on it that Deputy O'Higgins was taking, in conjunction with section 38 which is increasing the abatements for <Col N="1176" /> widows and dependent children quite substantially and I think that viewing these two sections together, the picture that emerges is fairly clear, that is, we are increasing the liability for estate duty on estates&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, £20,000. What is the effect at £20,000 on a widow with two children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>An estate under £55,000 is not liable to any higher rate of duty under this proposal but there would be a greater abatement and the abatement is off the duty, which means that it is quite substantial.  It is not just an abatement on the total value of the estate, but when the duty is assessed, then there is an abatement of the duty.  I would suggest that, first of all, if one looks back, one finds that the existing rates have been operating since 1961.  Prior to that, our maximum rate was 53 per cent at £250,000. In the meantime, the higher rates of duty are applying in Britain and Northern Ireland, and indeed they run up as high as 80 per cent, and the case was frequently made that if we were to abolish estate duty or reduce the rates very substantially, this could be of considerable benefit to our economy.  I think that if one looks at what has happened since the duties were cut in 1961, where the maximum was reduced to 40 per cent, which is half the maximum rate in Britain, one finds that there was no great inflow, no noticeable effect at all, and there is something wrong with that theory which says that the abolition or substantial reduction of estate duty liability would result in the inflow of capital of considerable benefit to the economy.</P>
      <P>That being so, we are faced with the situation where estate duty is substantially the only form of capital gains tax we have and in circumstances in which we propose to reduce its impact on widows, and particularly widows with children, it seems reasonable to me that we should increase its impact above what I might call its artificially low level fixed in 1961 on an experimental basis, that we should increase its impact there on higher valued estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Deputy O'Higgins made a particular case in respect of agricultural holdings becoming liable to duty.  I would like to point out that provided the agricultural holdings are inherited and worked, and not sold, the liability for duty is substantially reduced in the case of agricultural holdings because of the artificial method of valuation, whereby the land is valued at 25 times its rateable valuation, less the capitalised value of any Land Commission annuity which may be outstanding on it and this results in a very substantially lower artificial valuation than its market value.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are other provisions in the death duty code in favour of agricultural land.  For instance, the duty may be paid by instalments at half-yearly intervals over a period of, I think, four years &mdash; I am speaking from recollection at the moment &mdash; so that I would like to make it clear that in so far as agricultural land is concerned, it is especially well treated under the death duty code and I do not think that any serious objection can be taken to the proposal in this section, having regard to the considerations I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised to hear the Minister telling the House that the system of valuation is 25 times the rateable valuation, less the outstanding annuity &mdash; I understood the Minister to say this &mdash; because I have had cases in County Dublin where certainly the valuation was not done on that basis, where the valuation was not made on that basis and where the case being made was that this was potential building land.  The case was made for high valuations that it was potential building land when there were no services within miles of it and, to my knowledge as a member of the country council, where there would be no services probably for 20 years.  It was still valued on the basis that it had a probable potential for building, so that the method of valuation the Minister has given the House is certainly not employed in all cases.  I would like to reinforce what Deputy O'Higgins has said because I have known of cases where it was imperative to sell out in order to meet it. <Col N="1178" /> I have had cases I was able to do something about by explanation of the facts and long arguments about the facts, but it is certainly not the system of valuation universally used in the country.</P>

      <P>That is all right in theory but it is a different matter for people to find this sort of cash with which to pay the Revenue Commissioners. Of course, they can owe the money for some years but they will now have to pay 9 per cent per annum on any outstanding money.  One might say that they could sell half the farm but a farm as a unit is one matter while half a farm is another matter. This duty is very severe.  Having regard to the way in which the price of land has skyrocketed in recent years, an ordinary sized farm would fetch £100,000 in cash.  I have suggested often that farmers should pay income tax but I do not think that a man owning a farm, the market value of which would be a £100,000, would be likely to make an income from that farm of £9,000 per annum.  That sort of money is not made from agriculture. In such a case an imposition of 45 per cent would amount to £45,000. How is such money to be found?  If, during the years, the man has gradually accumulated a certain amount of money he may be able to pay up by parting with all of the money saved but I have not the slightest doubt that, because of the inflated state of land value, this rate of duty will cause serious problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to supplement what Deputy O'Donovan has <Col N="1180" /> said.  If a person has reached a fairly advanced age at the time of death he may have made a settlement, but in any event it would be likely that his children would either have been provided for or would be in a position to look after themselves.  However, in the case of a man dying at an early age this would not be so and surely it is contrary to the recognised policy of the Government in relation to farms that, within limits, they should be reasonably large units.  Such a person's dependants would be placed in the position of having to sell part of the lands or else either having to sell stock which they could not replace or mortgage their holdings.  It does not require much knowledge to realise how difficult it is to raise money on land and particularly on a truncated portion of a farm.  Substantially, what has been said here by Deputies is true.  One can think, at random, of farms within easy reach of Dublin that will never be used for building purposes, whether these lands be in County Dublin or in Counties Kildare or Wicklow.  I wonder whether the Revenue Commissioners have considered the effects of this duty <i>vis-à-vis</i> the policy being pursued by the Department of Lands &mdash; to create units of relatively large acreage and not to divide or subdivide except where the acreage is substantial and unless there is a valid reason for so doing.</P>
      <P>Because of the rate of this duty and taking into account the considerable changes in the value of land, the amount of money involved here is considerable especially when one recalls that since the 1965 Finance Act people who take out an insurance policy in anticipation of death duties find that this is aggregated with the remainder of the estate for duty purposes. That has resulted in a substantial change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I would say is that Deputies should remember that of the number of holdings of agricultural land coming before the Revenue Commissioners, duty is paid on only 4 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure but clearly if we are dealing with only 4 per cent of the agricultural holdings coming before the Revenue Commissioners the case being made does not stand up in practice, because clearly in dealing with such a small percentage it may be taken that in the main duty is being paid on the more valuable holdings and they are a very small proportion of the number of agricultural holdings coming before the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point.  So far as we are concerned the main problem is the necessity to find the money where that money is not available unless some of the property is sold.  A case that I brought to the Minister's attention previously was that of two small farms, one of six acres and the other of 12 acres which, together with a small house, were willed by a lady to her married niece who had looked after her.  The death duties on that property amounted to £200 and in order to raise that money this couple were forced to sell the farm of six acres.  However, the Revenue Commissioners then reassessed the value of the remainder of the holding and collected almost the entire amount that was received for the six acre farm with the result that these people then found it necessary to sell part of the remaining farm for the purpose of paying death duties.  There should be some other way of dealing with cases where the money is not available.  At present even a reasonably sized farm is worth a lot of money although the money may not be worth very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talks only about very valuable holdings.  A holding is valuable only if it is on the market.  One could have a farm in County Dublin which, although being used for agricultural purposes and likely to be so used for the next 20 or 30 years or much longer, would have an artificial market value.  There is always the feeling that at some time in the future such land would be developed when in fact the people concerned have no wish to sell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is then, as Deputy Tully has said, that the problem arises because the people cannot get the money from the banks and they are forced to sell some of the land.  The Land Commission have no wish to subdivide because as it stands, it is barely an economic holding.  In many cases it is a question of selling all of the land because the Land Commission will not agree to subdivision and this can create an awkward situation.  I would say that a large proportion of the 4 per cent that the Minister mentioned is in areas such as County Dublin where the potential is taken into consideration&mdash;potential that probably will never be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take a hypothetical case and ask the Minister how this section would apply to it while, at the same time, making my own observations as to how I think it might apply.  Let us take a farm of 200 acres.  It would not have to be oustandingly good land or land very near big development to be worth up to £300 an acre.  That would make the farm worth £60,000 and would bring it within the area of valuations being made subject to the increases introduced under section 30.</P>
      <P>Suppose that farm is not owned by somebody who is prepared to go very deeply into debt but by a prudent farmer who never borrowed beyond what he expected to be able to repay and suppose, as is very common in rural Ireland, he has two sons both of whom, perhaps, are married and working together with him on the farm.  They may be doing a little contracting work on the side but they are primarily farmers.  He would normally and, I think, wisely decide, rather than leaving the land to his widow who would perhaps not be in a position to work it, leave it jointly or by some arrangement to these two sons.  They would not be eligible for the exemptions to which the Minister adverts, which apply only to widows who are not perhaps the best people to whom to hand over the management of a farm.  These sons would find themselves faced with a very heavy burden of death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reiterate what Deputy <Col N="1183" /> Clinton said.  Agricultural land is valued on the market at a much higher level than its actual earning capacity would warrant.  This is because of people buying agricultural land for speculative purposes or in order that they will have something absolutely solid in a world in which there is great uncertainty in relation to shares or other less solid items. Land value is inflated in this way beyond the return which it would be likely to give a farmer.  If that were the sole criterion the value would be much lower.  These two sons will not qualify for the exemptions and will have to pay 33 per cent of the value of that property in duty.  This is an absolutely crushing burden on a farm business of this nature.</P>
    <P>One thing which we are encouraging in Government policy at the moment is that people in a case like this should form themselves into a partnership in running a farm.  We do not want farms to be broken up into such small units that they are not able to produce efficiently.  We are anxious that they should be joined together into one unit which may be supporting two or three families but it is important that it should be one unit.  In the hypothetical case to which I have referred this unit, involving two brothers, perhaps married men, would at the outset be crippled by this burden of paying 33 per cent in duties. This would be a 200 acre holding which we would hope would support two men and their families.</P>
    <P>Nobody with any knowledge of farming would say that these people could avoid having to sell off part of the farm.  In doing so they would probably reduce the farm so that it would <Col N="1184" /> no longer support the two families. These would be people who had been working for a considerable portion of their lives at farming, who perhaps knew no other business sufficiently well and were too advanced in life to become qualified at any other business. One of these two families would be forced to find employment elsewhere, employment for which they would not be qualified.</P>
    <P>It is on cases like this that this section and the other sections in this Bill fall most heavily.  I cannot say at this stage that I could propose any specific amendment but the Minister should reconsider the application of this section and other sections to the case of sons, maybe married men, succeeding to their father's holding.</P>

      <P>In page 18, line 13, to substitute &ldquo;seven per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;nine per cent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section provides for a punitive and penal rate of interest in relation to arrears of death duties.  At the moment interest on duty owed is chargeable at 4 per cent and it is proposed to increase it to 9 per cent.  I appreciate that the Minister may make a case for some increase in the rate of interest but I consider the increase to 9 per cent is an unduly high increase. Amendment No. 22 proposes to reduce the figure to 7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state if it is proposed to alter the interest rates every year?  I assume the reason 9 per cent was picked was because it was near the current bank rate.  If the bank rate is reduced &mdash; I am sure the Government will decide to reduce it by 3 per cent as things are going so well&mdash;will it be necessary to introduce a special Bill to cover that arrangement?  I assume the reason why the amounts would not be paid, or why the interest would accrue, is one of three reasons: first, the people concerned were contesting the rights of <Col N="1187" /> the State to get the money; secondly, that they had not got the money themselves and had to take the necessary steps to get it and, thirdly, that they were trying to dodge out of it.  This appears to be a punitive measure because it will punish people who are not deliberately committing a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with the principle behind this in relation to other sections regarding income tax. The primary reason for this change is that the going rate for money which might otherwise be available for duty, or property which is invested and which would otherwise be used to pay duty, could well be yielding a rate of interest above 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, they could have invested the money in Government stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be doing badly if this is so.  There is a built-in inducement in that sense to people not to pay the duty because the longer they leave it unpaid the more they can make money out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the third proviso.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good reason for increasing the rate.  I would not contemplate an alteration in the rate from year to year.  In fact, the existing rate of 4 per cent was introduced in 1919 and over a long period the difference in the rate was not so substantial as to amount to an inducement not to pay the duty.  The difference between the going rate and 4 per cent now is so substantial that there is a definite inducement not to pay duty, or not to pay it promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw attention to the fact that in the case of real property, duty is not payable for one year after death. I am introducing in another section a provision that in the case of personal property duty will not be payable for four months after death.  Effectively, this reduces the rate of interest to 6 per cent if the interest is paid at the end of the first year on personalty because duty does not accrue during the <Col N="1188" /> free period of four months.  We have an obligation to ensure that people who are liable for duty pay the duty promptly.  Failure to increase the rate to 9 per cent would mean that there would be still an inducement not to pay, or not to pay promptly, and for that reason I must resist the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am correct in believing that it relates to instalments?  In section 41 we are setting the interest rates for arrears which arise as a result of fraud by the people succeeding.  In the scheme of interest rates here, there does not seem to be any discrimination in favour of those people who have come to an arrangement with the estate duty office whereby they will pay what is owed in instalments over a period of years.  They are being honest and open about the matter and are giving the estate office an assurance that the money will be paid but they will face the same rate of interest for their arrears as people who are in arrears because of fraud.  On moral as well as practical considerations there should be a discrimination in relation to the interest rates charged for people who are honestly trying to pay the amount due over a period of years and those who have got into arrears through fraud.  Would the Minister elucidate the reason for the absence of a discrimination in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, there is a discrimination between the two cases.  In so far as we are dealing here with duty which is in arrears, there is no discrimination&mdash;the same rate of interest is chargeable on all duty in arrears. However, in the case of a person who is honestly trying to pay off the duty, all he has to contend with is the payment of duty and interest.  In the case of someone who has been guilty of fraud, he has to contend with the payment of duty and interest and, in <Col N="1189" /> addition, the other penalties imposed by common law and statute for fraud. There is substantial discrimination between the two cases.</P>

He drags it out as long as he possibly can and eventually has to pay it and the interest.  The question of a prosecution would not arise.  The Minister should be well aware of those cases and so should the Revenue Commissioners, as distinct from the case of a person who feels that he should not have to pay it or people who find it difficult to raise the wind.</P>

      <P>We are dealing in the main with people who just cannot get the money to pay and who have to resist paying because they do not want to have to sell their means of making a living.  The Minister is adopting a sort of righteous attitude on behalf of the State.  I should like to remind him that the State does not always act in this righteous way.  If the Land Commission buy a farm they give the farmer land bonds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fair to say that this section is compounding the difficulty of persons in the cases to which I referred in discussing the last section, people who are trying their best to keep a farm business intact.  Up to now probably the only way they could do this, while paying off the death duties they owed as a result of the succession, was by reaching some <Col N="1190" /> agreement that they would pay the death duties over a period by means of instalments.  From their point of view this is a much more natural way of paying because it can be budgetted for.  It relates to income.  Income does not come in all at once.  It comes in over a period.  If you are paying by instalment you are paying relatively painlessly.</P>
      <P>Up to now the rate of interest on arrears paid by instalment was rather low and it was relatively easy for these people to keep their property intact while still paying off instalments of death duties.  We are now increasing the rate to 9 per cent and we are making it increasingly difficult for people to avail of this way of keeping their farms intact.  They now find that the burden is very heavy if they pay immediately and, if they try to keep the property intact by agreeing to pay the death duties by instalment, the burden is equally heavy because of the increase in the rate proposed in this section.</P>
      <P>This is a very sensible amendment indeed.  It recognises what the Minister has said, that up to now possibly the interest rate has been too low and people were able to avoid feeling the full burden of death duties, which those who paid immediately were feeling, by putting it on the long finger and paying by means of instalment.  If we settled on an interest rate of 7 per cent we could get over that problem because 7 per cent is very near the rate of inflation over a period.  If the rate were 7 per cent there would not really be any advantage in putting it on the long finger rather than paying immediately, if you can pay it immediately.  Therefore I would appeal to the Minister to adopt the sensible compromise proposal put forward in the amendment.  The Minister should not see this figure of 9 per cent as something cast-iron, something to which he must adhere or else lose face. This amendment meets the case made by the Minister without being an unduly harsh penalty.</P>

What I am saying is that the people we are talking about may have some difficulties in paying estate duties and meeting the interest rate, but they are far better off than most people and they can overcome their difficulties.  The practical problem with which we are faced is to create a rate of interest which will not act as an inducement to people not to pay death duties.  I do not think that can be achieved at a lower rate than 9 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;generally speaking it is more likely to be in the nature of a windfall or something which he did not expect.  He might have a profession or he might be working in some other business and get a legacy of some property which he did not expect to get.  The pattern in rural Ireland is that practically all farms are inherited by people who have worked half their lives on the farm and who know nothing else except farming, people who have invested their own sweat in farming and who have been working alongside their fathers.</P>
      <P>When they get possession of a farm they are not getting something which they did not expect.  They are not getting any marvellous gift.  Their standard of living does not rise in the least because they have inherited the farm.  All that happens is that there is a transfer of ownership.  They are not in any sense lucky people who have suddenly struck gold because their father died and they are now charged with the ownership of the farm.  Their standard of living and their earning potential are no better than they were and, on top of this, they have to face the very heavy burden of death duties.  The Minister has not properly answered the case made that many farmers who are running their farms properly and running an efficient enterprise may be forced to sell off portion of their farms to the extent that the farm ceases to be an economic unit.</P>

      <P>This is a classic example of Dáil Éireann being asked to legislate in blinkers.  The plain fact is that one could not get clearance from the Estate Duty Office for from six to 12 months.  It is not the fault of the people in the Estate Duty Office. It is not because they are not doing their work.  The fault is that there are not enough people employed in the Estate Duty Office and there is a vast accumulation of arrears.  I am informed by solicitor after solicitor that they are nearly driven daft trying to get affidavits cleared and trying to get estates cleared for duty.  To provide in those circumstances that, after four months delay from the date of death, interest at the rate of 9 per cent should be charged on the account of a person is, in my view, grossly unfair.  I suggest that the Minister should be realistic and allow at least 12 months from the date of death.  That may not be sufficient remembering the state of affairs in the office, but it would at least cater better for the existing situation. Four months is much too short; 12 months is, in my view, a realistic suggestion.</P>

      <P>What Deputy O'Higgins says is true.  There is a protracted delay in getting out grants of administration.  This, as he says, is not because of any failure on the part of the officials to do their work but because the office is completely overloaded. There are cases such as Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned.  It is estimated that no case will come out in 12 months, unless it is a very simple case, and in some cases there are delays of two years.  Surely it is unfair to enact this kind of legislation without at the same time taking adequate steps to deal with the congestion that exists in the Estate Duty Office.  While the section appears clear enough the Explanatory Memorandum would appear to indicate a different interpretation. I know that it is the section which will be effective and operative, but there is room for doubt.</P>

But there comes a time when they need to put their titles in order and that may mean grants four, five or six years late.

Why should we favour people who left it even longer <Col N="1198" /> still?  This four months is a new concession which arises from the date of the passing of the Bill.  If we start making this concession retrospective, which is, in effect, what Deputy Clinton is suggesting, we will not be treating people equally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister objects to making the section retrospective and, in effect, he is saying that would not be right.  Let us look at this broadly.  All right the Minister is giving a concession.  On the one hand he is imposing penal taxation but with the other hand he is doing it retrospectively. He is doing it in relation to estates that are left by people who died before the passing of the Bill.  People who died three, four, five or six years ago and whose next-of-kin, whoever that may be, were presumed to know the law were well aware of the fact that at any stage in which they decided to take out letters of administration to the estate their liability would be limited to 4 per cent.  The Minister now, in effect, says: &ldquo;No, from this sum you are going to be liable to arrears at 9 per cent.&rdquo;  That is going to affect them at a time when, under the law, they could be only charged 4 per cent.  That is retrospective legislation and we have always condemned it in this House.  Indeed, in an earlier section in relation to income tax the Minister made a point of emphasising that the change in the income tax law would only apply after his Budget Statement.  Why should we tax people by doubling the rate of interest in respect of a period when under the law they were entitled to expect arrears only at 4 per cent?  If the Minister wants this change in the law he should do it fairly and honestly by providing that this section shall only operate in relation to deaths occurring after the passing of the Bill.  If he does it in that way, the concession of four months will disappear.  I am perfectly prepared to say, advocating the point of view which I am advocating, that I cannot have it both ways.  The four months free will disappear but at least people, who up till now have, perhaps, been dilatory because they knew the law and knew that it could only cost them 4 per cent, will only <Col N="1199" /> have to pay what the law said they ought to pay.  If the Minister wishes to proceed to charge 9 per cent and give a four months period of grace let him do it after the passing of this Bill.  It seems to me the clean and straight way of doing it otherwise the Minister is trying to suggest that he is doing something wonderful for the poor people who take out a grant after five or six years by telling them that had they taken it out in time they would have got four months grace but since the four months have gone they will have to pay at 9 per cent for four or five years back.</P>

      <P>The injustice is further compounded by the fact that very often in some of these old debts the rate of the incidence of duty commenced at £500 and it was possible consequently to have duty on an estate of £1,000 for ten or 12 years back attracting interest at 9 per cent over all that time.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is mistaken when he refers to this as retrospective in so far as it relates to arrears cases because what we are proposing to do is to apply this only to current arrears.  In those cases from the passing of the Bill there will be a four month period during which people could pay the duty and still pay interest at only 4 per cent.</P>

      <P>I want to suggest that the description of this as being retrospective would be true only if we were providing that we could go back <Col N="1200" /> and reopen old cases and charge the new rate of duty on duty already paid but that is not what we are providing at all.  We are providing that for a rate of interest on duty which is in arrears and unless we make the duty on those arrears the same as the duty that we propose to charge on new cases we are doing an injustice to new cases and favouring especially those cases which are in arrears, but we are giving a period of four months from the passing of the Bill during which the money may be paid and if it is paid on the last day they will still only be charged at 4 per cent.  It seems to me that this is the only fair and equitable way one can deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the point raised earlier by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Cosgrave about delays in the office.  I would point out that, in fact, where the cases are delayed in the office interest ceases to run.  I have here the terms of the directive or rule on which interest is charged at the moment and this would continue to operate.  It has operated since 1919 and is, I am informed, strictly adhered to in practice.  Perhaps I may read it out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The period from which interest is to be calculated is to commence from the day after the death or the day after the termination of the day on which the duty becomes payable. The period is to end on the day on which the account or affidavit is delivered and the day on which the account or affidavit is delivered is to be the day on which it reaches this office.  This rule applies even though <Col N="1201" /> the account may require to be returned for further information or for amendment so long as the alterations in it do not involve payment of a substantial amount of duty above what was involved in the first instance and there is no unreasonable delay in completing the account and returning it.</P>
    <P>The rule also applies in similar circumstances to an account which is in the hands of the Valuation Office.  In no case must interest be charged for a period during which the account is working in the office or is in the hands of the Valuation Office even where there has been a substantial increase in duty or unreasonable delay on the part of the parties.</P>
    <P>So that, if there is delay&mdash;and I do not want to involve myself in an argument on that&mdash;of the kind referred to by Deputies, it will not operate to the detriment of the person in the sense of interest accruing while the delay is going on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says being a rule of thumb or a rule of practice or a concession but, the Minister will understand, it is not the law of the land and we have to be concerned here that&mdash;it may be the improbable set of circumstances; it may be the extreme set of circumstances&mdash; there is in no part of our finance legislation any provision which would justify or give any basis to the convention and the rule of practice which the Minister has read out.  Under this law incorporated in what we are proposing here, until the discharge of the duty, interest may be charged if it is outside the four-month period back to the date of death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is right that we should be invited to pass what may be draconian legislation on the assurance that it is really not going to be enforced.  That, in fact, is one of the troubles in much of our finance legislation that too much discretion and too much power are, in fact, being given to bureaucracy and to those who cannot be made amenable here.  It is for that reason extremely important that every single sentence and word necessary to protect the citizen should be <Col N="1202" /> written down in our legislation and I must say I react against this suggestion that it is all right, that we should pass this section; if there is any difficulty the office will see that things will be done all right.  That just does not make sense, in my respectful submission, in a legislative assembly.</P>
    <P>The Minister in what he read out said that part of this ruling is that even if the affidavit has to be sent back for verification and amendment this will not incur an increase in duty unless there is a substantial increase in the amount of duty payable as a result. Who decides what is substantial? Again, apparently, the decision is to be left to the discretion of somebody, somewhere, in some office.  What may be substantial in one case may be regarded as not substantial in another. But we should not leave the whole question of what is now a penal rate of interest to be decided purely at the discretion of nameless officials, people who are carrying out their duty in this important Department of State who are not amenable or responsible to this House.</P>
    <P>I am going to make this suggestion deliberately and I suggest that the Minister consider this between now and Report Stage&mdash;if we want to deal effectively with the problem created by the delay in the Estate Duty Office, let us put that into legislation, that interest on arrears shall cease to operate on the date that the affidavit and account are presented to the appropriate Estate Duty Office.  Let us put that in our legislation.  Do not let us have a situation in which it must depend on the whim or fancy of the people who are dealing with the account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This section proposes to increase the rate of duty payable on estate duty from 4 per cent to 9 per cent.  That will apply in all cases where the death occurs after the passing of this Bill but it will not come into operation for four months after the death.  That is clear enough.  But in the case where death has occurred before the passing of the Bill then, provided that the duty is paid within four months after the passing of the Act, it will be payable <Col N="1203" /> at the old rate of 4 per cent.  I think that is clear.</P>
      <P>I say that this amendment which we are dealing with now and which proposes to extend that period of four months to 12 months is a very reasonable amendment because a number of things have to happen: this Bill has to be passed and when it is passed the people of the country have to get to know about it.  We are going to pass it now, presumably, in the dying days of July, in a holiday period, when solicitors' offices are working understaffed, when people will be going on holidays and maybe when instructions come in in the absence of a principal in small offices nothing will be done until the principal comes back.  Then there will be a rush of work for a month or two after he comes back and it will be utterly impossible to get instructions, to get the necessary information, to file an affidavit and to have all that done within four months, especially when you allow the people time to realise what is involved and to realise how they will be affected.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I say that in those circumstances and in order to give the people time to get to know about this and, indeed, in order to give professional people time to let it sink in and to get to know about it and to allow them to advise their clients, 12 months is very reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of what the Minister said&mdash;that due to some rule that is prevailing in the office, where there are delays in the office time stops running for the purpose of duty&mdash;that may be so but when time starts to run again and when it is outside the four months you may not pay duty for the six months delay in the office but when you do start paying duty you will pay it at 9 per cent.  That is the important thing under this Bill as it stands, because, although there may be a rule in the office at the present time suspending duty while the Estate Duty Office are getting around to deal with the backlog of work that is there, I put it to the Minister that if this Bill passes as it is now, he and his officials will be bound by statute to charge duty at the rate of 9 per cent after the expiration <Col N="1204" /> of four months.  They may be able to say: &ldquo;You will pay no duty at all for the time we could not get around to dealing with this&rdquo; but when duty does come into operation, it will come into operation retrospectively, back to the date of death, if more than four months have elapsed from the passing of this Act.  I am convinced that that is the case.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am dealing with the pre-Act situation&mdash;with the situation in which the death happened before the passing of the Act.  If a man died three years ago&mdash;and this could be the hard luck case&mdash;if he left money in the bank or left investments, a grant will be taken out, but if he was in poor circumstances, or at least if all his assets consisted of a farm of land which attracted duty, a grant may not be taken out because there is no necessity to do so. In that case, of a man dying two years before the passing of the Act&mdash;supposing a schedule is lodged in the Estate Duty Office within three months of the passing of the Act and the Estate Duty Office people cannot get round to dealing with it for another six months, that is nine months&mdash;it is three months out of date.  The Estate Duty Office will very kindly charge no duty at all from the date on which the schedule was lodged there until the date they assess it several months after. That period will be free of duty, I agree with what the Minister says, in pursuance <Col N="1205" /> of this rule, but when duty does become payable, it will become payable at 9 per cent under this Act, notwithstanding that the delay in the office was not the fault of the applicant.

      <P>There is another aspect.  As I understand, the Minister's regulation, or internal regulation as a matter of procedure, if it is of universal application, it to some extent lessens the criticism that applies here, but there is another aspect of this that has been brought to my notice.  It is that in Britain the revenue authorities publish at regular intervals&mdash;I do not know whether it is annually but it is certainly at regular intervals&mdash;a code of practice or set of precedence that applies similar to the rule, and of course dealing with many other matters governing the application of revenue legislation.  Here, I understand, there is no similar publication or a set of precedents and while a number of precedents of one kind or another are operated and known by practitioners, accountants and others, to exist and are regularly applied in a variety of cases, there is no set issue of either precedents or regulations which any particular applicant or his adviser, or advisers, as the case may be, can apply for and have available to him.  I think that is an aspect of the matter that might be considered.  As it is at the moment, there are only the statutes and the index to the statutes, and whatever authorities are dealing with it have to search the Acts and the decided cases and in a great many cases refer to English precedents, but in the British revenue an arrangement operates whereby a set of precedents or a code of rules or practices which apply is published at regular intervals.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say early in the discussion of this subsection that the interest-free period in relation to real property was 12 months.  The explanatory memorandum sets out that it also provides an interest-free period of four months from the date of death for estate duty on personal property, and it appears therefore, reading the explanatory memorandum, that this period of four months should apply only to personal property.  There is no reference in subsection (2) (a) of this section to personal property specifically as distinct from real property, nor is there any reference in apparent distinction in the Principal Act.  The Principal Act is the Finance Act of 1896, section 18 (1) of which sets out that simple interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum without deduction of income tax shall be payable on all estate duty from the date of death of deceased or where the duty is payable by instalments or becomes due at any date later than six months after the death from the date on which the first instalment of duty becomes due.  There is no reference there to personal as distinct from real property.  Could the Minister explain how the distinction apparently adverted to in the explanatory memorandum arises?</P>

      <P>Section 6 (8) of the 1894 Act deals with the point he has been making.  In the meantime, while he is having a look at it, perhaps I might deal with some of the other points mentioned.  In regard to the point raised by Deputy Cosgrave, I understand that what is published in Britain is what is known as &ldquo;Extra-Statutory Concessions&rdquo; as distinct from the kind of thing I have mentioned, which is not a concession and not so regarded, but is merely doing justice to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a point about that.  He felt that if this was to be done, it should be incorporated in the law.  I will have a look at that, but <Col N="1207" /> I must say that if it is to be done, it will not be just a simple statement to the effect that interest ceases to be payable on lodgment of an affidavit or a schedule of assets.  I think some of the Deputies opposite who are practising law will appreciate why it cannot be that simple.  I would, however, point out that if one wants to stand on the law, or the proposed law as set out in this Bill, the answer to the problems raised is simply to pay to the Revenue Commissioners, on or before the expiration of four months, in the case of personal property, a sum of money which one estimates to be the amount of the liability for duty.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at 3 per cent.  Section 10, subsection (3) of the 1894 Act provides that if a court finds on appeal that too much duty has been paid, it can order interest at 3 per cent to be paid on the amount refundable.  In both of these cases 9 per cent is being substituted for 3 per cent in subsection (3), so that we are trying to do justice in this regard although some of the Deputies opposite seem to think otherwise.  I would say also that the context in which I have referred to this rule that is operated by the Revenue Commissioners was because it was said that delays in the Estate Duty Office would operate to the detriment of the taxpayer and that with the interest rate <Col N="1208" /> being increased the person concerned would not be able to control the imposition. However, I think Deputies should be satisfied that either on the basis of the rule that has operated since 1919 or on the basis strictly within the terms of the Bill as I have outlined, a person who is involved in the payment of death duties can, in fact, avoid interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I comment on the Minister's suggestion that the person accounting can pay the duty in advance?  That is not realistic.  The Minister is equating this with the procedure in the early part of the section when we were dealing with a different type of tax, namely, income tax.  This suggestion is not realistic because the funds with which to pay in advance would have to be borrowed by reason of the fact that the funds in the estate are locked up pending probate and, consequently, the person accountable would have to get bridging finance at the current rate of commercial interest. Therefore, it is no offer to say that the duty can be paid in advance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Revenue Commissioners repaying, I would direct the Minister's attention to section 8, subsection (12) of the 1894 Act which says that if too much has been paid, the excess will only carry interest if too much has been paid as a result of an over-valuation by the commissioners but that if the person accounting decides, for some mad reason, to arrange bridging finance and pays too much, he will not get any interest on the excess when it is being repaid to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it would be unfair to have the date of death as the critical date in relation to these changes in interest in the sense that the estates of persons dying before the passing of this measure would be in a more advantageous category than the estates of those dying subsequently in a situation in which the executor would deliberately slow up the proceedings and that in a situation in which, in the case of the earlier death, interest on the duty would be at only 4 per cent while estates which are attended to expeditiously, and in that way benefit <Col N="1209" /> the Exchequer, may have to pay 9 per cent if the administration continues for longer than four months, as it will invariably.  I would suggest to the Minister that it is unrealistic to say that people delay deliberately for the purpose of making money on an estate.  As I have said already the estate is not available to the executor to invest at rates that are commercially advantageous.  At the time of the death of the owner it may be the case that the money is invested in something that is valuable commercially but I would point out to the Minister that if it is producing an income, that income is liable to income tax and if the rate of income tax is added to the old rate of 4 per cent it is not profitable for an executor to delay the administration of the estate.  Therefore, the Minister's argument does not hold.  I could see reason for it when he advanced it in relation to delay in the payment of income tax where a person was abusing the appellant procedure but it does not follow in regard to the death duty section.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to the question of hardship to which I referred already, what should be the critical date is relevant in the case of deaths which occurred quite a considerable time ago, prior to 1961, when the threshold for duty was only £500.  I think I am correct in saying that if a person died in 1950 and had an estate worth £2,000 such estate would attract duty because it was within the duty level existing at the date of death.  If the duty is not paid within a period of four months after the passing of this Act, duty on that small estate for the previous ten or 12 years will have interest payable on it at 9 per cent. Surely, this is a hardship and the Minister cannot say in such a case that there was a sophisticated fiddle to try and use the estate to make money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy considers the commas, it may be clearer. Leave out the qualifying clause for the moment.  It shall continue to be paid at the rate of 4 per cent and then the qualifying clause,</P>
      <P>for a period of four months after such passing</P>
      <P>is qualifying or extending &ldquo;continue&rdquo;. However, I shall have a look at the wording to see whether it can be made clearer but, at any rate, that is what is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if that is the intention and the liability for the 9 per cent arises only at the expiration of four months, nevertheless, in the particular hypothetical case I am dealing with, the application for an assessment and grant of representation might not be made for a period of two or three years subsequent to the passing of this Act.  Consequently, there would be 4 per cent interest on this small estate up to a date four months after the passing of the Act and from that date to whatever date on which the assessment is made, it would be 9 per cent. This would be a grave hardship.  It has <Col N="1211" /> an element of retrospective punishment about it because small estates have been taken out of the net altogether; and, fortuitously, if the person died at the right date, so to speak, there would not be any duty or interest to be paid, whereas if he died at the wrong date the estate could be liable to a heavy rate of interest.  The estate that would be so liable would be one which it was not intended to catch and one that would be least able to bear it.  All these arguments strengthen the case for having the critical date as the date of death.  The amount of fiddling that can be done is, I think, minimal and certainly does not justify the hardship that will be caused.  I am speaking from experience and any Deputy who practices in rural Ireland will know that many years can elapse before people come in to seek grants of representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Cosgrave's point, my experience of Revenue is that the Department is much more faceless here than it is in England.  That may not be the fault of the personnel of this Department but those of us who are in public life come across cases of representatives who could not be deemed by any stretch of the imagination to be familiar even with common law never mind the Revenue laws.  Such a person finds it very hard to get the necessary information regarding concessions of one kind or another.  I am not saving that the commissioners or the personnel of this Department want to hide anything but I do say deliberately that I think it is a faceless Department and that the administration is not facing up to the facts of life in the same way as the comparable Department in Britain is.  I agree that the laws under the various Finance Acts are very difficult but they are made much more difficult by the fact that people find it so very hard to get information even regarding concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not too clear, in dealing with section 31, as to what the Minister deems to be personal as opposed to real estate.  I may be wrong but I would take it that what he means by <Col N="1212" /> personal estate is the amount of liquid cash a person has either in a bank or in some liquid form.  I would take it also that the real property would consist of stocks, shares, chattels, lands or buildings.  I should like to be clear as to what is personal as opposed to real property.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would again remind the House that this is a new concession.  Heretofore and to this very day there has been no concession at all in relation to personal property.  Duty is payable and interest arises on duty from the first day duty becomes payable and there is no concession.  When we are giving a concession of four months while a case can be made as was made by Deputy Fitzpatrick for extending it there are quite a number of reasons, including Revenue ones, that is, from the point of view of receipt of money by Revenue, why I cannot agree to this being extended.  I would remind the House that it is a new concession.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Deputy Carter as to what is personalty and what is realty I cannot here purport to give a definitive or an exhaustive definition of it but I think, roughly speaking, I could say that anything that is not real property is personal property and that real property substantially consists of land or house property held in fee simple.  This is not exhaustive but very substantially I think that is the difference.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Would the Minister like to say something to clarify the point raised very clearly by Deputy Cooney and which I was making, too, that is, that it is open under the Bill, as now drafted, to argue that if death occurs before the Act and that duty is not paid or a schedule not lodged until six months after the passing of the Act that then duty will be payable at 9 per cent from the date of death.  That is open to <Col N="1213" /> argument I think on the section as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to the point I was making earlier but before I do so I think we should accept that this is a new concession and that up to now there was no interest free period in respect of personal property. However, given that we are giving a concession, surely we should apply the same standard in relation to personal property as we are applying in relation to real property.  In other words, if you are to give an interest free period surely the logical and sensible thing would be to give the same interest free period, namely 12 months, in relation to personal property as is given in relation to real property?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister in dealing earlier with his grounds for stating that real property was affected by this 12 month interest free period referred me to subsection (8) of section 6 of the Finance Act, 1894.  I do not claim to be very good at reading the small print of any Act particularly where there is so much going on around me but as far as I can see that subsection refers solely to the case where the estate duty on that real property is being repaid by means of instalments and that in that case the first instalment would not be due to be paid until 12 months after the death and interest would not start to be payable until the first instalment had been paid.  Therefore, it can be claimed that there is a 12 month interest free period in relation to real property in this situation. How do we arrive at the situation that there is a 12 month interest free period in respect of real property the estate duty for which is not being paid by means of instalment?  Suppose it is proposed to pay the estate duty on <Col N="1214" /> real property by means of a lump sum, say, 15 months after the death.  What is the statutory authority for stating that in that case those arrears will be interest free for the first 12 months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put another issue to the Minister.  Often-times as far as our Estate Duty Office is concerned the reason for the delay in lodging an affidavit is that there is British, Scottish and Irish estate and sometimes processing of that through the British Estate Duty Office may take some time as the Minister is no doubt aware.  The procedure is to lodge the affidavit, first of all, in London, to have the duty assessed there and then to lodge the affidavit in Dublin.  Will a concession be available to a person who suffers delay at the hands of the British Estate Duty Office or could he find himself paying an interest rate of 9 per cent here in respect of delay which is beyond his control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The processing of the schedule for the British or Scottish Estate Duty Office might take considerable time and hold up the lodging of the affidavit in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister see that such would be a delay beyond the control of an Irish executor and, nevertheless, could be a very real one? Surely it would be a simple matter to obtain verification of the date of lodgment of the estate duty affidavit in Britain.  If allowance is given here under our international agreement to estate duty paid in Britain so as to avoid double taxation, surely this concession should extend to estate duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case where the delay in the British office is, say, three months or something like that he is not prejudiced here because he is allowed the duty assessed as payable in the British Office as a deduction here and it will not affect his liability here but suppose there is a long delay in the <Col N="1215" /> British Office which runs out the period, the only answer I can suggest is that he should lodge his affidavit here first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that is not the usual practice.  The practice is to get the affidavit passed in Britain so that you do not have a situation where you have conflicts between the return of an estate here or in Britain or in any other part of the world.  It is much tidier to get any of the foreign assets assessed and duty paid on them before presentation of the affidavit here.  The Minister now suggests that lodgments should be made and duty paid in Ireland.  How then is the avoidance of double taxation to be implemented, an avoidance which the State here by international treaty is recognising as being legitimate and just?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, if it emerges that an overpayment of duty has been made because of an over-valuation or assessment by the commissioners there is provision for repayment with interest at 9 per cent. I do not know if that is any consolation to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 24 relates to the position in regard to timber and estate duty which becomes due as the timber is sold off.  I do not know anything about the timber business but I wonder if the peculiarities of this business are such that this interest rate on arrears which arises in relation to profits from timber may be harsh or easy.  I think when we have segregated the timber business in regard to this matter we should bear in mind, in deciding what the appropriate interest rate is, whether or not the timber business is such that this money can be easily recouped for the payment of duty immediately on the timber being sold.  I do not know: there may be no reason for any distinction there.</P>

    <Col N="1217" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is rather complicated. Under section 8 (3) of the 1894 Act the liability of an executor for estate duty on the personal property of which the deceased was competent to dispose is restricted to the amount of assets he has received as executor.  The property which comes into the hands of the executor as executor does not comprise as wide a range of property as that which actually vests in him on the death of the deceased.  For example free foreign personalty or Irish realty, including freehold registered lands of which he is competent to dispose, do not vest in the executor <i>qua</i> executor. If, therefore, a person domiciled here makes a revocable settlement of personal property and appoints a foreign trustee, there is no way of recovering the duty on such property except by an action against the Irish executor. If the Irish personalty which comes into the hands of the executor is trifling in value, the duty on the settled property is, in effect, lost even though the deceased might have died possessed of considerable Irish land and foreign personal estate.</P>
      <P>We have come across some cases of this kind.  Section 8 (4) of the Finance Act, 1894, which makes trustees, beneficiaries and any other persons in whom the property is at any time vested, accountable for estate duty, applies only where the executor is not accountable.  This means that where the executor is accountable no other person is accountable.  As I have indicated cases can arise in which although the executor is accountable the amount of property coming into his hands as executor is not sufficient by any means to pay the duty.  The deletion from section 8 (4) of the Finance Act, 1894, of the words &ldquo;and his executor is not accountable for the Estate Duty in respect of such property&rdquo; will have the effect that in addition to the executor, the trustees, beneficiaries and surviving joint tenants <i>et cetera</i> will all be accountable for estate duty in respect of property of which the deceased was competent to dispose.</P>

The words being removed are negative words, in that the executor is not accountable.

I am rather afraid that on some of the information we have about some cases of this kind, although six years may seem a long time, to make it much shorter might still make it worth people's while to indulge in this manoeuvre in order to avoid the duty. In the case raised by the Deputy, the genuine case, I do not think any hardship arises because in such cases people will pay the correct rate of duty.  They are not trying to avoid it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 37, after the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than an interest for life&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter may appear somewhat technical but it is of significance and concern to a number of people.  Section 34 seeks to amend section 28 of the Finance Act, 1961.  Section 28 of that Act was a relief measure which was brought in at that time to neutralise the effect of a decision given by the courts in the <i>Revenue Commissioners and Donoghue</i>, where a farm had been given by the deceased to his son more than three years prior to his death and it was held to be dutiable under section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, by reason of a covenant in the deed of gift securing the deceased's <Col N="1225" /> right to continue to reside on the farm during the remainder of his lifetime. It was because of the retention of that right to reside on the farm during his lifetime that it was held in Donoghue's case that, although the three years had passed, the entire farm was dutiable and passed on the donor's death. Accordingly, in 1961 section 28 was passed which provided in subsection (1):</P>
    <P>Property taken under a gift, whether by way of settlement or otherwise, made by any person dying after the passing of this Act shall not be included in the property deemed to pass on his death under the provisions of paragraph (c) or paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, by reason only of the fact that an interest in the property for life or any other period determinable by reference to death was reserved to the donor or that <i>bona fide</i> possession and enjoyment of the property had not been assumed by the donee immediately on the gift and thence-forward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The section goes on to provide, in effect, that all that shall be deemed to pass at a death is the slice, or the valuation of the interest reserved.  That was introduced in 1961.  It was introduced to ensure that when a father, settling his farm on his son, reserving the right of residence and continuing to live there for a number of years after his retirement from farming, died all that would be dutiable would be the value of his life interest.  It is proposed now that section 28 be amended. This, of course, is a tax avoidance section because section 28 of the 1961 Act was used for various purposes; I will not say anything about that.  It is probably felt that some amendment of section 28 is desirable and opportune, but it is the wording of this amendment that troubles me:</P>
    <P>Provided that this subsection shall not apply in any case where at the time of the making of the gift there was reserved to the donor or at any time thereafter there was granted or demised to him an interest in the <Col N="1226" /> property for a period other than a period determinable by reference to death ...</P>
    <P>That is perfectly all right.  That means that in that particular case subsection (1) will apply only if what is reserved or given to the donor is a life interest or an interest determinable on his death.  In other words, any other interest which the donor reserves or which is granted to him would not come within section 28 (1) but a life interest or an interest determinable on death would.  I have no objection to that.  But the proviso goes on to say:</P>
    <P>... or he became entitled to or acquired any interest in or benefit from the property or any right or privilege over or in relation to the property, and he had not divested himself of any such interest, benefit, right or privilege more than five years before his death.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Up to the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; it appears perfectly clear that all interest reserved and created determinable on death would continue to be within the protection given by section 21 (8) of the 1961 Act.  It seems to me that what is proposed after the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; entirely destroys section 28.  The Revenue Commissioners could under this proposal now take the very facts of the <i>Revenue Commissioners and Donoghue,</i> the very case which gave rise to the enactment of section 28 and they could deal with that in this way: the donor in Donoghue's case became entitled to or acquired an interest in the land, to wit a life interest, and he has not divested himself of that interest more than five years before the death; what appears after &ldquo;or&rdquo; appears so wide as to cover a life interest or an interest determinable on death.  If we pass this proviso in this sense, then the words after &ldquo;or&rdquo; could be used to make dutiable any interest reserved by a donor or acquired by him, even if it were a life interest, if he had not divested himself of that more than five years before his death.  If this is construed in that way it entirely destroys section 21 (8). These remarks apply also to section 28 (3).  It destroys the effect of both of these subsections.  I do not believe <Col N="1227" /> that could have been intended and, if it was intended, it is an extraordinary way of legislating.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to come in here and propose the repeal of section 28 of the 1961 Act and recreate the position that was created by the decision in Donoghue's case.  It is for that reason that I propose this amendment: after &ldquo;or&rdquo; to provide &ldquo;he became entitled to or acquired any interest in or benefit from the property or any right or privilege over or in relation to the property other than an interest for life&rdquo;.  I mean other than an interest determinable on death.  If that were accepted it would seem to me that the following words &ldquo;and he had not divested himself of any such interest&rdquo; could be deleted.  Obviously, what is intended here is &ldquo;or he became entitled to or acquired any interest in or benefit from the property or any right or privilege over or in relation to the property other than a life interest&rdquo;.  That is what is intended and if we put in words conveying that sense, then this proviso makes sense.  It preserves the retention of a life interest but makes everything else outside section 28.  I propose to insert similar words in the second proviso which has reference to section 28 (3) of the 1961 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to nullify completely the effect of section 28 of the 1961 Act.  Consequently I accept the principle in these amendments. I have however some difficulty about the wording because the expression used in the amendments is &ldquo;other than an interest for life&rdquo;.  The expression &ldquo;determinable by reference to death&rdquo; is already defined in estate duty law but &ldquo;an interest for life&rdquo; is nowhere defined and would therefore be given its ordinary meaning.  It is necessary that the wider meaning in the expression, &ldquo;determinable by reference to death&rdquo;, should be imported to cover interests in property which terminate at a point of time either before or after death and for that reason, if the Deputy would agree to withdraw his amendment, I would propose to bring in on the next Stage an amendment to the <Col N="1228" /> same effect but using the phrase, &ldquo;determinable by reference to death&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On the point which the Minister has agreed to consider, the Minister appreciates that a good deal of this part of the legislation is similar to, and indeed probably to a great extent copied from, a British precedent in this regard.  In Britain there are a series of definitions incorporated in the Act which clarify this and make it possible to interpret and understand the terms used.  When the Minister is reconsidering the drafting of this question he might consider including definitions in it.  This would probably avoid some of the problems which have arisen in this context.</P>

      <P>I should like some general information in relation to the type of abuse of section 28 of the 1961 Act which this section is intended to curb.  Deputy O'Higgins made a useful distinction in dividing this proposed amendment into two sections.  I should like to know the significance of the fact that an interest in the property is referred to in both subclauses so to speak.  In the second clause reference is made to &ldquo;an interest in or benefit <Col N="1229" /> from the property or any right or privilege over or in relation to the property&rdquo;.  That appears to cover everything.  What is the reason and need for having in the first part of the first clause a reference also to an interest in the property?  It would appear to be superfluous to have two clauses covering an interest twice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 20, subsection (1) (f), line 56, after &ldquo;pass&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or are deemed to pass&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to remedy a drafting defect in section 35. This section is designed to strengthen the provisions of section 20 of the Finance Act, 1965 which was enacted to prevent the widespread avoidance of estate duty through the medium of hybrid family companies.  Section 35 of the Bill introduces new definitions of company control by the deceased relative and control.  Certain consequential amendments of Section 20 of the 1965 Act become necessary because of the <Col N="1231" /> new definitions.  Paragraph (f) of subsection (1) of section 35 of this Bill substitutes a new subsection (6) for the existing subsection (6) of section 20. The original subsection (6) dealt with the valuation of shares in a trading company passing or deemed to pass on a death.  The new subsection (6) deals with valuation of shares in a trading company which pass on a death but does not specifically refer to shares which are deemed to pass.  The proposed amendment will rectify this omission.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 35, after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(a)&rdquo; and between lines 43 and 44 to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and</P>
      <P>(b) such a payment or transfer of property out of the resources of the company shall not be deemed a benefit save to the extent to which the payment or value of property transferred does not exceed the amount of income accumulated in the company&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister thinks of the suggestion in this amendment. The purpose is to ensure in an at arm's length loan if there is, in fact, a repayment of the loan out of the sale of the company's assets or something of that kind, a genuine sale of assets, there will not be a double taxation or anything of that kind.  I do not know if the Minister considers that something along these lines should be brought in. It arises from the proviso at the end of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should say is that this proviso is intended to protect transactions which are, in fact, at arm's length.  I do not know if the Deputy thinks that, in fact, it does not protect them but there is an objection to the principle of limiting the subsection to benefits paid out of the income of the company only or out of the accumulation of such income because <Col N="1232" /> benefits can, in fact, be paid out of capital.  If, for example, an investment company&mdash;and the majority of avoidance schemes operate through the medium of unlimited holding companies&mdash;were to sell an investment and realise a gain, such gain could be used to redeem debenture vested in the deceased.  If such gains were put to reserves with accumulated income it would be virtually impossible at any given time to apportion such reserves between accumulated income and realisation of capital.</P>
      <P>Another thing that could be done would be that the assets of the holding company could include shares in another private company.  If this second company were to issue bonus shares or otherwise reorganise its capital or to liquidate so that the holding company acquired a capital gain, such gain could be used to provide capital to pay off the alleged loan to the deceased.  But, as I said, the existing proviso is designed to ensure that repayments on foot of all <i>bona fide</i> commercial transactions at arm's length with the company are outside the scope of this subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This, as the Minister is aware, is a complex section.  One criticism of the section of the Finance Act of 1965 as it was amended last year by the 1970 Act and as it is proposed to amend it now, is its lack of precision.  I raised this point earlier. As I understand the application of section 2 (1) (b) of the Finance Act, 1894 and section 7 (7) of the Finance Act 1894 to a company, particular care must be taken to define the terms employed sufficiently precisely to enable the accountable party to compute accurately the estate duty payable. The idea behind the original redrafting of section 20 (4) of the Finance Act, 1965 was to simplify the complex terms of the corresponding British statutes.  Experience, however, has shown that the lack of definition has produced uncertainty and it is suggested that the addition of a paragraph <Col N="1233" /> or sub-paragraph defining the terms employed in section 20 of the Finance Act, 1965 would not add greatly to its length but if a definition were included it would enable the terms of the section to be understood and it would be better to introduce a new section or subsection rather than to amend it piecemeal.</P>
      <P>I mention that at this stage because it may be necessary to introduce an amendment on Report but the Minister might like to consider this himself and see whether it is possible to introduce an amendment that would define it more precisely and that would meet the criticism I made a few moments ago on the other section, that part of the problem in this portion of the legislation is that it has been copied to a great extent from similar British statutes but in the British statutes certain terms are defined and there is a set of definitions which enable them to be understood on the basis of those definitions.  In the case of the legislation here no similar definitions have been included and it is difficult to be precise and, indeed, the mere fact that it has been amended twice within the space of five or six years&mdash;it was changed in 1965, amended last year and is now being amended again&mdash;is clear evidence that the whole matter requires to be looked at again and, if necessary, a new clause introduced and, possibly, definitions included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Cosgrave has said is perfectly true.  I am looking at page 20, section 35 (1) &mdash;the new definition of when a person shall be deemed to have control of a company.  If my checking is right, subsection (1) comes from the UK Finance Act, 1940.  It is section 55 (3) of that Act.  Sub-clause (aa) (ii) comes from the UK Finance Act, 1954&mdash; section 31, and (aa) (iii) comes from the UK Finance Act, 1954&mdash;section 29 (3).  These are three subsections which have been taken from recent British legislation, which are brought in as amendments of the original section 20, but they do not contain the strict definitions which the UK Acts do contain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no definition of what &ldquo;power&rdquo; is and that is defined very <Col N="1234" /> clearly in English legislation.  These subsections use &ldquo;power&rdquo; and &ldquo;power exercisable by the person at his direction&rdquo;. Does that mean a power related to shares&mdash;the power of veto or whatever it may be?  Does it mean the power of appointment and so on? There are other phrases used in these such as &ldquo;share&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know whether it is defined&mdash;and &ldquo;debenture&rdquo;, and a lot of terms like this are used because the section is borrowed from an English section.  I think care should be taken to define the terms being used so that the taxpayer at least will have some clarity in relation to the effect of the section itself.</P>

      <P>I want to make a general observation, first of all, with regard to the question of sections in this and previous Finance Bills being copied from British legislation.  To a great extent, this is true, but I would like it to be understood why this is so. What, in fact, happens is that certain loopholes are discovered in Britain and they are operated by people who are trying to avoid liability for duty or whatever, and the British revenue authorities then bring in legislation to close these loopholes, whereupon they are drawn to the attention of people here who start to operate them here.</P>

      <P>The journal &ldquo;The Accountant&rdquo; has described the British company sections as &ldquo;of a complexity scarcely equalled by any other part of British statute law&rdquo;.  When we started in 1965, our idea was, and, indeed, remains, to try to keep our provisions as straightforward as possible without leaving too many loopholes for avoidance. It may be that the absence of the definitions to which Deputies have referred is leading to some confusion, but I do not think that is proved by reason of the fact, as I have indicated, that there have been so many amendments of British legislation.  I think the definitions may not be the answer to the problem.  I will undertake to look at this, although I should say that it seems to be unlikely that I would be able to bring in an amendment or amendments containing satisfactory definitions which would not just be new loopholes between now and Report Stage.  I will have a look at it, but if it seems that such would be advantageous, I might find that it would be impossible for me to do it on Report Stage, but it could be considered on the next Finance Bill that comes before the House.  I am not saying that that is the position but it may well be so when I have examined it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make a further point on that which I made before in discussing finance measures? There are undoubtedly certain aspects of finance legislation which obviously must be introduced shortly after the Budget&mdash;direct changes in taxation, changes in respect of income tax, beer or spirit duty, tobacco taxes and that sort of thing&mdash;but every year that most of us can remember&mdash;certainly in all recent years&mdash;the Finance Bill has been considered here at the very end of the session.  A lot of this Part of the Bill&mdash;a great deal&mdash;of it is not politically contentious.  I suppose that in present circumstances I would hesitate to suggest that it might be appropriate for a Committee of the Dáil, but be that as it may, it certainly is the type of legislation that should be considered in the autumn or at some period of the year when pressure in relation to the concluding <Col N="1236" /> of business is not as acute as it is at the moment.  The Minister might well consider, subject to whatever he may introduce on Report Stage, that certain aspects of the finance legislation might be introduced in a separate measure in the autumn when it would be possible to deal with the revision of the law and improvements in it, or matters which are, as I say, not strictly urgent in the sense that a number of these changes could apply at any particular period.  Undoubtedly, this is the sort of complex matter that it is very difficult to deal with in the end of a session situation, and also difficult to deal with very often because the matters could be more readily dealt with in a Special Committee such as that which dealt with legislation relating to company law reform, the Companies Act, income tax revision and fisheries consolidation&mdash;committees of that sort where it would be possible to get quick answers from both sides and direct advice on the actual matters being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a taxation section and it is not a very nice form or taxation, in my view.  It is increasing the spread of duty without changing the rate.  Section 27 (4) of the Finance Act of 1965 provided a sliding scale in respect of duty being attached to property by reason of the donor having transferred the property in his lifetime and not living for more than five years after the transfer.  A sliding scale was provided there whereby the duty would be 15 per cent if the death took place in the third year, 30 per cent in the fourth year and 60 per cent in the fifth year, so that in the event of a donor dying within three years, four years or five years, there was a varying liability to duty and the nearer he lived to the period of exemption, the less duty there would have to be paid.  That sliding scale was welcomed here and it was considered a reasonable way of making an approach <Col N="1237" /> to a change in the law.  The purpose of section 39 is to abolish that.  As I read it, the effect of this section is that now there is to be a liability for full duty if the death occurs within the five-year period.  I cannot see any justification for this and I should like to hear the Minister's defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily an effort to protect the yield from estate duty because originally the gift period was one year.  This was then extended by the Finance Act of 1910 to three years and section 27 of the Finance Act of 1965 extended the three-year period to five years.  Speaking from recollection the reductions for the third, fourth and fifth years, which have been referred to by Deputy O'Higgins, were introduced by way of amendment in the course of the debate.  However, the pattern is clear, that is, that it has been necessary during the years to extend the period in order to prevent a considerable drop in yield from estate duty.  That is borne out if one looks at what has happened in the UK where the period has now been extended to seven years with percentage reductions for gifts made in the fifth, sixth and seventh year.  One sees the same pattern emerging all the time.  It is exactly for the same reason that each of these extensions has taken place.  There is no other either more or less sinister reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, my immediate reaction was that section 37 was in many ways the worst section in the entire Bill.  It may be difficult for me to make the particular point I wish to make at this stage but it is my opinion that the removal of a sliding scale in relation to the rate of duty, having regard to the distance in time of the making of the gift from the time of death, is bad.  It is good to retain this sliding scale because it means that if a person knows he has not a very long time to live there will be a benefit in giving over the property at that time rather than waiting for another year because he knows that even if he does survive for a further three or four years, at least if he transfers it now there will be benefit in relation <Col N="1238" /> to the payment of duty.  We must remember that this duty is not a gifts tax.  It is a tax in relation to death. Therefore, it is consistent that since it is in relation to death there should be a lesser rate of duty having regard to the distance from the death and the relevance to the death of the time at which the gift is made.  If the gift is made immediately before death it is likely that it is made in anticipation of death and therefore the duty should be heavy.  On the other hand, if it is made some time before death, it was not made in contemplation of death and is not, in the same sense, applicable to tax on death.  Therefore, there should be the sliding scale.  If it is necessary to raise extra revenue I would not mind if the period was extended to six years as long as the sliding scale is retained.</P>

      <P>It appears from the explanation given by the Minister that what happened here was that one of the Minister's predecessors introduced a Bill and somebody succeeded in pointing out to him that there was something unfair in it and consequently a section was introduced which gave a concession.  The Minister is now starting from scratch again and he has to be persuaded, as was his predecessor, that this sliding scale should be included. If this is the reason the Minister is making a mistake in altering it. I agree that it could possibly be stretched if necessary to a longer period but it is unfair that the sliding scale should be removed simply because the Minister is of the opinion that his predecessor was wrong in agreeing to the amendment which was put in during the course of the debate.</P>

If a farmer making a will has a choice between his wife and a son who, in any case, will eventually be the person to succeed to the property then from the point of view of having the best management for the farm he would be wise to transfer the property to the son rather than to the wife.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point being made by the Deputy but far outweighing the point is the necessity to do what we can to assist a widow in circumstances of a death and particularly a widow with dependent children. I would remind the Deputy, too, that we are dealing with cases other than agricultural land when we are dealing with estate duty and the additional exemptions we are proposing are worthwhile and important.  The net effect of this proposal is to exempt from duty an estate of the extent of £15,300 where the widow is the only beneficiary and where there are no <Col N="1240" /> dependent children.  If there is one dependent child the exemption limit would be £18,750.  It goes up in that way.  If there are five dependent children it is £30,450, if there are ten dependent children £40,600.  I feel that this is worthwhile and I certainly would not alter it for the sake of the point being made by Deputy Bruton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter primarily because there is a certain amount of public anxiety about the uniformity of law enforcement. Recently on the Estimate for Local Government I had to advert to a similar problem.  I should like to say straight away that this is no reflection on the Garda Síochána who are simply not up to strength and are unable to cope with the multiple requirements of law enforcement at the moment.  That situation does require an examination of cases where there is any danger of sporadic or capricious enforcement of the law.</P>
      <P>In reply to my question the Minister quite rightly pointed out that the Garda Síochána and the Attorney General would be the prosecuting authorities in the first instance anyway. When I asked whether action would be taken there was a suggestion that the matter might be <i>sub judice.</i> That is not sufficiently definite to prevent this debate.  If there were definite action pending I would be only too glad to defer the matter.</P>
      <P>The situation arises as follows.  Section 16 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person, otherwise than under and in accordance with a permit in writing <Col N="1241" /> granted to him under this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to print or publish or cause or procure to be printed or published, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to sell or expose, offer, or keep for sale, or</P>
    <P>(c)  to distribute, offer or keep for distribution,</P>
    <P>any book or periodical publication (whether appearing on the register of prohibited publications or not) which advocates or which might reasonably be supposed to advocate the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage of any method, treatment, or appliance to be used for the purpose of such prevention or such procurement.</P>
    <P>There have recently appeared in a number of magazines, particulars of which I furnished to the Minister and I do not think it would be right for me to detail individual magazines here since there are probably others which are in default in the same way, a very clear full page advertisement clearly advocating the unnatural prevention of conception within the meaning of that section. I do not think there will be any controversy about that having regard to the whole tenor of the Act itself. This motive is right through it and it is specific in this section.  It is furthermore possible that the matter is covered by section 17.  The reading is not quite so clear in the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889.  That Act involes certain prohibitions but it is to be noted that it deals with the deliverer who delivers the indecent material.  In section 17 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 the references embrace the matters relating to contraception.  It appears that under section 16 and, possibly under section 17, the publication of the advertisement is within the terms of the Act.  The question is whether this Act is to be enforced or whether it is not.  If it is to be enforced is it to be enforced uniformly?</P>
    <P>I am not, at this stage, dealing with the question of the desirability or otherwise of such advertisements but I think that most people, even those who advocate certain freedoms in regard to this matter, would agree that the free advertisement of such material <Col N="1242" /> is not desirable.  Many of those who have advocated a certain freedom in the laws relating to contraception here have been careful to add that they would be prepared to accept certain safeguards and among those safeguards would be the prevention of indiscriminate advertising.  I mention that as a factor in the case but not as the basis on which I am making the case.</P>
    <P>This advertisement has been at large for approximately a fortnight.  These magazines are on free sale in this city today as they were on the day on which I put down the question.  The Minister in his reply said:</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the question of legal proceedings is being or will be considered in relation to the matter mentioned in the question and it is not a matter for me to make any further statement about it, at all events as long as the matter may become the subject of proceedings.</P>
    <P>If the matter were <i>bona fide sub judice</i> I think the ruling would be that I could not raise the matter here tonight and, indeed, I would not wish to.  I am raising it primarily with regard to the uniform enforcement of the law.</P>
    <P>The question is relevant because under another section of this Act a successful prosecution was brought against Irish publications recently.  I think that prosecution was well founded.  Section 14 under which it was brought also starts &ldquo;It shall not be lawful to print or publish....&rdquo; The Act was infringed in those particulars and nobody can complain, certainly I do not, about the bringing of that prosecution.  It might be of interest to note that it came out in cross-examination of the police officer concerned in the proceedings that the prosecution was not on the initiative, in the first instance, of the Garda.  It would be rather surprising if it had been otherwise because of the big gap in time and also because of similar reports on occasions in certain English publications that are freely available in this country and which nobody objects to.  It is also only fair for me to say that my information is that the initiative did not come from the Minister or the Department either. <Col N="1243" /> But a situation has been brought about in which this Act can be enforced in some particulars; therefore, it raises the question: is it to be enforced in other particulars?</P>
    <P>I think I should not indulge in a legal argument on whether my point on sections 16 and 17 is right.  I content myself by saying that, certainly, on comparing the words in the case of the section which was enforced and this section &ldquo;...it shall not be lawful...&rdquo; I think it is a fair submission that it is. This is what, in conclusion, I want to ask the Minister and it is possibly the whole purpose of my speaking.  There should be some certainty in this: if this Act is in abeyance&mdash;and sometimes Acts go into abeyance because of changing times&mdash;let it be so, but if this Act is to be enforced then let the law be enforced uniformly over the whole country.</P>

      <P>I am not making any particular complaint from newspapers.  I am saying the Act was enforced in one instance.  I am asking about its enforcement under this section.  I should like to make it clear that there is no complaint about the enforcement under the earlier section.  I am not complaining about its enforcement but I am asking that the matter be made clear.  I am asking for certainty so that people will know where they stand in this matter and whether the sections to which I have referred are alive or not.  That is the simple question I ask and it is from that point of view I have raised the matter.  I do not think there is anything further to be said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to say is that as the Minister for Finance who answered on my behalf this afternoon while I was in the Seanad, pointed out, this is a matter for the Garda Síochána acting where necessary in consultation with or on the direction of the Attorney General.  He went on to say that the question of legal proceedings is being, <Col N="1244" /> or will be considered.  I have made further and more specific inquiries since then and I find that this matter was referred more than a week ago by the Garda to the Chief State Solicitor and that this morning the Chief State Solicitor's office in the normal course referred it to the Attorney General and it is now in the process of being, or about to be considered by him.</P>
      <P>There are two possible decisions that the Attorney General can make with regard to this question or any other similar potential prosecution. He can decide to prosecute in which event the matter will become clearly <i>sub judice</i> in which case a debate on the subject matter of the alleged offence in this House before the hearing of the case is, in my opinion, grossly unfair to the defendant and, therefore, should not take place.  The alternative decision which the Attorney General can make is not to prosecute and if he so decides I am in no way responsible to Dáil Éireann for his decision any more than I would be for his decision to prosecute.  Therefore, I feel rather strongly&mdash;and it would be my submission&mdash;that matters of this kind relating to potential prosecutions which have already been referred to the law officers should not, in fairness to all concerned, be raised in this House before the prosecutions are disposed of.  In any event, as Minister for Justice, I have no responsibility to the House for the decision of the Attorney General whichever way that decision goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I shall deal more specifically with what Deputy de Valera raised.  He appears to complain that because a number of newspapers published in this country were prosecuted under section 14 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, therefore, certain other prosecutions should be brought under section 16 of the same Act against certain other publications. Whether this is the view of just one newspaper proprietor or the view of the proprietors of the four newspapers that I understand were prosecuted under section 14, I do not know but I did inquire from the Garda what were the magazines that gave rise to this complaint and I was given four names.  I was told that all <Col N="1245" /> four were printed and published in Britain, outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The gardaí on last Monday week went out to certain shops in central Dublin and purchased copies of each of the four magazines, the names having been published in a Sunday paper the previous day.  They forwarded these magazines to the Chief State Solicitor's office.  If there is to be a prosecution under section 16 in respect of this matter the prosecution will be against the owners of these shops for having sold or exposed, offered or kept for sale the publications in question.  It is not possible, even if the Attorney General were to decide to prosecute, to prosecute either the printers or the publishers because they are outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate for these shopkeepers in central Dublin that they should be potentially liable at least to the prosecution because they may well have been unaware of the contents or alleged contents of the magazines but I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that section 16 (1) of the Act in question does not apply only to advertising; it applies to any writing in a book or periodical which <i>inter alia</i> advocates or might reasonably be supposed to advocate the unnatural prevention of conception, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>I have a recollection of reading, in recent months, in all the Dublin newspapers, to a greater or lesser extent, numerous articles on the topic which is the subject of our discussion this evening.  In particular, I recall quite a considerable number of articles by a lady who was, I understand, the woman editor of a particular newspaper&mdash;unfortunately, I believe she has left that employment now.  On behalf of a recently formed organisation she consistently and almost daily appeared, to me at any rate, to advocate certain things which might or might not come within the ambit of section 16 (1).  As <Col N="1246" /> a result of my attention having been drawn so eloquently and so forcibly to the very strict provisions of this section this evening, I consider the gardaí presumably will have to go through the files of a number of newspapers to see, not whether the advertising columns might potentially offend section 16, but whether the editorial matter also might be in breach of the section.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it may well place a heavy load on the gardaí to do this. As Deputy de Valera pointed out in the debate, the gardaí are overworked at the moment and I can say without doubt that this is so.  However, the matter is one for the Attorney General and for him only.  The matter has now been referred to him for decision.  He is an able lawyer and a very competent man and I have no doubt he will decide the matter in accordance with the best traditions of the Irish Bar and that everyone will be happy with the enforcement of the law with regard to this topic.</P>
