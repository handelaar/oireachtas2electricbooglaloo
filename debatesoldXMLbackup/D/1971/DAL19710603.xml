      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing last week with our record in respect of the house building and particularly with the failure of the Government over a number of years to emulate the record set 20 years ago.  I particularly emphasised the fall off in the percentage of houses built by local authorities and the social impact this was having and will have among the less well off members of our society.  This fall off has occurred although we are now supposed to be 50 per cent better off than we were 20 years ago.  It is all very well for a Minister to come in here and quote statistics, but the ultimate test is the number of houses built, and if we have a social conscience our main concern must be the number of these houses available for letting or renting to people who out of their own resources cannot be expected to provide houses for themselves.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that to Fianna Fáil Governments house building has been a very sensitive area.  I suppose it would be to any Government.  It is a field which involves considerable labour mobility and that fact gives industrial workers a stronger bargaining position.  Whatever they may secure as a result of their bargaining tends to become the norm for other groups.  As well, building expenses are by their nature non-competitive whereas in the matter of other commodities there is open competition.  You cannot import buildings to compete with buildings put up here.  There is also no export content in building.  Neither can you export roads, but roads are regarded as the infrastructure for economic development.</P>
      <P>The general question of rents, rates and the Government contribution to them has been dealt with by the Minister in his White Paper but if we take the sources of local authority expenditure and analyse them in respect of county councils and urban bodies, it throws up some interesting figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Years ago when we were all younger the great outcry of the rural community and the farmers in particular was about the rates.  There is still an element of that but when the figures are examined they present an interesting <Col N="1007" /> pattern.  In respect of county council expenditure, in 1960-61, 44 per cent came from rent and rates and 55 per cent came from Government contributions. I have not the figures for 1970-71 but, in 1969-70, 36 per cent came from rent and rates and 61 per cent from Government contributions.  In respect of urban communities, in 1960-61, rent and rates amounted to 76 per cent whereas Government grants amounted to 24 per cent.  In 1969-70, the rent and rates grant had increased slightly to 83 per cent and the Government grant was 16 per cent.  This shows that the urban community are now contributing a very high ratio to local authority expenditure <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rural community. I imagine the pattern many years ago must have been rather different.</P>
    <P>In respect of housing, and this presents the figures in a somewhat different fashion, for the year ended 31st March, 1969, £.84 million was collected in respect of 19,000 county council houses whereas in respect of 103,000 urban houses £4.3 million was collected. These figures show that the urban community is harder pressed, and the tendency is for that pressure to increase <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rural community.</P>
    <P>In the past decade expenditure at local level has increased considerably. Rates have doubled and are now around £50 million per year.  Out of total expenditure of £150 million, one-third, or £50 million, comes from the rates; one-sixth from rents and other services and one-half from Government sources.  Capital expenditure advanced from £9 million in 1960-61 to £36 million in 1970-71 and is now 18 or 19 per cent of our total capital programme. In other words, our rates have doubled, our revenue expenditure has trebled, our capital expenditure has quadrupled and our total indebtedness to local authorities has increased from £143 million in 1959-60 to £283 million in 1969-70.  It is particularly disappointing in the face of all that increased expenditure, although I realise it does not all go on housing, that the housing record of the last few years has been so poor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> We were building at a higher rate 20 years ago, and at that time even though we were relatively less well off, we were providing substantially better social services.  We were providing £8 million for food subsidies which were abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government within six weeks of getting into power after promising on every platform in the country that if returned to power they would not touch the food subsidies.  This is in my view a highly unsatisfactory picture.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>All that could be done to reduce costs without jettisoning acceptable standards has largely been done.</P>
    <P>Does a reduction in the size of grant houses not constitute a jettisoning of standards?  Does the intensification of the density of housing schemes not constitute a jettisoning of housing standards?  Bad though the figures may have been over the years one thing we could say up till recently, when a programme of ghetto pillboxes arrived under the Minister and his predecessor, was that our houses had a larger cubic capacity than houses built in many other places.  We have sacrificed that larger cubic capacity in the interests of producing more housing units and consequently better statistical records.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned low cost housing projects.  It appears the project has two facets: the first is large-scale long-term contracts&mdash;one cannot object to that&mdash;and the second is short-life houses.  The ambition seems to be to get good production figures on the cheap.  I do not accept this is an adequate excuse or reason for returning to the jerry-building of the thirties.  In the absence of any radically new ideas or departures in the construction industry this approach of the Minister is of dubious value.  However, I can only wish him luck with his short life pillboxes.</P>
    <P>In respect of assessment of housing needs there is of course a subjective as well as an objective aspect to this.  It depends very much on what standards you are aiming at and it does not lend itself to an absolute mathematical calculation. I am satisfied that the needs set out in the Government White <Col N="1009" /> Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies,</i> are a true index of total needs.  The needs should be honestly set out.  There should be no attempt made to minimise the extent of the problem merely because we are unable or do not want to reach our target.  I have not analysed in detail the basis on which the figures in the White Paper were brought out. Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has done so here before this House on at least one occasion.  In general, these calculations are based on four basic criteria: overcrowding, unfitness, obsolescence and new family formation.  These taken in conjunction with the latest census data, are used as a basis on which to make the calculations and projections as regards future needs.</P>
    <P>I have, however, examined the calculations and projections as regards my own constituency, Tipperary South Riding, and I am satisfied that there the county development plan was a gross understatement of our requirements.  It was indeed grossly inaccurate in its calculation and assumption and it was ridiculous to regard it as a serious exercise in planning our programme.  I am sure that, if I carried out a similar exercise in most other counties, I would have similar results.  It may be that we had lack of expertise.  In most counties we had the position at that time of a staff relatively inexperienced in this type of work.  Most counties took a local engineer and sent him up to the Custom House for a crash course.  After the crash course he came back as a planner.  It was those people, with some help from other sources, who drew up the county development plan.</P>
    <P>It is quite understandable that the target of the requirements which was calculated in such circumstances could be open to question.  The attempt to make the assessment in my own constituency was extremely amateurish and was in effect an understatement; not alone were certain understated requirements laid down but targets lower than that were then suggested. As year after year passed we got further and further below those targets, so that in my constituency, as well as in other places, our record is extremely poor.  It is slightly better <Col N="1010" /> than it was in the past.  In one year we built no houses and in another year we only built one house, but by and large it is a poor record.</P>
    <P>I may say that this is not in any way attributable to the local representatives, all of whom are more than anxious, irrespective of the outcry about rates, to improve their house production programme.  The difficulty arises, as it has always arisen, at departmental and ministerial level.  I have already explained how, under the particular machinery local authorities have to operate, it is quite a simple matter to slow down housebuilding at any stage.  The various controls that are exercisable from the Custom House can, behind the scenes, be put into operation to secure this.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions that a subsidy from his Department is available under the Housing Act, 1970, for the provision of housing for key workers coming into an area for new or expanding industry and has provided the basis for arrangements which he hopes will become an effective service to industry. One must welcome that.  This is not new.  It has been in operation for some time but one needs to emphasise here that every effort should be made to see that the credentials of all such firms are carefully screened. In certain areas there is always a risk in building houses if the particular industry is likely to fail at a later stage.</P>
    <P>We had that experience in South Tipperary in respect of the Ballingarry Colliery.  A number of houses were built in Killenaule.  Fortunately, the Department resisted the more rosy prognostications of the proprietors and built less houses than were demanded; but even at that we are faced, and have been faced for some considerable time, with a number of unused houses in a place where it will not be too easy to get them occupied.  We resisted for years demands in South Tipperary County Council to have these houses built in the Ballingarry region.  It was only when the National Building Agency arrived that facilities were made available to have these houses built.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement <Col N="1011" /> that where houses must be provided for rent they will be taken over, maintained and administered by the housing authority and that the Industrial Development Authority will recoup the local authority for the letting of houses to industrial employees.  One of the difficulties at Killenaule probably arose from the fact that these precautions were not taken at that time.  If the county council had had some direct administrative role I believe that the houses would have been maintained. As it was, this housing estate seemed to be in the hands of an industrialist and our position as a county council was merely to buy some of the houses from time to time.  We have taken over some of these houses but had the county council been involved from the beginning I believe the position would be better.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the reduction in the floor area of the grant houses and said that the new system should help counteract the effect of high land prices which often force builders to build to a luxury standard simply to cover their costs.  High land prices have developed as a result of inflation.  There has been land speculation also.  No serious drive has been made at Departmental level to encourage local authorities to acquire a pool of serviced land over the country as a whole.  Some effort has been made in Dublin to do so, but there has not been sufficient drive at county council level to secure a quantum of serviced land in rural Ireland for private individuals and private builders.  Consequently, at the present time the smallest plot of land can be sold for £1,000, £1,200 or £1,500.  The Government and the Minister have been less than satisfactory in dealing with this matter.  There has been talk about the nationalisation of building land but the Minister has said that this would give rise to legal, administrative and constitutional difficulties.  I cannot comment on the constitutional aspect of the problem.  This is probably a matter for a constitutional lawyer or for the courts.  There is machinery by which local authorities could have built up a pool of serviced land under each <Col N="1012" /> local authority and this worthwhile exercise has not been undertaken.  Yet we speak with tongue in cheek about land speculation.  This course might not have prevented land speculation completely but at least it would have modified it.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about houses for the aged.  Everybody in this House will be in favour of the Minister's plans to provide houses for the aged.  Such houses should be built at ground level only with built-in safeguards and should be specially adapted to the needs of the elderly.  I would not like to see a large number of such houses grouped together in the bigger centres of population.  We do not want to create geriatric ghettoes.  The houses should be carefully planned and suitably located.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Since the scheme of grants to encourage this work was introduced in 1962, grants have been allocated for 962 units, of which 530 have so far been completed.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts that we should try to keep people out of institutions and county homes and that their own surroundings, no matter how humble, are more suitable than the most sophisticated type of institution.  I am disappointed with the figures if I have interpreted them correctly as meaning that only 530 houses have been completed for the aged since 1962, when I compare that figure with the high population in county homes.  I have never liked the idea of large county homes.  I feel depressed every time I visit such a home and see such a high proportion of our population living there.  I do not deny that everything is being done in a most humane manner for the old people, but these people miss their home environment.  I am disappointed at the figure of 530 houses completed since 1962.  Relative to the county home population, this figure is not very impressive.</P>
    <P>On page 16 of the Minister's brief are the figures for the subsidisation of local authority housing&mdash;the one-third and two-thirds subsidy houses.  The figure for a non-serviced house is now £1,300.  In 1948, it was £1,100.  For a <Col N="1013" /> serviced house the figure is £2,200 and in 1948 it was £1,650.  For flats up to five storeys, the figure is £3,000 and in 1948 it was £2,200.  For flats of more than five storeys the figure is £3,200 and in 1948 it was £2,200.  Of course, the purchasing power of money has decreased considerably since 1948.  It is now less than half what it was then. Therefore, from the point of view of building costs, coupled with this decrease in the value of money, the subsidisation of these dwellings has by no means kept pace with rising costs.</P>
    <P>On the question of differential rents the Minister said, and I quote from page 17 of his brief:</P>
    <P>On an annual programme of nearly 5,000 dwellings, subsidies will increase every year by over £1.1 million.  Thus, in five more years, on the basis of the programme proposed in the 1969 White Paper, State and local authority subsidies at their current level could have increased from £10.6 million to over £16 million a year&mdash;or nearly as much as we spent on building local authority houses last year.</P>
    <P>It is no argument to say that the amount would be as much as we spent on building local authority houses last year because, as I have already emphasised, that figure is too low.  In principle the differential rent system is sound.  Most people in the House, irrespective of which side they are on, agree on this.  One could not disagree with the principle provided one is satisfied that the little extra paid by those who are in a strong position to pay is reflected in improved conditions for those who happen to be in a weak position.  I have not any figures on this but I would like to know if the increase in income from local authority housing has been reflected in a corresponding increase in the number of local authority houses built.  We know that the income from local authority housing has increased and we know also that there has been a decrease in the number of local authority houses being built.  When he is replying perhaps the Minister would give us some observations on this.</P>
    <P>Differential rents are on a <Col N="1014" /> gross family income and not on basic parental income.  Gross income includes overtime and some other emoluments that may be temporary or haphazard and on a proportion of the income of the family members.  I do not think anybody could object to the principle of calculating a rent on a static basic income&mdash;an income to which parents can look forward year after year.  However, the question of overtime raises certain difficulties.  My own view is that the inclusion of overtime is questionable.  Apart from the fact that such extra earnings often entail extra and perhaps not too readily vouchable expenses and simultaneous increases in taxation, the adding on of another increase in rent is very likely to prove a disincentive to productivity in the peak of seasonal employment and also in the labour-scarce field of domiciliary help.</P>
    <P>In putting these arguments forward, I am urging the Minister to have another look at this question of including overtime, money that the head of the household may earn, perhaps, by working during a week-end or money that a wife might earn by carrying out some domestic chore in a house in the vicinity.  Regarding the inclusion for rent assessment of so many new pennies per week in respect of each member of the household who is working, again there is some injustice here.  It is unjust to ask non-householders who are already consumer tax-payers by reason of turnover tax and who are already paying income tax under PAYE to pay a household rent or a proportion of it.  No other citizen in the State is asked to do this.  Members of a family who happen to be raised in a local authority house are asked to pay a household tax for no other reason than that their parents were poor.  Under the new health regulations there is a clear differentiation in relation to a means test for health cards between parental and family member income.  The family member income is now to be excluded completely when calculating means for the issue of health cards.  If that is a correct procedure for subsidised health, I submit it should be a correct procedure for subsidised housing.</P>
    <P>I understand there is considerable <Col N="1015" /> dissatisfaction up and down the country about differential rents, not in respect of differential rents being assessed upon a basic parental income but in respect of differential rents being increased by dragging in all these bits and pieces that a means test officer can lay his hands on when he is asked to reassess the rent of a household.  I note the Minister's observation about building societies at column 442, Volume 254, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The number of new house loans which the societies were able to approve in the year ended 31st March, 1971, was about double the number of loans approved in the previous year.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am right in my suggestion that this advance may have been the result of the bank strike. The availability of housing loans from building societies depends upon how much money is being put into the societies by the public.  Perhaps the Minister could give his views on how this upsurge was related, if it is related at all, to the recent bank strike, or if it is a trend that is likely to continue. The Minister also mentions that foreign insurance companies operating in this country have agreed to advance the level of investments in Ireland of the funds appropriate to their Irish business from the present level of 66? per cent to 80 per cent by 1977.  Could the Minister tell us how much of that has been earmarked or is it just a general advance?</P>
    <P>In regard to house purchase loans by local authorities, it has been our practice in South Tipperary to limit these loans practically entirely to the provision of new houses, and I see that this is in conformity with the practice all over the country.  In so far as money is scarce I would be in agreement that this money should be limited to the provision of new houses.  There would be a temptation to borrow money for small repairs that people could well do themselves, and therefore I believe it is quite right that the available money should be reserved for new houses.</P>
    <P>The income level and the valuation in respect of local authority houses <Col N="1016" /> should have been raised even higher than the Minister has allowed.  Local authorities assess the income of applicants, but the allocations made are determined by regulations.  I put down a Parliamentary Question asking the Minister to raise these figures to a more realistic level, and now we have this small advance to £1,500.  If we are to balance income with valuation on the basis of £1 valuation being equal to £20 income, the valuation should be advanced to £75, that is, if we are to accept the ratio which has been in operation in Civil Service thinking for many years.  I cannot understand why in this field there is this imbalance between income level and valuation.  It does not obtain in most other fields. However, that is a small point.  In general the income limits are still too low because of the fall in the value of money, and people who could not be considered well off and are in need of a loan are precluded by this limit from availing of it.  I think local authorities may, if they wish, go above that, but I am not quite sure of that.</P>
    <P>On the question of supplementary grants, I recognise there was an injustice done to people trying to build houses and finding they could not get a supplementary grant from small urban bodies, because such bodies were unable to meet these grants.  I welcome the fact that this has now been corrected and that the larger body, the county council, may now pay the supplementary grant for smaller urban bodies.  This was an injustice which affected a not inconsiderable number of people all over the country.</P>
    <P>In respect of supplementary grants, again the Minister will tell me we are paying out ever-increasing grants but it is only proper that I should point out the failure of these supplementary grants to keep pace with the fall in the value of money and the increased cost of house building.  To qualify for a supplementary grant in 1960 the income was £832, valuation £50, with concessions for dependants.  In the 1966 Act the figures were advanced to £1,045, the valuation to £60, with dependant concessions up to £400.  I put down an amendment that the figure should be raised to £1,500 on one occasion and <Col N="1017" /> the Minister has agreed to £1,250.  If building costs have increased by one-third over the past three years the Minister's advance on applicant income levels for supplementary grants has not kept pace with rising costs.</P>
    <P>Of course when I welcome the fact that county councils may pay supplementary grants to people building houses in small urban areas where these grants are not being paid by the urban body, I do not thank the Minister for it.  It is no skin off his nose. These are being paid entirely by the local authorities and one's thanks must go to the local authorities who have been good enough to take on this extra financial burden.</P>
    <P>The Minister said at page 23 of his speech:</P>
    <P>...a special extra capital allocation of £3 million, spread over a three-year period, was made available from the Local Loans Fund to Dublin Corporation to acquire land for housing.  Under this programme the corporation were able to buy over 2,000 acres of serviced and unserviced land at an average price of about £1,500 per acre.</P>
    <P>I must express my appreciation of that. It is a pity that some similar effort was not made in respect of many other areas all over the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister said also:</P>
    <P>...one of the factors that has pushed up land prices in the Dublin area in recent years has been competition among builders for the building land available.</P>
    <P>Competition may be a factor but is there not another reason?  Is the real reason not land speculation, made possible under the Planning Act?  Would anyone disagree with me when I say that that is the operative factor in pushing up the price of land in Dublin and in other parts of the country?</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with group water schemes.  This is a difficult field.  We in South Tipperary were perhaps among the pioneers in the field of regional schemes.  We had considerably to modify our approach and indeed our attitude in respect of regional schemes. <Col N="1018" /> The money was not available.  Since the recession of 1965 there has been considerable restraint placed on the development of these schemes.  We have largely had to move away from regional schemes into the field of group schemes.</P>
    <P>One of the defects of group schemes is that they have introduced a new form of administration.  In group schemes the field officer is directly under the control of the Department.  Why this change was made I am not too clear. In my own county council we have 20 or 21 engineers.  We have nearly lost track of them.  One of the reasons advanced during the years for increasing the engineering staff was all the work to be done on water schemes. Now what is the position?  The planning of the water schemes is being done by consultants.  Down through the years we have never been able to secure that our engineers would do any of that work.  We had the case in my constituency of an engineer, our county engineer, who could not plan the carrying of water across this Dáil Chamber but within a fortnight of leaving the service he became a consultant engineer and does the work for the entire county.</P>
    <P>Now we find that our basic regional schemes are still there but the attempt is being made to do the in-field work through local group schemes.  That is quite reasonable.  The county council provides the headwork and the main arterial supplies and group schemes do the in-field area.  When we cannot do it ourselves as a regional scheme this is a method of approach which now seems to have evolved.  Much of the planning has already been done.  We have spent £80,000 on engineering fees.  It is not all wasted.  Some of that work is still available to us in respect of our group schemes.  However, the difficulty about group schemes is that the local officer in charge of them does not report to and is not permitted to attend meetings of the local authorities.  We have no control.  We have merely a loose liaison, a contact with such officers.  If group schemes are not being pushed we can only put down parliamentary questions asking why they are not being <Col N="1019" /> carried out.  Admittedly these local field offices are inadequately staffed. In the beginning they did not even have clerical help.  I also understand that it is not so easy to fill these posts.</P>
    <P>I have yet to have it explained to me why these officers who are providing a local service, a service to help local people, are so divorced from the county council which is the local authority.  Why are they kept completely under control of the Department and the Minister?  What is the purpose behind that?  From our point of view it is not a satisfactory arrangement. In the ordinary engineering services we can have our monthly meetings and question the engineers as to why this or that was not done, get explanations and have our arguments, but in the case of the group schemes where we are supplying the basic headworks and money grants we have no element of control.  The contacts we have are extremely loose.  To my mind this is administratively unsatisfactory.  I do not know what solution the Minister may have or if he will offer any help in the matter.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary questions have been asked, so far as I recall, suggesting that such district officers should be expected to report periodically to the local county council, but they are not allowed to appear before us.  I see no valid reason why this should be so.  A loose liaison between a field engineer directly under the control of the Minister and some other nominated engineer in the county council chamber is not satisfactory from the point of view of local representation.</P>
    <P>Last year was Conservation Year.  I am dissatisfied because of the lack of progress in regard to the very important matter of pollution.  Some years ago we had an international engineering conference here and certain legislation was suggested to the Minister and certain action was proposed.  Nothing on these lines has been carried out since.  We were told last year, we were told this year, and I suppose next year we will be told again, about the amount of research work that is being carried out particularly by An Foras <Col N="1020" /> Forbartha in the Custom House.  One would like to see some practical results. We have to consider the Dodder, the Tolka, the Liffey, Dublin Bay and the River Lee.  We do not need any research work to know that they are grossly polluted.  So far, what practical steps have been taken in regard to conservation of our environment?  Over the past two, three, or four years it has been estimated that it will cost us £35 million and the corresponding figure produced in Britain was £500 million.  Do we have to keep on spending £¼ million per year on An Foras Forbartha to be treated every year to a eulogy on this unit in the Custom House and yet see no practical results anywhere?</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister has done a very good job with a very bad case.  He has given us a prolonged dissertation on the problems, but this dissertation simply means that the people of Dublin will have to tolerate their filthy rivers as well as their housing and traffic problems for many years to come.  Here we have page after page of words, verbiage, but when one reads through all those pages one fails to find anything of a practical nature being suggested by the Minister.  One must ask when will we get results? When will a beginning be made to solving these problems?  Every Department in the State is interested in pollution as is the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards.  A harmless committee was set up by the Taoiseach on which he appointed 50 or 60 persons.  They are all decent-minded but harmless people who would be quite happy to meet, have a cup of tea, discuss this terrible problem of pollution, and then go home.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion I urged that this problem should be centralised in one Department.  I presume the Department of Local Government would be the suitable one.  All the clap-trap of other interested bodies should be set aside because it only confuses the issue. We saw a caravan in Leinster House which was got together by the Minister for Lands.  That was his contribution to Conservation Year.  This caravan went up and down the country showing <Col N="1021" /> people how to conserve our resources and it became known as Flanagan's circus.  That is merely play-acting.  That is not getting down to the heart of the problem.  Getting to the heart of the problem involves planning and the expenditure of money and that is what the Government are not prepared to face up to.  It means work.  It does not mean pages and pages of a dreary brief read out by the Minister once a year before the national Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt also with regional development and regional teams.  In the nature of things I suppose we are a little bit nervous about regionalisation, regarding it as a stepping-stone towards centralisation.  However, in this case we have to look at this matter in the context of our projected entry into the EEC.  The Minister has not mentioned that but the help which we may get in the EEC in regard to regionalisation, and this particularly affects people on the western seaboard and in the north-west, is a matter of extreme importance to us.  Therefore, county and regional development teams are developments which we will have to foster not from the point of view of local government but from the point of view of the importance of regional development in the event of our entering the Common Market.  Regional development is of importance to Italy, to ourselves and to other countries who have this problem, which we have particularly in the west.</P>
    <P>The White Paper which the Minister circulated would appear to be largely a Custom House production based mainly on the results and thinking of the Royal Commissions set up in respect of local government in Britain and in Scotland.  We have had no such commission or investigative body set up here and, indeed, we have not had an examination of local government on these lines since 1935.  They have had several of these examinations across the water.  Before this White Paper appeared at all we had developments here which I understand may shortly be given legal backing, namely, the regionalisation of our health services and the centralisation of our arterial road system.  I have mixed feelings about these local government reorganisation <Col N="1022" /> proposals.  I do not agree with issuing proposals of this nature without simultaneously issuing some ideas in regard to the financing of the system.  Are there to be any radical departures or is it going to be just a rehash of the old system?  I recognise that when the report was prepared by the Royal Commission in respect of Scotland the same argument was advanced&mdash;it was not necessary to produce details of the financing of the system until the structural details were studied and decided upon.  The same argument has been advanced here.</P>
    <P>Here we have a document of 70 pages and the all-important matter of financing this reorganised system is dealt with in only half a page.  This is not a new problem to local government because they have already issued three booklets on the question of the rating system and local financing, none of which got to the kernel of the matter.  We have been promised a fourth booklet shortly on local financing.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with planning and planning appeals.  It is now a few years since the Planning Act was passed and now and only now can we look back and try to judge how satisfactory or otherwise that legislation was.  Again, that legislation was largely based on similar legislation passed in the House of Commons.  It is claimed to have defects both at central and local level.  Being dissatisfied with the method of dealing with appeals at departmental level, this party submitted a Planning Appeals Bill in 1967. It was prepared by Deputy Denis Jones and others and it proposed to substitute for appeals to the Minister appeals to an appeals board to be established under the Bill.  It was suggested that the board consist of a chairman who would be a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court; he would be assigned as chairman by the Chief Justice after consultation with the President of the High Court or the President of the Circuit Court.  In addition, two members of the board who would act as assessors would be drawn from a panel, one to be constituted by the Minister for Local Government and the other by <Col N="1023" /> the Local Appointments Commission. An assessor would be appointed for a period not exceeding three years and would be eligible for reappointment. It was suggested that the ordinary members of the board, whether from the Minister's panel or from the Local Appointments Commission panel, would be either qualified engineers, qualified architects or qualified town planners.  It was also proposed that the decisions of the board should be in writing and their reasons for their decisions should be published in writing and would act as a guide for future appeals and thereby establish a kind of case law to help future appellants who would feel that they were disaffected and would wish to make an appeal.</P>
    <P>That Bill was rejected and the system still goes and appeals, whether they are verbal or written, are adjudged by the political head of the Department behind closed doors.  In our small society, in a suspicious kind of community as we tend to have here, I doubt if this is a satisfactory system.  I have always believed in open conventions. The best way to eliminate suspicion and public dissatisfaction is to open the windows and let in the light of day.  I am not satisfied that our planning system at central level meets the wishes of our people.  It would be better if the business were conducted in a more open fashion than has been the case up to now.  This would be in the interests of democracy and of better public relations.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in regard to appeals at local level.  Registers of planning applications must be kept by all local authorities.  They contain itemised proposals and in the majority of cases most of the proposals are accepted.  In many cases the matters are quite trivial but this is not surprising when one considers that it is necessary to get planning permission for the smallest job.  A certain number of applications are refused and it appears that once the county manager rejects an application the county council and the applicant are powerless. The aggrieved applicant may apply within 28 days to the Minister for <Col N="1024" /> Local Government.  He does not know if his appeal will succeed.  The only thing he knows is that he will probably have to wait for a year before he gets the result.</P>
    <P>The alternative course open to the applicant is to revise and resubmit his application in the form of a new planning proposal, perhaps backed by a section 4 motion submitted simultaneously. The county manager, having once exercised his authority, may be disposed to exercise it again; he may send a second submission to the county solicitor for advice as to whether the second proposal is invalid on the basis that the matter is now <i>res adjudicata</i>.  In many instances the county solicitor may feel himself under the control of the manager; he may have little knowledge of planning, engineering or architecture; he may not have access to the advice of an independent assessor and his knowledge of law may not be too reliable. This man will submit a report to a not too perceptive local authority that the second proposal is an invalid planning proposal and that the county council must reject it.</P>
    <P>To strengthen the hand of the planning officer when he feels disposed to reject an application he has four approved boards at his disposal&mdash;An Comhairle Ealaíon, An Taisce, Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works. In very many cases these organisations do not investigate the case in question. Sometimes they are written to in regard to a private house although we know that Bord Fáilte, for example, are not interested in making any pronouncement in regard to single private houses.  One suspects that these bodies are misused in order to give a pseudo objectivity to the case or to support the decision already taken by a local planning officer.</P>
    <P>We have had considerable difficulty with regard to planning permission in my home town of Cashel.  I have outlined the general difficulties which may arise when a person applies for planning permission.  Perhaps the House will allow me to give a specific case which clearly demonstrates the difficulties we have to face in Cashel, difficulties <Col N="1025" /> other public representatives may have to face up and down the country at local level.  On March 12th last a citizen of Cashel applied for permission to build a bungalow, one mile from Cashel, on the subsidiary Cashel/ Thurles road.  On 17th April his wife approached me in a very agitated state about the pending application; she had heard rumours.  Because another house had been built on that road nearer to Cashel, I assured her that there could not be any difficulty and, to put her mind at rest, I put down an ordinary notice of motion to intimate to the officials my interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>The matter came before the county council on May 3rd and I was informed by the county manager that they were awaiting reports from the four approved bodies to which the matter had been referred.  These are the approved bodies I mentioned.  No intimation was given to me that a refusal was contemplated and it was agreed, at my request and with a view to showing my continuing interest in the matter, that the notice of motion be retained on the agenda.  On the following Saturday morning, May 9th, I received a letter.  The meeting of the county council had been on the previous Monday.  The letter referred to my notice of motion and stated that the statutory period would expire on Monday, May 11th, and accordingly a decision would have to be given before that date and &ldquo;unfortunately the decision in this case will have to be a refusal&rdquo;.  I tried to contact the county manager, but failed, although I understand he was in Clonmel on that date and was, in fact, contacted by the solicitor.  The manager was departing for Paris.</P>
    <P>I succeeded in getting an emergency meeting of the majority of the county councillors on Monday.  It then transpired that it had been agreed to reject this application from the beginning, irrespective of any opinion expressed by the four approved bodies.  It also transpired that of the four approved bodies, An Taisce had some objection but, as far as I could gather locally, had never visited the area.  The Arts Council and Public Works had no <Col N="1026" /> objection.  Bord Fáilte did not reply. The excuse offered for not informing me at the county council meeting four days earlier that the application would be refused was that replies from the bodies were being awaited.  Yet, at that time, it would appear that all had replied, except Bord Fáilte, and I understand this body never interferes in respect of local rural applications.  In any case Bord Fáilte did not reply. Now that is the position that has arisen in respect of one particular local application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I found out what the grounds were on Monday because we had a meeting of the county council. Alternative sites were offered by the officials and a few days later I inspected these sites with the applicant and the planning officer.  I personally was not impressed with the alternative sites.  They were either in an undeveloped, unserviced area, or they were too expensive and, as far as I could judge, the applicant was just not interested.  The objections&mdash;I read them very carefully several times&mdash;were to me generally unconvincing.  There is, of course, a great deal of room for differences of opinion on these things.</P>
      <P>The applicant's architect in an effort to meet the situation and to meet such objections as had been raised submitted a new application.  The manager has referred this to the county solicitor requesting an opinion as to whether the second application should now be regarded as invalid on the grounds that it was already <i>res adjudicata.</i></P>

      <P>I have now submitted a section 4 motion asking that the applicant be granted permission to build by the county council in accordance with his new proposal and that the county development plan be amended accordingly.  This is a specific case.  I raise it because it affects not alone the individual concerned but the whole environs of Cashel.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>If it contravenes your county plan then it is up to the Deputy and the others to change the county plan.  It is not a matter for the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this particular instance I wish to emphasise an aspect of the matter which may have escaped the notice of the House.  When this matter came before the county council and I submitted a simple notice of motion I did not anticipate any objection. I did so merely to satisfy the lady who came to me in a very agitated state.  It was not done for the purpose of confrontation or conflict with the manager.  If I thought there were good and adequate reasons for not building there I would be prepared to listen to them.  Every public representative should.  If I am prepared to give that kind of co-operation, then, equally, I <Col N="1029" /> should get co-operation from others. The matter came before the county council on Monday.  The manager had already decided to &ldquo;knock&rdquo; it, but he said nothing about it until the following Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be interested to know whether one of the conditions on which it was refused was whether it contravened the county plan.  If that was one of the reasons for refusal this is a matter for the local authority.  I am interested in the reasons that were given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the list of reasons here, I think, but I do not think contravention of the county plan was mentioned in it.  I am not absolutely sure of that.  Other reasons&mdash;for example, that it concealed the view of the Rock&mdash;were complete poppycock because it was to be built in a recess and, coming in from Thurles, you could not even see the roof of the bungalow.  I am particularly interested in&mdash;and I want to bring it before the House&mdash;the difficulty of members of a local authority who feel that a citizen may be disaffected.</P>
      <P>Our job as local representatives at local and Dáil level is twofold, (1) to legislate and (2) to bring forward the grievance of any citizen, irrespective of his political allegiance, colour or nationality.  Any citizen who comes to a public representative is entitled to be received by that public representative who has a duty to do his best to see if the grievance is genuine and get it remedied if possible.  It would be a poor public representative who would not try to do that.  It is quite improper that an official, sheltered behind official and legal barriers and protected, should utilise his position to thwart a public representative in an attempt to remove a grievance or to have it aired. This is what happened here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here a White Paper, a document issued by the Department of Local Government: &ldquo;Notes on the Powers Vested by Law in Elected Members of Local Authorities.&rdquo;  This document reads very nicely.  I shall quote from page 5 in respect of <Col N="1030" /> managers <i>vis-á-vis</i> public representatives. It says:</P>
    <P>While the law must, of necessity, make an exact division of functions so that responsibility for their exercise may be clearly defined, it is not the intention behind the management system that the elected members and the manager should act independently of each other.  It is important to bear in mind that all the functions are functions of the local authority and that the exercise of executive functions by the manager is provided for to enable the elected body to have an experienced whole-time administrator for the prompt and efficient discharge of day-to-day business without making an undue demand on the time of the elected members.  The manager is expected to have regard to the wishes of the elected members in the discharge of the executive functions and, with certain reservations, the elected members are authorised to direct the manager as to the manner in which an executive function is to be exercised by him in any particular case.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to reconcile that lovely language with the position in which I found myself in this case in which the technique chosen was to thwart me in the exercise of my statutory obligations and present me with a <i>fait accompli</i>.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This White Paper has an Appendix A dealing with the management system, which says:</P>
      <P>Under the Management Acts, the functions of local authorities are divided into two classes&mdash;reserved functions, performable directly by the elected members, and executive functions, performable by the city or county manager by order.  While the law must make an exact division of functions (so that responsibility for their exercise may be clearly defined) it was never the intention that the elected members and the manager should operate independently of each other.  Both the reserved and executive functions are functions of the local authority and the fact that the executive ones are assigned to the manager is simply intended to provide the elected council with an experienced, wholetime administrator for the prompt and efficient discharge of day-to-day business without making an undue demand on the time of the elected members.  The manager is an officer of the county council or county borough corporation; he is appointed by them on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commission and he may be suspended by them or removed from office with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elected council are responsible for all policy decisions&mdash;including decisions on financial policy&mdash;and the manager must act in conformity with the general policy laid down by them.  In carrying out his duties the manager operates under the general supervision of the council; he is expected to have regard to their wishes and even in the conduct of day-to-day affairs he can be over-ruled by them.  The elected members may require the manager to give <Col N="1032" /> them all the information in his possession or procurement on any business or transaction of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Except only in relation to the control, supervision, <i>et cetera</i>, of staff, the council may direct the manager as to how any of his functions in relation to local government services is to be exercised in any particular case, provided money for the purpose has been provided and what they want can lawfully be done.</P>
    <P>Executive functions (those performed by the manager by order) include decisions in relation to staff, acceptance of tenders, making contracts, fixing rents, making lettings, and decisions on applications for planning permissions, outline permissions or approvals.  Executive functions are, in fact, defined as all of the functions of the local authority except those which are reserved functions.  As mentioned already, the manager, even in the performance of executive functions, operates under the general supervision of the elected members.</P>
    <P>That makes lovely reading but I find it hard to reconcile that with the tale I have told here today.</P>
    <P>I want to pass from that and deal with another specific matter.  It relates to pollution.  On 1st May, an article appeared in the <i>Clonmel Nationalist.</i> The heading was: &ldquo;Clonmel Sewerage Scheme Will Not Harm Fish Life Court Told.&rdquo;  This derived from an application by the acting borough engineer to Clonmel Corporation for permission to pipe untreated sewage into the River Suir.  One week later an article appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on this subject entitled, &ldquo;Polluting the Suir&rdquo;, from the pen of George Burrowes.  I do not wish to go into details of the court proceedings in Clonmel or waste the time of the House but I shall advert to what the <i>Irish Times</i> said.  I quote:</P>
    <P>An angler hardly could be expected to appreciate the full and exact meaning of certain words, words like pollution, for instance, <Col N="1033" /> or indeed phrases.  Here is an example of what I mean.  In the <i>Tipperary Nationalist</i> it is reported that the acting borough engineer for Clonmel, Mr. Denis Collins, went to Clonmel District Court, where he said that discharge of certain effluent into the River Suir would not harm fish; it would, indeed, help the fish by promoting weed growth and &ldquo;other organic plants for the fish to feed on&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The application was for grant of permission to the council to enter on certain lands, to lay pipes to provide drainage for 100 acres for a new housing scheme.  This column is not concerned with the legal aspects or purpose of this case; only with the proposition that putting untreated sewage into a river like the Suir, indeed any river, can be done lightly.</P>
    <P>It was put to Mr. Collins that it was surely an offence to discharge untreated sewage into a river, and he agreed that this be untreated. Was there any programme for sewage treatment in the Clonmel scheme?  There was no fixed proposal (what is a fixed proposal?) but the matter was under review (at what stage in an effluent discharge or housing scheme is potential pollution under review?)</P>
    <P>It was then put to Mr. Collins that surely Clonmel Corporation would not contemplate putting raw untreated sewage into a river and he replied: &ldquo;Taking into consideration the amount of sewage which will be discharged and the condition of the river at this point, it will have no deleterious effect on the river.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And we are left to assume that the eventual discharge from 800 (repeat 800) houses will have no effect on the River Suir.</P>
    <P>As things stand about pollution and possible pollution in this country today, the following organisations should make tracks for Clonmel without delay: the local fishery board, the Department of Fisheries, An Foras Forbartha (which contains a brand new water sampling service), the Agricultural Institute, the Department <Col N="1034" /> of Health and several others.  Protest meetings have been called here for things of much less importance.</P>
    <P>A Parliamentary Question was submitted by me on 12th May to which the Minister for Local Government replied.  He gave me a rather woolly reply but he was not able to comment on what effect the discharge of untreated sewage would have on the fish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was submitted on 12th May.  About that time a notice of motion was submitted by me to the local council in Clonmel that the council should take every step open to them to see that the discharge of sewage would not continue into the Suir pending further investigation.  On 29th May an article appeared in the <i>Clonmel Nationalist</i> from the country manager who is also manager to the Clonmel Corporation, apparently jettisoning completely the opinions offered by the corporation.  It took one month after the story broke in the <i>Nationalist</i>, an article on 17th, a Parliamentary Question by me and a notice of motion by me to force our county manager to do his duty and publicly to repudiate his stand in relation to the discharge of untreated sewage into the Suir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that a manager who is on his job and who is paying full attention to what is happening in the public authorities under his administrative <Col N="1035" /> control presents a very sorry picture when he has to backtrack on a decision taken by his corporation to go to the courts to take action in this matter.  It is a reflection not alone on the manager but on the Department of Local Government and the Minister who allowed this kind of thing to develop.  It took one whole month before the public became aware that an attempt was being made to rectify something that never should have happened.</P>
    <P>One final point I should like to raise&mdash;I am sure there are many things I have forgotten&mdash;is the question of public relations in general between local authorities and the community.  I have raised this in the House before and I have raised it at county council level.  I speak of the question of an annual report being prepared and issued by each local authority, certainly by the larger corporations and county councils.  It is very bad business to find local authorities spending up to £3 million per year and no annual report available to the public, to research workers and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Several do issue reports&mdash;Donegal County Council, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Parliamentary Secretary would be in agreement that this is something that should be done, even for the benefit of council members who might wish to refresh their memories on expenditure or on decisions taken two or three years previously. It would also help officials to have under one cover the main facets of a council's activities.  I asked my council two years ago to have such a report.  Some steps were taken but a report has not appeared yet.  The last reply I got was that as the health services were being removed from local authority control the council would defer the issue of a report until that had been completed.  Then the job would be tidier and somewhat easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now exhort the Minister to get those people off their backsides to do something.  I strongly exhort him to urge local authorities to prepare and to issue annual reports.  It may well <Col N="1036" /> be that An Foras Forbartha, where all the talent is, might be able to frame or devise some annual report formula which might be followed by local authorities from year to year.  The type of report produced by Donegal County Council may serve as an example which other county councils could follow depending on local circumstances.  I would strongly urge the Minister to use his good offices to try to get local authorities to give an account of their stewardship in the form of an annual report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before the Minister for Local Government concluded his marathon speech he was complimented by his colleague Deputy Patrick Burke who said, &ldquo;The Minister has made history in the House with the longest address ever&rdquo;.  This was said before the Minister had even concluded his speech when Question Time intervened.  The Minister recommenced his speech after Question Time and continued for a much longer duration. Never then in the history of this House did a Minister take so long to say so very little.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech, stripped of the verbiage, the padding and the gobble-degook of his conservative Department, does not represent one progressive thought and does not obtain the long-awaited intimation of a breakthrough in the resolution of the housing scandal.  It does not convey one iota of hope to the many thousands of homeless that the long purgatory of waiting will be ended for them very soon.  This was all the more lamentable because we have had a change of Minister for Local Government.  We had the appointment of a young, certainly energetic and, one expected, able Minister in the person of Deputy Robert Molloy.  We had been used to the intransigence of Mr. Boland, who as a Minister, despite the best endeavours of those of us on this side of the House to move him, was unbending and unyielding. When this welcome change came about many of us expected Deputy Molloy would bring energy and dynamism to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's speech is indicative of anything it represents merely a continuation <Col N="1037" /> of the ultra-conservatism of the Department of Local Government: no change in policy, no change in outlook. Under this Minister the stultifying, indolent, dead hand of the Department lies as heavily as ever on all our local authorities.  Instead of assisting, stimulating and co-ordinating the effort of the local authorities the brakes are on as never before&mdash;stultifying, inhibiting and stifling progress by all the various devices that only the Department of Local Government is proficient in.</P>
    <P>One would imagine the Minister for Local Government would have recognised that he inherited a sorry legacy from his predecessor, Mr. Boland. Under various Fianna Fáil Ministers for Local Government we have won for ourselves the worst record in respect of housing in Europe.  Independent surveys carried out in recent times prove conclusively that we have the lowest output of houses per 1,000 of the population and as a percentage of gross national product we spend less on this essential service than any other country in Europe with the exception of Britain.  Is it not also a fact that these independent surveys revealed that we have the lowest useful floor space in respect of the provision of housing than any other country in Europe and that we have the second lowest stock of houses per 1,000 of the population after Spain?  This is a dismal record. I could go on to say that our record in house building is such that for every 100 new houses completed by us we lose an average of 47, which is more than any other country in Europe.  In this modern age only half the houses have laid on to them proper sanitary services such as piped water and flushed toilets, not to mention the luxury of a bath.</P>
    <P>Here was a golden opportunity for this young, energetic Minister to grapple effectively with this great social evil and help us to make the necessary breakthrough but there is nothing in his speech to indicate that the slow rate of house building will be accelerated; there is nothing in his speech to indicate effective controls in respect of the rising cost of land for development <Col N="1038" /> and house building purposes; and there is nothing in his speech to indicate to the many hundreds of thousands of aggrieved tenants that they will get a better deal in respect of a fair and more humane differential rent system.  There is nothing to stop the continuation of the rackrent charges in this city and in many towns all over the country.  There is nothing to indicate some amelioration in the crushing burden of rates or abolition of the anomalies in ground rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to the very important issue of local government is pathetic.  Costs, on his own admission, in respect of house building in recent years, have increased astronomically. The Minister has stated that within the past three years the cost of the average local authority house has increased by 30 per cent.  Here is damning evidence of rampant inflation, and no effort whatsoever is made to control it.  It must be appreciated that the shocking increase in the price of land and house building generally is paid for by the council and the corporation tenants, by the newly-weds, who are striving desparately to provide homes of their own.  It is disgraceful for any Government to allow this type of exploitation to continue in respect of this essential service of housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister condones this racket and he is doing nothing to deal effectively with the racket in respect of spiralling land costs.  In last night's evening paper we saw where the price of land for house development in Kildare is £3,000 per acre.  We are paying 10 per cent in interest charges for the essential service of housing. This service, under Fianna Fáil, has been made the plaything of the profiteers, the moneylenders, the racketeers and the Tacateers of this country. Is it any wonder we have widespread indignation in respect of the scandalous price of rents, the cost of sites and the repayment of loans?</P>
    <P>I am very glad I am not a party to a regime which allows this racket in respect of housing to continue.  Unfortunately it will continue as long as Fianna Fáil remain in office and our people will continue to be exploited <Col N="1039" /> in the matter of rents, interest charges, the price of land and many of our people will be compelled to live in in-human and deplorable housing conditions. The dead hand of the Department of Local Government is leaning harder than ever before on the people of this country and local authorities are not being helped to accelerate the housing drive.</P>
    <P>One of the most nauseating aspects of the Minister's speech and the attitude of his Department is the credit he takes for the normal advances which have been made in respect of house building generally.  He counts not merely the houses built by local authorities but the houses built by individual effort when he states the number of houses which have been built.  He has told us that two out of every three houses built in recent times have been built for private purchase. He seeks to imply from these figures that this is because of the opulence and the high standard of living in this country, that people are now so well off that more and more are able to build homes of their own.  This is a shabby pretence.  It merely means that the local authorities are failing to provide homes for our people and that more and more people are being forced, whether they like it or not, to find ways and means of providing their own homes.  We know that many young married couples, rather than wait four, five, six and seven years until local authorities can house them, are forced to take the gamble of building their own homes.  We know they are taking on financial responsibilities which they are unable to cope with and life is proving miserable for thousands of private home dwellers by reason of the colossal repayments which they are obliged to make weekly or monthly for the outlay involved.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the provision of a home of one's own, no matter how menial it is, involves the repayment of £30 and possibly £40 a month.  One requires a very substantial salary to take on that type of financial burden but we know many people are forced to take on this gamble.  They hope by <Col N="1040" /> some means, when their children grow up in the years to come, that they will be able to cope with this financial burden.  When the Minister implies that it is relatively easy to provide a home of one's own in this country at the present time he is making a mockery out of the suffering of these people.  I am not talking about the ordinary working class people, who are condemned under this system to the long purgatory of waiting, condemned in this city to remain in foul, evil-smelling, rat-infested flats for seven or eight years until they are rehoused by an indolent and dilatory authority. Many thousands are obliged to live in dilapidated homes lacking any modern amenity in villages and towns throughout the country while they wait to be rehoused.  I am speaking of the new house purchasers, the white collar worker, the artisan and the tradesman who are taking the supreme gamble in providing homes for themselves in present circumstances.  In this House I am pointing out the tremendous handicap it is for such people to try to meet the commitments to the exploiters and extortioners.  Those of us in the Labour Party in particular call for a radical change in the housing policy.  This is wholly justified from any standpoint. There is a dire need for it on the grounds of morality as well as on the grounds of social justice.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret that the Minister, Deputy Molloy, did not rise to the occasion when he made his marathon speech and did not give us some semblance of progressive legislation to deal effectively with this problem. In order to conserve the very limited amount of capital available to him the Minister is embarking on what he considers to be a number of gimmicks, many of them fraught with very serious repercussions for our people, especially those awaiting re-housing. In recent times we have had this notion of a low-cost housing scheme.  The Minister has been considering this issue for some months past in a desire to arrive at some form of economy and efficiency in housing costs.  When replying the Minister might outline to us in detail what he <Col N="1041" /> and his Department have achieved in respect of a proper type of low-cost housing unit which, on the one hand, would provide modern amenities of life and durability and, on the other hand, worthwhile reduction in cost reflected in the rent or interest charges, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>My impression is that the Minister has had many submissions made to him in respect of this cheaper type of house, this prototype or industrial unit-type house or prefab&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;but the overall picture is that no matter what type of house is likely to be available on the Irish market unfortunately there is very little difference in the cost of such house and the cost of the traditional type of house.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether this is true or false.  The Minister might tell us what progress is being made by An Foras Forbartha or the experts in house design with a view to reducing costs.  A final decision on low-cost housing as such is an urgent necessity. Local authorities have delayed and in some instances have set aside plans for meeting urgent housing needs in anticipation of a decision by the Minister on the low-cost housing scheme.  They have not as yet received a decision in this important matter. Plans have been held up and the Minister has been responsible for this.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that what I say is true and that the Minister's indifference to this matter is such that he had the audacity to refer me in answer to a Parliamentary Question, to the answer given to a previous question asked by Deputy Moore.  The Minister had not the courtesy to tell me about the cost of low-cost housing, as such. We want facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for my party on this fundamental issue I can say that we all desire to see economies effected in housing costs in this country.  These economies are badly needed having regard to the exploitation which is rampant in land and building charges and the exorbitant interest rates.  There is need to economise in order to bring down costs urgently, but we do not <Col N="1042" /> want to see economies effected at the expense of essential amenities in the modern home.  Our people are entitled to the best standards of housing in the world.  We would be concerned about any cutback in the standard of workmanship, of equipment, of amenities or of the life or comfort of those houses. The Minister's attitude in this respect is worrying.  Already he has adopted a policy of increasing grants for the smaller type houses and discontinuing grants altogether in respect of the larger type houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the tendency to force lower standard houses on our people.  The Minister is on record as saying that what he is aiming at is the cheaper type of house that will not last as long as the traditional type.  Having <Col N="1043" /> regard to the charges for money and the differential rent system we have here, our people must be entitled to nothing but the best.  Therefore, we will not tolerate any reduction in standards.</P>
      <P>We are concerned also about the building industry in so far as the provision of work is concerned.  Can the Minister say how the building of these lower cost houses will affect employment in the building industry in respect of tradesmen, labourers and so on?  Is it not a fact that the type of prefabricated dwellings which the Minister has in mind can be erected within a matter of days or, at the most, a matter of weeks as against the months or even years that would be involved in the erection of the traditional type scheme, depending on number and so on? Involved here are fundamental issues. The person who pays the piper in the matter of housing should be entitled to call the tune and before the Minister or his Department seek to impose their will on local authorities in respect of low cost housing of the prototype he has in mind, we should see to it, as a matter of courtesy, that those people who are waiting to be rehoused should be consulted as to their views on the dogbox or prefabricated house.  We must know exactly what we are getting in terms of structure, longevity and cost.  I am sure that the many submissions made to the Minister indicated clearly that there is relatively little difference in the actual cost of houses of this type and the traditional type.  The only appreciable difference is in respect of high rise flats and the multiple type houses.  In this respect economies may be effected but so far as the ordinary structure or cottage type house is concerned there is no appreciable difference in respect of cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I should welcome a comprehensive statement from the Minister and the fullest information in respect of exactly what is happening in this important matter.  This is a radical change in housing policy.  It is getting away altogether from the traditional type of house and the utilisation instead of the more modern prefabricated <Col N="1044" /> structure.  Our people must be informed fully and as early as possible of what the Minister and his Department are letting them in for.  I am asking, respectfully, that the Minister take the opportunity of supplying us this information when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that prevarications on the part of the Minister are causing undue delay for all our housing authorities.  Plans are being deferred pending positive statements of policy from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am merely asking the Minister to make up his mind on this issue and let us know what is the position. I am sorry that in respect of assistance for the acceleration of the housing drive generally, the Minister has not seen fit to give anything in the nature of special assistance to the cooperative <Col N="1045" /> groups that have been so active in so many parts of the country. Such co-operative efforts are worthy of the approval and active support of the Department and there is no reason whatever, if we are sincere in seeking this worthwhile breakthrough in housing, why special assistance should not be given to co-operative effort.  I would ask the Minister to look again at that situation because co-operative effort can do much to take housing out of the ambit of speculators and relieve the burden of responsibility on local authorities and provide that much-needed self-help which we all applaud.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that a new national code of building regulations is to be introduced, and, again, we would be grateful for any further information the Minister can give us on this important matter.</P>
      <P>Recently I clashed with the Minister on the question of differential rents.  I have adverted to the differential rents system in this House on very many occasions; in fact, I would be surprised if I did not advert to it on every occasion I rose to speak on an Estimate for Local Government or anything else appertaining to local government.  I merely reiterated my sentiments in this regard on 8th May last.  I have been absolutely consistent in my condemnation of the administration of the differential rents system.  I do not mind receiving a hard-hitting reply from any political opponent; we ought to be used to that as politicians.  However, I am entitled to resent deeply the manner in which the Minister sought to misrepresent my views on the differential rents system in the reply to my statement which he issued on 11th May. The Minister chose to quote me out of context.  He picked a short statement from my speech in this House on 29th September, 1966, without reference to my overall remarks on this matter of differential rents, what I said before and after this particular quotation, and misrepresented me altogether.  The Minister's statement is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Molloy said that when Deputy Treacy spoke in the Dáil on 29th September, 1966, he said: &ldquo;I agree with the principle of differential rents.  This is a principle for <Col N="1046" /> which the Labour Party, in the main, have been responsible.&rdquo;  The Deputy added: &ldquo;This is a good Christian principle to which to adhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to quote&mdash;it is unusual for a Minister to adopt this shabby kind of tactic&mdash;from my speech in this House of 7th October, 1967, in which I condemned the differential rents system pretty trenchantly, as I normally do:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party representatives have consistently opposed the whole idea of a graded rents system on the grounds that it was unfair, inequitable and unjust.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to taunt me that it was time my bluff was called and said that I was notorious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, May of this year, 1971.  This is the speech I made on 8th May last to which the Minister replied alleging inconsistency in my remarks during various debates ranging back over a number of years.  I said the differential rents system:</P>
      <P>was primarily intended to ensure that in cases of unemployment, sickness or any other hardship resulting in a drop in a tenant's income the tenant paying a differential rent could remain on a lesser rent until his circumstances improved.  This was the scheme that ensured that thousands of unemployed would have at least a roof over their head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I went on to say:</P>
    <P>This is in keeping with the beliefs of Connolly and Larkin, for was it not the latter who preached the necessity for such a scheme?</P>
    <P>Again, I said in my speech on that occasion:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are 100 per cent behind the concept of a differential rents scheme.  Indeed it was the Labour Party who introduced the implementation of differential rents in this State.</P>
    <P>I have always been in the forefront of Labour spokesmen who claim full credit for the principle, the noble principle of differential rents.  However, I have been particularly trenchant in my attacks on the administration of that system, the odious means test, the rackrenting system it has turned out to be in the hands of the Minister and his Department.  There is nothing inconsistent about what I said either then or now.  The Minister might have had the decency to read in full the speech of 29th September, 1966, in which he quotes me as saying:</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of differential rents.  This is a principle for which the Labour Party, in the main, have been responsible.... This is a good Christian principle to which to adhere.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or his advisers who misrepresented me on that occasion had gone through my speech they would have seen that most of that speech, which was probably about 2½ hours in length, was trenchant and vitriolic in its denunciation of the administration of differential rents.  To quote me out of context like that was grossly unfair and unbecoming a Minister, especially in a cold calculated speech outside this House.  I do not want to bore the House with repetition of my speeches in the past, but I feel that in order to counteract the unfair tactics of the Minister and his advisers I must place some of my statements on record.  In 1966 I referred at length to differential rents.  I shall quote from column 347 of the Official Report of 29th September, 1966, which the Minister conveniently ignored.  I said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> I want to refer to the controversial matter of rents.  The impression which the Minister created in his statement to the House is that while he admonishes local authorities to rationalise their rent policy, as he calls it, he trys to convey that no hardship would accrue from this and that the policy is designed to help the poor, the needy and the aged and all under-privileged sections and to ensure that no one will be denied a house because of inability to pay rent.  All this sort of soft soap had been rubbed in by the Minister in rare abundance and by his spokesmen inside and outside the House but the fact is that in issuing his booklet &ldquo;Housing Progress and Prospects&rdquo; the Minister issued a clarion call to all housing authorities and county and city managers to rationalise rents, to raise rents, and this policy has been embarked on and in the case of many authorities it is now a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>Not only did the Minister virtually direct local authorities to increase rents but he threatened them if they did not do so.  He issued a circular on 30th March, 1966, entitled &ldquo;Modification of the Deficit Principle; Review of Rents&rdquo; to all local authorities.  He explains this deficit principle.  I am quoting from circular No. H3/66 from the Department of Local Government which is unsigned.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to the Minister for Local Government that the arrangement known as the deficit principle has deterred some local authorities from reviewing the rents of their housing estates as a whole.  Under the deficit principle, if the loss on a housing scheme after taking all rents into account is less than the amount of the State subsidy due for the scheme, the subsidy is reduced by the Government.  This means that in some cases, particularly in the case of older schemes, the Exchequer and not the local authority gets the benefit of rent increases.</P>
    <P>I went on to quote that circular at great length and to say how the housing authorities to my knowledge interpreted that circular.  They interpreted <Col N="1049" /> it as a direct threat by the then Minister and the Department to rationalise, to increase rents forthwith or otherwise this essential housing subsidy would be withdrawn.  It is a very long speech on rents and the more I look at it the more despicable I regard it that the Minister should pick out one snippet in which I lauded the principle and failed to recognise the castigation I made of the system itself and the manner in which it is being administered. These are unfair tactics and if Deputy Molloy or anybody else wants to play that game with me they are welcome to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister.  If the differential rents system is all that the Minister, Deputy Molloy, and his Department claim it to be, in terms of fairness and justice, how is it that over half a million tenants are up in arms, are in revolt against the system&mdash;an odious system, a rackrenting system, a system which leans so heavily upon all of them?  How is it that we have rent strikes and a national movement? How is it that we have threats of eviction in so many parts of this country if this system is all it is cracked up to be by the Minister?</P>
      <P>There are fundamental defects in the differential rents system and they must be faced up to and remedied.  The rent should be assessed on a fixed percentage of the tenant's income only.  We believe that the rent assessment should automatically exclude all overtime, shift money and incentive bonuses and that it should also automatically exclude the earnings of all other members of a dwelling.  There are many other factors which I should like to go into in detail but primarily there is this ingrained distaste for and abhorrence of the system because of the attitude of mind of certain local officers who administer the scheme and the overall directive and attitude of mind of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any system which makes inroads into the privacy of family life, as this system does, is wrong, is socially unjust and unwise.  The system involves prying <Col N="1050" /> and probing into the private and intimate affairs of family life&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>But in your system you suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and is resented as such.  I suggest a more humane approach.  I suggest an approach towards the graded or differential rents system which will have due regard to the dignity of the human person and the sanctity and privacy of family life. I suggest that the Gestapo tactics should end, that employers should not be permitted to reveal the family income, that children should not be harrassed or their employers, that it is intrinsically wrong to take the whole family income into account.  Knowing human nature for what it is, children tend to look after themselves as well as they can in these modern times in terms of clothing, of enjoyment, perhaps, drinking and smoking and the like.  To regard their income as an integral part of the family income is simply wrong.</P>
      <P>The whole approach and attitude of the Minister is to extract all he can from the working class people.  The system is unfair also from the point of view that subsidisation of housing is an accepted thing in this country and, indeed, in most other countries.  All sections of our people are subsidised in respect of the provision of housing. The large farmer, the large industrialist, as much as the ordinary working class person, avails of grants for the purpose of building a home.  In the application of a differential rent, applied by the Minister and the local authority, the economic rent of that house applies in respect of the maximum rent and in determining the maximum rent that dwelling is deliberately stripped of the State subsidy which is enjoyed in the initial stages.  The State subsidy is taken away.  The economic rent is applied and the maximum is based on that economic rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect is the fact that the Department are using the differential rents system not as a means of reducing hardship on the sick, the aged and the unemployed, but primarily as a revenue-raising device to buttress the <Col N="1051" /> rates in local authority areas and to conserve money, admittedly limited money, in the Department.  The Minister was fair enough in his approach to this matter when he talked about the subsidisation of local authority houses and intimated his belief that this cannot continue, that those who allegedly can pay must pay and that subsidisation will cease.  This deliberately discriminatory approach to the withdrawal of subsidies applies only to the ordinary working-class people in council houses.  There is no suggestion at all of withdrawing subsidies from any other category of persons.</P>
    <P>This is the attitude of the Department which has bedevilled the differential rents system.  The attitude of the Department and the Minister is that the ordinary working-class people are getting away with something in relation to housing.  That is a reflection on them by officialdom: that they are being subsidised, that they are getting away with something, that they could, and should, be paying more as if these people were not already taxpayers and ratepayers.  The housing accommodation provided in most instances for them is of a most antiquated type.  The policy now is to force all tenants over to the differential rents system.  The tenants who were on fixed rents have had their agreements torn up literally by the Minister and they are being forced over to differential rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

      <P>They are caught up in the mesh of the differential rents system and their rents have increased three, four and five times over for accommodation which, in modern terms, could be regarded as primitive. Many of these pre-war houses do not contain a bathroom and invariably the toilet is outside the house.  We make no apology for condemning this system and calling for redress and a more <Col N="1052" /> humane and dignified approach to it. In yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> we see that a long list of tenants of urban authorities are up in arms over the administration of the differential rents system.</P>

      <P>It is stated in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> that in Limerick they are about to take action for the ejectment of tenants.  The battering ram, the bailiff and the bum are being used on corporation tenants in Limerick on this issue.  Many parts of County Louth, Drogheda and Dundalk and other places are mentioned.  In Kilkenny the differential rents committee are taking appropriate action to defend themselves against bureaucracy. In Tullamore, Edenderry and other places in County Offaly the NATO committee is active, that is, the National Association of Tenants Organisation.</P>

      <P>In Dublin there is a variety of these committees agitating to defend tenants' rights.  I believe that the agitation in respect of tenants' rights is as keen, as virile and as determined today as it was in Davitt's day. We have the same overbearing, rackrenting system backed up by the law now, seemingly, of the bailiff and the <Col N="1053" /> bum.  I believe that evictions are about to take place.  The Minister simply cannot brush this under the carpet and ignore it.  This is a natural, spontaneous outburst of indignation by our tenants. The Parliamentary Secretary can count them any way he likes but there are thousands of them.</P>

      <P>As a member of a local authority, I know the position.  In my county up to three or four years ago we provided excellent council cottages for our people, quite modern, with bathroom, toilet and water laid on, at a basic rent of 10s plus rates of 10s, that is, £1 per week, inclusive of rates. Under the differential rents system we are providing very largely the same kind of accommodation and the maximum rent is £6 per week, and that does not include rates.  There is no use in seeking to pretend that all is well with the rent system and the method of funding and financing housing.  We hope for a more rational and logical approach to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Minister is resorting to an element of gimmickry in order to save costs.  This is graphically displayed in a circular which emanated from the Department, Circular H.209/40/3 of 19 March, 1971. It is addressed to the county manager on behalf of the Minister and his <Col N="1054" /> Department.  I need not read it all but it is a most revealing document.  It is a pathetic document.  It displays graphically the inability of the Minister and his Department to cope with rising costs and their indolence.  I will now tell the House the suggestion contained in this circular as to how costs might be reduced.  It is stated:</P>
    <P>The cost of financing the projected local authority programme on the basis of the present system of raising loans which are repayable over a period of 50 years has been under examination and has been compared with the cost if the borrowing period were reduced to 35 years.</P>
    <P>It goes on:</P>
    <P>In this connection, graphs, copies of which are attached for your information, have been prepared showing the annual loan charges on a loan of £3,000 repayable over periods of 20 to 50 years at interest rates varying from 6½ per cent to 10½ per cent and the total amounts repaid in respect of a similar loan over various repayment periods.</P>
    <P>Repayments on a local authority house built in 1969-70, costing £3,200, financed by a 50 year loan at the current rate of interest, are calculated to be £276.3 a year.  Were the loan period 35 years, the repayments would be £287.6 a year.  Thus the 50 year loan requires repayments for the house of £13,815 while the repayments on the 35 year loan would only total £10,066.  In other words, to save £11 per year in the 35 year period a sum of £276 per year is paid out each year for an additional 15 years.</P>
    <P>The puny recommendation here is that local authorities ought to opt for the shorter loan term of 35 years in order to save a few pounds, but the principle of extortion and exploitation by the moneylenders is the same.  This is a revealing paragraph.  On the Minister's own figures he tells us that having borrowed £3,200, which is the average cost of a local authority house now we pay back £13,815 to the moneylenders over 50 years.  Four times the amount we borrow we pay back the moneylenders for this council cottage. <Col N="1055" /> Now he wants us to economise and take the 35 year loan instead.  Watch what happens here.  We borrow £3,200 over 35 years as recommended and we pay back £10,066, over three times the amount of money borrowed originally.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful admission on the part of a helpless and indolent Minister caught up in this capitalistic mesh of exploitation.  Instead of taking steps to make cheap money available for this essential service of housing, not at 10½ per cent but perhaps at half that amount, he is condoning the continuation of the capitalistic system of exploitation under which for every pound we borrow for house building we pay back £4 to the moneylenders over the normal period of repayment. It is all right for the Minister to be indifferent and complacent about this but it is our people who suffer, our council tenants, our new house builders. These are the people who are scourged by the system.  Is it any wonder then that we have tenants up in arms?  Is it any wonder that we have so many thousands of people still waiting for houses?</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Department's policy which is overbearing and unjust is in regard to the sale of local authority houses.  Heretofore council and corporation tenants were permitted by law to vest or purchase their homes on the basis of the price fixed by the local authority, which invariably approximated to the original cost of the house.  That concession has been withdrawn on the instruction of the Minister and the Department and now tenants purchase their homes under very different terms, terms which are far more rigorous.  Instead of the original price they will pay what is regarded as the present day value of the house, the value an auctioneer would put on it.  There are small concessions in regard to the tenancy of the houses but this concession applies&mdash; I am subject to correction here&mdash;to the tenant who was originally appointed and does not seem to be applicable to the next-of-kin, the sons, daughters or close relatives of the tenant.  This is unfair.  There is also the stipulation that if tenants of council houses dispose <Col N="1056" /> of their interest in the property they are obliged by law to repay one-third of the cost to the local authority &mdash;one-third of the money they secure for selling their cottage must be refunded to the local authority.  Some genius in the Department of Local Government is conjuring up these ideas and has his hand deep down in the pockets of non-vested and vested tenants, extracting the last halfpenny from them.  This would not happen in respect of private property.  The whole approach of the Minister and his Department is to treat these tenants as serfs who are there to be exploited and to wring out of them all the revenue they can on every possible occasion.</P>
    <P>There was nothing in the Minister's speech which gives any hope of a change in the rating system.  We are aware that the burden of rates has made it impossible for local authorities to cope and in some cases rather than impose what they believe to be an intolerable burden on their people they prefer that the local authority be abolished.  It is a sad state of affairs that our capital city is bereft of its mayor and municipal authority.  The voice of the elected representatives is no longer heard in Dublin.  The local authority was abolished by the former Minister for Local Government, Mr. Boland, because the members had the temerity to decry a system which was having such a deleterious effect on business and on the people of the city.  There is no move being made to bring back the voice of democracy in Dublin.  There is a commissioner, or perhaps I should say a commissar, in charge of the affairs of this metropolis.  More than 500,000 people are being controlled by one man and the voice of democracy on the rates issue is silenced.</P>
    <P>There was the possibility that the same fate lay in store for Wexford, Waterford and councils in other areas. Due to the unwillingness or the inability of central government to come to their aid, many local authorities may find it impossible to carry on.  It is no wonder that they tend to prefer abolition.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell us what <Col N="1057" /> is being done in regard to having a substitute for the present rating system. He should tell us what he thinks of the various suggestions being made for local methods of taxation, whether by way of income tax, sur-tax or purchase tax.  It is essential that an alternative method be found.  In the mean-time it would be beneficial if the impost of the health services were removed. This would give some temporary relief, pending a more effective solution.</P>
    <P>I shall not say much about the White Paper on local government because we are all awaiting the reactions of our various county councils, urban authorities and corporations.  Many have made known their views but others have yet to do so.  The Minister is seeking to bring about a radical change in a system which has been in operation for the last 50 years.  He should not rush things unduly.  There is much heart searching regarding the wisdom of abolishing local authorities&mdash;the town commissioners, the urban authorities and some borough authorities.  It is true that some of them are so small that they have not the necessary finance to provide essential services but it is also true that many others, though small, have done a magnificent job. They have been dedicated and conscientious, they have been in the forefront of the housing drive and, within their limited resources, they have given a good account of themselves.</P>
    <P>We will have a further opportunity of dealing with this matter in detail but my initial reaction to the main proposals in the White Paper was not favourable, especially with regard to the establishment of local community councils and area committees.  They will be a poor substitute for the town commissioners, the urban councils or the borough authorities.  The latter had a certain status and autonomy and, above all, they were democratically elected by the people of the area.  This cannot be said of the area committees or the local community councils.  These bodies could comprise some kind of junta, appointed by faceless people.  It can never be said that they are representative of the people.</P>
    <P>These new bodies will not have any statutory authority, unlike the bodies <Col N="1058" /> they replace.  They will be able to make recommendations to the county council but that is a far cry from having an effective voice in the administration of affairs.  It is a movement away from democracy and effective local government. One wonders why the Minister stopped short at county boundaries, why he did not seek to have wider administrative areas, perhaps following the lines of demarcation laid down by the regional health authorities and the area tourist boards.  In any event, we await the reaction of our various authorities but the Minister's timetable to have views and reports by the end of this month is rushing unduly this important matter.</P>
    <P>I wish him well in his apparent belief that he will have everything in readiness and the new areas established in time for the local elections next year, but I cannot see a hope of all these things being done in the limited time available.  It would, indeed, be very dangerous to rush this. Those of us who are members of local authorities appreciate that we are not losing very much because the effective powers vested in us are very limited. The only really effective power we possess is the striking of the rate and, if we do not strike the rate laid down by the county manager for the maintenance of essential services, we are abolished.  We have, too, the power to appoint rate collectors.  Under section 55 of the Local Government Act, section 4 of the County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, we have the power to direct the manager to do a specific thing.  But, in the last analysis, it is the county manager and the Minister who are in sole control.  Members of local authorities are mere puppets. The county managers have wide dictatorial powers.  As Deputy Hogan said, some of them exercise these powers in such fashion as to be both overbearing and disrespectful towards the members of local authorities.  I do not wish my remarks now to be attributed in any way to our existing county manager, Mr. Robert Hayes; he has been only a short time with us. I do not wish my views on the county management system, as such to be construed as reflecting upon him or, <Col N="1059" /> indeed, upon any existing county manager in my area.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of essential powers from local authority members has had a very bad effect.  It has brought about a lowering of morale in local authority areas.  There is a certain cynicism; young people believe it is not worth while being members of these bodies and there is a reluctance on the part of young men and women, anxious to serve their community, to come forward and put themselves up for election in order to serve their fellowmen and women.  There is a marked reluctance to do this because members of local authorities have been stripped of any worthwhile autonomy and authority by successive Ministers for Local Government.  We have had imposed upon us a virtual dictatorship, a tyranny battening on the lives of our people.</P>
    <P>I do not see any suggestion in the White Paper on re-organisation to improve that situation.  On the contrary, there will be a worsening of the situation. There is the suggestion of community councils and committees.  These will be purely advisory.  They will be selected rather than elected.  God help them.  Little and all as are the powers we possess as members of local authorities, they will have none at all.  They will be completely at the mercy of local bureaucracy.  If this is supposed to be a strengthening of the local government system the Minister will have a great deal of convincing to do.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal in depth with the subject because we will have other opportunities.  I have pretty strong views on all this.  My main appeal to the Minister is not to worsen what is already a very bad situation from the point of view of morale.  I appeal to him not to rush this.  Let it sink in.  Let it be thought over in depth and in detail.  Let the reactions come back to the Minister slowly, if necessary, but let him not try to tear down in three months that which it took 50 years to create.  If he does that I am very fearful of the kind of system we shall have. It would be a blow against demacracy to create further cynicism, further disrespect <Col N="1060" /> and further disregard for democracy and local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all commend the Minister's efforts to eliminate death and danger from our roads.  There is one particular problem to which I wish to refer and that is the problem of straying animals.  There seems to be no effective remedy.  We all know of the many tragedies which have resulted from straying animals on the roads. Without being disrespectful to anyone, least of all the farming community, I think the man who lets his animals stray upon the road of set and deliberate purpose is doing a criminally dangerous act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strenuous efforts should be made to prevent this gross irresponsibility resulting in damage, death and destruction. I am sure the Minister has given serious thought to what further steps he can take to ensure that livestock are properly fenced in along main thoroughfares and that fencing defects are expeditiously dealt with.  We have rules governing the cutting of hedges to ensure scenic beauty; I think it is far more important to ensure that animals are properly fenced in. <Col N="1061" /> Itinerant or straying animals should be quickly impounded.  If necessary we should have legislation rendering it more difficult for animals to be allowed to stray on main roads causing such a tremendous hazard to all using the highways.</P>
    <P>The danger and the annoyance of loose chippings on roads were brought forcibly to my notice recently.  I do not know if there is any record of the number of windscreens broken as a result of flying chippings but this is a matter of growing concern to motorists. I am not reflecting on the work done by council machinery operators or labourers but it is wrong that there should be so little redress for a motorist who suffers damage as a result of flying chippings breaking a windscreen or denting bodywork.  Is it not a fact that county councils will not accept liability for damage to cars in this way? Motorists are rather reluctant for relatively small amounts involved to claim against their insurance companies for such damage in case it would lead to premium increases.  There is clearly no redress here for motorists.  It is not good enough that the county council should be exonerated from all responsibility in respect of damage caused by loose chippings merely because the council has a notice somewhere along the road saying: &ldquo;Danger&mdash;Men at Work&rdquo; or &ldquo;Loose chippings&rdquo;.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of An Foras Forbartha to lay down conditions for roadmaking which will eliminate as far as possible incidents caused by flying chippings which are a serious hazard.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter and to tell us what can be done to eliminate this danger.</P>
    <P>Many flood points created on roads are due to negligence by council officers. Older road workers engaged on maintenance of roads knew every channel, culvert and drain intimately and regarded it as their responsibility and duty to keep such shores, culverts and drains open and clean so that when rain came flooding did not occur and the water drained away quickly.  We find, with modern roadmaking methods and the drop in the number of workers employed in roadmaking by councils, that flood points are <Col N="1062" /> neglected and, consequently, we have constant and recurring flooding, erosion of roadways and unnecessary damage.</P>
    <P>One of the most pleasing aspects of our efforts at road safety is the inauguration of the junior traffic warden.  I have seen the system on the Continent and I was very impressed.  I am glad that it is coming into vogue here and that many schools have taken up the idea of training young boys and girls as traffic wardens.  I am particularly proud that Carrick-on-Suir in my own constituency has adopted this method of school traffic control and that the children of the town will be playing their part in enlightening their colleagues and, indeed, the adults in the matter of road safety.</P>
    <P>There is one worrying aspect of this system and it is this: as alternatives are found, such as junior traffic wardens or paid school traffic wardens, the gardaí seem to take a lesser interest in this important field of traffic control and surveillance of children coming to and going from school.  We cannot allow the gardaí to opt out of their responsibility in this matter.  Provision of junior or senior school wardens is intended, I think, to supplement the gardaí rather than replace them and this is a matter that should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>I have had to express concern recently at the fall in the numbers employed by county councils, particularly in roadmaking.  More and more men are being replaced by machinery.  I am not a Luddite seeking to put back the clock or repudiate modern machinery but a special effort should be made when planning work schemes to ensure that as far as possible schemes shall be designed to provide maximum labour content.  This is not being done and in the interests of efficiency more men are being replaced by machines.  This may seem economically desirable but it is socially bad in rural Ireland where there is such a scarcity of jobs, so little alternative employment and where men look to the councils for work.  It is important that the Minister should keep in mind that in spending ratepayers' money we have an obligation to provide maximum employment.  In an undeveloped <Col N="1063" /> economy where we have some 70,000 unemployed we must not forget this important obligation and we should be slow to introduce the efficiency expert or the computer without regard to social considerations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has any observations to make on the statement of the British Under-Secretary for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to the House of Commons on May 27th that the Taoiseach's statement following the situation in Belfast on 20-21st May was unhelpful and did not amount to representations or an official message; and that the British Government did not accept the allegations which had been made against the troops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement issued on the 21st May said that the Government's concern about the events in Belfast on the 20th and the 21st May had been conveyed to the British authorities.  This expression of concern was made through diplomatic channels before the statement was issued.  The purpose of the statement was to inform the public that an expression of concern had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask whether, in view of the statement made by the British Under-Secretary for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Taoiseach's conveyance of his views through diplomatic channels amounted to representations or, seemingly, to an official message, and would the Tánaiste accept that the Taoiseach might take the opportunity of forwarding officially, directly, a communication to the British Government as an expression of our views concerning this statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that the views were <Col N="1065" /> conveyed through diplomatic channels. Further to that, there was a reasonably helpful discussion on the occasion of the last questions on this matter during which the Taoiseach accepted many of the Deputies' observations.  He said that these views would come to the attention of the British authorities.  In so far as the opinion of the British Under-Secretary for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is concerned, that is simply a matter of opinion, but it does not mean that the full force of the Government's views was not conveyed through diplomatic channels.  As I have already said, this was further confirmed in a debate on a number of supplementary questions in which everything the Taoiseach had said was fortified by Members of the House. The Taoiseach in most cases agreed with the observations of the Deputies wherever the contribution was helpful and wherever it would fortify the representations made to the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Tánaiste will agree that the British Under-Secretary gave quite an objectionable political push-off by stating that the communication of the Taoiseach, which now appears to have gone through diplomatic channels, did not amount to representations or to an official message.  So that the British Government will be under no illusions whatever as to the opinion of the Irish Government's views was not con-I suggest that this message should now be formally, officially, directly conveyed by the Taoiseach, if necessary to Mr. Heath himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy on behalf of the Taoiseach that all these matters which were the subject of the previous questions were conveyed to the British Government, and the fact that the British Under-Secretary thought that they were unhelpful does not mean there is not full contact with the British Government through diplomatic channels or that the British Government did not take full cognisance of the view expressed by the Taoiseach and by Deputies in the House.  The Deputy will have to take my word about that. <Col N="1066" /> There will be differences of opinion at least on some occasions as to statements made on either the British side or here in regard to matters of immediate importance in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put one final supplementary.  Surely the Tánaiste will accept that the statement made by the British Under-Secretary, a written statement in the House of Commons in reply to a question from the office of the Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs sector, was quite clearcut in its virtual rejection and it did not accept that the Irish Government had made any representations. I merely wish not to have our country treated in an offhand fashion by any British Under-Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it absolutely clear that no matter what the British Under-Secretary said, the views of the Taoiseach as expressed at that time still hold good, and he is supported by the House.  Surely the Deputy should accept that?  In any event there is nothing to indicate that the Taoiseach's reply was unhelpful in the light of events that have occurred since.</P>

      <P>In accordance with section 8 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, the yearly value of any advantage accruing to a person who is resident in a specified area of congestion from the use of land which is personally used or enjoyed by him is calculated for the purposes of unemployment assistance at the rate of £20 for every £1 of rateable valuation of the land and at a proportionate rate for any portion of a £1 of the valuation.  This provision applies to the person in question.  The rateable valuation of the land personally used or enjoyed by him is £21.50 &mdash;£18 of which relates to land owned and £3.50 to rented land.  His statutory means for unemployment assistance purposes are accordingly £430 a year or £8.30 a week.  This assessment has been confirmed on appeal.</P>

The deduction of the weekly rate of means assessed accordingly leaves him entitled to unemployment assistance at the rate of 20p a week.</P>
      <P>The rate of unemployment assistance, if any, to which an applicant is entitled depends on his area of residence, the size of his family and his means.  This applicant has been correctly dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that the contribution year for maternity benefit which operates from July to July is inequitable; that as a result there are certain cases where persons with more than 26 stamps are denied benefit; and if he will amend the present statutory regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>For certain benefits under the Social Welfare Acts there are two contribution conditions.  The first requires a minimum number of paid contributions since entry into insurance and the second requires a minimum number of paid or credited contributions in a recent complete contribution year.  For women this contribution year commences on the first Monday of July of each year.</P>
      <P>In the case of maternity benefit the first contribution test is that not less than 26 contributions have been paid since entry into insurance.  The second test requires not less than 26 contributions to have been paid or credited in the relevant governing contribution year.  Both contribution conditions must be satisfied.  I do not consider these conditions to be inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, even though some persons have more than the required contributions, because they do not fall within the period July to July, they are denied benefit while others, with possibly fewer contributions, can get benefit?  Would he consider amending the regulations to ensure that in this particular instance maternity benefit may not be denied to people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the anomaly the Deputy is referring to where the 26 contributions could be in two different contribution years and do not therefore fulfil one of the requirements for qualification.  But the Deputy will agree that when credits are permitted for the second condition it does put the claimant in an advantageous position in that she could have been signing for credits even though she was not employed.</P>

      <P>I have details of a case where a person who had been in <Col N="1072" /> employment, ceased work at some stage prior to the birth of the child and has more than the required number of contributions, but loses about £50 of the benefit because the year runs from July to July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that in the case cited there is an element of luck or chance in a person's entitlement to benefit?  A woman whose confinement is in May or June has no possible hope of qualifying for this benefit because in the case of her first confinement she cannot have 26 employment contributions paid subsequent to her marriage and prior to her retirement from work pending confinement, whereas if her confinement was in October or November she would be likely to qualify.  Surely that kind of position should not obtain? Where a person satisfies the conditions by having 26 contributions paid subsequent to marriage she should get her maternity benefit.  We should do away with this element of luck or chance; there is too much of it attached to the Department of Social Welfare regulations.</P>

I wrote to the Minister's Department recently, and I have just received a reply, about the case of a person who had almost seven years stamps prior to her marriage, did not claim any benefit when she did get married and did not claim benefit through ignorance, on the birth of her first child, but continued to work afterwards. Because she has 25 stamps in one year and did not have a stamp for the 26th week&mdash;simply because it happened to be Easter week and there was no work for her in that particular week&mdash;she is being denied benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the requirements set down in the Act as far back as 1955.  As I have stated in the House so often, until about that time there was no benefit for a married woman after marriage.  The case <Col N="1073" /> was frequently made that some provision should be made for those married women who were prepared to go back to work after marriage.  In order to meet the case the conditions were changed and considerably improved. It was made possible for them to get benefit if they had 26 stamps affixed and credits for the governing contribution year.  The Deputy is asking if we would consider further improving the regulation to provide that, no matter what time the 26 stamps were put on subsequent to marriage, they would still qualify.  I will have a look at that.</P>

      <P>Arising directly from this question and reply and one which was tabled yesterday, did anybody draw the Minister's attention to the advice given by &ldquo;The Experts&rdquo; in reply to queries in the <i>Evening Press</i>?  They gave as a reply to a question somewhat similar to this that the reason why this woman's claim was not determined in a reasonable way was that the Department of Social Welfare was overstaffed particularly with executive officers who were making all types of ridiculous regulations, hence the difficulty of the juniors in the office to implement these regulations and hence the woman's grievance.

      <P>A deputation from the college received in my Department on 26th February, 1971, presented proposals for the introduction as from autumn, 1972, of night courses additional to those already provided by the college, and it was indicated in a letter received subsequently from the college that the preparatory arrangements for this purpose which it would be necessary to make during the financial year 1971-72 would cost approximately £30,000.</P>
      <P>The annual State grant which the college receives for secular education is not earmarked for particular purposes.

Given the joint anxiety, which the Minister is supposed to <Col N="1078" /> share, for the establishment of increased night courses, is it not illogical to come here and defend the refusal of this paltry sum of £30,000 which would have enabled Trinity College to initiate these night courses?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to <Col N="1081" /> take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 19 and 20 together.  In making educational provision I must deal with factual not theoretical situations.  As I have pointed out in the House on numerous occasions I had to deal with the problem where in a number of smaller rural towns adequate provision could be made for the post-primary education of all the pupils only by building one school sufficiently large to provide a curriculum which would be broad enough to cater for varying degrees of aptitude and ability.  This would mean in effect in most of the areas concerned the discontinuing of three small existing schools and providing equitably for the interests which they represented.  Before arriving at any final proposals as to how one large community school might be established and managed I had before me the views of various bodies and gave the fullest consideration to these views.  I am satisfied that my proposals are those best calculated to provide a practical solution for the problem involved.</P>
      <P>I would have felt that the figures which I gave the House on 27th May would once and for all have stifled the efforts to introduce sectarianism into this matter.  I can only once more deplore these efforts.</P>
      <P>In applying the concept of community schools I could not agree that different patterns should be worked out in relation to different areas as appears to be envisaged in Question No. 19.  It will be a matter for the parents at the various local meetings to make known their views as to how their representatives for nomination to the board of management might be selected.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that views were available to him from all sources.  How can the Minister reconcile that statement with the fact that the Protestant minority have said that they have only recently received the document and have not yet had an opportunity of commenting on the proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out before, and I will have to do so again, <Col N="1082" /> that I met members of the Protestant community on many occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On this proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to deal with the factual situation, which does not appear to have any recognition from the Opposition benches.  The Deputies on those benches are much more inclined to build up a theoretical situation which appears very fanciful but which, in practice, will not work.  I met the representatives of the Protestant community on many occasions and they made it clear to me that they were anxious to have their children educated in schools conducted by members of their own faith.  This happened over a very considerable period and it was obvious to me that in framing these proposals the thing to do was to continue to help the Protestant minority in order to enable them to send their children to schools which were conducted by people of their own faith.  This has been the policy of this Government and it will continue to be our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many Protestants favour multidenominational education and that it is not correct to say that all Protestants want their children to be educated in purely Protestant schools? The proposals were not submitted to the Protestant school authorities until recently and the replies were not received by the Minister before he made his announcement.  The Minister has not yet received a response from these authorities with regard to their views on these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the Protestant community, no less than the members of the Catholic community, have made it clear to me and to my predecessors on many occasions that they wish to have their children educated in schools conducted by members of their own faith.  Surely the Deputy does not expect to be told that I have met all the Protestants and all the Catholics in the country.  I have to rely on the views expressed by representatives of the various sectors.  I have given my reasons for acting in the way <Col N="1083" /> I did, and it appears to me that what members of the Opposition would like to do is to hang some sort of sectarian label on me, but that will not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I still repeat what I said before and that is that the Minister is acting in a sectarian manner. Would the Minister agree now when his current proposals which are in issue have been rejected unanimously, as stated in Question No. 18, by the Church of Ireland Diocesan Synod in Clones, County Monaghan, that it is extremely unlikely that the Board of Education of the Church of Ireland will find them less unpalatable?  These proposals have been opposed by both Opposition parties and by the executive committee and many branches of the Vocational Teachers Organisation, by an overwhelming majority.  In fact, all the chief executive officers in this country who have spoken on the proposals have rejected them.  May I ask the Minister in the light of this overwhelming repudiation and abhorrence of what is now contained in the proposals, why he still obdurately continues to refuse to amend the proposals and to bring forward more balanced ones which would not involve the sell-out of the vocational schools in the country and the introduction of an entirely sectarian community school concept?  I implore the Minister to re-examine his decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In case Deputy Desmond is under any illusion in relation to my remarks last night that I felt hurt by the fact that sectarian allegations were made against me, and lest he felt that I was referring to his remarks in the House, I want to disillusion him immediately.  I treat his kind of remarks with contempt.  I had discussions with many groups in relation to these proposals.  As I explained on many occasions very diverse opinions were expressed.  Some of the opinions were completely opposed to one another.  It was obvious to me that in the long run it would be necessary for me to put forward my own proposals based on all the information that was available to me&mdash;and this was a large amount of information.  This is <Col N="1084" /> what I have done.  I now propose to put my proposals to the most important element in our educational system, that is, young people and the parents acting for such young people.  I now propose to commence in a few areas consultation with the parents of the young people who will be attending these post-primary schools and who will be very much more interested in having a worthwhile education provided for their children than they will be interested in political or any other sort of controversy.  We will ascertain what are their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether it is not correct that, in sending these proposals to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and in consulting with them and obtaining their views, he did not get the views of the Protestant Hierarchy or Protestant school authorities on these proposals?  Would he explain what he means by saying that the approach of getting the views of one religion only before deciding to hand over the vocational schools to the Hierarchy of that religion is not sectarian?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not handing over the vocational schools to the Hierarchy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What did happen was&mdash;I hardly need to repeat it&mdash;that in the case of one particular town I was asked what I meant in relation to community schools and I gave this information which some time later appeared in one of the national newspapers. This created an emotional situation for which, of course, I am not responsible.  I gave figures in the House recently to indicate the numbers who would be attending these community schools if we had them in the different areas and also the numbers from the Protestant community who might be attending them.  This was one factor that had to be taken into consideration, but by far the most important factor was that I knew from my own experience in dealing with the Protestant community over a period of time that they were anxious to have their children <Col N="1085" /> educated in schools conducted by members of their own faith.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course this attitude was very understandable because we must remember that the Protestant community comprise only 5 per cent of the population here.  I sympathise very much with the desire of the Protestant community in this matter.  Since I have held ministerial office I have helped them in many ways to achieve various things which I could not make available to Catholics.  I believed I was right in so doing.  This has always been the policy of the Government here and will continue to be their policy as long as I am Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I put a question down on this, perhaps I could ask a question on a slightly broader aspect of this problem.  Not wishing to shift the subject from the issue of denominationalism on which I concur fully with Deputies Desmond and FitzGerald, may I put it to the Minister, before asking my own supplementary, that this is a very serious issue and that everybody thinks so except, apparently, the Minister. To say that he treats Deputy Desmond's views with contempt is not an adequate answer from a Minister of State in this House to a serious question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy come to the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's specific reply, when he spoke of dealing with factual and not theoretical situations and when he spoke of providing equitably for all the interests involved, can he say here and now whether in any area his proposals provide equitably for the interests involved either at this time or in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, will the Minister state if, despite the massive volume of unanimous opposition to his scheme, opposition that is not confined to Deputy Desmond or to any other Deputy, he stands over what he apparently said in Tralee last night that <Col N="1086" /> the four and two system stands and he will not budge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained on a number of occasions why I decided on this particular four and two system. Having had to bear in mind all the practical considerations, I believe this was the best solution.  I have already said here that if I got a large sheet of blank paper and a pencil I could jot down what might appear to be an ideal solution to this particular problem. However, the facts are that this sort of thing cannot be done.  One must take into account all the practical considerations and, having done so, make up one's mind.  That is what I did.  I emphasise again that I propose to hold public meetings in a few areas and to give the parents of the young people, who are more important than the Minister, more important than the Hierarchy or more important than anybody else in the educational system, the opportunity of making known their views.</P>

      <P>If there is not a complete breakdown between the Minister and those who should be communicating with him, surely he is aware <Col N="1091" /> that I and numerous other Deputies have complained to the Dublin District Milk Board and to other organisations that cattle have been rejected at all the marts in the midlands, that evidence has been submitted to those organisations that the cattle were dressed and that they were still infested with warble flies.  The Minister's officials should be telling him this; otherwise they are not doing their duty.  In some cases cattle which were returned were put back into the ring and farmers got £13 less for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply dealt with the point raised by the Deputy, but for his benefit I will repeat it.  It is possible, and commonly occurs, that the larvae do surface and cause lumps on the animal's back but it does not necessarily mean, in fact it is rarely the case, that such larvae are viable nor do they emerge and repeat the life cycle of the warble fly.  The effectiveness of the dressing, if properly applied, is between 95 and 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that when the scheme was put into operation a few years ago those complaints were not being made? Surely if the Minister has got the proper information from his officials he would agree the cattle were infested, not that the larvae were there and were not viable.  They certainly were viable and the cattle in the midlands were infested after they had been dressed and after people had paid 4s per beast to have them dressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that if the dressing is not properly applied and if the amount is not accurately measured an imperfect kill will be got. It is also a relevant factor that certain larvae in the course of their migrations through the animal's body may, at the time of application of the dressing, be embedded in fat tissue and being there will be immune from the effects of the drug.  In that case it is possible for a very small percentage of viable larvae to emerge but, as I have said, the drug is very highly effective if properly used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The complaint being made by the majority of farmers <Col N="1092" /> is that the dressing being used in the last year or so is not satisfactory. There were no complaints in the previous five years by any farmer that I know about any infestation after the cattle were dressed, but there were complaints last year all over the country. The Minister should inquire whether the dressing or the drug being used is, to use his own word, viable.  Would the Minister make inquiries, because this is serious for farmers?  They do not want the same thing to happen this winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the Pigs and Bacon Commission, through whom the export of bacon is centralised, recently notified licensed bacon curers that from next month onwards all bacon for export should not bear individual factory brands but should continue to be strip-marked as Irish, the purpose being that marketing advantages as well as economies in transport and distribution can be achieved by selling the bacon abroad on the national mark basis.  I understand that the great majority of bacon <Col N="1093" /> curers voluntarily agreed a number of years ago to the discontinuance of factory brands on export bacon but that this did not include a few factories in Limerick and elsewhere although their acceptance of it as a requirement applied to all factories was not ruled out.

The duties and responsibilities of the board are such that an application for an adoption order could not be said, in any realistic sense, to be open to consideration by the board until certain conditions have been fulfilled, additional to the making of the application.  For instance, a waiting period of at least several months is necessary before the suitability of the particular applicants to adopt the particular child can be assessed.  If the Deputy's question is intended to relate to cases where the necessary waiting period has elapsed and where all necessary consents and other documents have been obtained, I am informed that the position is that the board is not in arrears at all <Col N="1100" /> except of course to the unavoidable extent that, at any given time, cases are coming forward for decision between one meeting of the board and the next suitable meeting.  By &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; meeting, I mean, a meeting that suits the applicants.</P>
      <P>No figures are available to me or to the board as to children &ldquo;available for adoption&rdquo; but, while availability for adoption is not a simple clear-cut concept that could readily be translated into a statistic, it is common knowledge amongst those involved in adoption work that there are waiting lists of suitable applicants.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that on Friday, 28th May, 1971, Henry Street, Dublin, was blocked off to facilitate the operation of a film unit; that normal trading in the vicinity was disrupted; and that local traders suffered losses; if the Garda were asked to co-operate in blocking off the street; why local shopkeepers and traders were not consulted; and if he will ensure that similar action is not taken in future unless local traders are first consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the street was not blocked-off by or with the consent of the Garda Síochána and, as far as they are aware, it was not blocked off at all.</P>
      <P>The facts, as far as the Garda Síochána are aware, are that filming went on for only a very short time, that it was causing no traffic obstruction worth mentioning and that it was discontinued because of protests by local traders who threatened to block the street with their cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda had been told beforehand <Col N="1102" /> of the proposed filming.  It would have been inappropriate for the Garda Síochána to consult local traders about what a film company proposed to do on the public street just as it would be inappropriate for them to do so if a television camera crew wanted to film something on the public street.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister may be correct in saying that the street was not physically blocked off, may I inform him that two messengers belonging to traders in this street were stopped by members of the crew and were only allowed through when they satisfied those people that they were messengers belonging to traders in the street.  Is the Minister aware that, when the local Garda were contacted by the traders, they informed them that this was the first they had heard of it? The only Garda who were aware of this were the traffic Garda?  Is he also aware that, although he said filming lasted for a very short time only, filming only stopped when the traders decided that they would take the law into their own hands and block off the street?  Is he further aware that this is not the first time this has occurred at a weekend and seriously disrupted the traders and the ordinary public? Heavy cables were laid along the street and people could only get into business premises with considerable difficulty on that day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts appear to be that the Garda were informed beforehand.  In fact, there was a member of the Garda there all the time.  The distinction which the Deputy makes between what he calls the local Garda and the traffic police is hardly valid because they are all members of the one Force.  The general question of filming in this street or, indeed, in any other public place in the country, is a difficult one.  It has been the view not only of myself and my predecessors but that of other Ministers who were consulted about this that, in general, it is to the benefit of this country if foreign film crews come here to make films.  If they are not causing serious obstruction, the Garda, when they are consulted, try to facilitate film crews <Col N="1103" /> because these films are to the overall benefit of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally consulted 20 traders in that street and they all said very definitely that not only on this occasion but on a previous occasion they suffered grievous financial loss.  They very much resent the insinuation by the Minister in reply to a question about the previous incident that some of the traders had made financial arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is why they were brought to the point of bringing out their own cars.  When they threatened to do this, then and only then, did the film crew cease their operations. Why should a film unit be facilitated in blocking off 20 to 25 parking meters in Henry Street and also be allowed to use power and get a mains connection to the Post Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are entitled to that if they can make those arrangements. The Garda have no responsibility in this matter at all.  I want to reply to the allegation by Deputy Belton that serious financial loss was suffered by the traders.  This is unlikely in view of the fact that operations began at 8 o'clock in the morning and ended about 9 o'clock in the morning. Henry Street may be an early morning street, but I do not think it is so early that they would suffer serious financial loss at that time.</P>

The Minister can consult with the Inspector of the Garda for the area. I spoke to him and he was not aware of this filming until he got a complaint from the traders in Moore Street.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The remedial action taken in this matter was not taken as a result of an inquiry from the newspaper concerned but as a result of an allegation made about a week previously by a member of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> The facts are as follows.</P>
    <P>On 19th May, 1971, the Central Statistics Office informed a senior officer at Garda Headquarters of the allegations from the member of the public which in effect was an allegation that, as well as checking the census forms as part of their duty in connection with the census, some gardaí used the forms as the easiest way of checking that the household register was up to date.  The Central Statistics Office expressed serious concern at the allegation and stressed that, if it were true, such action would appear to be in breach of the obligations imposed by the Statistics Act, 1926.  Accepting this view and recognising the urgency of the matter the Garda officer concerned immediately telephoned a special instruction to all divisional officers outside Dublin&mdash;the matter did not affect Dublin&mdash;that they should forthwith bring to the notice of all members that any inquiries necessary to have the register kept up to date must be made separately and that strict care must be taken not to infringe in any circumstances or in any way whatsoever the rule that the information in the census forms may not be used for any but statistical purposes. There was no circular on the matter. About a week after this was done, an inquiry was received from a journalist and he was informed of the action taken.</P>
    <P>Up to the point where the remedial action had been taken, my Department, as distinct from the Garda, was not involved at all.  Further inquiries have since been made by my Department and the following is the position that emerges.  The register is a register which has been kept in all stations outside Dublin since the foundation of the State.  Up to last year it contained columns for recording the name, address, occupation and the relationship to the head of the household of each person in each household in the area served by the Garda station.</P>
    <P>These particulars were, of course, common knowledge locally but it appears to be a fact that, down the years, when the gardaí in connection with their census duties became aware of any changes in the names, addresses, <Col N="1106" /> or occupations, they recorded those changes in the register.  By that I mean that their work on successive censuses was one way, but not the only way, that was used as a means of keeping the registers up to date.</P>
    <P>Early last year the stock of registers was running out and, before a reprint was ordered, the gardaí decided to consider specially whether the value of the register to them was worth the trouble of keeping it, particularly because it appears that in practice the voters list may be used more than the household register when any inquiry was received at a station.  The views of a crosssection of divisional officers were obtained and the matter was also considered by Garda headquarters officers. The unanimous view was that the register was of sufficient use to justify its retention and that a further column to show the date of birth should be included.</P>
    <P>The register is regarded by the gardaí as a very useful means of enabling new members assigned to a station to familiarise themselves with their area.  Date of birth is often a matter the gardaí need to know in connection with alleged offences by or against juveniles, school attendance problems or even such matters as the serving of drink to young people.  The recommendation that date of birth be included was accepted by the Garda authorities at the time and reprints of the register were obtained on this basis.</P>
    <P>It appears that the headquarters officers who examined the matter appreciated that the date of birth would not readliy be obtainable in many cases as a matter of common local knowledge and that the inclusion of a column for the date of birth implied that the local gardaí could legitimately seek the information from the census forms.  It appears that they were of opinion that the obligation on the gardaí not to reveal any information they might obtain in the course of their duty in connection with the census did not preclude them from extracting the information in question from the forms as long as it was not disclosed to anybody outside the force and in fact the necessity to be strict in not <Col N="1107" /> disclosing information to anybody outside the force was noted by them.</P>
    <P>The view that the only obligation is an obligation not to disclose information to persons outside the force is, as I need hardly say, quite wrong as it is clear that an authorised officer may not disclose any information obtained from the census returns even to another authorised officer unless the other authorised officer, too, is concerned in that capacity with the particular information. The full acceptance that a wrong view had been taken is reflected in the immediate and specific instruction that was issued as a matter of urgency on the day the allegation was received, namely, 19th May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that gardaí in the midlands area, specifically in the Mullingar divisional area, expressed reservations at being asked to undertake this work? Would he further accept that, following inquiries at senior level, a memorandum was sent to that area?  Several thousand forms have been examined in that area by gardaí, if I may take that area first.  It is the only area with which I am familiar apart from Cork, about which I have a question down also and to which I will come.  Could I have conformation of that, please?</P>

Would the Minister accept that this is a breach of the regulations?  Is he aware that many enumerators experienced delay in getting back those A Forms to enable them to go ahead and complete their summary forms, thus giving them grounds for thinking that the forms were being used for purposes other than the census?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputies in reply to their questions of 19th May, 1971, I made an order under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, on 14th May, 1971, refusing outline permission for the development of a site at Quinn's Road, Shankill, as a mobile home park.  Enforcement of the control provisions of this Act in relation to any unauthorised development which may have taken place on the site is a matter for the planning authority in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the fact that in general planning permission is required for the provision of a mobile home or for the use of a site for the keeping of caravans, provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948 are relevant.  Under section 31 of the 1948 Act a sanitary authority may prohibit the erection or retention of temporary dwellings if they are of opinion that such erection or retention would be prejudicial to public health, or the amenities of the locality or would interfere to an unreasonable extent with traffic on any road.  In addition in any sanitary district where section 34 of the 1948 Act is in operation, it is an offence to keep temporary dwellings on lands for more than 18 consecutive days, or 36 days within a period of <Col N="1116" /> 12 months unless a licence, granted by the sanitary authority, is in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the concern regarding the slowness of the procedure?  Is there any action under which either the planning authority or the sanitary authority, or his Department in conjunction with them, can take to have the caravans removed because of the failure to provide the facilities and because of the breach of the Order that was made?  In addition, the area in question was scheduled in the draft plan as an amenity area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the concern to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that notice of 28 days is given to the proprietor to remove the caravans, and that subsequently he has to be brought to court?  In many cases the proprietor gets an adjournment and for four or five months a large number of mobile homes can be parked on a large site and the local authority seems to be powerless?  Will the Minister give an assurance that he will look at the existing legislation with a view perhaps to the authority being able to obtain an injunction or something of this nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the need to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the Act.  I have been looking at this aspect of the Planning Act for some time and may be coming forward with proposals some time in the future. However, that does not arise out of this case.</P>

      <P>The local authority take what steps they are empowered to take.  The point is that it is much too slow.  It is happening throughout County Dublin where the local <Col N="1117" /> authority have refused permission for development and the Minister, on appeal, refused permission also.  In many cases the applicant goes ahead and when he gets the mobile homes on the site he makes application for retention, which holds up prosecution while this is being considered.  When the application is turned down by the local planning authority, he appeals to the Minister and this holds up prosecution while the applicant goes ahead with the development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that people are having difficulty in obtaining loans from building societies to purchase houses; and if he is prepared to take steps to help such people to secure loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that building societies generally are accepting new applications for loans only from persons who have been members of the societies for specified periods.  I would, however, point out for the information of the Deputy that the total amount issued in housing loans in 1970-71 by the principal societies was a record £19,052,000, compared with £11,365,000 in 1969-70 and that the societies expect to better this record in the current financial year.  Further, in 1970-71 the number of loans approved by the societies increased by more than 40 per cent to 7,084 and the total value of all the applications which the societies have on hands now exceeds £20 million of which about £16 million is in respect of approved loans.</P>
      <P>This growth in the operation of the societies reflects the current high level of house-building activity, as evidenced also by the fact that new house grant allocations in 1970-71 were about 50 per cent up on the total for the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> To assist persons with modest incomes to purchase their houses, the Government have, through the public capital programme, made a total of £12,500,000 available to local authorities for the making of house purchase loans and supplementary grants in the current financial year.  The capital allocated to individual authorities for those purposes should be sufficient to enable them to meet the demands for loans and grants from eligible persons. The Deputy will be aware that I have also increased, with effect from the 1st March last, the eligibility and maximum loan limits applicable to the local authority loans scheme.</P>
    <P>Total funds available in the current financial year for house purchase loans from the three main sources&mdash;building societies, assurance companies and local authorities&mdash;are likely to approach £40 million representing an increase of about 20 per cent on actual issues in 1970-71.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that, on the figures given to me yesterday by the Taoiseach, the £ has depreciated by 7 per cent in the last four years and that should be taken into consideration in any figure related to a matter like this.  Is the Minister aware that, despite the fact that private people cannot get loans, the building societies are giving large sums to speculators for the purchase of hotels?  In one case they gave £150,000 to a speculator to buy a hotel.  If they were not doing that the money would be available for people who are trying to buy homes.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a recent Press report.  I have no evidence that illegal importation of drugs by post is occurring to any significant extent.  Certain preventive measures are already operated by my Department and the customs authorities.  In the light of the recommendations of the working party on drug abuse the question of whether any additional measures are necessary and practicable is being considered by my Department in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners and other interested Departments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will make a statement on the Government's decision to set up a committee to review the progress of the television and sound broadcasting services since the enactment of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>

      <P>It is nearly 11 years since the Broadcasting Authority was established, and over nine since the television service commenced.  Since its establishment, the authority has made substantial progress in the development of the sound broadcasting and television services.  I consider, however, <Col N="1135" /> that it is desirable that from time to time a general review should be made of the progress of these services, and an assessment made of the further development needed.  The lapse of time since the authority was established makes it appropriate, in my view, that such a review and assessment should now be made, and, accordingly, I have decided to set up a committee for that purpose.  I hope to announce the membership of the committee shortly.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Local Government.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to Questions I had been adverting to the desirability of maintaining maximum employment in local authorities.  I had indicated my belief that the number employed by county councils has been falling in recent years, that machinery and so on tends more and more to replace labour in county council work, and I was seeking to impress on the Minister the urgency and the importance of maintaining maximum employment in rural areas.  It may seem to be economically wise, but I submit it is not socially desirable that we should of deliberate purpose run down the number employed by local authorities in the interest of mere efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment in rural Ireland is very important, all the more so at present by reason of the large numbers who, because of deliberate Government policy, have been added to the unemployment <Col N="1139" /> register, the scrap heap, through the withdrawal of the dole. This is an additional army of unemployed and I am seeking to emphasise the importance of ensuring that when it comes to the preparation of work schedules they should be so designed as to ensure maximum labour content.</P>
    <P>In respect of some aspects of local government policy, an endeavour has been made to ensure that this desirable social policy is adhered to, but I am afraid it is being departed from of late.  This is particularly true in respect of what was commonly known as the employment relief grants at Christmas. It was true to a large extent in respect of the Local Authorities (Works) Act. It was a desirable social feature of those schemes that they were so planned by our engineers to provide maximum employment for human beings.  It would be a tragedy to depart from that very desirable social policy in the interests of mere efficiency, especially as local authorities provide very largely&mdash;upwards of 50 per cent at least&mdash;of the revenue for such works. It is only right and proper that members of local authorities in determining the rate should have some effective say in the spending of the millions of pounds garnered through the rating system.</P>
    <P>There is little industrial activity in rural Ireland.  There is little employment in agriculture, where it is diminishing year by year, and there is a rush away from the country into cities and towns and abroad.  The only employment which seems to be available is with the semi-State bodies such as Bord na Móna, the ESB and the Post Office.  In such circumstances one cannot blame unemployed people, whole families, entire rural communities, for looking to local authorities for employment. Therefore, it would be very callous, unpatriotic and irresponsible of the Government and the Minister if they ignored this human factor which I am pleading for here.  A feature in our local authorities which is becoming more and more evident is that there are what I might term more officers than men in the sense of engineers, <Col N="1140" /> staff officers, clerical officers and the like being more numerous than the labouring classes.  In any local authority today there seem to be more engineers than men.  I am seeking to rectify that imbalance and to implement the policy announced by the late Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, when he said that the essence of good government is the provision of jobs quickly.</P>
    <P>I am therefore asking the Minister for Local Government to keep that in mind because it was never so badly needed as it is now with 71,000 registered unemployed and 17,000 more because of the deliberate action of the Government in regard to the dole.  In addition there are large numbers coming out of schools and more men are opting for retirement at 65.</P>
    <P>I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without reverting to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I know it is still on the Statute Book but when Fianna Fáil came back to power in 1957 they sabotaged it of set purpose by withdrawing the moneys required to fund it.  That was a retrograde step. The Act was brought into being by the Labour Minister for Local Government, Deputy Murphy, and it proved invaluable to all local authorities who initiated so many essential work schemes.  Through that Act thousands of pounds found their way to the local authorities enabling them to repair roads, to build and repair bridges, to drain rivers and effectively to deal with flooding.  It enabled the local authorities to go into the bed of the stream or river and carry out essential drainage work.  We all know to our sorrow how urgently required a facility of this kind is at the present time.  We are all obliged to protest here annually and demand some remedial measures for the recurring flooding and the damage which results from such flooding in our respective areas.</P>
    <P>The damage accruing from constant and recurring flooding is very costly. Apart from the many thousands of acres of arable land which are inundated, the loss and deprivation of livestock, property, houses and sometimes even of human life as a result of this flooding, which local authorities are <Col N="1141" /> unable to cope with despite their best endeavours, is a great national loss. The loss of the Local Authorities (Works) Act is incalculable.  One only has to read the daily or evening papers to observe that more and more local authorities are clamouring either for the reintroduction of the Local Authorities (Works) Act or for the provision of the capital required to fund this essential public service.</P>
    <P>The stock answer for refusing to bring back this measure is that much of the money spent at that time by Mr. T.J. Murphy, the then Minister and his colleagues, was wasted.  That is not merely untrue; it is a libel on those great men.  The money most certainly was not wasted.  We have to admit there was an administrative omission in the sense that there was no obligation for maintenance work to be carried out.  It would be a simple, procedural, legislative device to ensure that when moneys were expended for purposes of this kind under the Local Authorities (Works) Act the scheme should be taken in charge by the local authority and maintained thereafter, as is the procedure in respect of roads. It is not good enough to say that money was wasted because there was no follow through.  This can and should be remedied.  I therefore make no apology for demanding once again in the interests of local authorities, in the interests of employment and in the interests of the economy generally, the reintroduction of this very desirable scheme.</P>
    <P>In thinking in terms of employment and the provision of amenities, especially those amenities which local authorities are able to provide of their own volition out of their own slender resources, I want to place on record my personal disgust and indignation&mdash; and I use these words in the strict sense and positively so&mdash;at the removal of the moneys required to fund the unemployment relief grant at Christmas time.  The deletion of this money from the Budget two years ago was a particularly callous act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government would not have any responsibility for the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1142" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>He administered it and it would be his duty to see to it that this money was maintained in the Budget for this essential service.  This grant was administered by the Minister for Local Government and he must share the responsibility for its withdrawal, all the more so because it was money provided to ensure that the large army of unemployed people are at least employed around Christmas time so that none would go in want around the holy season.  It meant the difference between happiness and misery for thousands of workers and their families at a time when we all strive to ensure that we have a happy and contented community.</P>
      <P>The work was specifically designed to provide the maximum labour content. The local authorities themselves contributed towards the grant and much valuable work was carried out. The withdrawal of these essential moneys was a deplorable act which meant the difference between happiness and sorrow for many thousands of unemployed people at Christmas time.  It made a mockery of their sufferings and I am asking&mdash;I hope this is the appropriate time to do it&mdash;the Minister to insist that the necessary money be put back into the Budget next year.  I have had many questions down expressing the urgent necessity of bringing this grant scheme back.  The Minister's answers were that it was deleted in the Budget and consequently there was nothing he could do about it.</P>
      <P>These are important matters for rural Ireland.  When one considers the large amount of money expended by the State and the economies which could have been effected without interfering with this scheme, which was designed to help the least well off sections of the community, the action is all the more reprehensible.  I hope the Minister will be determined enough to see to it that, if and when economies are to be effected in budgetary policies and the like, they are not done at the expense of the least well off section of society, doing a disservice to the unemployed and to the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may advert to another aspect of housing policy, apart from the desirability of building new houses the Minister <Col N="1143" /> has the obligation to maintain old dwellings and assist people to maintain them by way of grants and so on.  This is being done to some extent but one would wish the grants were increased in proportion to the increased cost of building materials and other costs.  I am concerned here with those categories of persons who by reason of their lack of financial means are unable to avail of the grants for repair, reconstruction and the like and whose homes are in dire need of repair.  The only alternative available to this category of people is to seek to secure what we might call an emergency repair grant by the local authority under section 23 of the Housing Act.  The Minister referred to this section and intimated that he thinks that as much as can be done under this section has been done.</P>
    <P>This is a very important measure. It can be an emergency repair for a poor widow or an old couple living alone in a house which is literally falling down around them.  Some of those houses are even dangerous to live in.  Many of them are open to the elements.  It is vitally important where the local authority is unable or unwilling to rehouse those people in the normal way that they should be able to go in and make that house at least wind and weather-proof and as comfortable as possible within the limited resources of this section 23 grant system.</P>
    <P>Many of our local authorities have done this work but again one of the difficulties is that the money so expended seems to be a once for all grant. There is no follow up, no attempt to continue maintenance and within a relatively short time we find deterioration has set in all over again so that the money already expended is simply wasted.  Those unfortunate people are then back in their old predicament. The solution may well lie in deciding, first of all, whether that old hovel was really capable of repair at reasonable cost.  Nine times out of ten you will find that money should not have been spent on some of those old houses. Those people should be provided with alternative housing by way of low cost <Col N="1144" /> prefabricated structures of some type. The real solution, of course, to this problem is more houses for the aged. That is why I would like to see acceleration of the drive to provide homes for the aged in rural areas as well as in the cities.  We tend to forget about the old people in rural Ireland, some of whom live in hovels.</P>
    <P>Difficulty is also experienced by those people who have purchased their homes from county councils or corporations, so-called vested tenants, who are unable to find the money for urgent repairs.  In many instances these people are prepared to hand back their homes to the county councils.  There seems to be a marked reluctance on the part of county councils to repossess those houses, put the tenants back again under their tenancy agreements and carry out the essential repairs. The Minister should take a personal interest in this important matter and where it is shown that the vested tenants are unable or unwilling to carry out essential repairs and where there is agreement for the county councils to repossess those cottages this should be done expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I very much regret the withdrawal in very large measure of loans to persons who wish to purchase existing old houses.  Loans from local authorities are confined in the main to the erection of new houses.  It is regrettable, due to the need for economy, that loans for the purchase of existing old houses have very largely been withdrawn.  They may be made available in certain circumstances but these are such as to make it virtually impossible to secure a loan for the purchase of a house on the property market.</P>
    <P>This was a very important facility for ordinary working class people whereby they could go to an auctioneer's office and compete on the property market for homes of their own.  They were facilitated by way of loans from their local authorities for this purpose.  This is an important corollary to rehousing, as we know. Loans are being withdrawn for this purpose unless you are an approved applicant for rehousing by your local authority and you must prove conclusively <Col N="1145" /> to your housing authority that you sought, and failed to secure, this loan from alternative sources, such as building agencies, insurance corporations and the like.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the importance of this facility.  I want too, despite the shortage of capital, to ask the Minister to instruct local authorities to make some money available for this essential purpose.  The purchase of houses on the property market is the preserve of people of capital in this country, the people whose assets are such that they can go to a bank or a lending agency and obtain money.  The ordinary working class people are now cut off from this essential facility because of the action of the Minister for Local Government and his officers in instructing local authorities that they were to reserve capital resources for new house building only.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> New house building is very desirable but equally important is the ability to get a loan to purchase an existing house if it comes your way and is within your means.  That is the reason why I raised this very important matter here.</P>
    <P>There are other matters I should like to refer to such as the implementation of the Buchanan plan, and the acceleration of the provision of piped water and sanitary services where people have not got those services. This should be a top priority because only half the people of this country have piped water and flushed toilets available to them.  I also want to deal with the matter of pollution.</P>
