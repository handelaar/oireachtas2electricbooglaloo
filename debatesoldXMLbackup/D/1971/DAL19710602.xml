    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>44.  In paragraph 9, page 6, line 29, after &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for a period in excess of six months&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall precisely what point we were at in regard to this but I shall just repeat that the purpose of the amendment is to limit disqualification from membership of the commission to major offences, so that minor offences indicating penalties of less than six months, the kind of penalties one can incur for certain types of contempt for example, would not disqualify one from membership of the authority.  I think this is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the amendment.  This is an unprecedented suggestion.  The provision in the section is a normal provision and I cannot see any reason why I should depart from it at this stage, particularly in relation to a body such as An tÚdarás.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept there are minor offences <Col N="766" /> carrying with them penalties of less than six months which are of such a character and involve such a minimal amount of ignominy as not to warrant disqualification of somebody from membership?  The origin of this amendment, as the Minister will know, was a suggestion from the students' organisation that a student who, because of his part in some demonstration is given a short sentence, could find himself disqualified from membership of the authority.  That is not confined to students.  Other persons could find themselves in conflict with the law on some minor account which would not warrant total disqualification from membership.  Would the Minister not be prepared to reconsider it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not reconsider this.  I have given my reasons.  It is an unprecedented proposal. The provision in the Bill is a normal provision in relation to the operation of legislation of this type.  I could not accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the reasons.  I do not think the Deputy is really serious about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has only said it is unprecedented.  That is the worst of all possible reasons for not doing something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said very much more.  This is a normal provision and I cannot see any reason at all why I should depart from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister says it is normal procedure; that is another way of saying to depart from it would be unprecedented.  It is the same argument again.  When the Minister says he does not see any argument in favour of it, that is not an argument against it.  Has the Minister no argument whatever against it other than precedent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why this amendment is in at all except in relation to one particular aspect the <Col N="767" /> Deputy mentioned, and I simply could not accept that we should create in relation to this Bill a new type of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So we are back to precedent.  The Minister has no reason whatever for rejecting it other than precedent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 10, page 6, line 31, to delete &ldquo;seventy&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;sixty-five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to reduce the maximum age for holding office of members of the authority from 70 to 65.  Sixty-five is the normal retirement age and there does not appear to be any particular reason for departing from it in this instance.  It seems better, in view of the Minister's insistence on precedent, that we should stick to precedent in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should say that in this particular instance the amendement appears rather strange coming from a university man whose normal conditions of service allow him to continue to serve until he is 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not invent the conditions of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy did not.  Nevertheless, they are there and I find the suggestion rather strange, coming from the source from which it came and I am not just referring to the Deputy here.  At the moment it is the right of people concerned in the university like professors and lecturers, to continue to serve up to 70 years of age and I find the suggestion that, on the other hand, we should prevent those who will be dealing very closely with university work from having the same right, very strange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="768" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that in the university the power of extension to 70 is a power that must be specially exercised.  I will, of course, admit that it normally is exercised.  It is only in the case of the National University of Ireland where the President of the College takes the initiative of proposing the extension that that extension takes place.  It is not the case, therefore, that a university professor is automatically entitled to continue to age 70 whereas what is proposed here would involve an entitlement to continue to age 70 automatically.  Therefore, the Minister's analogy is far from being completely correct.</P>
      <P>The fact that in the year 1908 it was thought appropriate in the case of university professors to give a power of extension to age 70, possibly at that time envisaging this as something to be exercised rarely in cases where somebody had a very particular contribution to make, does not mean that we should in 1971 feel obliged to give an automatic extension to age 70 to members of an authority concerned with university matters.  The Minister's line of argument is a somewhat tenuous one and I cannot see that because something was thought desirable, perhaps as an exceptional measure, and in circumstances requiring a special initiative, in 1908, by a British parliament, a Liberal majority, that we must be bound in 1971 to introduce the same thing for another purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.  It is far from certain that the pattern under which it is almost automatic for university staff to be extended to age 70 is necessarily a good one.  There are, of course, cases where the person concerned has a continuing contribution to make in many cases long after the age of 70 but in so far as it applies to professors who in the normal way, though not always, but in most cases, are heads of departments it is far from certain that the present arrangement is a good one and that the most vital, energetic head of a department will be somebody in the age bracket 65 to 70.  I think myself that this is something which needs to be looked at in the context of future university legislation with a view to <Col N="769" /> ensuring that if any provision is made to enable somebody to continue teaching it certainly will not make him almost automatically the head of a department possibly holding up desirable changes in that department for a further five years.</P>
    <P>I do not see that on any count the Minister's analogy is a valid one or that I should feel in any way precluded from putting this forward or indeed that the body which initially suggested this amendment, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, should feel inhibited in putting it forward.  That federation may well feel that a reform is overdue in respect of its own members in this regard and no doubt may come forward with proposals of that kind later on.  I am concerned at this stage with this Bill and in the context of this Bill the desirability of having a body of people fully active in mind and body to undertake this difficult task suggests the desirability of maintaining this age limit.  If it is the case that in the public service who will be considering the recommendations of this body, who will be dealing generally with university matters, an age limit of 65 applies, there seems to be no reason for departing from it in regard to the body which will be formulating proposals to put before the Minister for consideration by him and members of his staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to protract this debate but lest silence be taken as acquiescence may I say that I agree with the Minister on this?  I am at a loss to follow Deputy FitzGerald's argument.  It would seem to me that experience in his own university suggests that selective continuance in employment to the age of 70 has led to an extreme degree of abuse.  It seems to me the line should be drawn firmly either at 65 or 70 and if 70 is good enough for his college and good enough for my college and if 75 is good enough for the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church, 70 is good enough for me.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, of course, said at any stage that individual <Col N="770" /> Deputies or groups of people or individuals have no right to put forward proposals.  Of course they have, but it does not mean that I should have to accept them.</P>
      <P>Let me again return to the point I made.  Deputy FitzGerald has ranged over a very wide field but I must come back to the point and that is that at the moment the situation in the universities is that professors and lecturers may continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to serve until they are 70 years of age.  There does not seem to be any reason for assuming that members who are chosen for their knowledge and experience in the first place would lose their effectiveness as members of An tÚdarás when they reached the age of 65.  We should also take into consideration the longer life expectancy and this should make us more inclined to leave the situation as it is, that is, that the Chairman of An tÚdarás should be entitled to act as such until he is 70.</P>

      <P>This Bill is an unfortunate example of Fascism of the worst sort.  This body will either be a nominal body or it will pretend to do something.  If it is to be a nominal body there is no reason why people should not stay on until they are 70. In fact, its primary functions are advisory and it is said that wisdom comes with age and people are living much longer and being kept much fitter now with the various drugs that have been invented.  Therefore, for once I am with the Minister.  I still wish he would withdraw the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 7, paragraph 19 (3), line 19, to delete &ldquo;the Schedule&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;this Schedule&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is just a drafting amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 7, paragraph 21 (1), lines 38 and 41, to delete &ldquo;quinquennium&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is not an amendment I feel very strongly about but the purpose behind it is to ensure that the authority at regular intervals makes quite clear what it has done, gives an account of its stewardship during the preceding relatively short time.  I have no objection to quinquennial planning as such.  Obviously in the case of grants, for instance, a quinquennium is a more suitable unit of time than a year but there could be a situation here where the authority would only report at the end of each quinquennium if a Minister did not direct it to do otherwise, if I understand this correctly.  The desire of Deputy Desmond and myself was to have included in the statute that the authority should be in this way kept on its toes. I wonder if the Minister would consider the possible value of that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I explained to the Deputy what I had in mind here it might help.  Subsection (1) requires that An tÚdarás make a report of their proceedings at quinquennial intervals or at such other intervals as the Minister might direct.  This provision has been included because of the intention to introduce as soon as possible a system of quinquennial planning and budgeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit far-fetched to hang this on such an absurd argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would envisage is that once the quinquennial planning and budgeting have been <Col N="772" /> introduced reports would be submitted to the Minister in somewhat this form: first, a report outlining a programme for development over the ensuing quinquennium for which the Minister's approval would already have been given and then a mid-term review of progress during the first half of the quinquennium and a forecast for the remaining half.  This would be more suitable than just having yearly reports on a quinquennial programme. In other words, you would at least have to get it in the middle of the quinquennial period and then we would have an annual publication of statistics on higher education collected by An tÚdarás with a brief résumé of the main features of the activities of the body during the year to which the statistics refer.  Then, at the termination of the quinquennium we would have a review of the progress over the previous five years and an outline of the programme approved by the Minister for the next five years.  This is going a good way to meet the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We now have the Minister hanging on to this argument about something which probably will never happen, this quinquennial budget, which is a method of hiding realities from the public.  Reports are always made yearly and there is nothing sacro-sanct about a year.  It could be two years or three years but five years is certainly too long a period.  The Minister can fix some other period if he wants to.  The method of approach which the Minister adopts here is different from his approach on other parts of the Bill.  The Minister's argument is completely absurd and ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule, as amended, be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier on we discussed the Schedule item by item but this morning we have gone through a large portion of it in one lap and therefore I want to speak on a few points which were not mentioned. Paragraph 11 of the Schedule states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> A member of An tÚdarás shall be paid by An tÚdarás &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such allowances as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determines,</P>
    <P>(b)  such amounts in respect of expenses as An tÚdarás considers reasonable.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between the two items?  The allowance is presumably a salary of some sort.  It would probably be comparable with what we receive as Members of this House which is not exactly a salary.  I do not believe it is intended to have it a regular thing so what exactly does it mean?  It says &ldquo;such amounts in respect of expenses&rdquo;. Is the word &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; here intended to be the overnight allowance you get when you are away from home, or is it the daily allowance which a civil servant gets if he is more than ten hours away from headquarters? Are &ldquo;such amounts in respect of expenses&rdquo; travelling expenses? If they are, why not say so?</P>
    <P>Paragraph 19 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The seal of An tÚdarás shall be authenticated by the signature of a member of An tÚdarás authorised by An tÚdarás to act in that behalf and the signature of an officer of An tÚdarás authorised by An tÚdarás to act in that behalf.</P>
    <P>The usual procedure is that the chairman signs with the secretary and you make such provision in the Bill and then you go and you say that in the absence of the chairman the seal shall be authenticated by such member of An tÚdarás authorised by An tÚdarás.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 21 (3) states:</P>
    <P>An tÚdarás shall supply the Minister with such information regarding the performance of its functions as he may from time to time require.</P>
    <P>There is some double thinking here. When An tÚdarás came into existence it was stated by itself to be an independent body.  The very fact it did that made everybody think that it was not in fact independent.  We have the proof here that it is not independent.  How well or how badly this works will <Col N="774" /> depend on the particular civil servant who will be for the time being in charge of this job.  If the particular person is a &ldquo;Nosey Parker&rdquo; he can make an awful nuisance of himself in the name of the Minister until such time as the authority protests to the Minister.  There has been a great increase in the size of the Civil Service since 1964 and a great increase in the cost from approximately £19 million a year to approximately £46 million a year in seven years.  It is necessary to find work for all those people and one method of doing so is to get them to write letters to people.  The paragraph could be phrased differently such as saying that the Minister may ask An tÚdarás for information from time to time.  When you say &ldquo;shall apply&rdquo; it is compulsory on this independent body to supply the Minister for Education with such information as he may from time to time require meaning that such civil servant as may from time to time be appointed to do this particular job shall obtain the information. I should be glad if the Minister would clear up those points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first point on paragraph 11 this paragraph provides for payment of allowances and expenses to members.  The payment of allowances is understandable. It is the ordinary payment of an allowance to a member for his work on the authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a salary as such, because if we were to pay a salary we would have to pay a greater sum than we are likely to pay when we call it an allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that there is nothing new in this provision and that, in practice, the necessity to take action would rarely arise.  It will ensure that, if a question is put to the Minister in relation to the performance of the authority, he will be able to supply information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

What the Minister is really telling me is that if somebody puts down a parliamentary question the Minister will be able to get the information and that, if this provision were not in the Bill, he might not be able to get the information. &ldquo;I cannot obtain the information&rdquo; has been said from time to time in this House.

      <P>2. &mdash; In relation to an employee whose employment is terminated by reason of redundancy on or after the commencement of this Act, any provision of the Principal Act or this Act which affects or relates to the preservation of continuity of the employee's employment shall apply to periods of employment before the 1st day of January, 1968, as they apply to such periods after that date.</P>

    <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I was sympathetic to the Labour Party amendment which has now been retabled as amendment No. 2, subject to the understanding that it will apply to <Col N="777" /> cases occurring after the commencement of the amending legislation.  This is the marked difference between the amendments.  My amendment repeats the terms of the Labour Party amendment with the addition of the opening words which give effect to reservations mentioned by me on Committee Stage. I hope that, having regard to this Government amendment, the Labour Party will withdraw their amendment. I think my amendment meets the case fully with the exception of the slight change in the original words.</P>

      <P>We are pleased to note the Minister's amendment because it reconfirms the application of certain provisions of the Act to existing employees. We are pleased to note that the Minister has accepted our suggestion in relation to continuity of employment. This is a general principle which the Labour Party have advanced throughout the discussion on the Bill. We should point out that it does not contain retrospection for what we classify as deprived employees.  In the circumstsances we are not anxious to withdraw amendment No. 2.  Perhaps it can be further considered in the Seanad.  We are anxious to facilitate the Minister in getting the Report Stage through today, but we suggest that if both amendments were accepted by the Minister this would strengthen and connect the statutory means of preserving continuity of employment.  This is the basic idea behind our amendment. As I said, we are not anxious to withdraw amendment No. 2 at this stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" />&ldquo;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following new section before section 3:</P>
    <P>&lsquo;The provisions of this Act in relation to a payment to an employee (or eligibility for a payment) shall have effect from 22nd January, 1971 provided that the difference between a payment under this Act and the payment (if any) under the Principal Act, in the period between 21st January, 1971 and the commencement of this Act shall be paid from the Redundancy Fund&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, we come back to the overall attitude of the Labour Party that we should have included in this Bill a provision which would prevent employers from deliberately avoiding the provisions of the Bill.  We maintain this happened in relation to the original Act.  Our amendment is designed to ensure that the new benefits will apply from 21st January, 1971.  If the Minister accepted this amendment, together with amendment No. 44, we feel that this would quite effectively prevent any employer from avoiding the provisions of the Bill and thus damaging the normal entitlement to redundancy.  I do not entirely agree with the Minister's attitude that it is unlikely that anybody would, as he said before, jump the gun.  I do not entirely accept the view that, perhaps, there may be a few hard luck cases.  The purpose of our amendment is to prevent any deliberate circumvention of the provisions of the Bill.  Fixing a date, 21st January, 1971, from which payment shall be made from the Redundancy Fund would be of immense benefit to this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we are discussing amendments Nos. 3 and 44 together.  The amendment suggests that the reduction in the qualifying period from four to two years should be applied retrospectively from the 22nd January, 1971 with all the consequential payments arising being borne by the Redundancy Fund.  This was debated at length on Committee Stage and although I expressed my complete <Col N="779" /> opposition to the principle of retrospection on that occasion I did agree to have a further look at the question. In the meantime, I have seen no reason to change my view.  The further examination which I have made has served only to strengthen my conviction that retrospective application of benefit should not be accepted.  The principle is a bad one and its implementation could operate quite unfairly, give rise to numerous anomalies and grievances and I have established in this particular case that it would have serious financial implications for the Redundancy Fund.  These are the practicalities of the matter.</P>
      <P>I fully accept the point made on Committee Stage that some people will lose benefit because their dismissals took place between the 22nd January and the date on which the Bill when enacted will come into operation.  I have as much sympathy for the position of these workers as Deputies opposite but there would be hard luck cases no matter what dates were chosen.  One always has these.  It is a question of hoping that they will be at a minimum.  Some time must elapse between the circulation of a Bill and the enactment of it and nothing which Deputies have said would justify the backdating of the provisions of the Bill to cover persons declared redundant during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the financial position I mentioned on Committee Stage that while there was a surplus in the fund it was not such that it could be played around with to the extent of conceding retrospection.  Further examination since the Committee Stage has revealed that assuming retrospection were to cover the period 22nd January, 1971 to, say, 1st July, 1971, the cost would be rather high, more than the fund could afford.  Together with the future cost of the improvements proposed in the Bill this could seriously undermine the position of the fund. On Committee Stage I did point out that while we would appear to be making generous provision for the surplus to cover the improvements in this Bill, the Act has not been sufficiently long in force to enable us to <Col N="780" /> be quite certain that this surplus is likely to stand up to any future erosion and events since the beginning of the year &mdash; we have had quite a number of redundancies &mdash; would justify the decision I made at the outset.  As time goes on we will see that the surplus built up could be quite necessary.</P>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage the more industries one has the more redundancies one has.  I could foresee in years to come, when we have more industries, more mobility of people, more changing and chopping, that we might even find it necessary to raise the contribution to meet the requirements of this amending legislation.  I am quite serious when I say that we are straining the fund as much as possible without taking in retrospection and I am compelled to stand out against any retrospection in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The latest information we have about the Redundancy Fund is that there is £1.75 million in it.  The fund therefore would appear to <Col N="781" /> be in a somewhat healthy condition. We in the Labour Party are very concerned, in relation to a Redundancy Bill published in July, 1970 and not likely to have passed through both Houses until July, 1971, after which it has to go for Presidential signature, that a substantial number of workers who would normally benefit from the improved benefits under the Bill will not obtain them.  Our suggestion is that the commencement date should be the 21st January, 1971, which is fair and reasonable.  Indeed, as Deputy Cluskey pointed out we are not averse to accepting a later date, such as that on which the Report Stage is concluded, which we hope will be today.  I make this point because of the legislative mess-up which has occurred in the Houses of the Oireachtas and which is not the responsibility of the Labour Party.  We therefore feel there should be some finality in regard to the commencement date and accordingly we ask the Minister to consider the matter again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>4. &mdash; The following subsections are hereby inserted in section 4 of the Principal Act and shall be deemed to have been enacted in that Act:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2A)  If an employee was or is in continuous employment on or subsequent to 22nd January, 1971 and his normal weekly hours of work in the period of 208 weeks ending on 22nd January, 1971 were not less than 21 hours, but were reduced below 21 by reason of redundancy, or in periods of redundancy, that employee shall be deemed to have been employed for at least 21 hours per week on 22nd January, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> (2B)  Payments (if any) to employees affected by subsection (2A) by reason of redundancy before the commencement of this Act shall be made from the Redundancy Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is to deal with the phenomenon known as creeping redundancy, a piece of jargon coined by the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal and used in Britain, Northern Ireland and here.  As we pointed out previously we can have a situation where over a considerable period a worker may be in continuous employment but his normal weekly working hours will be less than 21 per week.  The employer may possibly, anticipating future redundancy, reduce the hours of work of the employee below 21 hours.  The hours may be reduced also by redundancy itself or by periods on short time and subsequently a worker becomes disqualified for redundancy payments. This is the intent of amendment No. 4 and we have already given to the Minister a number of cases in relation to Noonan v. Dwyer and Deasy v. the B and I as illustrations of particular cases where the Redundancy Appeals Board commented on this matter.  We have accordingly tabled amendment No. 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is similar to one which was defeated on Committee Stage.  As I explained then, it was never intended, when the 1967 Act was passed, that persons who were not normally expected to work for the same employer for the requisite number of hours at the time should be covered by the Act.  This amendment would involve a lesser degree of retrospection than the Committee Stage amendment but it, nevertheless, provides for some retrospection from a date three years prior to the 22nd January.  I must oppose this amendment, in conformity with my decision regarding retrospection generally.  I should like to state again that the position at the 1st January, 1968 and the category of workers to which the amendment applies is already adequately covered in the existing legislation. Under the Act, as it stands, employees whose hours of work with the same employer are substantially reduced <Col N="783" /> to less than 21 hours in a week are entitled to claim redundancy payments on the basis that the conditions of employment have worsened. Employers cannot, therefore, deliberately evade responsibility under the Act.  They cannot evade responsibility by progressively reducing the working hours of the employees, if this is what the Deputy dealt with when speaking of creeping redundancy.  If they do this, they leave themselves open to immediate claims for redundancy payments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>4. &mdash; (1)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of section 9 of the Principal Act, an employee shall be entitled to terminate his contract of employment in circumstances of uncertainty in which it is reasonable for the employee to anticipate dismissal for redundancy (whether or not he has received notice of dismissal or protective notice of dismissal or lay-off) if it is reasonable for the employee to expect that his remaining in the employment would seriously prejudice his prospects of obtaining suitable alternative employment which became available and was unlikely to remain vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where, in the circumstances specified in this section the employee has received an offer in writing from the employer and on a reference to the Tribunal it appears to the Tribunal, having regard both to the reasons for which the employee seeks to leave the employment and those for which the employer requires him <Col N="784" /> to continue in it, to be just and equitable that the employee should receive the whole or part of a redundancy payment, the Tribunal may determine that there shall be paid to the employee &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the whole of the redundancy payment to which the employee would have been so entitled, or</P>
    <P>(b)  such part of that redundancy payment as the Tribunal thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Here, again, we are back to a proposition which we put to the Minister on Committee Stage.  Under amendment No. 5 we want to give protection to employees in what might be regarded as a situation of constructive redundancy, if I might use that phrase.  Where a person legitimately and in perfectly good faith anticipates that he is going to be declared redundant, and where his employer also is aware that at a future date he will be obliged to declare an employee redundant and where that worker acting in a perfectly normal, legitimate manner obtains alternative employment he should not automatically lose his redundancy benefit.  Deputy Cluskey and I have spoken very strongly on this matter.  We had the support of Deputy P. Belton on Committee Stage.  We pointed out that there is provision in section 20 of the Northern Ireland Act whereby an employee should be entitled, without prejudice, to terminate his contract of employment in general circumstances where he can reasonably anticipate dismissal by redundancy and, at the same time, he would not in any way, under the circumstances, lose his entitlement.  I put it to the Minister that in circumstances of industry in modern Ireland with the relevant scarcity of vacancies we should try in redundancy legislation to ensure that workers who are anticipating redundancy are given every incentive to obtain suitable alternative employment as and when it becomes available, particularly where it can be said that a job might not be held vacant for a period and where a worker knows that there is a vacancy, and also that his own employer has not yet declared him redundant.  Such a worker should be in a position to go to an employer and <Col N="785" /> the employer may say: &ldquo;Yes, you will be redundant in two months time, but I will now declare you redundant.  You then proceed to alternative employment and you obtain your redundancy compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have found it difficult to get across to a large body of opinion, and even to trade union opinion, that because a worker changes a job he automatically gets redundancy payment on the basis of being declared redundant, and although he proceeds immediately to alternative employment he qualifies for redundancy payment by virtue of the length of service and the social rights which he had accumulated in that job, and he gets redundancy payment on being redundant and on moving from one job to another.  Most people say: &ldquo;He has a job.  Why should he get redundancy payment?&rdquo;  This is not the purpose of the Redundancy Payment Act.  It is to give people a terminating entitlement which they are entitled to by virtue of accumulated social rights in their employment in a payment of a transfer nature or in some cases where it must be a payment of an almost terminating nature where they might not be able to get employment subsequently.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this provision in amendment No. 5 is in section 20 of the Northern Ireland Act.  We have taken it straight from that Act.  It is a transcription from it and the lengthy amendment which we have down would make the whole Bill more flexible. It would give employers a greater incentive to be utterly honest with their employees and to tell them precisely what their prospects are in the future.  It would enable workers anticipating redundancy to obtain alternative employment as soon as possible and in circumstances which would be socially acceptable and of benefit to Irish industry, to employees and to employers in Irish industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate on this amendment, I expressed my very strong opposition to the amendment on a number of grounds.  At the same time, I undertook to consider the matter further and having regard specifically to statements made by the Labour Deputies <Col N="786" /> that provisions similar to those in the amendment were contained in Northern Ireland redundancy legislation. I have since confirmed, as I thought when this matter was being discussed previously in the House, there are no similar provisions in the Northern Ireland Act.  The Act contains a section which provides for the award of full or partial redundancy payments to employees, but in circumstances that have no relation to those described in this amendment. In fact, the section in question applies to employees who have already received notices of dismissal or redundancy or who have themselves served notices of intention to claim redundancy payments by reason of lay-off or short time, who then take part in strikes and are summarily dismissed by their employers because of participation in strikes.  The only resemblance between the amendment and the section of the Northern Ireland Act is that both provide for the award of partial redundancy payments by tribunals.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that, apart from the other objections to the amendment, I am opposed to fragmentation or partial redundancy in any case.  The only thing the amendment and the Northern Ireland Act have in common is that the amendment provides for partial redundancy and the Northern Ireland Act, in different circumstances, also provides for partial redundancy.</P>
      <P>The amendment is related to situations in which employees terminate their employment, whereas the section of the Northern Ireland Act applies to cases of summary dismissals by employers. Accordingly, there is no case for accepting the amendment by reference to legislation in Northern Ireland and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> Amendment No. 6 arises as a result of amendment No. 9 tabled by the Labour Party on Committee Stage, a revised form of which has been tabled for Report Stage as amendment No. 7. I accepted the general principle of the earlier amendment which was designed to cover cases where offers by the new holders of agencies, franchises, <i>et cetera</i> are made shortly after the employee's contract with the previous owner has been terminated, as well as before termination.  I indicated that I thought it would be desirable to place some time limit&mdash;for example, four weeks from the period after the employee's contract with the previous owner is terminated&mdash;during which an offer might be made by the new owner. My amendment deals with the matter on the basis of four weeks, which I hope will be acceptable to the Labour Party in view of the terms of their revised amendment.  A period of four weeks is featured throughout the Bill and I think this is reasonable.  I think I am meeting more than half-way the Labour Party amendment No. 7.</P>

      <P>In page 3, between lines 41 and 42, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where an employee is or was employed by a sub-contractor who (under contract or otherwise) is liable to another person (in this section referred to as the principal) and that employee is subsequently employed by the principal, the employee's continuity of employment shall have effect as if the sub-contractor and the principal were the same person.</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Contract&rsquo; includes a contract or arrangement&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to carry out work or operations of any kind,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> (b)  to be answerable for the carrying out of such operations by others whether under sub-contract to him or under other arrangements made, or to be made by him, or</P>
    <P>(c)  to furnish his own labour or the labour of others in the carrying out of such operations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is one we wish the Minister to consider seriously.  The amendment is designed to give protection where an employee is, or was, employed by a sub-contractor and liable to another person.  When the employee is employed subsequently by the principal, the employee's continuity of employment should have effect as though the sub-contractor and the principal were the same person. On Committee Stage we pressed this matter and we are surprised that the Minister has not seen the merit in the general proposition.  There are tabulated a number of instances where this kind of development took place, where an employee was told one day that his contract of employment was terminated and that the company was gone.  On the following day a new company took over and the man continued working with them.  Automatically, this man was not covered under the Act and we brought to the notice of the Minister a number of such instances where manifest injustice had occurred from the point of view of redundancy.  On Committee Stage Deputy Belton supported our amendment and he gave the example of a painting contractor who was doing a job for a builder, or even a builder if he was sub-contracting.</P>
    <P>This amendment is worthy of support. The Minister should do everything possible to try to cover the loopholes which exist.  If this is not done any unscrupulous individual who may wish to do so may take advantage of this situation.  One meets such individuals in every walk of life and the law has an obligation to provide elementary protection.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  Examples mentioned by Deputy Desmond occur frequently in the building industry&mdash;<Col N="789" /> perhaps more than in any other industry. Frequently an electrician, a plasterer, a plumber, or a painter may take over a contract, they underestimate the cost and straight away they are out of business.  In some cases the builder might take over the men and employ them directly or allow someone to come in and employ them.  The proposers of this amendment are quite correct and I would ask the Minister to consider the amendment.  In addition he could make inquiries from builders and he will find out that the cases I have mentioned occur frequently.  In any building job it can happen once or twice with different sub-contractors.</P>

      <P>When this amendment was debated on Committee Stage, I indicated I could not accept it and I gave many reasons for my decision.  Therefore, I am surprised at the view expressed by Deputy Desmond.  My reasons were that it would be unfair to compel employers legally to assume liability for employees of sub-contractors over whom they have no control.  Such employees have been safeguarded since the 1967 Act.  I do not think there is any real reason for taking this amendment seriously.  As far as I have been able to ascertain it would be most unfair to ask employers to take responsibility for the employees of sub-contractors over whom they would have no control anyway.  It appears that there was some confusion regarding this matter on Committee Stage and Deputy Tully pressed it very strongly.  Without committing myself, I promised then to have a further look at the matter but having done so, I can see no reason why I should change my mind.  While such a provision could seriously inconvenience employers, the employees in question are adequately covered. This is a very important part of the whole approach and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> (1)  Where before, on or after 1st January, 1968, an employee was employed by a Company which was wound up, liquidated, sold or otherwise ceased business or ceased to employ the employee, and the owner, or a director, or a person who had a controlling interest in that Company, dismissed an employee in circumstances of redundancy and within 52 weeks renews the employee's contract of employment or re-engages the employee under a similar or new contract with another Company of which he is the owner, director or has a controlling interest, the employment of that employee shall be deemed to have been continuous.</P>
    <P>(2)  Payment (if any) to employees affected by this section who were dismissed by reason of redundancy before the commencement of this Act shall be made from the Redundancy Fund.</P>
    <P>We are surprised that it is necessary for us again to press the content of amendment No. 9.  Surely the Minister will agree that, as outlined directly in the amendment, where employees were employed by a company that was sold, went into liquidation or otherwise ceased business, the employees would lose their redundancy entitlement. There have been instances of this having happened.  Take, for instance, a building contractor aware that at a future date he might find himself going into liquidation or putting up the whole job for general takeover.  If workers continue to work for him up to the last day of his association with the business they will find, if they report for duty next morning, that they have a new employer.  The new employer might well be the wife or the son of the contractor but the company becomes automatically a new company in questionable circumstances.  The employees of such a firm would lose their redundancy entitlement.  Surely this is a situation in respect of which the Minister should have introduced an effective amendment.  We have cited the case of Hehir v. J. and G. Murphy of Cork.  I mention those names merely as a case study.  There were other instances given to the Minister such as the case of <Col N="791" /> Darby v. Jacobs.  Although the Minister may plead that this provision would be contrary in some respects to the concept of limited responsibility in common law, in the case of any employer who goes out of business or any company that is sold or that goes into liquidation or otherwise, not only a moral obligation should be inherited by somebody who continues to have a controlling interest in the new company or who is involved in it but a very definite obligation should be put into statutory form.  Otherwise, the irregularities which the Minister referred to on Committee Stage may occur.  The Minister said that we could be legislating here to overcome the irregularities or malpractices of a few people. Surely that is the purpose of legislation. If this particular amendment is not accepted it is possible that the preservation of the continuity of employment will not be given the kind of protection that we consider to be desirable. Accordingly, we recommend the amendment strongly to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support this amendment to a certain extent only.  I say this because in the case of a person who owned a business or who had a controlling interest in a business, he should be regarded as having been associated with the business that was liquidated if he continues to have a controlling interest in that business. However, I disagree that in the case of the director of a company there should be the obligation on him of the continuity of employment.  There have been many cases where people have been nominated to serve as a director on the board of a company because of their particular knowledge or business ability but who might have no shares whatever in the company.  Therefore, I do not think the word &ldquo;director&rdquo; should be included here.  Otherwise I would support the amendment but I do not think that either the Minister or anybody else could support it while the word &ldquo;director&rdquo; is included as well as the owner and a person having a controlling interest.  This would be against the interest of companies and, indeed, against the country generally. I agree with the part of the amendment <Col N="792" /> which refers to an employee being entitled to continuity of employment in the case of the owner of the company or a person having a controlling interest in it.  The Minister should consider the amendment in this light.</P>

      <P>This is another amendment that was debated at considerable length on Committee Stage. While I agreed to have another look at it, I am afraid I must say that I cannot find any reason for accepting the terms of the amendment.  I must still oppose it because, if accepted, it could have very serious implications for employers.</P>
      <P>The amendment is objectionable in principle for two reasons as has been stated already by Deputy Belton.  It is contrary to the concept of limited liability&mdash;a concept that is basic to company law&mdash;and also it is objectionable because it seeks to impose liabilities with retrospective effect.  In practice, too, the arrangement proposed in the amendment would penalise those very persons who try to help workers if they lose their jobs.  Companies ceasing business for one reason or another usually try to find employment for the employees and the majority of companies are very helpful in trying to absorb employees who have been made redundant.  There may be isolated cases where persons would set out deliberately to use the situation in order to save themselves but we cannot legislate for exceptions in a way that would victimise the majority.  It is impossible to have watertight legislation.  A person inclined towards circumventing the terms of the Bill will always find a loophole.  I do not think we would be justified in making a provision for what might be an isolated case and I cannot therefore accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  The Tribunal shall, after consultation with any person or body charged by statute with the fixing or determination of minimum wages or rates of pay, or the <Col N="793" /> registration of employment agreements under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, have regard to any such minimum as is appropriate or relevant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 is a happy situation. When the Labour Party amendment No. 15 was being discussed on the Committee Stage.  I indicated I had sympathy with the general intention behind it that the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal should in assessing redundancy payment entitlements have regard to pay rates which are binding under some particular Statute but I said I would have to look further at the wording.  In particular I said I wanted to ensure that the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal would not be charged with the responsibility of deciding what the correct statutory minimum wage would be in an individual case.  In other words this should remain the function of the appropriate wage-fixing body.  There has been some misunderstanding as to what I had in mind when I expressed this reservation.  I was not suggesting, as I feel may have been the impression, that the Labour Party amendment would empower the tribunal to fix rates of wages for individual workers or groups of workers.  The point I did not think the amendment was not entirely clear on was whether it was intended the tribunal should be empowered to interpret the application of wage rates fixed by other bodies in individual cases.  I do not consider the tribunal should be required to interpret orders in that way but it should consult the appropriate wage-fixing body as to what the correct statutory minimum wage is in each case.  The amendment which I have tabled meets the general intention of the Labour Party amendment while making it clear that the correct statutory minimum wage rates would continue to be determined by the appropriate body in each case.  In the circumstances, I am sure the Labour Deputies will welcome the official amendment.  The amendment also covers wage rates specified in agreements under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following section is hereby substituted for section 12 of the Principal Act:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;12.&mdash;(1)  An employee shall not be entitled to redundancy payment by reason of having been laid off or kept on short-time unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he has been laid off or kept on short-time for four or more consecutive weeks or, within a period of 13 weeks, for a series of six or more weeks of which not more than three were consecutive, and</P>
      <P>(b)  after the expiry of the relevant period of lay-off or short-time mentioned in paragraph (a) and not later than four weeks after the cessation of the lay-off or short-time, he gives to his employer notice (in this Part referred to as a notice of intention to claim) in writing of his intention to claim redundancy payment in respect of lay-off or short-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where, after the expiry of the relevant period of lay-off or short-time mentioned in subsection (1) (a) and not later than four weeks after the cessation of the lay-off or short-time, an employee to whom that subsection <Col N="795" /> applies, in lieu of giving to his employer a notice of intention to claim, terminates his contract of employment either by giving him the notice thereby required or, if none is so required, by giving him not less than one week's notice in writing of intention to terminate the contract, the notice so given shall, for the purposes of this Part and of Schedule 2, be deemed to be a notice of intention to claim given in writing to the employer by the employee on the date on which the notice is actually given.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>All these amendments are consequential amendments on No. 11.  Government amendment No. 11 arises from my consideration of amendment No. 26 tabled by the Labour Party on the Committee Stage, which has now been retabled for the Report Stage as amendment No. 22.  I accepted the general principle of the earlier amendment in the interests of simplifying procedures for employees who wished to claim redundancy payments by reason of lay-off or short-time.  I said I would like to consider the drafting further as the provisions in the 1967 Act with which the amendment was concerned were rather complex and some consequential amendments would also be necessary.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 meets the general intention of the Labour Party amendment by providing that, in future, one notice from an employee to his employer, instead of two as at present, will be sufficient to set a claim in motion.  The amendment does this in a slightly different way from that proposed in the Labour Party amendment but the end result is the same.</P>
    <P>One point of difference between the two amendments which I might mention is that the Government amendment contains a provision under which a claim for a redundancy payment by reason of lay-off or short-time must be served within four weeks of the cessation of the lay-off or short-time, whereas the Labour Party amendment has no similar restriction.  That is really the <Col N="796" /> four weeks coming up again.  The four-week limit is intended to cover cases where employees resume work after periods of lay-off or short-time.  In practice, it does not apply to the situation where an employee after lay-off or short-time is finally dismissed by his employer.  In such cases that would be determined under the ordinary provisions and procedures relating to claims rather than on the lay-off or short-time arrangements.</P>
    <P>Neither would it affect the other type of situation which could arise for an employee, for example, where the lay-off or short-time is continued indefinitely. In such a situation, the employee would retain the right to claim a redundancy payment as the lay-off or short-time would still be in operation.</P>
    <P>The four-week limit which was included in the 1967 Act in a slightly different form is necessary and desirable to ensure that employers are not left open to claims for redundancy payments for indefinite periods.  I pointed that out on the Committee Stage.  I am sure Labour Deputies will agree that the provision is not unreasonable since their main objective is being met in amendment No. 11.  I take it Deputies will be prepared to agree to the Government amendment and withdraw their own.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of amendment No. 11 also involves the acceptance of a number of other consequential amendments: 16, 21, 23, 28, 30, 32, 34 and 37 and a related amendment No. 27. As these are all consequential, the acceptance of No. 11 would automatically involve the acceptance of these.</P>

      <P>We accept the Minister's amendment and the consequential amendments.  The drafting of the amendment is clear-cut.  One general query I would like to raise with the Minister is that reference to the cessation of the lay-off could be construed as reference to a general cessation, although it would seem the references are intended to apply in relation to the employee concerned.  As the words &ldquo;in relation to the employee&rdquo; appear elsewhere in the Bill the absence of similar wording in this section might well be interpreted to mean that the <Col N="797" /> section applies to the generality and not to the particular.  We have given the Minister notice of our intention to raise this matter and perhaps he could meet the query.  Unfortunately Deputy Tully who would probably elaborate on that aspect of the amendment is not able to attend this morning.  It appears that the new 12 (2) as drafted applies to circumstances where an employee who has been laid off discovers that he was being replaced by a new employee. In such circumstances there should be an obligation on the employer to in-form the employee of the cessation of the lay-off.  Would the Minister comment on that?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 53, to add the following to subsection 2:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that the time limits for making a claim for a lump sum shall not apply if the employer has failed to give the statutory notice under section 17 or the Redundancy Certificate under section 18&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this amendment we come back again to a very serious aspect of redundancy legislation.  It is absolutely vital that legislation should provide that the time limit for making a claim for a lump sum shall not apply if an employer has failed to give the statutory notice under section 17 or the redundancy certificate under section 18.  The Minister's view is that by extending the period to 52 weeks and to 104 weeks he is in fact putting in a very good medium provision.  We believe there should be no particular time limit.  In our view this amendment is even more necessary now because the amendment immediately <Col N="798" /> following will prohibit weekly payments as well as lump sums where employees' claims are late because an employer has not complied with his statutory duty.</P>
    <P>Where an employer has failed to give statutory notice or provide the appropriate certificate employees should be entitled to recover subsequently from such an employer. After all, such an employer is guilty of negligence and possibly evasion. The Bill does not go far enough.  If I owe money to somebody I can hardly assume that after 52 weeks or 104 weeks my obligation in law ceases to exist.  As far as I am concerned, redundancy payments are of the same character and we should not have one law for ordinary debts and another law for redundancy debts.  A couple of hundred pounds to a worker could mean the difference between having some kind of future while he tries to get another job, or no future at all, or even emigrating in search of alternative employment.  This is a social situation in which the Minister should bend over backwards to provide statutory protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would abolish altogether the time-limit on claims for lump sums.  I could not accept it.  It is neither necessary nor desirable.  This whole matter was debated at great length on the Committee Stage and I pointed out then that section 10 provides for a very generous extension of the time within which an employee must lodge a claim. The extension runs from the existing 30 weeks to 52 weeks, and to 104 weeks, if it can be proved to the satisfaction of the Appeals Tribunal that the delay arose through reasonable cause.  This is a very generous extension. A fair balance must be preserved and, in my opinion, this represents a fair balance between the interests of employers and those of employees.  I am satisfied this provision is quite adequate to protect the position of employees whose claims are delayed and nothing the Deputy has said convinces me the amendment is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister once again look at this amendment <Col N="799" /> from the point of view of the worker who finds after two years that he was, in fact, entitled to what could be a considerable sum of money? Either through ignorance on his own part of because of negligence on the part of the employer, a worker, as a result of the provisions which we have asked to have amended, could be in danger of losing a considerable sum of money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond suggested that the Statute of Limitations, which applies to ordinary business debts, does not apply here.  The worker is being asked to accept a two-year period whereas business people have a seven-year period and even after that period, if they resurrect the debt by way of civil bill or otherwise, they can get an extension of the time.  I am asking the Minister to look at this from the point of view of possible application of the Statute of Limitations to these cases.  There is a good case for it.  As has been pointed out, the instances in which this will occur will be very few but there could be great hardship as a result of neglect by an employer or because of lack of knowledge or plain ignorance of the law on the part of employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give any hope at all of considering this later?  I can understand his extreme reluctance to accept the entire amendment but I think he should consider inserting the 104 weeks.  He brought the period up from 30 weeks to 52 weeks and, in exceptional cases, to 104 weeks and if we had a formal conclusion fixing it at 104 weeks in all cases it would be a considerable improvement.  Deputy Kavanagh pointed to the application of the Statue of Limitations and this adds even greater weight to the views of the Labour Party on this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act, an employee shall <Col N="800" /> not be entitled to a weekly payment unless he has become entitled to a lump sum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, an amended form of which has been repeated in section 10 of the 1970 Bill provides a time limit on claims for redundancy lump sum payments but the time limit does not specifically cover weekly payments. Persons whose claims for lump sums have failed because of the time limit provision can, under existing legislation, be regarded as being eligible for weekly payments.  I feel there is a strong argument in favour of extending the time limit to weekly payments as well as to lump sums. That simply is why the amendment has been put down.  I said on Committee Stage that I intended to bring it in.  A person who is dismissed through redundancy should be entitled to a lump sum and weekly payments or should not be entitled to redundancy payments at all.  The existing situation is completely anomalous.  There is a very generous extension of the time limit in section 10 and this should give ample opportunity to employees to establish entitlements to redundancy lump sums in future.  I think the logic of this amendment is obvious to everybody.</P>

      <P>In page 9, at the reference to section 2, to add the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The addition of the following definitions:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(a) &ldquo;offer&rdquo; in relation to re-engagement or renewal of a contract of employment or an offer of employment, means a written offer, received by the employee.</P>
      <P>(b) &ldquo;diminish&rdquo; in Part 2, means either temporarily or permanently and from whatever cause.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks two additional definitions.  We have put the definitions to the Minister and the first part of this amendment puts a new definition of the term &ldquo;offer&rdquo; for the Minister's consideration. We thrashed this out on Committee Stage and suggested to the Minister that the term &ldquo;offer&rdquo; in relation to re-engagement or renewal of a contract of employment should mean a written offer received by the employee. I think this is clear enough and that it streamlines most of the attitudes of the Labour Party in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposal in paragraph (a) of the amendment, this matter was discussed on Committee Stage when I said that in an ideal situation it would be desirable to have written offers not only from the employee's point of view but from that of the employer as well.  I stated, however, that I did not think it would be reasonable to expect employers to make all offers in writing and I referred to the obligation already existing in relation to section 15 of the 1970 Act in <Col N="802" /> relation to new contracts and so on.  I expressed the belief that the requirements of section 15 regarding written offers adequately protected the employee's interests in a situation where he requires protection, where the new contract being offered to him differs from the old.</P>
      <P>The Labour Deputies represented that in cases of dispute employers can and, in fact, do succeed in evading liability for redundancy payments by alleging that they made offers of re-engagement to employees that they did not, in fact, make.  Deputies have argued that the inclusion in the legislation of a requirement that all offers of re-engagement should be in writing would prevent employers from acting in that way, by establishing with certainty in each case whether or not an offer was made.</P>
      <P>We must face up to the fact that no matter what requirements are laid down there will always be conflicting arguments in particular cases as to whether or not offers were made or whether or not the terms of the offer were unsatisfactory.  I do not accept that the provisions of the 1967 Act permit wholesale evasion of the kind suggested or that such wholesale evasion has occurred.  I have already referred to the specific provisions of section 15 of the Act which afford valuable protection to employees in regard to offers of re-engagement.  The position of employees is now being further safeguarded by section 9 of the Bill which provides that for the purposes of a reference to the tribunal a person's employment shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been continuous and, if he has been dismissed, that it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the dismissal is due to redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other amendments put down by the Labour Party seek, for the purpose of dealing with exceptional cases, to impose wide obligations on employers.  I have stated time and again in the course of Committee Stage of the Bill that we must accept that employers have rights, too.  I consider that (a) of the amendment is unnecessary for employees and would be unfair to employers and I cannot accept it.  I also believe that the definition of &ldquo;diminish&rdquo;<Col N="803" /> in (b) is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it either.  I can see the intention behind the amendment, but it is really seeking to deal with detail that is already adequately covered and would not justify the imposition it would place on employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's reluctance to ask employers to make offers of employment in writing.  The only reason the Minister has stated is that it would be inconvenient. Surely such a small inconvenience, if it is an inconvenience at all, would be far more desirable than a conflict between an employer and an employee as to, first of all, whether there was an offer of alternative employment and, if so, what exactly were the terms of that alternative employment.  The Minister said that even with a written offer being made a dispute can arise.  Possibly that is true, but surely if one has something down in black and white it is much easier to determine what exactly the facts of the case are then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, like workers, they are not all wise, and to leave to the wisdom of an employer something that by implication the Minister has admitted is desirable and not include it in legislation is not acceptable.  I cannot understand why the Minister is sticking so hard on this amendment.  From any objective point of view it is a highly desirable amendment, that in the event of a dispute one is not going on the word of either party but one is able to see in black and white what exactly has been offered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

      <P>I put it to the Minister that nowadays even the smallest employer employs a clerk-typist or a typist or has a member of the family doing that type of work for him.  Therefore, it is no great harship to expect him to have some little form, or, perhaps, the Department of Labour could issue such a form, indicating <Col N="804" /> that an offer of re-engagement has been made.  With sums of £500 or more at stake as a result of a dispute in this matter we must look at the whole question of small items like this in relation to employment in a different light from that in which they were seen in the past.</P>
      <P>The old system, as in the parable, of just walking out to the man outside the vineyard and offering him employment should change after 2,000 years. At least let us get to the point where a notebook or a small form can be used and a name signed to it indicating that an offer of work has been made and that the person can start work on a certain date.  A provision to this effect would improve the whole Bill.  If this small change were made it would take away the vagueness that could arise with an employer as to the time and the date of the offer.  It would then be the employee's responsibility to look after this document, to put it away in his wallet, so that if a dispute arises he can produce it to the employer or to anybody else to whom he wants to prove that an offer of work was made.  We are not asking for any great sacrifice on the part of employers in seeking to have this amendment accepted. The number of times a person would be asked to sign such a form would be so few as to cause very little inconvenience to the employer.  I would commend the amendment to the Minister even at this stage.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the Minister might have another look at this before it reaches the Seanad. It is only fair and proper that, if we are going to modernise industrial relations, relations between employers and workers in terms of employment offers should be on a more formal basis. Otherwise there will be a great deal of casualness giving rise to much friction, tension and confusion between employers and employees as to what precisely was meant on a given occasion. I have in mind a particular case where a firm ceased and where an offer of employment was made.  But, of course, this was done verbally and the solicitor at the tribunal and in other negotiations, acting on behalf of the firm,  assured everybody that <Col N="805" /> because there was no written evidence the understanding of the employees in relation to their future prospects were, in fact, all wrong.  The Minister has already accepted in various sections the need for employers to make proposals in writing.  In relation to this particular section we are proposing that there should be a definition of the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; so that nobody would be under any illusions about it.</P>
      <P>We are now in 1971 when any job has of itself accumulated rights, when any job that is worth anything at all is worth a substantial amount of money per week, when industrial employment has major consequences in terms of income, social insurance of workers and redundancy payments. The principle that all relationships should be in writing, if necessary in a statutory form, is only elementary commonsense.  If it is a good enough for a managing director to offer to a sales manager a contract of employment in writing and if the Tony O'Reillys of this world can obtain magnificently paid employment in writing, as undoubtedly they do, and obtain it in the form of an official and statutory, contractually binding agreement, every other employee is entitled to the same kind of protection, the same rights, even if their incomes are not as magnificent. The Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It has not got any great advantage really.  An employer could very easily forget.  It is all right citing cases where a typist can type out a notice but there are many employers who are not organised like this.  There could be the case of a lorry driver working for a man who is out labouring himself every day.  One could visualise many cases where an employer could easily forget to give notice in writing.  I have no doubt that well-organised industries and big concerns would always give notice in writing but I am thinking of the small casual type of employer who, perhaps, employs one man and is engaged on the job himself.  He could easily forget.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reason for not accepting the amendment is totally unacceptable&mdash;the fact that an employer might forget, forget his obligation towards his employee whom he is about to dispense with.  I wonder what the Government's attitude would be towards a small employer who forgot to make his returns for turnover tax or income tax.  To dismiss like that a legitimate safeguard being sought for an employee is hardly a responsible attitude on the part of a Minister for Labour.  Unless the Minister can think of a more acceptable reason for rejecting this amendment, I think he would be doing himself an injustice in doing so.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not have a further look at it in view of the form generally suggested by the Department to employers?  The kind of form that should be used by employers is generally accepted by the Department and I see no reason why that should not be incorporated in the legislation. It is eminently reasonable that the Department should supply through <Col N="808" /> their local offices these simple forms which employers would fill in when giving notice and this would stop much of the conflict that arises between employer and employee on this question.</P>

    <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 24 and 25 together. These amendments relate to the new subsection 2A being introduced by the Bill into section 15 of the 1967 Act which provides that if an employee who is offered alternative work takes this work for a trial period of not more than two weeks and then refuses the offer his temporary acceptance shall not prejudice any plea by him that his refusal of the offer was reasonable. The Labour Party amendment (No. 25) seeks an extension from two weeks to four weeks of this trial period and was discussed on Committee Stage.  I said at the time that I considered a two-week trial period to be sufficient.  I have re-examined the position in the meantime and I am now agreeable to <Col N="809" /> providing for a four-week trial period. Amendment No. 24 provides for the necessary alteration in the Bill and will I presume be acceptable.  The amendment covers the intention of the Labour Party amendment No. 25.</P>

    <P>shall not exceed 90 per cent of that person's normal weekly remuneration; provided that a person shall not receive in respect of unemployment benefit, disability or sickness benefit, maternity allowance, unemployment assistance or supplementary benefit less than that to which that person would, but for this Act, have been entitled&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With your permission, I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 31 and 33 together.  I referred at the Committee Stage to my intention to introduce an amendment to the Bill at Report Stage to allow weekly redundancy payments to be made to residents of Northern Ireland who became redundant in the 26 Counties and to persons who became redundant in the 26 Counties but who subsequently go to reside in Northern Ireland.  In fact, two amendments are necessary to give effect to this intention.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 refers to paragraph 15 of the First Schedule to the 1967 Act, which specifies that a person <Col N="812" /> shall not be entitled to a weekly payment unless he is normally resident within the 26 Counties.  The proposed amendment will allow persons resident in Northern Ireland to avail themselves of their entitlement to weekly redundancy payments under the redundancy payments scheme.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 relates to paragraph 2 of the First Schedule to the 1967 Act, which specifies that weekly redundancy payments may be paid in addition to unemployment or other social welfare benefits but that the total of the weekly redundancy payments and of any social welfare payments may not exceed 90 per cent of preredundancy pay in any particular week.  The amendment is necessary to provide on grounds of equity that the 90 per cent income limit should also be applied to beneficiaries who reside in Northern Ireland.  That is the reason the second amendment is necessary.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, it will be necessary to have the assistance of the Northern Ireland authorities in verifying claims which arise. The Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Social Services has been consulted by my Department and has kindly promised full co-operation in the matter.</P>

    <P>This amendment is consequential on section 10 of the Bill relating to the time limit within which an employee may claim a redundancy lump sum payment from his employer.  Paragraph 20 of the Second Schedule to the 1967 Act provides that in a case where a lump sum is being claimed by the personal representative of a deceased employee a time limit of one year should be regarded as applying instead of the normal 30 weeks.  Section 10 of the Bill provides for the extension of the time limit applicable to claims for redundancy payments generally from 30 weeks to 52 weeks and, as was pointed out on the section, 104 weeks in certain cases where cause can be shown to the tribunal.  The specific extension of one year provided at paragraph 20 of Schedule 2 is no longer necessary and the paragraph can be deleted.  This amendment provides for that.  It is consequential.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The deletion of &lsquo;one-half of&rsquo; in paragraph (a).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a question of the lump sum payments.  In these amendments we suggest that there should be a lump sum of one week's pay for each year of employment and of two week's pay for each year of employment in the case of employees over 41 years of age.  Since the fund can be described as being in a healthy state, we consider that this would not impose any great burden on the fund, and would not require an employer to do anything more than what is just and reasonable in the case of employees who, through no fault of their own, are faced with the prospect of redundancy. We ask the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments would in effect result in the doubling of the amount of the lump sums payable under the Act.  A substantial increase of this nature, apart from its implications for the Redundancy Fund, which would be quite considerable, would place far too great a burden on industry generally.  Assuming the rate of redundancy were the same as has been experienced in the three years 1968, 1969 and 1970, it is estimated that the doubling of the lump sums would cost between £750,000 and £800,000 in a full year.  The Redundancy Fund would have to bear roughly £450,000 or more, and the employers the balance from their own resources.  This is a situation which I could not accept.  The additional benefits already proposed in the Bill, including improvements in the lump sum rates will, as has already been pointed out, cost the fund almost £500,000 a year.  I believe that it would be most unwise to give any further concessions in the present situation.</P>

Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage I accepted a Labour Party amendment substituting the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo; for &ldquo;service&rdquo; where it occurs in the first line of paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 to the 1967 Act.  The original Report Stage amendment No. 39 was tabled to provide for a further amendment of the same line of the paragraph.  It would be neater and I have been advised that, from a drafting point of view, it would also be more desirable, to have both points covered by a single amendment.  This is done in the new amendment No. 39, which makes the Labour Party amendment No. 40 unnecessary.  I recommend to the House amendments Nos. 39 and 45 which are entirely of a technical nature.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The deletion in paragraph 5 (1) (a) of &lsquo;78 consecutive weeks&rsquo; and the substitution of &lsquo;104 consecutive weeks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We suggest that by extending sick leaves or sick absences this would assist in preserving continuity where termination notices are given.  This is one of the main principles behind our approach to this amendment.  This would simply extend the period of absence due to disability which might have to be bridged between employment termination and the resumption of employment.  We suggest substituting 104 consecutive weeks for 58 consecutive weeks.  We think this is a reasonable time.  We consider that 78 consecutive weeks is not adequate and that it should run to two years.  This would be a very useful amendment if it were accepted by the Minister.  It probably would not apply to very many people who have been in employment for a long number of years but it would help some long service employees.  I do not think it would cost very much.  There would not be a great number of claims coming forward of a questionable nature.  This is a relatively minor improvement suggested by us but it would bring within the ambit of the Act a number of persons suffering from disability. This is a very socially desirable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was being discussed on Committee Stage I said I considered that the existing period 78 weeks was sufficient, <Col N="817" /> that I was not aware of any cases in which that period could cause hardship, and that it represented a balance between the thinking of various interests as to what period could be regarded as reasonable.  As a result of the further examination of the matter which I have carried out I have found no good reason to change this view.</P>
      <P>However, in order to correct any impression to the contrary that may exist, I should like to point out that the period of 78 weeks already laid down does not automatically commence when an employee has to absent himself from his employment because of illness.  This period commences only from the date of his dismissal by his employer after he becomes ill and, if he is not dismissed, there is no limit at all to the period for which he can be absent from work through illness and still preserve his continuity of employment. I am quite satisfied that the number of employers who would dismiss employees merely because they become ill is negligible and I believe also that any employer who would act in this way would almost certainly refuse to re-employ a worker after a long spell of illness if he thought that by doing so he would have to assume liability for the worker's previous service.  Quite honestly, I regard this amendment as unnecessary and unrealistic and I do not propose to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister should say that this amendment is unrealistic.  If a person is sick for 78 weeks he could be sick for a further 26 weeks.  Unfortunately, there are numerous people in hospitals, such as TB hospitals, for long periods. Long periods of illness are not uncommon. Fortunately, as a result of greater awareness in our health services in recent years, such cases are not as numerous as before but there are still people who spend very long periods in hospital. Surely when a person is ill we must make every possible exception for that person.  If a person is genuinely ill for any length of time in excess of 78 weeks, or even 104 weeks, I do not understand why the Minister would not accept an amendment that would allow <Col N="818" /> that person to be entitled to benefit under the scheme as soon as it was found, after a long period of illness, that he was dismissed.  Since the Minister says it is of little consequence he could extend the period by 26 weeks. It would not cause any inconvenience or any extra expense.</P>

      <P>By way of correction, Sir, I should not like the impression to be given that somebody with a protracted illness, like TB, would automatically be confined to the 78 weeks.  The 78 weeks does not commence from the date of illness but only from the date of dismissal and if dismissal does not occur there is no limit.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The insertion in paragraph 5 (1) (b) (i) of &lsquo;or dismissal&rsquo; after &lsquo;lay-off&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment should be acceptable to the Minister.  It applies to seasonal workers and we have put it in the section relating to the Defence Force Reserve.  In relation to the Defence Force Reserve perhaps the Minister could tell me if a worker does annual training and subsequently resumes employment to what extent can his employer claim that such annual breaks debar him from redundancy payments?  Recently I had a query from a prominent Transport Union member in County Tipperary who has given tremendous service to the State over the past 30 years and is deeply involved in the annual preparations for training of reserve forces and he has had great difficulty in regard to redundancy payment claims. I undertook to make inquiries and I may as well raise the point now.  The Minister should accept this amendment because otherwise it would not be consistent with the attitude in relation to other amendments which were accepted from the Labour Party.</P>

On amendment No. 20 on Report Stage I have already stated that I was satisfied that the position of casual workers is otherwise safeguarded under the legislation.  Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary.  I may say that the amendment, as drafted, has much more far-reaching implications than have been represented in support of it.  It would and could apply unfairly to employers in cases other than of seasonal or casual workers.  It would be contrary to a basic principle in the Act in relation to continuity of employment that except in very specific circumstances dismissal must be regarded as breaking continuity. Like other amendments put forward, it could have the effect of reducing the prospects of re-employment in some cases.  This is most important.  In regard to annual training for reserve members this does not break continuity of employment but the question of its being reckonable service is another matter.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The insertion after paragraph 6 of the following new paragraphs:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" />&lsquo;6A.  If an employee's employment is interrupted (including voluntarily leaving the employment) and the employee resumes employment at the employer's request, or with the employer's consent within 52 weeks, continuity of employment shall not be broken by such interruption.</P>
    <P>6B.  Where before or after 1st January, 1968, an employee is or was indirectly employed or engaged by an employer (through an agency, contract or otherwise) and subsequently that employee became employed directly by that employer, that employee's employment shall be deemed to be continuous.</P>
    <P>6C.  For the purposes of this Schedule employment at the same place of employment with successive employers shall be taken to be continuous, unless the employee voluntarily leaves the employment.</P>
    <P>6D.  For the purposes of this Schedule a &ldquo;take-over&rdquo; of an employee by an employer shall not break continuity of employment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment gives protection to women who leave employment voluntarily to get married, or to other employees who voluntarily leave employment and are subsequently invited to go back to that employment and then, when a change of management occurs, the new management plead that the person voluntarily left the employment and so broke continuity.  We have given the Minister a number of case studies, No. 37 of 1970 and No. 334 of 1969 and so on, and we pointed out that these case studies of tribunal decisions are entirely relevant and that a bone of contention has developed.  We are asking the Minister to provide for a voluntary interruption of employment and where the employee resumes at the request of the employer.  We suggest that provided that this happens within 12 months continuity should be preserved. This is in relation to Schedule 3 of the new Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not adopt the attitude which he adopted on Committee <Col N="821" /> Stage of total opposition.  Redundancy legislation is designed for the 1970s onwards for the rest of this century in which employment will be dramatically changed.  The work will dramatically change even in the next ten years. Circumstances of employment will change substantially with the growth of casual employment and the great growth of workers in employment.  This Act should be geared to anticipate as far as possible, future changes of employment. It is conceivable that an ever-increasing number of employees will come within the ambit of the amendment put down by the Labour Party.  We ask the Minister to consider the amendment sympathetically.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was debated on the Committee Stage I dealt with its four parts separately.  I propose to follow the same pattern now.  The Deputy will not expect me to go into the same detail.  I expressed my total opposition to the first part of the amendment, 6 (a). Nothing I have heard since would encourage me to change my viewpoint on that.  The proposal would have far-reaching implications.  It would be unfair to the employer to expect him to aggregate for redundancy payments purposes interrupted periods of employment, and particularly interruptions occurring as a result of deliberate decisions by the employees themselves to leave their employment voluntarily. Acceptance of the proposal would also tend to act as a disincentive to workers remaining in the same jobs and would be an incentive to shuttle around.</P>
      <P>I mentioned also on the Committee Stage that the proposal could act as a deterrent to workers being re-employed by former employers.  That is, perhaps, the most important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a suggestion in the second proposal, 6 (b), that the employer should be obliged to assume liabilities for redundancy payment purposes to employees of sub-contractors.  This has already been discussed in relation to amendment No. 8.  The proposal at 6 (c) is the most objectionable in principle. I can see no justification for saddling one employer with the liabilities incurred by another in a business with which he himself had no connection. <Col N="822" /> Finally, I must also reject 6 (d).  I am satisfied that employees in the situations which the amendment is designed to cover are already adequately protected by the legislation.  I see no need for the proposal.</P>
    <P>These are my comments on the four parts.  I regret that I cannot see anything reasonable in this amendment.  I think it is a lost amendment although I did undertake, at the Committee Stage, to have a look at it.</P>

      <P>May I point out that if one takes amendment No. 46 (a) here one can have an entirely casual situation developing where a woman, for example, goes to get married.  After a few weeks the employer may invite her back.  In the circumstances, the continuity of employment should be allowed to develop.  That is the kind of contingency which we have in mind. An employee may take leave or a woman may decide to get married and inform her employer who tells her &ldquo;Get married and come back to your job after a fortnight&rdquo;.  The continuity of employment is broken.  In the circumstances the legislation proposed is not progressive.  Amendment No. 46 (b) takes into account the question of sub-contractors' employees being taken on by the principal and amendment No. 46 (d) refers to the take-over of employees.  The Minister could certainly consider this particular section and amendment between now and the time when the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>

This is a technical point but trade union officers, employers representatives, and solicitors, handling the Redundancy Payments Act, as it will be called, will have to go through the tortuous layout of the Schedule.  Admittedly it has been very much improved.  I compliment and thank the Departmental staffs for having done good work in the simplification and laying out of a number of the Schedules and the amendments.  I would also urge strongly that the Minister should ask for a reprint of the Bill for administrative purposes as soon as possible.  This would be of assistance to those dealing with redundancy legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the introduction of references to the social welfare code on pages 10 and 11. These references should be deleted in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>These are my observations on the Bill itself.  I thank the Minister for accepting our amendments.  I should like to thank also two people outside this House who have given considerable assistance to the Labour Party Deputies in their briefing on this legislation. Mr. Patrick Murphy, President of the Federation of Rural Workers was of immense assistance in a painstaking manner to the Labour Deputies.  I thank also Mr. Donal Nevin, Assistant General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I should like to thank the Bills Office and the Departmental staffs for their patience and tolerance in dealing with the many amendments we put forward in relation to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to take every opportunity to stress publicly that the general philosophy behind redundancy payments is not that they should tide a worker over a period of unemployment.  We should like to see stressed by the Minister that the stated purpose of redundancy payments is to compensate for loss of security in employment and to encourage <Col N="824" /> industrial workers to accept the fact of redundancy without damaging relations between them and their employers.</P>
    <P>Since 1967 in relation to redundancy payments legislation, we have not stressed sufficiently the fact that a redundancy payment, either by lump sum or supplementary weekly benefits, is compensation for the loss of a right which any employee has intrinsically given to him in his job.  Those people who deal with social and industrial legislation do not draw sufficiently the comparison that just as a property owner has the right to compensation when he is deprived of his property, likewise any long-term employee should be regarded as having a similar right to compensation, a right to security and to obtain payment for the value he has put into the job.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as further amended, is meeting the highest aspirations of the Labour Party.  We have had to wait for 40 years for elementary Labour Party policy to be put into operation.  This Bill will lead to a general improvement in industrial relations and will compensate workers for loss of jobs, irrespective of whether that loss led to unemployment as such.  I welcome this debate; for members of the Labour Party it has been a valuable opportunity to participate in constructive legislation.</P>

    <P>12. In page 3, to delete lines 25 to 34 and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a statement in contravention of subsection (1) of this section is made by or on behalf of a group of persons, every person who is a member of the group and who consented to the making of the statement shall be guilty of an offence under that subsection.</P>

    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In the opinion of the Labour Party section 4 is the most objectionable section of a Bill which is thoroughly objectionable.  We are glad to see that our objections are shared by what appears to be the entire Opposition.  We object to the section as amended but basically to subsection (1) where it is stated:</P>
      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>The words used are &ldquo;encourages or advocates'; in other words, simply to encourage an offence is itself an offence.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tried to tell the Dáil that he has not introduced any new principle.  At column 209. Vol. 254 of the Official Report dated 26th May, 1971, the Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the offence has exact parallels in, and will operate along-side, the three common law offences of inciting, aiding and abetting, and counselling or procuring the commission of a crime.  These are concepts that have been firmly rooted in the common law for a very long time, and two of them, aiding and abetting and counselling or procuring, were imported into statute law generally by section 22 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, in relation to summary offences, and by the <Col N="826" /> Accessories and Abettors Act, 1861, in relation to indictable offences.  The words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; are considered more suitable in modern times to express the element that is common to all three offences.</P>
    <P>Later on the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that these offences exist, the inclusion of this subsection is justified on the grounds that there is a substantial deterrent effect to be derived from spelling out the law in clear terms in a modern statute.</P>
    <P>This is not a spelling book; it is a Bill. It is not for the purpose of spelling out the law; it is for the purpose of changing the law.  The Minister should not be allowed to get away with the concept that he is simply spelling out what the law already is.  He may be spelling out what he thinks the law is but that is a different matter.  If we accept this subsection we will be changing the law. It is clear to us all that there is a distinct difference between this and the statutes referred to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>To begin with, the Minister is speaking of Acts of Parliament of more than 100 years ago&mdash;Victorian Acts applicable to this country.  I do not imagine that the Minister thinks all Victorian Acts applicable to this country were sound or rooted in common law principles. Nonetheless, he is going back to these old Victorian Acts in this rather desperate quest which he has incited or encouraged his officials to find out something that could be of some help to him in this debate.  He has found this: that surely there is a marked difference between inciting, aiding and abetting the procuring of the commission of a crime and encouraging or advocating the commission of crime which is in fact constituted by this Act itself.  In general when we amend or attempt to revive what we deem to be the intent of a Victorian statute, we are doing something new because we are attempting to revive it in a very greatly changed social atmosphere.</P>
    <P>When the first of the measures to which the Minister referred was introduced we were still not very far from the days when small children could be <Col N="827" /> punished savagely for what we now regard as minor offences.  Therefore to revive this in a changed atmosphere, even if it has remained on the Statute Book for all those years, is in itself doing something new.  Of course it is not only a question of reviving it.  This is new language&mdash;encouraging or advocating are different from inciting as the Minister knows very well.  We do not know yet what extension can be given to these terms by the law enforcement officers or by the courts.  In particular there is a very serious difference between inciting, on the one hand, to common law offences and creating an entirely new offence and then making it another new offence to encourage or advocate that.</P>
    <P>We must consider what is the Minister's object in introducing this section. In moving his amendment he said:</P>
    <P>That object, as the House is aware, is to enable the Garda and the courts to deal with the organised intimidation and violence engaged in by subversive and quasi-political groups who encourage and promote acts of squatting and illegal occupation of property.</P>
    <P>In short this belongs, perhaps, to the rather unusual category of statutes which seem to be aimed at a particular group, perhaps an undesirable class in themselves.  What is the particular group?  It is clear from the language used by the Minister about subversive and quasi-political groups that this is aimed at a particular section&mdash;that section of the Sinn Féin IRA movement which has been active within the 26 Counties for what they believe to be social causes.  At the time that this Bill was in incubation, the Minister and the Government who, as we all know, were going through other internal travail wanted to be able to distinguish between one set of IRA Sinn Féin&mdash;those engaged in fish-ins, squatting and so on&mdash;and the others who might be active in relation to Northern Ireland, forms of activity that are intermittently justifiable from the point of view of Fianna Fáil in terms of wrapping the green flag round.  This Bill as a whole and this <Col N="828" /> section in particular is, I think, aimed at that group.  The Government are prepared to go to very great lengths when they face opposition which, for internal reasons, is embarrassing to them.  This Bill and, in particular, this section, is highly illustrative of how far they are prepared to go.  This section constitutes a clear incursion into the freedom of speech, freedom of the Press and freedom of association.  The words &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; and the section as a whole with its association clauses, make that perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister has been very casual about this.  He has made the point that the Press, for example, is amenable to the law.  This is true but the fact that the Press is amenable to the law does not justify any and every change in the law as affecting the Press.  In countries which have, as we hoped until recently we had here, clear and stable conventions of democratic government and civil liberties&mdash;might I, a Cheann Comhairle, ask for the Minister's attention.  If he wishes to chat, perhaps he would do so elsewhere. Have I a right to ask for the Minister's attention?  I wish to seek the Minister's attention if it can be vouchsafed to me as a Member of this House?  The Minister is now resuming his conversation and treating this House with the contempt with which it is customary for him to treat it.</P>

      <P>The creation of this new offence of encouraging or advocating is, no doubt, in the Minister's mind aimed at a particular category of the Press, to wit, the Sinn Féin-IRA section but it necessarily involves or may involve the Press as a whole. In particular once this becomes law any person who simply says&mdash;and it might be a question of a member of a <Col N="834" /> religious order or an editor of a paper &mdash;that a man who cannot provide shelter for his children except by squatting has a right to squat, is committing, <i>ipso facto</i> under this an offence and it is an offence affecting all the colleagues of the person in question.  I believe it is a generally accepted moral principle that parents whose children's health may be in danger are justified in taking all steps necessary to secure their shelter and this applies to squatting if necessary in certain circumstances.  I do not know whether this moral principle is to be regarded as repealed by this measure.  I do not know whether the Minister recognises the existence of the moral principle.  I do not know whether he has ever heard of it, but it does appear that simply to assert this principle would be a case of encouraging or advocating a breach of the section.</P>
      <P>This surely carries us quite a long way from the kind of incitement envisaged in the Victorian statutes to which the Minister referred.  I do not, for example, know whether if a clergyman were to enunciate what I have just referred to as a moral principle, which I believe is a moral principle, he and the members of his religious body would be liable to prosecution. Perhaps in those circumstances he would become a so-called cleric.  In general, the clergy in this country are treated with enormous respect except in the rare cases where some of them come in conflict with Fianna Fáil ideas on property rights when their ecclesiastical status drops sharply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The style in which the Bill has been handled by the Minister and in particular this section constitutes yet another example in the great many that we have seen over the past year or more of the general erosion of normal standards of democratic practice and of civil liberties in this country.  I believe there must be many people in the Government Party, not all of whom are quite as arrogant and insensitive as the Minister on this kind of issue, who must have qualms about this and I hope they will begin thinking about it again.  We must, however, assume that given the Government's majority this <Col N="835" /> Bill and this section will be passed despite our votes.  If that happens I hope the constitutionality of this Bill and particularly of this section will be tested at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The ministerial amendment to this section has been accepted by the House. Instead of improving the section, which is objectionable in the extreme, the amendment, in my opinion, takes away safeguards from the defendant instead of giving them to him.  As the section stood, an accused person, who is a member of a group on behalf of which a statement had been made, knew that (a) if he dissociated himself from the statement as soon as possible, or (b) if he showed that the statement was made without his knowledge, or (c) that it was made without his consent, he had an absolute defence. The Minister in what is, I am sure, a well-intentioned effort to improve the objectionable section has brought in this amendment but the position will be that it will be necessary to show that the person charged consented to the making of the statement.  I refer to subsection (2) of the amendment.</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) it is provided that the court may hold that consent has been proved if it has looked at all the circumstances surrounding the publication of the statement unless the accused person gives an adequate explanation. That is so gloriously vague that it is quite impossible to say precisely what it means and, while it might provide material for an empty argument in the courts when this section comes up for interpretation, I do not think it is the type of legislation this House should put on the Statute Book because I believe it will be impossible to say what an adequate explanation is.  The House should not indulge in the practice of putting vague sections on the Statute Book because that tends to bring the law into disrepute in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I suppose, correct to say that the Minister saw the force of the objections taken to the section as drafted and he thought that, by introducing this amendment, he was improving the <Col N="836" /> position.  I am of the opinion that, instead of improving the position, this will have the opposite effect.  I have given this considerable thought.  I shall certainly oppose the section; I made my opposition perfectly clear on Second Reading and also on the last day this Bill was before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 4, subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;?  There are umpteen ways by which a person could encourage others to do things.  It has been said that the housing situation is far from satisfactory.  Deputies know that people who are inadequately housed can work themselves into states about their condition; they can feel very strongly that other people should not be too well housed while they have no houses.  They can feel very strongly about houses being used as offices or being converted into office blocks while they live in dwellings which are no better than hovels.  If a person in a public position, or the editor of a newspaper, who felt strongly about housing conditions here and stated publicly that it was an absolute disgrace that people should continue to live in hovels while buildings which could be used as dwelling houses were being converted into office blocks, and he said that was not good enough, should not be tolerated and people should not stand for it, he could, I think, find himself in court accused of encouraging people to go in and take possession of these buildings, of encouraging men with wives and children to go into these buildings and house themselves there.  If we put this sort of section into this Bill this will be the thin end of the wedge in the destruction of freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between encouraging and advocating, a thin difference, perhaps, but it is a difference. This section is unnecessarily wide.  If any person speaks on behalf of a group, an association or an organisation he will be guilty of an offence.  We are a very well organised <Col N="837" /> society and there are many organisations of one kind or another.  Under this section, as amended and as the Minister seeks to enact it, a whole political organisation could find itself in trouble just because one member of the organisation sought to speak on behalf of the entire organisation. That has happened.  What will be the position if a member of the Fianna Fáil Party goes into print and gives what he believes to be the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and advocates what he thinks the Fianna Fáil Party should be doing?  He might feel so strongly about the housing situation that he might say that, if this situation continues, people are morally entitled to go into these houses and take possession of them.  Will that mean that the whole Fianna Fáil Party will be hauled before the courts and charged with encouraging the commission of a crime unless everybody, from the Taoiseach down, is prepared to go into court and give what the Minister is pleased to call &ldquo;an adequate explanation&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It may be said I am taking a very extreme view and that, of course, that would not happen.  If it is to happen in the case of Sinn Féin or any other group it should happen in respect of the Government Party if the case should arise.  If a member of Fine Gael or Labour or Fianna Fáil feel so strongly about the housing situation or the fishing situation and if that member says there is a moral right for the Irish people to proper housing, and they have a right to housing in preference to office blocks, or if he should say that the people have a moral right to fish the waters and that no absentee landlord is entitled to stop them, is he to be deemed to be speaking for the entire party of which he is a member unless he comes in and gives an adequate explanation?</P>
    <P>That is what we are writing into the Act, what we are putting in the Statute Book.  I feel very strongly against the whole section.  I think it is quite unnecessary.  Certainly the word &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; is so gloriously vague that I do not know what it is <Col N="838" /> and I have not had a good explanation from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that when the Government seek to strengthen the criminal law they do not know where to stop. They lift the proverbial sledgehammer to kill the fly.  That is the sort of thinking, the sort of draftsmanship, which brings the entire law into disrepute. I never saw a section which could be less justified.  It is no use the Minister sitting up there and saying he is legislating for an illegal organisation. He is legislating for any organisation that may come within the net of this section when it leaves this House. That is what we should bear in mind. It is what the Opposition should fight against and it is the sort of argument the Minister should listen to.</P>
    <P>I certainly do not want to drag up the events of last year for the sake of dragging them up but in one field or another there were certain people in the Minister's party who advocated things which the Taoiseach or other members of the party did not agree with.  Are all the members to be guilty by association unless they go into the witness box and clear themselves, if they can clear themselves, by giving the court what is regarded as an adequate explanation?  I do not think that is what we want or what we should do.  Let us not say, as we have so often heard from Ministers piloting Bills through the House, that what the Deputy says is so unlikely to happen that it is not worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>That is not the situation.  We are putting on the Statute Book here, if the Minister gets his way, a section of an Act of Parliament to create for the first time guilt by association.  We are shifting the onus of proof to the accused person and are saying that just because a person is a member of a group or an organisation he is deemed to be guilty of an offence of incitement because one member of that organisation purports to speak on behalf of the entire association, unless the person who is accused goes into court and gives an adequate explanation.  I will not stand for it, this party will not stand for it and I sincerely hope the House will not stand for it.</P>
    <Col N="839" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interesting section in many ways because it is a reflection of a very important change that is taking place in society here.  It shows that the Minister has completely misjudged the situation in two serious ways.  He believes that if he introduces this kind of legislation, this kind of section, to use the criminal law to prevent protest, that in that way he is dealing with the reason for that protest. This section, which is, of course, just another major assault on the whole practice of democratic discussion, consideration, debate, the taking of sides by individuals in whichever issues&mdash;political, social or otherwise they are concerned about&mdash;is a direct assault on the rights of individuals in a free democratic society.</P>
      <P>The Minister has misjudged the source of the need for protest, the reason for the need for protest of this kind, and he certainly has made a grave error if he believes that a repressive section of this kind will end the growing evolution of protests of one kind or another simply by repressive legislation. Taken together with the Offences Against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Act, this legislation in its basic philosophy seems to me to show that this is a very frightened Government. They are very frightened of all the people and they are showing their fear by attempting to out-frighten the people by this kind of threat of criminal proceedings, imprisonment and all the various sequels associated with them.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that the Minister may succeed in achieving his objective if he is permitted to go on with legislation of this kind, with the gradual attenuation of the domestic rights of our people which have existed for a long time.  He may succeed in creating this Greek-fascist type State here in which the Government are always right and those who do not agree with them find themselves in jail.  Regrettably, European history, world history, shows that there are precedents for the success of fascist-minded Ministers such as the present Minister for Justice. That is the awful tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is probably the most important section in the Bill, most important in its specific function of <Col N="840" /> frightening people away from one another, frightening people away from taking sides in causes about which they feel very deeply.  It is a section which is specifically directed to frighten that little flickering flame of conscience&mdash; there is not much of it but there is a little of it&mdash;in our community.  The Minister is making a direct assault on it now in this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister uses as his excuse that he is aiming at subversive and quasi-political groups who encourage and promote acts of squatting and illegal occupation.  That has been invariably the excuse for the attenuation of freedom in democracies.  They are never aiming at those of us who go into elections or make our case at discussions and debates; they are always aiming at some unnamed minority group and, because they are aiming at a minority group and, in consequence, deny us the rights of free association on specific issues&mdash;because that, effectively, is what it will do&mdash;they are paying to them the highest possible tribute they could pay.</P>
    <P>Are these subversive organisations that the Minister has in mind so powerful, is he so frightened, that he must deny to the rest of us the rights which he is denying us implicitly in this section? Are they worth the tribute that he is paying them?  Surely he must be able to distinguish between the activities of ordinary citizens and those of subversive, quasi-political groups who encourage acts of squatting and illegal occupation of property?  But, even if he does feel he is justified in changing the law in this drastic and fundamental way, it is still true to say that, if there are grave social ills in our society such as unfortunate families without houses and homes, what he calls the quasi-political organisation, or even the subversive organisation, still has rights to take sides on issues of this kind, and he is still not justified in taking the decision he has taken in this section to create the crime of guilt by association.</P>
    <P>One of the behaviour patterns which have fascinated me over the years in the Dáil&mdash;I have seen it before when Deputy Haughey was Minister for Justice and when other Deputies held <Col N="841" /> that office&mdash;is the way in which they justify current changes in the law by quoting old statutes at us, by quoting decisions of petty sessions and of judges, and laws of various kinds.  It has astonished me because it was under these very laws, which were the creation of British imperialism in Ireland and which are quoted as a justification for the Minister taking action against his fellow citizens now, that our people in the past went to jail and frequently were hanged, sent to Van Diemen's Land, deprived of their property, deprived of their fundamental rights.  These perverted laws were specifically aimed at penalising Irish people and, lest that was not done clearly in law, the judges were handpicked to do it and, if they failed, the juries were handpicked and packed in order to ensure the success of these wonderful precedents quoted here as justification for the present repressive piece of fascist legislation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that every Deputy in this House should have nothing but contempt for the record of the judiciary in Ireland, the courts in Ireland, those who operated it in the vast majority of cases in Ireland, up to the time the State was established&mdash;I am not talking about the last 50 years &mdash;and they should never be quoted here as permissible, desirable precedents on which we should base legislation applicable to our own people in our own so-called free society.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also aiming at the Press in this section.  The dictator has always aimed at the Press.  All of us in politics disagree with the Press from time to time.  We are all aggrieved from time to time by what is said about us in the Press, and that is probably one of the best tributes we could pay to the Press, that we are all at some time or other criticised by them.  By and large that is true; there are obviously pressmen and newspapers that are strictly sectarian and never attempt to discharge their very honourable functions as they should but, generally speaking, the Press has been one of the great safeguards, the tiny remaining vestige of the democratic ideal in a society from which practically everything else has disappeared.  I <Col N="842" /> cite the present position in South Africa when the very occasional newspaper man takes a courageous stand, and this is true in many countries.  If people are aggrieved by the Press, if the Government, if the State, if individual politicians, feel aggrieved, if they feel their case is being misstated surely they have a remedy?  Surely all our lives we have had a remedy?  I have operated in this society for 20 years against a hostile Press and I can honestly say that I have never been denied the right to correct some mistake which has been made about me by a hostile Press.  Why is it that the Minister cannot also rely on this simple expedient?  If the Press makes its case, if the Press misrepresents the Minister, if the Press is deliberately misleading&mdash; a very serious charge to make about the newspapers&mdash;or attempting to mislead, generations of Ministers have used the simple expedient of: &ldquo;My attention has been drawn to a reference...&rdquo; and invariably the Press will give precedence to whatever he has to say, absolute precedence.</P>
    <P>This is a restriction of a very important fundamental liberty, the liberty of free comment and comment can be interpreted as incitement, a restriction on the right of the newspapers to take sides for or against a particular decision as they did, as I said on the other section, perfectly rightly and with great effect on the Philistine decision by the authorities to destroy the Hume Street area of Dublin.  These are the kind of issues which it will be impossible for the newspapers and for various individuals to take sides on, issues which have been shown to be perfectly legitimate, perfectly justified and right and agreed upon as being right by the Ministers in this particular Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister should hesitate.  I have little regard for the whole idea of the capitalist society in which we live but I do believe that there are some organs within the organisation which are valuable, which have been useful and which have contributed to the enlightenment, the education, the expansion of knowledge, the expansion of value judgments on different issues from time to time correctly, frequently incorrectly <Col N="843" /> at other times, but at any rate the right to free comment.  The Minister is interfering with that.  He is delimiting that right to some extent.  To that extent this is a particularly serious step on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted at column 211, Volume 254, No. 2, of the Official Report the guilt by association precedent in relation to murder.  He said:</P>
    <P>For example if A and B set upon C to beat him up and A kills C, B is also guilty of murder.</P>
    <P>I know very little about legal principles but I always remember being particularly shocked by the application of this particular principle in relation to a man who was in jail at the time a murder was committed and who was hanged because of complicity eventually. Was that good law?  Was that a just principle?  Is that a principle which should be considered as applicable, as desirable to apply in any law passed by an Irish parliament?</P>
    <P>I shall not deal again with points that I made on the amendment&mdash;the difficulty of proof, the specific consent, the incitement to disclaim, to disown, to take sides against one's own personal or party loyalties in order to prove one's innocence, to take sides in an issue upon which one would just as soon not have to take sides in so far as one might be lukewarm about an issue about which a comrade may feel particularly strongly.  This insists that a person must take sides for or against, cannot be neutral as far as I can see. That must be divisive not only for the various groups that get together these days in order to fight for various protest issues which they are concerned with but in relation to political organisations.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that as a layman I have a peasant fear of the courts which I think is in all of us one way or another.  I am not secure in my belief about their inevitably doing the right thing or coming to the most reasonable conclusion for many reasons. Could we remind the Minister of the Taoiseach's comment about the arms trial and he is a lawyer?  Did it give him the verdict he was expecting?  Did <Col N="844" /> it act in a reasonable way?  I would just remind the Minister that in spite of the fact that there have not been many governments here since the State was founded, governments come and go and in the time ahead it seems to me that governments will come and go with much greater frequency for one reason or another.  The Government are now putting up a stick which they may find they are dealing with when their turn comes to be in opposition and they decide to resume, as I hope they will do, their old radical role fighting for the homeless, the helpless, the aged or the people whom they feel the then Government are exploiting. It is not impossible for this to happen.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, might find himself in the box explaining that he is not a party to a particular decision taken by a member of this party and he might also find himself in jail under this Bill, when it becomes an Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular section we are dealing with opens with words which include the following: &ldquo;A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence&rdquo; under this particular Bill.  Offences under this Bill include in certain circumstances the locking of a door, or the barring of a gate by someone occupying property of which he is not the owner.  These two words have somewhat different meanings.  Had they not they would not be used.  Had the Minister been satisfied to try to get at people who advocate the commission of an offence he would have confined himself to that word.  He has chosen, however, to use another and broader term capable of a very wide interpretation indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not difficult to encourage people by word or by example and there are many ways in which one can do it. One can do it. for example, by means of a chicken.  The chicken which the former Minister for Finance sent to the occupants of Hume Street at Christmas 18 months ago was most encouraging for them.  I was there at the time.  They were greatly cheered that the Minister should have thought so much of them as to send them this chicken.  It gave them heart to continue their struggle. <Col N="845" /> Perhaps his gesture may not have been in every respect genuine.  I do not know but it certainly was not reflected in the actions of the Government for some months later.  It was not until in fact the Government changed and somebody succeeded to his post that sympathy to the students concerned was shown in a more practical way for which they and others associated with them have since been duly grateful. Nevertheless, whatever his motive, the Minister sent a chicken and he gave encouragement.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill that Minister should have been arraigned before a court and charged with encouraging these people to commit this offence.  Moreover, it would be open to the Attorney General, should a malicious sense of humour prompt him to do so, to bring into court also the other members of the Government and have them charged, although of course it would be open to the court to hold that the chicken incident was one entirely prompted by the personal goodwill of the Minister for Finance and it would be unfair to send to jail or otherwise nine other members of the Government, not capable of such goodwill.  I suppose in such circumstances they might have been let off with a caution, let off completely, exonerated or pardoned, whatever the appropriate action is.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear what this Bill means. By adding in the word &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo;, the Minister is deliberately widening it to include various classes of persons, saying or doing various things which in themselves by any conceivable moral standards are innocent things.  Let us consider the theologian who writes a textbook on moral theology and who enunciates that well tried axiom of moral theology in the Roman Catholic Church, known apparently to everybody except Deputy James Gallagher, that is, that a man who is starving, whose family are starving, is morally entitled to take food where he may find it to the amount he needs to ensure that his family are not starving.  It is true we have had an alternative philosophy enunciated here. We have had Deputy Gallagher on this Bill asking where would this thing stop if you are going to allow people to <Col N="846" /> occupy property which does not belong to them when they need shelter, including some abandoned house; that next there will be people saying they are entitled to steal food because they are starving.</P>
    <P>The Deputy apparently had not known, his upbringing was such perhaps that he did not know, this was the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church and has been so since its foundation.  Of course, any theologian who advocates this, who writes this down in a textbook and who says that a person in that condition is morally entitled not alone to take a loaf of bread to feed his family but if he is without shelter and finds an abandoned dwelling he is entitled to enter therein &mdash;another speaker has given an example of that&mdash;I shall not repeat it &mdash;of some historic importance&mdash;is of course encouraging the commission of an offence under this Bill and he and all his associates and those responsible for his actions, the bishops of the church concerned, must be arraigned before the court.  No doubt the bishops could get off by pleading that the theology has been changed and that they no longer have this heretical belief, so unpalatable to the Fianna Fáil Government, and that the Catholic Church, in response to the demand of the Fianna Fáil Government, will change its mind. I doubt it very much but if they did I suppose they could get off and avoid going to jail leaving the theologian to carry the full burden himself.  These are the absurdities to which this Bill leads us.</P>
    <P>You have the position then of a newspaper, any newspaper, which in the event of a repetition of something like the affair of Hume Street says anything that encourages in any way the students, anything that suggests they are doing something valuable or useful, any phrase of that kind brings that newspaper editor into contempt and brings him into a position where he should be arraigned before the courts, fined and sent to jail.  Anybody who writes a letter to the paper which can be construed as offering encouragement, which does not outrightly condemn these heinous activities of seeking to shelter the homeless or to preserve what evil men would destroy, <Col N="847" /> is liable to be sent to jail under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Any politician who is so unwise and so unwilling to accept the moral authority of the Fianna Fáil Government as to suggest that any action of this kind might in any circumstances be justified also goes to jail.  A politician, to take a practical and immediate example, visits a squatter, as many of us have to do because of the situation in which so many people are squatting because of lack of housing, who tries to resolve their problems, get housing for them, get them out and get the space released for someone else, anyone who finds himself in that position and who offers any encouragement to that squatter, who does not immediately walk in the door and say: &ldquo;Out you go, you have no right to be here,&rdquo; can find himself arraigned before the court.  Anybody who shows any human kindness, who does not by word or deed immediately suggest that the squatter must get out but who accepts that he is there and that something must be done to find alternative accommodation and accepts that he will remain there until something is done or until he the TD can do something about it, is of course guilty of an offence under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course, anybody who stood on the lorry at Hume Street would have been guilty of an offence if this Bill had been law then, not just myself but distinguished politicians.  I see one here today, Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien.  I saw him offering the most illegal encouragement to these squatters up there, I am sorry to say.  I saw Deputy Justin Keating there and I saw other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party in the crowd there.  Their presence there, their demeanour, their laughter and applause on certain occasions when certain things were said, would have brought them within the scope of this Bill also.  It is possible that some of them may have been sufficiently cautious to maintain a demeanour offering no encouragement but I am afraid most of them were prompted by the exhilaration of the occasion to show some kind of approval.  Indeed the very fact of their presence there, the fact they came up there in the <Col N="848" /> crowd and stood outside, even if they kept a grim face throughout, that itself offered encouragement to the students, as I know, because they said frequently what an encouragement it was to them that people of standing in public life were sufficiently interested and concerned to come along.  All of these people would have gone to jail and the rest of their parties unless their parties repudiated them forthwith and said they should not have got involved, that they should not have smiled, applauded or said an encouraging word to those concerned.  This is the scope of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Do not let the Minister say that this is exaggeration.  It would of course be an exaggeration to suggest that this Minister intends, when this Bill is law, to operate it in this way, that his first thought will be to get at the authors of books on moral theology.  I am not suggesting that is in the Minister's mind and I am not suggesting that any of the other people whom I have suggested could suffer under this Bill will suffer, that this Minister intends to attack them, but laws should not be enacted which give to Governments, this and future Governments, powers of a kind which run far beyond what is necessary and which threaten the liberties of a whole range of people, whether they be theologians, or newspaper editors, or politicians, or students, or letter writers to the papers, or members of An Taisce, or members of the Dublin Civic Group, or members of the Dublin Housing Action Committee, unless they engage directly in some illegal activity.</P>
    <P>Bills of that kind should not come before the House.  When they come before the House they should be rejected. It is up to all of us who are free of the Fianna Fáil Party Whip to voice the feeling, which I know is shared by members of Fianna Fáil also, that this is a misguided Bill, a Bill we do not need, and a Bill that goes far beyond any conceivable requirement of the situation.  The problem, such as it exists, of squatting in corporation property, and a real problem it is, was tackled by legislation last year.  Personally I was unhappy with some aspects of that legislation but I <Col N="849" /> could see the reason for it.  In the case of corporation property the ownership of that property is clearcut and no issue of ownership arises.  One can make a case for special legislation to deal with that.  The case against this legislation here has been made more broadly on Second Reading and I shall not repeat it.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the need for a measure to deal with corporation property, and even if one conceded, as I do not, that a Bill of the kind before us here was necessary with a view to dealing with people engaging in this particular activity, none of us could agree with this attempt to bring within the scope of the Bill everyone who by word or by deed offers encouragement to squatters, encouragement to people engaged in the kind of activity the students in Hume Street were engaged in, treating them as criminals and indicting them accordingly.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether, even in the worse period of British rule, legislation as broad as this in scope was brought in. My memory of what historical knowledge I used to have of the Parnellite period does not enable me to quote the text of the Bills and the Acts that were brought in at the time to deal with the Land Leaguers, the cat and mouse provisions.  I could not say whether, in fact, they went as far as this, but I am inclined to doubt it.  The only precedent we have in Irish history for a Bill like this is the kind of legislation brought in at that time to deal with the Land Leaguers.  I was forcibly struck with the thought of the continuity of Irish history when just over a year ago in Hume Street from that lorry I heard the voice of a man whose father was imprisoned because of his involvement at that time.  He was professor Myles Dillon.  John Dillon was one of the people sent to prison by the British Government because he encouraged&mdash;that may not have been the word used; I doubt if the British Government would have gone so far&mdash;or advocated measures of resistance to laws of property at that time which operated against ordinary decent Irish people.</P>
    <P>This Minister who has sought to emulate that example found his <Col N="850" /> example there.  For all I know he may even have found the words in the Bill there.  As I say, I doubt if the British went that far.  That is the precedent we have.  This Bill is not designed to protect Dublin Corporation or other local authorities.  That has been well, truly and completely done in the Bill passed here last July.  The purpose of this Bill is solely to deal with private property, private property which is not, in fact, threatened by the kind of occupation the Minister has suggested graphically to us.  There is not an epidemic of people entering somebody's house when he is away on holidays, taking it over, living there and forcing him to take a civil action to get them out.  Such an event has certainly never occurred to my knowledge in the recent history of this country.  I think I read the papers well enough to have come across such a court case if it occurred.  We are not faced with such an epidemic.  There is no situation at the moment in which private individuals are being deprived of their own domestic property by people seeking to take it over, put them out and live in it.  That is not the problem.</P>
    <P>There are, indeed, some demonstrations taking place justified by the appalling housing situation which this Government have created by their neglect in this area.  There are other demonstrations from time to time which involve the temporary occupation of premises.  They are not activities of a kind which would justify this Bill or this type of section in a Bill under which anybody who says that the people who organised the fish-in had a point because the rights of the landlord are dubious should be sent to prison for saying so.  I do not know any Bill that has been brought before this House, not only in the period I have been a Member of the Oireachtas but within my memory going back to the Offences Against the State Act of 1939-40, which had this characteristic of being so broadly drafted as to bring within it potentially so many different groups of innocent people, people properly engaged in carrying out their duties, newspaper editors, letter writers to newspapers concerned about the housing situation and the squatting problem which the lack of housing has <Col N="851" /> created, theologians, priests or pastors concerned to look after the spiritual interest of their flock and concerned to assert that basic Christian doctrine which I have already enunciated and which all accept other than the Fianna Fáil Party and in particular the Minister and Deputy James Gallagher.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that such a provision is needed or can be justified.  The Minister must think twice about it.  A Government in the condition which the present Government are in are bound by some law of nature to involve themselves in blunders and mistakes.  We have seen three of them within a very short period of time.  We had the extraordinary dole blunder and the inept attempt to cover up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am listing a number of blunders and seeking to explain how this Government could have been brought to introduce such an inept provision as is included in this section. I am suggesting that this reflects a breakdown in morale of a Government in the last stages of disintegration and I am giving as evidence for my thesis other events of a character which do not have other parallels in the recent history of the Fianna Fáil Party when it was better run and better managed, such as the dole blunder and the blunder over community schools. These are examples of the kind of things that happens to a Government when they lose their grip and their nerve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A prime example of that is this legislation here&mdash;panic legislation brought in arising out of a particular event, brought in to protect particular <Col N="852" /> private interests which are not even seriously threatened, and brought in in terms so broad as to exceed the breadth of even the kind of measures brought in by the British Government when they were seeking to oppress the Irish people and seeking to protect certain property rights against the public interests and against the moral rights of the Irish people.  A Government which get to the stage of bringing in Bills of this kind, of drafting them so ineptly and of envisaging in them so many innocent groups of people, will not survive for long.  At least before they go they should have the courage and intelligence to withdraw this aspect of this Bill which of all the things in the Bill is the most inept and objectionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to deal with is the question of what is or what is not an offence under this section.  I am in certain difficulties in this because within the past week I was criticised in a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, as is their perfect right to do, for standing up here and giving or purporting to give interpretations of the law, of what the law is, and of what the law would be under this section or under this Bill if it were passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that it is, of course, a matter for the courts to interpret what any Statute of the Oireachtas means.  When I stand up here to try to explain what a section of a Bill or an existing Act means, I am simply doing this to the best of my knowledge to assist Members of the House or members of the public.  I fully accept that, but I think that, while my interpretation of the law may not always be correct in spite of the fact that I have considerable advice on the meaning of sections of the Bill, at least the same concession must be made by Deputies opposite who get up and give their interpretation.  As far as I can see the position seems to be that Opposition Deputies can give interpretations of what the law is or what the law will be under sections in this Bill, or indeed any other Bill, and this is perfectly all right, but if the Minister seeks to correct those interpretations&mdash;and God knows a lot of those interpretations need correction&mdash;<Col N="853" /> then he stands in danger of being accused of, as it were, in some way taking over the functions of the court and seeking to impose an interpretation that may not necessarily be right.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that the House and the newspaper leader writers who feel strongly about the fact that I have to stand up here to contradict certain interpretations which I find, as any lawyer would find, totally erroneous must accept my right to try to correct some of these things and they must accept my right as being at least an equal right to give an interpretation, the same as anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Equal but no more than equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not claim any more than an equal right.  I make this point now because Deputy FitzGerald started by giving a long series of what he described as examples of what would be offences under this section when it is passed.  I do not know how many examples he gave; they ran to 12 or 15 but I gave up counting after a few.  I listened to them all and claiming only my equal right with Deputy FitzGerald to say what is or what is not the law, but at the same time having the advantage of being able to rely on the advice of the law officer of the State and his advisers, I can say categorically that every one of his examples as to what would be a breach of the law is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's examples of what would be breaches of the law were perhaps a little more sophisticated and subtle than some of the examples, or alleged examples, given elsewhere in this House.  However, it is at least equally necessary for me to contradict these other examples of what would be breaches of the law.  My mind cannot help going back to the examples given during the debate on section 1 on Committee. Section 1, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out, is the section which contains the definition the influence of which runs throughout the entire Bill, and two of the examples of alleged offences that were given in the section 1 debate were given by Deputy Desmond.  I almost hesitate to go back <Col N="854" /> to them but I use them to illustrate the ludicrous sort of things that were put up in this House and which inevitably must evoke contradiction from me. One of the things, of course, was that a husband and wife in bed together, according to the Minister for Justice under this Bill, would commit the offence of forcible entry.  That was not the happiest of examples to give.  We will leave out the overtones about it but it just shows the ridiculous lengths to which certain Deputies will go in an effort to discredit this Bill, by giving as examples of what would happen under it completely outrageous things of which there is not the remotest possibility whatever, and saying that the Minister wants to do this and to do that.  It is an old trick and provided you can say these things often enough and get enough people to agree with you often enough you can, as it were, clog the communication media with these ludicrous examples with the inevitable result that many members of the public who do not have the opportunity of reading, studying and understanding the Bill&mdash;and we must be realistic enough to appreciate that most members of the public unfortunately do not do that&mdash;believe that the Bill contains the sort of things that Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Desmond and many other Deputies have been saying about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The most fundamental point and one which would cover practically every one of the examples of alleged illegality given by Deputy FitzGerald, is that it would be for me to point out what in fact would be an offence under section 4 and what <Col N="855" /> would not.  To commit an offence under section 4 a person would have deliberately, and that entails <i>mens rea</i>, to encourage another to commit an offence under section 2 or section 3. In other words, deliberately and with <i>mens rea</i> he would have to encourage or advocate to another person that that person forcibly enter land, and having done that that that person would interfere with the use and enjoyment of that land by the owner and that he would refuse to leave when asked to do so.  Merely to criticise housing conditions or to encourage people to squat <i>simpliciter</i> would not amount to an offence under section 4.  If Deputy FitzGerald reads the section, either as amended or in its original form he must accept that.</P>
      <P>Section 4 does not in any way affect or curtail freedom of speech any more than the existing common law offence of incitement does.  It is perhaps no harm to refer to a definition by a well-known author of what incitement under the existing common law entails, and I quote from Glanville Williams, Criminal Law, General Part, second edition, page 612:</P>
      <P>One may incite persons generally as in a newspaper article and the person incited need not even be known.</P>

      <P>I am being asked for a definition of &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; when &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is a perfectly ordinary word in everyday use.  If the word &ldquo;incitement&rdquo; were used I could well believe that a definition of it might be sought despite the fact that it has been in use in our law for many years. With regard to subsections (2) and (3) as amended, we now find that these subsections in general have been objected to on the grounds that they are vague and that it is a matter for the <Col N="856" /> court to decide whether or not a person is guilty of an offence under the section. However, Deputies will recall that I amended the two subsections, (2) and (3), in this way precisely as a result of their criticisms of the original subsections. I can quote from what Deputy Fitzpatrick said on this point.  At column 87, volume 251 of the Official Report dated 27th January, 1971, after referring to subsection (2) and the defences that were open to a defendant, he said:</P>
      <P>How can he do that? Is he to buy newspaper space or get a loudspeaker van to go around the area telling all and sundry that he dissociates himself from this?  It is not workable.  That the statement was made without his knowledge or consent&mdash;how is he to prove that?</P>

In fact, according to estimates prepared in that office, the net outward passenger balance has shown a continuous and significant decrease in recent years, being 7,160 in the year ended February, 1971, as compared with 8,137 in the year ended February, 1970, and 24,548 in the year ended February, 1969.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in a previous reply on 3rd June, 1970, the Government when fixing in 1965 the geographical limits for the amended scheme of unemployment assistance for smallholders adopted substantially the same areas as those recognised by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for the pilot area and other similar schemes administered by that Department.  These areas represent in the widest sense of the term the congested areas of the country where the small farm problem is concentrated and the difficulties of the small farmer are, generally speaking, more acute and the volume of wage-earning employment available is lowest.  In the circumstances I do not propose taking any steps with a view to extending the present generous limits of the scheme. It is, of course, inevitable that in any scheme of this nature the geographical limits&mdash;irrespective of where the line of demarcation is drawn&mdash;will cause some dissatisfaction in bordering districts which are not included in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="873" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the demarcation lines were clearly set out when the scheme was introduced assessing means and valuations in certain parts of the country and the areas covered were those included in the development areas in connection with which county development teams were appointed to make recommendations?  Is he not further aware that this has applied in all areas with the exception of County Cork, that 11 counties in their entirely are included, and that the area in County Cork is restricted to not more than one-third of the area deemed to be an undeveloped area in accordance with the county development plan?  That being the case, surely the Minister would agree there is justification for extending the area in County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is almost correct when he says Cork is the only area in which the whole county is not included; West Limerick is another one.  At the time of defining what is popularly known as the congested districts this question arose, and there were a number of precedents for this: we had the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, and the Irish Land Act of 1909.  Then there was the much wider definition of congested districts as recorded by the Department of Agriculture for their scheme.  We took the widest of the three possible definitions available to us, that is, the agricultural one.  Not merely that, but in so far as it might not have extended to cover all of what was originally defined as a congested district we brought in extra areas to the Cork area to supplement the congested area.  The Deputy has been seeking to have it extended to parishes.  I examined this as a result of this question this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That has all happened. I gave the Minister 12 months, and I am giving him no longer now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legal definition of a parish boundary, whereas there is of a county electoral area or an electoral area.  This does pose a problem which would not be so easy if we were to decide to change what I think was a very generous definition <Col N="874" /> of a congested area even in relation to the part of Cork county that is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that 11 counties which are included in their entirety were not deemed to be congested areas according to the old regulations?  Is he aware that a number of farmers deemed to be within the area covered by the Twelve Western Counties Scheme are precluded from applying for unemployment assistance by virtue of the limitation imposed on them by the demacration line drawn up by the Department of Social Welfare?  If he is so aware, will he not take steps to rectify this grave injustice?  As a final question, may I ask why then should not the borders of the 12 western counties apply?  There is a clearly defined part of County Cork deemed to be within the 12 western counties.  I can produce the map for the Minister.  It is defined in the same way as the 11 western counties are defined.  My view is that that clearly defined area which is deemed to be in the 12 western counties should be included for this unemployment assistance scheme.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is justification for changing the regulation and that, instead of taking the period from some date in 1953 to the present time for determining the number of contributions an insured person had in that period, you would take his lifetime of insurance from the first day he entered insurance and if he had more than 24 contributions per year over that period then grant him his contributory pension? The Minister knows what I have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it right that a man who enters insurance at 59 years of age and has three years paid contributions qualifies for a contributory old age pension while a man who had 35 years contributions but who changed over to self-employment does not qualify?  Surely, in justice, a man who has more than 30 years paid-in contributions over the period he was working as a wage earner is entitled to be considered for a contributory pension at least on equal terms with a man who just entered <Col N="877" /> before he reached the age of 60 and qualified since?  Will the Minister agree that this should be reconsidered?  In the Minister's regulations he has inserted some date in April, 1953&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> The standing instructions to the Customs service cover the action to be taken in relation to the enforcement of section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, and no special instructions were issued in respect of the expected importation of contraceptives on the 22 May, 1971.  In accordance with the standing instructions, as far as was practicable, all contraceptive devices disclosed as having been imported by passengers arriving from Belfast on that occasion were detained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what he means by the phrase: &ldquo;as far as was practicable&rdquo;?  Did the customs officials find that they could not confiscate some of these and if they could not confiscate them why did they not take the necessary percautions to see that they could confiscate them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They did confiscate all those that were declared to them and they confiscated, as far as they know, all those which were thrown over their heads to the waiting crowd.  In fact, it is possible that some were brought in which were not confiscated but the vast bulk of them, and any known, were confiscated.  That is what I mean by the phrase &ldquo;as far as was practicable&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If some other prohibited substance, which it was a criminal offence to import, were brought in by a group of people in this way, simply because the customs officials could not cope with the number of these prohibited articles being brought in, would they be allowed in?

      <P>On Thursday last, 27th May, I replied to a Parliamentary Question by Deputy Harte concerning the arrangements for the maintenance and repair of Garda cars.  In supplementary questions the Deputy raised a specific matter which he had already raised earlier, namely, the question whether two Garda cars broke down in pursuit of a car believed to be used by persons who had engaged in a robbery.  I said that I had already checked and re-checked with the Garda <Col N="897" /> Síochána and the position was that only one car broke down.</P>
      <P>Owing to Deputy Harte's insistence that a second car broke down, yet a further check was subsequently made and it has transpired that the information given to my Department by the Garda Síochána was incorrect.  The second car did, in fact, break down inasmuch as there was a failure of the lighting system and, as it was dark at the time, the car was effectively out of use.</P>
      <P>The circumstances in which despite a special check and re-check, misleading information was given are being investigated fully by the commissioner. For my part while I gave the House the information as supplied to me, I think it right first to correct the record, and secondly, to express my regret to the House and to Deputy Harte in particular that in replying to his supplementaries I did not allow for the possibility that the information supplied to my Department was incorrect, as it has turned out to be.</P>

Deputy Dr. Browne tried to create the impression that the section was in some way aimed at newspapers. <Col N="898" /> This most certainly is not true and while like Deputy Dr. Browne I do not always agree with what newspapers say, I most certainly respect their right to say what they feel is correct.  If they make an error, like Deputy Dr. Browne, I freely accept that they will freely publish a correction if the matter is brought to their attention.  What Deputy Dr. Browne and some other Deputies seem to seek to imply now is that in some way newspapers should be in a better position than ordinary citizens in what they say or on what they comment and the way they comment on it.  I cannot accept that.  They have been subject to the ordinary law and they are still subject to it and when this Bill is passed they will not be in any weaker position than at the moment nor in any way worse a position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rights or duties of ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P>I was also dealing, when I reported progress, with the complaint of Deputy Fitzpatrick and others in regard to the amendments which I put down to subsections (2) and (3) of this section, which somewhat recast the two subsections. As I pointed out, I did this in deference to the objections, expressed by quite a number of Deputies opposite, to certain features of the subsections which they felt were objectionable. I complied with their wishes as it were&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's contribution on this section, which he feels is the nub of the Bill and in his view the most objectionable part of it, suggested clearly that there is no need for this Bill and that we were going at the matter wrongly and so on.  I should like to refer the House to the Official Report for Tuesday, 26th May, 1970, Volume 247, column 110, when Deputy Fitzpatrick was speaking on Second Stage of the Prisons Bill, 1970. I quote the Deputy:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have very unsettled conditions, restless conditions: the nation is perturbed by crime of all descriptions, ranging from armed bank robberies resulting in the death of police officers, to what might be regarded as something less, in the form of sit-in protests, fish-in protests, protests of one sort or another.  I do not intend to dwell on this at any length but I think the toleration of the taking over of public or private buildings, whether as sit-ins under the auspices of cultural or architectural activities or sit-ins in protest against lack of housing or fish-ins as a national protest is nothing short of tolerating anarchy and can lead only to total disrespect for the law and to the common commission of more <Col N="900" /> serious acts of violence.  It is bound to generate disrespect for the law and for public and private property.  I hope that the Minister, in entering his office, will tackle these problems as they should be tackled because they have been overlooked and tolerated for too long.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick gave me some advice shortly after I became Minister for Justice in May, 1970.  It is fair to say that in so far as that advice is concerned I have carried it out to the letter.  Deputy Fitzpatrick comes in here and criticises the need for the Bill, the type of Bill and so on. That can fairly and squarely be described as hypocrisy of a kind rarely seen in this House.</P>
      <P>These was criticism made by Deputy Cooney on the last occasion, as well as by a number of Deputies today, about the words &ldquo;adequate explanation&rdquo; which appear in the last line of subsection (3), as amended.  It would be no harm if I referred to the history of where those words came from.  I adverted to this previously on the debate on amendment No. 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those words and the whole concept and drafting of the subsection are precisely the same as appeared in a Private Member's Bill promoted by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Fitzpatrick on behalf of Fine Gael some time ago in relation to the use of knives.  The House will recall that the two sections which they put together and called a Bill were taken word for word from sections 22 and 23 of the Criminal Justice Bill.  I am not comparing the merits or demerits of the situation to be dealt with by this Bill with the situation to be dealt with by the Criminal Justice Bill or the Private Member's Bill to which I have referred.  I am saying that the legal concept is precisely the same, the drafting is the same and the principles involved are the same.  If they are all right in the Criminal Justice Bill or in a Private Member's Bill, I fail <Col N="901" /> to see how the same concept is not right in a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>In effect, what I have done in the amendment and the situation we now have in subsections (2) and (3) as amended, is that it is a matter in each case for the court to make up its mind as to whether a person is guilty.  The court has complete and absolute discretion. Under the Bill as previously drafted it had not the same discretion but, as it is now, the court has a discretion in trying an offence under this section which it would not have if it were trying somebody for incitement under the Common Law, under the Petty Sessions Act or under the Act of 1861 in relation to aiders and abettors. The court now has discretion to take all the circumstances into account and to decide whether it is fair to convict a person.  Under existing law it does not have that discretion.  Therefore, I cannot follow how the argument can be put forward that people are in greater danger or that there is an extension of the existing law.  As I pointed out previously, the contrary is the case.  The defendant has greater safeguards under this section than he has at Common Law under an indictment for incitement, or an indictment for counselling, procuring, aiding and abetting.</P>
    <P>Play was made of the use of the words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo;.  It was suggested by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and others that the old words of &ldquo;counselling and procuring&rdquo; are preferable to the modern, perfectly clear words we use in the section.  The case was made that the words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; were not used in any other legislation in this country or in any other country.  It was stated that it was undesirable to use modern clear terms and, apparently by default, the argument was that it is better to use old-fashioned terms, the meaning of which would not be clear to the man in the street.</P>
    <P>As this point was made on Second Stage by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, it might be no harm to compare what is the law relating to encouraging and advocating, inciting, aiding and abetting, counselling and procuring in other <Col N="902" /> countries at the present moment.  I have confined myself to looking at the law in democratic countries only as I see no point in going to the kind of places Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and other Deputies might put before us as models of how a country should be run.</P>

      <P>It is distressing to come in here and hear a Minister of a democratically elected Government and a democratic Parliament advocating the acceptance of this piece of legislation as part of our statute law.  It shows a regrettable lack of appreciation, in particular, of what I consider to be the cornerstone of democracy, the idea of the rule of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of anyone who may not be already aware of precisely what this section sets out to do, it sets out to put a person in a position in which he can be convicted of an offence because of something said by another person.  That may be hedged round <Col N="904" /> with what the Minister calls protections but, nevertheless, that is the kernel of the offence and the Minister can quote from penal codes in every country in the world but, as far as we are concerned, this is a completely new concept in the criminal law of this country because it introduces the principle of vicarious criminal liability.  To my mind, that is outrageous.</P>
    <P>However, while it is distressing, it is not surprising to see this present Government bringing forward such a piece of legislation because its conduct from the point of view of democracy and from the point of view of the rule of law over the past 12 months has been utterly deplorable.  The rule of law is, as I say, the cornerstone of our democracy. It is the guarantee of our freedom. It is something imported into our constitutional law from the constitutional practice and theory of Great Britain.  There is the difference that we have a written Constitution while in Britain there is none.  The idea of the rule of law is a well-known rule. Initially it meant several specific things: it meant that no citizen would be tried except before the properly constituted courts; it meant that no citizen would get preference before the law.  It has been expanded over the years to mean more than that.  It means now that the law will never be harsh and will never seek to be unfair, will never seek to be inequitable and will at all times respect the spirit of democracy, respect truth and the full meaning of the idea of freedom and will never be used, or abused, to interfere with rights.  In particular, it means that the law will never seek to convict one person for the action of another. That is precisely what this section sets out to do.  This regrettably infringes, and infringes seriously, a very important principle in our society.  It is not, however, surprising to see this bad principle being proposed by this Government because over the last year they have shown a disregard for, or an ignorance of, the idea of the rule of law and the idea of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>We have a written Constitution and one of the things written into that, <Col N="905" /> borrowed from the unwritten constitution of Great Britain, is collective Cabinet responsibility.  We saw a most flagrant breach of that last year when that principle was flouted and ignored. We then saw Parliament itself being used&mdash;the correct word is &ldquo;abused&rdquo;&mdash;when the Taoiseach availed of this institution to impose party discipline on some dissident members of his own party.  These two instances showed a startling disregard for what freedom, democracy, parliament and constitution ought to mean in the fullest sense.</P>

If that is not bringing on top of us a dangerous, disturbing and frightening situation, I do not know what is.  It is disstressing to see a democratically elected government so reneging on its responsibilities, so ignorant of its sacred duty as to introduce this type of repressive, jackboot legislation.  It makes hollow the claims of the Taoiseach that he and his party are the true repository of all things republican, of all things for which men gave their lives so that we might be free.  I suggest to the Minister that he and his party, in putting forward this legislation, have betrayed those who gave their lives that we might be free from British imperialism.  This type of legislation is precisely the legislation used by the British Government when they had us in chains to try to repress the Irish people.  Here we have a manifestation of that same mentality 50 years after we won our freedom and by the very people who claim pride in the traditions that won that freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> This is repressive legislation because it seeks to stamp out something which springs from a genuine protest against a social evil.  The Minister is flying in the face of Irish history if he thinks that this repressive legislation will be effective.  One has only to look back over the history of British legislation in the latter half of the 19th century and the beginning of this to see that the Statute Book is bursting with coercion Acts and repressive and unjust legislation, none of which was effective in securing the end it was intended to attain.  This Bill will go the same way.  Instead of repressing an alleged social evil it will only encourage that spirit which is part of the characteristic of the Irish race, that spirit of protest, when it is felt there is cause for protest.  That spirit will not be stifled by any piece of imperialistic legislation.</P>

The Minister has only to look at similar legislation in our history to see how singularly ineffective it has been.  Instead of bringing calm and peace in our society it has only aggravated the subject matter of the protest. We must also consider in the case of repressive legislation of this magnitude and novelty the principle that no law should be passed to create new crimes unless there is a glaring, obvious, widespread social evil to be controlled.  I suggest to the Minister that such an evil does not exist, certainly no evil to justify the principle of vicarious criminal liability introduced by section 4.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to bet with the Minister that my interpretation is correct, in spite of advice he may have received.  I do not know who is responsible for the tone of this Bill, its arrogance, its totalitarian tenor, but if the people giving the advice are the people responsible for its fascist hue I should not like to accept their advice. This Bill flies in the face of the principle that new crimes should not be put on the Statute Book unless there is a glaring, obvious, widespread social evil.  I suggest that the disturbances that have taken place at which the Bill is aimed do not fall into that category. It is obnoxious as amended by the Minister just as much as it was before he amended it because as it is now amended, subsection (3) states that a person shall be deemed to have consented to the making of a statement if certain things make it appear to the court that he was a member of a group, &ldquo;unless he gives an adequate explanation&rdquo;.  Again, the Minister has not given any precedent for that and I do not think he will find one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister would let me finish.  If a person is charged with an offence I read the section to mean that the prosecution states that a statement under subsection (1) has been made and that the person charged has consented to that statement and thereby committed an offence.  The prosecution then proves that that person consented to that statement by putting before the court certain circumstances, including the constitution and the rules of the group on whose behalf the statement was made and the extent of the defendant's participation in the group&mdash;informer's evidence.  The court can then find that there was consent to the making of the statement and can say to the defendant: &ldquo;Having heard that you are a member of the group and having heard what their constitution consists of and having heard that a statement was made under subsection (1) on behalf of the group, I will convict you unless you have an adequate explanation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a novel legal principle.  The <Col N="908" /> defendant in that situation is faced with a tribunal which, having heard evidence from members of the Garda, has then to decide to convict the defendant on its subjective dealing with whatever explanation the defendant puts forward.  I submit to the Minister that it is bad law, quite contrary to all principles of our legal system, that there should be a statute under which a person must say: &ldquo;If I do this or if I do not do that I will be convicted.&rdquo; That test must be applied because the person must ask himself: &ldquo;Will the explanation I give be regarded as adequate?&rdquo;  It is quite wrong that the adequacy of the explanation should be exclusively within the decision of the presiding judge.</P>
    <P>I referred the last day to a school of jurisprudence which deals with the sources of law, with the influence which judicial decisions has as a source of law, and I pointed out that that factor can be affected by subjective feelings of the presiding judge.  That school of jurisprudence is known jocosely as the digestive school.  That may be funny in a lecture room but in a court of the land it is not a bit funny for the defendant, the adequacy of whose explanation may depend on the humour of the person on the bench, whose humour, in turn, may be determined by the state of his digestion.  That is the type of law the Minister is asking us to put on the Statute Book.  I described it as abnoxious because it is repressive, fascist, totalitarian and this is the most abnoxious section of all.</P>

      <P>I do not have legal training, unlike the Minister and the last speaker and, therefore, I am not capable of entering legal arguments in any detail.  However, one can have valid opinions on this Bill without a legal training because it is perfectly obvious, even on a casual perusal, that the Minister's objective is not legal at all but political and not simply generally political but party political.  In other words, what is happening is that the legal profession, of which the Minister is a member as well as being a Member of this House, is being prostituted for Fianna Fáil Party political purpose of the most degraded sort; <Col N="909" /> and public servants who are in the Department of Justice and who are paid for by all the public are being prostituted in the same scandalous. way.</P>
      <P>When a party starts to rot the rotting is all of a piece.  The rotting expresses itself in everything they do. We have seen that rotting going on in public for the last two years.  In most species of living things decay takes place after death; in the Fianna Fáil party putrefaction is taking place before death, but the smell is what one expects from putrefaction and the smell of this Bill is an offence.

    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> Let us look at the central idea that is enshrined in section 4, even in section 4 as amended.  The central idea is that, if somebody in an organisation to which one belongs says something which would be contrary to this law if it were passed, all of the members of that organisation can be held responsible at law unless they specifically repudiate his statement.  That is fine. Let us see how this new provision, this prostitution of law, would look if it were applied in a slightly different area.  Let us say we are not applying it to the matter of people trying to get protection from the elements, trying to provide their families with a roof and enough warmth, not to have children sick.  Let us say that this principle of guilt by the failure to repudiate were to apply to a conspiracy to import arms into the country.</P>

      <P>I am arguing that if the basic idea in section 4 is valid in this Bill, it should be valid for every piece of legislation, and by taking examples from other areas of legislation I am seeking to establish that the basic idea in section 4 is not only, as the last speaker said, Fascist, jackboot, authoritarian, but it is also party political because it is also using the might and the dignity of the law to crack a very small nut in a vindictive way.  However, if this were to be extended, if the principle operated for other kinds of law, then all the members of the party in government who are going to do their servile, rubber-stamp thing when the moment comes and toddle up the steps and validate it, would themselves all be guilty of what members of their own party may have done if they did it in regard to arms importation, in regard to various other illegal activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I am not a lawyer, I think the natural sense of what is honourable and just to do is in the possession of everyone.  If the principle is valid, if people act to provide themselves and <Col N="911" /> their families with shelter, then it is also valid across the whole spectrum of legislation.  You cannot pick out this sort of guilt by association because you are goaded by the Dublin Housing Action Committee.  You cannot make special bits of law to suit this city this year or last year in regard to one little organisation.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</P>

      <P>The members of the Government Party have so disgraced themselves by rubber-stamp voting that we are past the stage where any appeal to their honour or their conscience or their sense of Irish history or their sense of the dignity of the legal profession is worth a damn.  However, there are some members of the party to whom one might conceivably appeal.  If those people who are generally referred to as dissidents, who uphold republican principles, wish to uphold the standard of law which they themselves may dearly need, then rather than putting a halter around their own necks they will be showing a little wit when the vote comes if they vote with the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party.  If they want an issue to tumble a putrefying government, then this is a moral issue on which it is well worth doing it.</P>
      <P>This is a law which is aimed at coercing people into becoming turncoats. However fast one runs away from republicanism and from the traditions of the country, one ought at least to remember a little and one ought to have enough insight into what motivates Irish people to know that if you try to compel a man by law to renounce what has been said by another member of the organisation to which he belongs, if you try to compel him to turn his coat by law, then even if he disagrees with the spokesman of that party he will feel in honour bound not to repudiate what has been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is legislation for disruption.  It <Col N="912" /> is legislation to try to use the dignity of the law and the dignity of Parliament on a tiny, trivial subject.  There is no need for any other legislation, neither section 4 nor the Bill as a whole.  Things could be perfectly simply solved by providing the accommodation that the protesters need.  They do not enter for fun.  They do not enter for kicks; they enter out of need.  The way to prevent such a situation is to provide accommodation.  The solution is to solve the social problem but not, in the process, to degrade the law and to make the crushing of a small organisation the preoccupation of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>All our experience is that the passing of this legislation will have the effect opposite to that which seems to be intended.  I say &ldquo;seems to&rdquo; because, of course, it is possible that the engendering of conflict and of social chaos is at least partially the motive in the introduction of law like this for the reason that I have said: it will force people to do the opposite to what it seems to want to make them do.  If you say: &ldquo;You must repudiate the spokesman of an organisation with which you feel you can identify and in which you feel pride&rdquo; and if you try by law to compel that repudiation you will have the opposite effect.  It is therefore not just all the things that Deputy Cooney said it was&mdash;fascist, jackboot&mdash;it is also trivial, it is party political, it is a degradation of Parliament.  As well as that, as we have come to expect in recent years, it is stupid in the sense that it will have the effect opposite to the one attempted.</P>
    <P>Therefore, from every conceivable point of view it is a pitiful waste of parliamentary time to introduce this Bill.  It is a scandal that we should have to fight against it, to hurl back the thoroughly base reasons which motivated its introduction.  We have no option but to make this fight not because the Bill itself matters a damn but because the principles, the degradation, that the Government are bringing into Parliament are so important.</P>
    <P>This country would be better off it the whole thing were to be scrapped, not simply amended section by section. <Col N="913" /> Sometimes it is strong to admit a mistake.  Sometimes it is strong to appear weak.  This is a moment when a little humility, a little weakness on the part of the Government would be seen by everyone to be strength&mdash;the courage to admit a mistake, the courage to admit an action out of vindictiveness at a time of anger.  One hopes that the vindictiveness has now passed, that the anger has passed, that with cooler thoughts after the feelings of vindictiveness, people realise, as indeed the public servants must realise, and as many people in the Fianna Fáil Party must realise what a shameful thing this is.</P>
    <P>It would be no disgrace now to drop the whole thing.  Fianna Fáil members may not want at this critical moment in the affairs of their party a public defeat on a Bill but they do have the power to go privately, if they wish, and compel its withdrawal.  It seems to me that particularly those who had the courage to rebel once or twice on recent issues, notably on the issue of the dole, have an even greater moral responsibility to do that now.  Nobody will require them to do it in public.  Nobody will require confrontation. They can do this quietly. Indeed, if they are astute they will realise that this involves their own future as well as the future of the Dublin Housing Action Committee and the Sinn Féin organisations.  They would be wise were it pushed to a vote to side with the Opposition and pull down the Government on this but in fact it is not necessary to do so should they go quietly and compel the withdrawal of the entire Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister when he last spoke made something in the nature of a Second Reading Speech.  He made reference to statements made by me on the Prisons Bill and on the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as I made any reference to illegal activities on the Prisons Bill I was merely restating the policy of this Party as it is well known, the policy of upholding the rule of law whether in Government or in Opposition and I <Col N="914" /> was appealing to the Minister and to his Government to encourage people to uphold the rule of law by word and by example particularly.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has seen fit to introduce section 4 of this Bill.  I believe that if the Governments over the last years had been running this country in a democratic manner and had been listening to lawful protests this Bill would not be necessary nor any part of it.  We had the extraordinary performance in regard to the Hume Street houses.  The Government refused to listen to peaceful protest, to editorial comment, to appeals in this House, but when the people concerned adopted what the Government regarded as illegal methods then the Government caved in; they had second thoughts and they yielded just as they have yielded on several occasions in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>That is the way they have been running this country over the years and that is what has the Government party in the mess they are in at present and that is what has them introducing this Bill to try to convince the people that they are the great upholders of law and order when in fact they are letting the country slip and slide anyway it likes.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I made my position and the position of this party perfectly clear.  I said at column 85 of Volume 251, No. 1, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>So far as the general policy of the Bill is concerned, I and this party believe in the rights of individuals, not only in the rights of landlords, but in the rights of the ordinary man who occupies a house or land whether he occupies it as owner or as tenant, but this Bill will need a lot of thought and consideration before this House could pass it. Certain portions of it seem to me dangerous and quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I then went on to the part of the Bill which we are dealing with now, section 4, and I stated at column 87:</P>
    <P>I say that section 4 is an unnecessary and dangerous section and I intend to oppose it <i>in toto</i> on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> There is nothing inconsistent about that.  There is nothing inconsistent about my attitude to this Bill on the Second Stage and my attitude here today.  I am doing what I said I would do on the 27th January last. I am opposing section 4 of this Bill. I think it is quite unnecessary and dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister thought fit to refer to my remarks on 27th January last or at least to some of them.  He would have been better employed if he had dealt, as we are now in Committee, with some of the questions which I put to him on the Second Stage in a general way to give him an opportunity of considering them in relation to section 4 which we are now dealing with as amended.  On that occasion I pointed out that there was no definition in this Bill of a group of persons. I said at column 86:</P>
    <P>What is a group of persons? Where is the definition of &ldquo;a group of persons&rdquo; in this Bill?  It would be very difficult to define a group. Are they to be associated under some set of rules, under a constitution? Are they to be incorporated or unincorporated?  Are they to be some people who meet socially?</P>
    <P>I posed those questions to the Minister and the Committee Stage of a Bill is the Stage on which questions like that are answered and not an occasion on which a general discussion takes place.</P>
    <P>I repeat those queries to the Minister now.  I ask him when he next speaks to define a &ldquo;group&rdquo; and to say how he thinks the courts will define it, or how he thinks the courts should define it, and what guidance he intends to give the courts.  There are many groups of people in this country.  There are social groups; there are political groups; there are athletic groups; there are numerous other groups.  How many people constitute a group?</P>
    <P>This is a loosely drawn section, a bad section.  The Minister says he is using the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; because he thinks it is an ordinary word that is helpful and easy to understand.  I think there is nothing more dangerous than <Col N="916" /> the use of ordinary words in statutes, and particularly in criminal statutes. The Minister or his predecessor in one of the Licensing Acts in 1960 or 1962 used the words &ldquo;special event&rdquo;.  A district justice down the country applied one interpretation to the words &ldquo;special event&rdquo;, the same interpretation as was applied by the Minister's Department and the Attorney General and cattle marts all over the country were given licences.  A High Court judge applied a different interpretation from that of the Minister and the district justice, and three Supreme Court judges upheld the High Court judge although the Minister and the Attorney General were represented in the High Court and the Supreme Court to say they were quite satisfied with the interpretation given by the district justice.  Those were ordinary words but they were eventually thrashed out in the Supreme Court by reference to dictionaries.</P>
    <P>The liberty of an individual should not depend on a dictionary definition of a word.  When we are passing legislation here to deprive people of their liberty and to create criminal offences we should define the words we are using.  In relation to this section I invite the Minister to define the word &ldquo;group&rdquo;.  The next word I should like him to define in relation to this section is the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  That is another vague word.  It is defined in some dictionaries as &ldquo;to hearten, to cheer, to inspirit, to make bold, urge, further or promote&rdquo;.  Those are gloriously vague words.</P>
    <P>If the editor of a newspaper, in relation to what the Minister would call forcible entry or forcible possession, were to write that while the actions of these people could not be condoned it was easy to understand them in view of the shocking housing shortage, surely that would be heartening these people, it would be cheering them, it would be giving them some spirit, and he could be guilty of an offence.  I will be accused of being political now but if, as a result of the editorial in today's <i>Irish Press</i> slamming the Minister for Education for his new proposals about the management of the secondary schools, the <Col N="917" /> editor were held to be encouraging people to go in and squat in these schools to make sure that they were not managed in that way, would he be hauled before the courts and be found guilty of an offence?</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with a piece of criminal legislation which will be applied, if it is applied at all, in an emotional atmosphere and in emotional circumstances.  To date, the first case in which forcible entry took place&mdash; and I want to say that I do not agree with forcible entry; I have made that clear at all times&mdash;was in the circumstance of a housing shortage when a man and his family found themselves without a house and considered that they were entitled to go and get themselves a house.  That is something about which people could feel very strongly and might innocently speak very strongly about and, as a result, they might be held to be giving good cheer to the people in the house or to be heartening them, or inspiriting them, or encouraging them, and they would be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The next case of forcible entry was in completely different social strata. This was a question of squatting in the Hume Street houses to vindicate a belief or a point of view that these houses should be preserved for posterity, a view which after years the Government accepted and upheld.  Is it any wonder that people would feel strongly about that, and rightly so, and speak strongly about it?  Yet they will be charged with an offence.  The Minister talks about <i>mens re</i> which is thrown in as an explanation for everything. In every legal discussion when a man is cornered he turns to the defence of <i>mens re.</i></P>
    <P>Under this section as it is now drafted, I say these people could be guilty of an offence if they said that all methods should be used to preserve those houses for posterity and that once they were pulled down they could never be rebuilt, a perfectly logical argument to put forward.  Once you pull down a house and build some modern monstrosity in its place, the house is gone.  Supposing somebody made that cogent argument in a newspaper <Col N="918" /> or on a platform, surely under the section he would be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The other field in which we had these protests is another very emotional field: the claim to the right of Irish people to fish Irish waters and to catch fish without having to get the permission of foreign landlords.  That is a field about which Irish people have felt very strongly all down the years. People might think, do think and have thought in the past, that the people who exercised those rights even by force were doing right.  If they sympathised with them, under this section they could be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>This section is totally unnecessary for the implementation of reasonable sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  A perfectly respectable organisation might like to conduct its business in private.  There are such organisations, some of them absolutely respectable and some of them not so respectable, who believe in conducting their business in private. Supposing some member of that defined organisation goes out and makes a statement which is contrary to subsection (2) of subsection (4), in order to prove himself innocent a member of that organisation might have to produce the minutes of the organisation.  Would the Minister like it if all the minutes of the National Executive of the Fianna Fáil Party over the past 12 months had to be hawked up and published and brought into court in order to show that so-and-so voted against what another member was saying?  The Minister may say that that is absurd but that is the sort of absurdity he is legislating for and the sort of absurdity to which we are objecting.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I said that section 4 was totally unnecessary I considered it totally unnecessary when I first read it.  It would be very difficult to enforce it even as it is.  There is no reason why decent people should be dragged into court to exonerate themselves by going into the witness box because of an absurd piece of legislation like this.  I believe that if this Bill were being drafted now it would not contain this section.  The Minister put it in and published it several <Col N="919" /> months ago and now feels that he is obliged to stand over it just as the Criminal Justice Bill was introduced by his predecessor and has now been put into cold storage indefinitely.  He would be well advised to do the same with this.  On several occasions in the past 12 months the Government have taken hasty action and have gone back on it.</P>
    <P>It is not alone the Opposition Parties who are against this section; the national newspapers seem to be as one in being very much against it.  I have found in the recent past that when the national newspapers come out very strongly about something the Government give in, as they did in regard to the dole mess or mistake or call it what you like.  They simply could not stand up to the force of public opinion.  Thinking people who cannot be regarded as irresponsible, who have a stake in the country and who have always believed in the rule of law, either in power or out of power, believe that section 4, either amended or as it is, is dangerous, unnecessary and should be dropped.</P>
    <P>The Minister made considerable play of the fact that I on Second Stage specifically referred to these defences that are open to an accused person in paragraphs (3) (a), (b) and (c).  I pointed out the difficulties a person would have to surmount to show that he was not guilty under this section.  I was putting forward that argument then, as the Minister well knows, against the entire section.  I said that section 4, subsections (1) and (2) were outrageous and I was ridiculing the defences offered in subsection (3).  The Minister knows that that was the case I was making and there is no point in saying that he did not.  Indeed, he fully appreciated that because he tried to improve it but with the best will in the world neither the Minister nor his advisers could amend the section because it is an outrageous section.  I give the Minister credit for making an effort to amend this but the second stage of this section is much worse than the first because as it was then I suppose that if a person went to the extremes I was talking about, buying <Col N="920" /> newspaper space or going around in a van with a loudspeaker telling all and sundry that he did not agree with his colleagues, then if he went into court he would have some sort of an argument that he had done everything that he could to undo this.  It would be unreasonable to ask him to do that, but at least he would have done something tangible to which he could point. That is the case I would make, that it was absurd to ask this type of law-abiding citizen to indulge in this sort of antic to get himself out of this terrible section.  Here now it will be left to the mercy of some district justice or judge to decide whether an adequate explanation has been given or not.  He is to be left in mid-air and if the atmosphere surrounding the alleged defence is heated enough at the time it might very well be that no explanation would be regarded as adequate.</P>
    <P>Why must Minister after Minister introduce this sort of section in a Bill? And then we are referred to New York, Chicago and all around the world, but our legal system has never been patterned on those legal systems.  Our legal system has been operated or has tried to operate in recent times on common sense.  Then the Minister will go away back into distant ages and get another section forgetting that we are in 1971, forgetting that in the past ten years we have abolished the death penalty, forgetting that 21 years was once regarded as a life sentence but in the last few years the average life sentence has worked out at about six years.  The Minister seems to be going backwards instead of forwards.  I find it necessary to say these things at some length because the Minister attempted to misrepresent me and I refuse to be misrepresented.  My position is perfectly clear.  I appealed to the Minister on several occasions to give a lead to the country by the way he enforces the law which he has and which he is not doing.  In the country the Garda Síochána in several spheres of very serious criminal activity do not know from day to day where they stand, how to act or what to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is vague enough to mean anything.  Will he define &ldquo;a group&rdquo; for us?  Does he mean that this section is to be so wide that it can be used against anybody or anything if the Government or the Minister of the day thinks that it should be?  It is a dangerous section and it is slovenly drafted.  When the section was originally drafted the Minister conceded that it needed amendment but the amendment which he has put into it is not satisfactory.  At any rate, as long as subsections (1) and (2) are retained, I do not care what he does with subsection (3) because I will oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Having spent the morning putting in some useful parliamentary work on an urgently-needed piece of social legislation, namely, the Redundancy Payments Bill, it is a most depressing experience to have to come along this afternoon and oppose this section of this Bill.  One would have thought that amending legislation is designed to perform some social good or to remove a problem.  I suggest to the House that <Col N="922" /> by any criterion this section is unwarranted.</P>
      <P>It is 30 or 40 years since the terms &ldquo;Fascist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gestapo&rdquo; were fired across this House with such vehemence. I do not think that Deputies, particularly newly-elected Deputies such as Deputy Cooney, indulge in such phraseology lightly.  Therefore, it behoves the Minister when such charges are made to be constrained in his reactions and to pay some attention to the sharp reaction which has come not only from Members of this House but from every authoritative representative of legal, social and political opinion. The Minister cannot produce a public figure of legal or social standing or with any judicial experience, or with any experience in the Garda Síochána, who will give him an iota of support for section 4.</P>
      <P>Although I doubt if the Minister is renowned for his humility, he should accept that there is sharp repugnance towards section 4.  I would draw the analogy of how his predecessor reacted. The Minister made great play of section 22 of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1967, and of the various meanderings of his predecessor in his attempt to get the Bill through the House.  I should not like to see any Deputy reduced to a shivering mass as was the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Ó Moráin, when, with perspiration streaming down his face, he withdrew the Criminal Justice Bill at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis some years ago.  He was compelled to do this because of the reaction of the Fianna Fáil organisation. It must be stated in fairness to Deputy Ó Moráin that he withdrew the legislation.</P>
      <P>However, the current Minister for Justice decided to resurrect part of it. May I suggest to any Fianna Fáil Deputy who goes into the Lobby in support of this section that he has soiled the term &ldquo;republican&rdquo; which he is supposed to represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discussed this matter on 26th May, the Minister expressed the view that there is nothing novel in what is proposed in this section.  The Minister is more than stretching the imagination.  This section is obnoxious and repulsive and it must be opposed <Col N="923" /> completely.  The Minister has gone on record as saying that there was fairly drastic drafting on his part.  He has said that, having had a look at the Bill, he now wishes to ameliorate the position of the defendant.  According to the Minister the defendant is now in a better position as a result of his amendment than he was under common law and the rights of the person are defined clearly.  These are sweeping statements made by the Minister as judge and jury&mdash;as he will be under the Bill.</P>
    <P>One should take the ten commandments of proof which the Minister is going to produce here.  First, he envisages that in practice the provision of section 4 will operate in the following way.  The Minister states that the prosecution will have to prove that the alleged statement was actually made.  Will our hard-pressed gardaí be given new training in stenography? Will all the recruits at Templemore be given a crash course in shorthand so that they will be in a position to prove that the alleged statement was made?  I would ask the Minister to elaborate on how this will develop.</P>
    <P>Will a member of the Garda Síochána attend a protest meeting armed with tape recorders in order to be able to prove that the alleged statement was actually made? In future will the notes of newspaper reporters be used?  The Minister has a peculiar love-hate relationship with newspapers in this country but he is careful not to go too far.  It might be said that the first commandment is that the prosecution shall prove that the alleged statement was made.  I see the ranks of the Special Branch swelling dramatically so that the Minister may carry on his vendetta against protest groups.  These groups have assumed, in my opinion, an importance they do not really deserve all because the Minister has given it to them.  He is so busy talking about groups that every impressionable adolescent must be more than anxious to join, if only to prove the Minister's point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second point is that it must be proved that the protest <Col N="924" /> was made by or on behalf of a group of persons.  Every Deputy who has spoken has pointed out the entirely subjective connotation of the term &ldquo;group&rdquo; in the section.  What does, in fact, constitute a group?  Is it one person, two persons or half a dozen persons on a platform, or is it any particular organisation?  The Minister will assure us that it is up to the court to decide.  The Attorney General, the State solicitors, the Garda superintendents, the Garda inspectors, the sergeants have a right to know what exactly is in the Minister's mind.  There is no attempt at any definition of the word &ldquo;group&rdquo; in this section.  The section is spurious.  It is one which no self-respecting parliamentary draftsman would include in any legislation.</P>
    <P>The third commandment says that the accused person may be one of a group on whose behalf a statement was made.  Will there be physical personal observation by members of the Garda Síochána of every single protest group in the country?  How will we have proof that the accused was one of the group?  Will we have the South African technique whereby membership cards, minutes of proceedings and all the rest will be kept in Dublin Castle and then produced at the appropriate moment to show that someone was a member of a group on whose behalf a statement was made? The Minister must see a rich harvest here.  He has been hooked on empty protest.  He should get off the hook, recover his sense of balance and allow Parliament to proceed with more constructive legislation.</P>
    <P>We have the phrase, introduced by the Minister out of concern for the accused, that the court, having looked at the circumstances of the case may regard proof of the defendant's membership of the group as proof of consent in the absence of any adequate explanation.  This will be a paradise for the Attorney General or for anybody who prosecutes and the Minister will spend the rest of his life chasing around after State Solicitors. This is tendentious and questionable legislation.</P>
    <P>We come then to the constitution and rules of the group.  Most of these <Col N="925" /> groups form on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  They gather on a particular occasion.  It is open to question whether many groups have rules and constitutions.  But, if they have rules and constitutions, they will have to produce these.  The Garda Síochána will sequester them and the members of the group will have to go before the court and produce their constitution and their rules.  This is bureaucratically repressive.  The Minister is making a laughing-stock of himself.</P>
    <P>We come then to the extent to which the defendant participated in the activities of the group.  He attended one meeting.  Is he guilty or is he not?  If he attends three out of seven meetings he will be adjudged guilty.  The unfortunate accused will have no conception of what may be the interpretation of &ldquo;participating&rdquo;.  He may become involved by merely standing on the street, being rounded up and pushed into a Black Maria and brought down to the Bridewell.  There were many repressive edicts in bygone centuries.  The Minister has become newly converted to these.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;provided the court thinks it is reasonable to do so&rdquo; is a very magnanimous contribution from the Minister.  If the court thinks it reasonable that an individual participated to some extent in a particular group he will be judged to have committed a criminal offence.  He may have made a comment.  He may have smiled. He will get six months in clink.  No self-respecting Minister for Justice should put such a provision on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>All these things having been established, the defendant is then informed that the prosecution has done enough, to quote the Minister, to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case and, in the absence of any adequate explanation, the court may feel constrained to infer that the defendant consented to the making of the statement.  The Minister should spend a few weeks in the cattle marts talking to the farmers to find out what their interpretation is of common sense.  This is legislation gone mad.  It is utterly undemocratic.  It is at variance with every democratic concept. The Minister seems determined to <Col N="926" /> outdo his predecessor where the rights of citizens are concerned.  The constitutionality of section 4 is in question.</P>
    <P>I would urge the citizens of this country to test the constitutionality of this section because it is called into question by any criterion, whether one takes into account the defunct 1922 Constitution or any of the provisions of the 1937 Constitution.  It calls into question the exercise of freedom of expression.  It would not be the first time that the constitutionality of a whole piece of legislation was tested in the Supreme Court and the legislation thrown out.</P>
    <P>The Minister has advanced a novel defence in regard to shifting the burden of evidence.  He says an analogy is to be found in section 28 of the Larceny Act, 1960.  The Minister is being absurd when he tries to draw an analogy between the physical possession of housebreaking tools and the public statements or verbal actions of an individual.  Such an analogy does not hold water as far as any person in the country is concerned.  Anybody in the legal world to whom I have shown the section was not impressed by it or by the Minister for having introduced it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if we require this piece of legislation at all&mdash;we do not need it at this point of time&mdash;public order or morality has in no way reached such a pitch of insecurity that would warrant section 4 and that therefore the Minister should withdraw it.  One must challenge Fianna Fáil Deputies in this regard.  I am shocked at the total manifestation of hypocrisy by Deputies such as Deputies Blaney, Brennan, Sherwin, Allen, O'Connor, Haughey, Timmons, Gibbons, just to mention a few of them.  I do not think a single member of that group will support that section in conscience. They have gone around the corridors of the House saying so but of course they will walk into the Lobby this evening and support it because they are scared of a general election in which they might lose their seats.  As far as the Minister is concerned, they have had a blank cheque to exempt them from such charges as incitement, encouragement, conspiracy.  I draw the analogy between the Firearms Act and <Col N="927" /> this.  They are the people who wanted armed military incursions into Northern Ireland but there was no question of legislation being brought in to deal with the standard of hypocricy of this House.</P>
    <P>I challenge Deputy Blaney if he is the much vaunted republican so vitally interested in civil rights in Northern Ireland at least to show some sense of perspective and to come in and oppose this legislation.  Deputy Haughey hopes to have an each way bet on the position of Taoiseach but when it comes to the crunch he is prepared to swallow his principles and support this section about which privately he said that the Minister was daft to go ahead with it.  He said the same outside the House.  He could not say it inside because it would upset the show.</P>
    <P>I find it depressing that a relatively new Minister should be so hard up in terms of precedents that he has to go right back, as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien pointed out, to 1861, and 1851 and that he has to rely on sections of Acts passed more than a century ago to apply to modern Ireland of 1971.  In its outlook this section is simply what Deputy Cooney called it, fascist.  I do not think any other word could more appropriately describe it.</P>
    <P>I was amused at the dependence of the Minister on an analogy with New York.  He lauded the courts of New York and their academic judicial advisory groups on their legislation.  One may have a lesson to draw from this analogy with an area where the Minister finds the law so satisfactory, a city renowned for its brutal violence, where the whole fabric of the occupation of premises has broken down, where one is not safe to walk the streets in the evening.  The Minister finds nothing strange in drawing an analogy between New York and the Republic of Ireland, a peaceful island off the coast of Europe.  The only thing one can say is that he has here opened up a whole new vista of legal definitions.  I do not think the implications of section 4 are fully appreciated by the Irish people and I think each newspaper should print that section in large type, surrounded by black rules, if it is passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> Many representative citizens have opposed the section, none more strenuously than Father Sweetman, the Jesuit.  It is appropriate that one should place on record his view of the Bill and of this section:</P>
    <P>This particular Bill and this particular section make a criminal out of any individual in any group of persons who encourages or advocates entry unless that individual can prove ignorance or repudiate his colleagues.  Surely this contravenes the right of a person to accept the majority decision of the society to which he belongs even if he does not agree with it.  To force him by law to dissociate himself from the contents of the statement is clearly undemocratic.</P>
    <P>I do not think he was extreme in that expression of opinion in regard to this Bill.  He was referring to a Fianna Fáil cowboy and Indian type legislation&mdash; the goodies and the baddies, and we have it here under this legislation.  My colleague, Mr. Donal Nevin, of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, was absolutely correct when he said this Bill, with its overtones, leaves the Criminal Justice Bill far behind.  Rev. Fr. Enda McDonagh, Professor of Modern Theology in Maynooth College, has said this Bill gave him a vision of society which he found impossible to take.  He said the Government ought not to be tackling the symptoms, that is, the deprived, the weak, that they should be tackling the strong who are responsible, and that this Bill would protect the strong even further and would not alleviate the problems.  I want to quote another eminently respectable public figure, Mr. Louis McRedmond.  He has said that the Bill is crude, unjust, that it is bad law and that section 4 establishes the new concept of guilt by association and undermines the principle of a person being innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    <P>These are sane, competent public commentators, whose comments the Minister will find it difficult to argue against.  When one puts this legislation in perspective, one remembers that it is the Greater Dublin area which is the only area of the country where house squatting has been practised.  This has <Col N="929" /> largely arisen from the absence of Dublin Corporation, from the self-immolation of 45 councillors who declared themselves out of office.  These councillors do not exist and have not existed for a number of years.  It is quite miraculous that with the total absence of local representatives there has not been greater confusion in local authority housing in the Greater Dublin area.  However, even with the absence of local councillors there are 50,000 tenants in Dublin Corporation houses.  There are at least 5,000 or 6,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am concluding on this point: out of a total of about 70,000 local authority dwellings in the Greater Dublin area there are about 120 which are illegally occupied, mostly by subtenants who stayed on in houses. I have no doubt that without this legislation the corporation could resolve the problem.  Again in relation to section 4 I want to record our total opposition to the provision.  If this Bill goes through, as far as we are concerned in the Labour Party, it is all the more reason why we should strive as a political party to achieve office in order to be able to repeal this legislation.  We believe this is an elementary commitment which we, as a responsible political party, should make to the people, on whom this repressive legislation is being foisted.  It is legislation which is a disgrace to the republican traditions of this House, and it is an everlasting disgrace to the Fianna Fáil Party who have deteriorated to such a level as even to contemplate its introduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In his last statement just now the Minister for Justice said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Section 4 does not in any way affect or curtail freedom of speech to any degree greater than the existing common law offence of incitement which has existed for a very long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume that the Minister actually means that, that he is sincere in saying <Col N="930" /> it.  Even so, the fact that the Minister has said this here in a debate has, of course, no force in law; it is just an <i>obiter dictum</i> made by a Minister here, and what is important is the actual wording of the Bill which we are asked to pass.  That wording as we have it now does not bear out what he says, because the words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; in the section are different from the word &ldquo;incites&rdquo;.  It has been pointed out that the word &ldquo;incitement&rdquo; which is of venerable usage in law, has acquired meanings, and &ldquo;meanings&rdquo; means restrictive meanings, not just what anyone thinks it ought to mean. These words here have acquired no such technical penumbra and are not so limited.  Therefore, if the Minister is sincere about not wanting to curtail or affect freedom of speech, if he means this provision is not curtailing freedom of speech any more than the common law offence of incitement, he can very rapidly make that law, first of all, by amending his own section to read: &ldquo;a person who incites to the commission of an offence&rdquo;.  If that is what it means why can he not say so?</P>
    <P>The only reason we have been given for the present wording is that the Minister objects to these archaic legal terms.  He does not object to the Petty Sessions Act of 1861 or whatever it was.  He does not object to ancient statutes in themselves, but for some reason he objects to their wording. According to the only reason we have been given here, which is not necessarily the correct reason, his sole concern in all this is the modernisation of our usage so that the public may plainly understand from the words used exactly what is meant.</P>
    <P>If we accept that, again assuming that the Minister is sincere in not wanting to curtail freedom of speech, why could we not have a definition that the words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; in section 4 (1) mean what in common law the word &ldquo;incites&rdquo; means and no more?  The Minister is represented here at the moment.  I should like to put those two alternative suggestions to him and to ask for a reply on them because this whole section really hinges on the words &ldquo;encourages <Col N="931" /> or advocates&rdquo; in section 4 (1).</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister to give us a personal assurance that he does not want to affect or curtail freedom of speech because it is clear that he is, in some way, affecting freedom of speech and presumably curtailing it by the language he is using.  The fact is that the older technical vocabulary which he cites: &ldquo;inciting, aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of a crime&rdquo; has acquired, through court decisions, a certain set of meanings.  &ldquo;Encourages or advocates&rdquo;, the two together, are distinctly wider.  One might argue that &ldquo;advocating&rdquo; the commission of an offence here is very closely the same as &ldquo;inciting&rdquo; it.  That could reasonably be argued but the word &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; is very much wider indeed.  &ldquo;Inciting&rdquo; as it is ordinarily used has the fairly precise meaning of wanting someone to commit an offence and working on him in such a way that he does.  I do not think people are all that often charged nowadays for incitement except where the case is very clear and very flagrant. I think courts and law enforcement officers have, on the whole, tended to respect the ordinary freedom of comment to a great extent.  This particular limitation casts a doubt of unknown proportions on freedom of comment.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the statements he made just now said that Deputy Dr. Browne tried to give an impression that the section was in some way aimed at newspapers and that this most certainly is not true.  We know that the ways in which views are most often encouraged and most effectively encouraged or advocated these days are through the media and still in particular through the Press so that any warning that the present limits of choice on &ldquo;encouraging or advocating&rdquo; are to be restricted must affect the Press.  We must also assume that the Minister had this in mind because we know the kind of groups he has been dealing with have been &ldquo;encouraging or advocating&rdquo; what would become an offence under this section and he certainly has in mind trimming their freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>He also revealed in earlier remarks of his own that he did have newspapers <Col N="932" /> in mind, that he was aiming at them.  He named them when he was talking about the general concept of &ldquo;incitement&rdquo; which he makes identical, though I think neither ordinary usage nor the law would, with his &ldquo;encourages or advocates.&rdquo;  He said</P>
    <P>One may under our law incite persons generally as in a newspaper article and the persons incited need not be known.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from the Official Report, Volume 254, No. 2, of 26th May, 1971. He said at column 229:</P>
    <P>I am bringing it in in order that we will have a modern statute which will set out clearly in terms which cannot confuse anybody what precisely the position is and what can or cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Notice here the confusion which the Minister is introducing by using words which have a wide span of meaning in ordinary speech instead of terms which have precise legal definitions built up in case law.  He is trying to put over to the public the idea that he is simplifying things and making things easy for them.  It is quite the other way around.  The protections of people's liberties lie in the more precise definitions and the Minister, who makes so much display on occasions of his legal learning, should not be allowed to get away with this distinctly demagogic argument here.  He goes on:</P>
    <P>In other words the rights of a person are clearly defined&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where?</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he is put on clear notice that if he infringes certain things he is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>He is not put on clear notice of anything because we do not know how these words &ldquo;encourages or advocates,&rdquo; particularly &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;, are to be interpreted.  We all know that judges construe things in different manners and in different times and loose and vague language of this kind is a danger to public liberty particularly in times of excitement.  The Minister goes on:</P>
    <P>There is the horrified suggestion that newspapers, for example, might well find themselves in difficulty with <Col N="933" /> the law under this section if they were to advocate the commission of a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>That phrase &ldquo;horrified suggestion&rdquo; is designed to cast contempt on any concern for the liberty of the Press or further encroachment and intrusion on the liberty of the Press.  He continues:</P>
    <P>There is the implication in this horrified suggestion that this is something new, but it most certainly is not new.  Newspapers are not any more immune from the law of the land than any other individual or company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Nobody, of course, has claimed that they are.  The point is that this will be an extension of the law of the land. The Parliament presumably would have the recognised right under law and subject to the Constitution to introduce very serious further intrusions on the liberty of the Press.  The point is whether in terms of public policy this is warranted or whether there is any justification for it.</P>
    <P>Notice the contradiction between this and what he has said just now&mdash;that section 4 does not in any way affect or curtail freedom of speech to any degree greater than the existing common law offence of incitement and his denial of the idea that the section was in some way aimed at the newspapers.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister seriously maintain that this section is not in some way aimed at the newspapers?  Is a newspaper which writes an article encouraging or advocating the commission of an offence not to be proceeded against and if they are to be proceeded against what is the meaning of saying that the law is not aimed at the newspapers?  Of course, it is aimed at newspapers.  Who does the Minister think he is fooling?</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to the point of either amendment of the section to substitute &ldquo;incites&rdquo; for &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; or a clarification by definition or failing that let the Minister give us some reason other than his alleged concern for the modernisation of our vocabulary why he is using the words &ldquo;encourages or advocates&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;incites&rdquo; here and why he will not limit it by definition <Col N="934" /> which seems to me to cover his quaint concern for our vocabulary or style.</P>
    <P>All of us on this side of the House had more than very serious doubts and were strongly opposed to this section and this whole Bill before we heard the Minister but with every statement the Minister has made here, with every argument he has put forward, with every stylistic nuance that he has introduced, our concern has deepened.  This section in particular can become, in certain conditions, a very grave and real threat to freedom of expression and freedom of comment here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the most objectionable part of this section of the Bill is the deliberate confusion of the general motivation behind the formation of organisations or groups or conglomerations of people who get together for any purpose, the confusion of the idea that those of us in all parties over the years who have concerned ourselves with social matters of one kind or another, in varying degrees and to varying extents, should be lumped in together or related in our motivations to various criminal activities, conspiracies to murder, to rob or to steal and other activities which obviously have completely different objectives.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister gain by this section?  He talks about the subversive groups which he is aiming at, but is it not a fact that he will not touch the subversive groups or the quasi-political groups he talks about as being the target of this section?  None of us in any of the parties who become involved in this sort of activity, or protest, or unemployment movement, or anti-emigration movement, or fish-in or family planning, the latest one, or women's lib, or whatever it may be, need be concerned and he is simply concerned to deal with these quasi-political groups or subversive activities. Has he not watched the developments in every country in the world over the years and throughout history, including the present unfortunate situation in the North of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last people to be affected by this section will be his allegedly subversive <Col N="935" /> groups or quasi-political groups.  The people whose liberties he will restrict and delimit are the democrats, the people who believe in democratic organisations of one kind or another. The people at whom he purports to aim this legislation will simply turn their attentions elsewhere.  They will take action in other ways.  There are so many precedents nowadays for the protest, the spectacular protest, that they will simply move away from squatting.  There are many alternatives open to them at present, hi-jacking something or other, or kidnapping, or assassination, or dropping a bomb somewhere, or setting fire to some place.  There are dozens of alternatives open to the subversive groups or the quasi-political groups on whom he says he is wasting the time of this House.</P>
    <P>There are many other important matters on which this House could spend its time but instead of that we are debating this completely antidemocratic piece of legislation to which we in the Labour Party are violently opposed because it reduces a very important element in our lives here in Ireland.  Whatever the many and grave defects there are in our society&mdash;and God knows I have probably listed them on more occasions than anybody else&mdash;we have had over the years the right of dissent, of stating a case in strong terms for or against a failing or defect in our society, of supporting those who share our views and criticising those who do not.</P>
    <P>In this section the Minister is making inroads on this basic freedom, the basic right of the individual to dissent from other groups, from other political groups or from other persons within the group to which he wants to belong. The essential dynamic of the whole democratic process is the dynamic of debate.  We are told that the Minister is concerned only with these people and that in order to deal with them we must have this section.  There is no doubt in the world that this section will not deal with them.  It will not inhibit their activities in the slightest but all the rest of us will have to suffer under this particular objectionable section which puts us all in fear <Col N="936" /> of having to prove that the people with whom we work have views that we do not share and are ashamed of and dissent from.</P>
    <P>We apologise for the fact that they hold them; we disown them; we disclaim them; we exculpate ourselves from any association with them or with anything they may have said: the whole demeaning, humiliating process of undermining the association between people who unite together in the broadest terms because they are like-minded and because they want to achieve certain objectives even though there may be differences on detail here and there.  This broad principle is being assaulted in the most blatant way in this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond showed that squatting is a negligible problem.  It is a relatively unimportant problem in our society at present.  None of us is justifying squatting at all in publicly owned houses.  I personally disapprove of it and I have always said I do. I go even further.  I disapproved of the principle of parents and children squatting simply because of the undesirable effects on both mother and child or children in such circumstances. I still believe that as a form of protest it is made only because of the Government's failure to provide houses for people.  This is not the section or the evil for which the Bill is being introduced.  The Bill is introduced in order to deal with a process of protests against a deficiency in the Government's activities.  Section 4 is not the answer.  Another 12,000 houses in Dublin is the answer.  It is a fact that the Government are only not providing the houses but in order to attempt to conceal the magnitude of their failure they are attempting to reduce the effectiveness of any protest being made by the people who want to highlight their failure in regard to this very important problem.</P>
    <P>I am astonished at the looseness of the phraseology of this amended section. I do not understand how a lawyer such as the Minister could defend the provisions of this section.  The Minister has made no attempt to deal with Deputies' queries about the interpretation <Col N="937" /> of the wording of this section. Under this section a district justice, in order to decide on the merits of a case, would have to consider the Constitution and the rules and the extent to which the defendant had participated in the activities of the group.  It is outrageous to suggest that anybody could make sense of this clause and then we go on to talk about what is reasonable or unreasonable.  &ldquo;The extent to which the defendant had participated in the activities of the group&rdquo;&mdash;how often did he attend their meetings? Had he paid the party or group subscription?  Did he have a party card?  Is he up to date?  To what extent did he agree or disagree or dissent or take no part in the debate or discussion at which the decision was arrived at for which he now finds himself in court? Clearly the minutes of the meetings of every group, every organisation can be subjected to the scrutiny of the courts as the case goes from one court to another right up to the Supreme Court and then eventually for consideration of the constitutionality of the Bill.  In what way does the person support the group?  There is the question of the interpretation of the degree of support, whether a person simply attended a meeting, whether he applauded or did not applaud, whether he made a speech, whether he provided the flat in which they held their meetings or whether he simply gave moral support.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this was not aimed at the newspapers as I had suggested. I reassert that it is aimed at the newspapers and I would add that it is also aimed at television and radio coverage and the coverage of many journals which now take a much greater interest in social issues of one kind or another and who could, by advocating change, encourage decisions by individuals to take action of this kind.  Why in section 4 (3) are the following words used: &ldquo;may regard proof of the defendant's membership of the group and of the making of the statement by or on behalf of the group as proof of consent on the part of the defendant in the absence of any adequate explanation by him&rdquo;?  Surely the Minister must be ashamed at the appalling woolliness of that provision and the near impossibility of its interpretation <Col N="938" /> in anything like objective terms?  The words usually used&mdash;I do not particularly want them used here&mdash; are &ldquo;shall provide proof&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall regard proof&rdquo; or &ldquo;will regard proof&rdquo;. Why &ldquo;may regard proof&rdquo;?  Then we have this completely wide and double ended word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;adequate explanation&rdquo;.  I wonder, as I said earlier on, if the Minister was impressed by the seriousness of the opposition to this section and has amended it in this way in order to make it completely unworkable.  Would the Minister not reconsider the whole section and on Report Stage have the courage to accept that there are genuine protests, which are not simply obstructionist protests?</P>
    <P>We are concerned that a very serious component of the very delicate fabric of the democratic process is under assault here, is under threat and that the people the Minister is going to penalise are those who share our belief in the democratic process.  The provisions of the section will not have the slightest effect on those for whom the Minister said he designed this disreputable piece of legislation&mdash;his quasi-political groups and his subversive groups.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious that the idea of squatting, of taking possession as a form of protest, has a distinguished lineage.  I suppose the most honourable example of all can be seen in the front hall of Leinster House&mdash;the Proclamation, with the very distinguished names attached.  The decision to equate with criminality the taking of forcible possession as a form of protest against an unjust government is just as ignoble and as contemptible as the precedent which the Minister did not mention&mdash;the precedent which was used against the men who signed the Proclamation.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the Minister is not going to shoot us for squatting or taking possession but it is dishonourable of him to relate this use of the different kinds of protest open to us&mdash;the boycott, the picket, strikes or squatting as a form of social protest&mdash;with some form of criminality.  I never thought that I should find myself having to protest in this House against the introduction <Col N="939" /> of such legislation.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure to what extent I agree with the section but as a man with some common sense I shall vote for it.  However, the section can be rethought and restructured and there is no reason why a method cannot be found to solve the problems that have been raised by Deputies who have spoken.</P>
      <P>A Bill such as this should not be necessary.  Since the Act of Union we have managed without legislation of this kind and people have succeeded in retaining their property in the years since then.  However, I could not stand idly by and accept that someone can walk into another man's property and take it over.  If people can walk into a Georgian house today they can do the same tomorrow and take possession of a man's farm or public house.  We must have some common sense in this matter.</P>
      <P>How many of those who have been preaching here against this section would allow people to take over their property?  All the nonsense that has been spoken here does not cut any ice with me.  Although the Bill is not all I should like it to be, it is aimed at protecting private and public property. Its purpose is to give property owners title to their property and not to put them into the unhappy position whereby their property can be taken over by anyone who squats in it.  It is easy for an Opposition party to oppose any proposal by the Government.  The fact that I resigned from Fianna Fáil does not alter my mind on a matter such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one major problem involved in section 4, namely, that football clubs and such groups could be in trouble.  The Minister should look into this matter and on Report Stage let us know what changes he has made.  So far as the two major parties are concerned, I think there would be general agreement on this point.  I do not think either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil want to see the situation whereby property can be taken over arbitrarily, as would be the case if we accepted some of the proposals that have been put <Col N="940" /> before us this evening.  I doubt if one Deputy who has spoken would go home to his wife and admit that he said what he did, because she would throw him out the door.  I gave the tinkers good advice.  I told them to go into the urban areas and into Achill and Valentia.  If they go into Achill they will be in my constituency and I will be able to get their votes. That would be important.  I hope, however, that they will not go into Achill and take over anybody's property.  If 500 or 600 of them go into Achill there will be plenty of tourists there this year.  If they go into Valentia they will have a good Blaney bridge, not a Bailey bridge, but I would not like them to take over other people's property there.</P>
    <P>If Deputies voted conscientiously on this measure I doubt if they could really oppose it.  A Bill like this has not become necessary until now.  I suppose it is difficult for young people to accept that such a Bill is necessary. I think it is necessary judging by some of the things I have seen in this city and around the country, though not in my own constituency.  However, I would ask the Minister to have another look at the wording of section 4.</P>
    <P>Some speaker here said that if Fianna Fáil had built enough houses this kind of problem would not arise. Who the hell built houses except Fianna Fáil?  Every house from Ballina to Blacksod was built by Fianna Fáil. If there are not enough houses in other parts of the country that is because the unfortunate people have very poor types of representation.  The Telefís Éireann &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team admitted that we had the best houses in Ireland in the west.  They did not grow like mushrooms.  Every damn house in it was built since 1933.  Let no one have any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Just because I had a row with my party is no reason why I should not be honest and tell the truth.  I am not sure that I agree entirely with section 4 but let no one be in any doubt as to how I will vote; I will vote with the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two objections to the section, as amended.  Even <Col N="941" /> now there is in the section the proposition that a man is guilty until he proves his innocence; it is up to the defendant to prove that he did not commit a crime.  This is contradictory to the long tradition of law in this country.  Even Bloody Balfour, of unhappy memory, did not impose upon defendants this kind of thing.  The Coercion Acts never required a man to prove his innocence.</P>
      <P>I want to draw attention to a specific deficiency in the section.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will make a note of the point because it is of considerable importance.</P>

      <P>The first subsection says that a person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence shall be guilty of an offence.  The new subsection says &ldquo;where a statement in contravention of subsection (1) is made&rdquo;.  How does one make a statement in contravention of subsection (1)?  I have here the Concise Oxford Dictionary and it says &ldquo;in contravention of&rdquo; means violating.  We have then a person making a statement violating subsection (1).  How does one make a statement violating subsection (1)?  Obviously one does so by discouraging somebody from doing something, not by encouraging.  I believe the use of the word is all wrong.  I believe the section is not properly drafted.  It is as simple as that.  &ldquo;In contravention of&rdquo; are specific words and, &ldquo;in contravention of a specific subsection&rdquo;, means one is violating that subsection.  The subsection says &ldquo;a person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence&rdquo;. How does one violate that subsection? One violates it by advocating the opposite or by stating something that is the opposite of it.  This is what is now in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a lawyer and neither is the Parliamentary Secretary but there is the tag that where ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise.  It is no harm once in a while to bring in a person who is not legally minded but who has regard <Col N="942" /> to the ordinary meaning of words. &ldquo;Contravention&rdquo; means &ldquo;in violation of&rdquo;.  Of course, the people who drafted this had other things in their minds than what I have in mind at the moment.  I think of it by way of the ordinary meaning of words and that is the way the courts would construe it, and in that context this is not correct in any sense of the word.</P>
    <P>It has become popular, and proper, to take the State to the Supreme Court on constitutional issues, and I think that if this goes to the Supreme Court there is no doubt as to how they will react.  There is the principle that everybody is innocent until proved guilty and I think all that I have been speaking about is to tie up in a mass of verbiage the suggestion that people can be proved guilty by association, that they can be proved guilty unless they prove themselves innocent.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said he would vote in favour of the Bill, apparently to rehabilitate himself with the party, but he did not speak too favourably of the Bill.  This is not unusual nowadays. People vote for the party though they do not speak favourably of the party. That has become too obvious to be labouring it here.  I am sorry the Minister is not here because I wanted him to answer the points I have made.  A Deputy pointed out earlier that some difficulties of this sort were drawn to the Minister's attention but the Minister did not answer.  Of course, the more errors in this type of Bill the better and anybody who went to the trouble of construing this would take the obvious meaning, the meaning I took from it.  I looked through the larger dictionary in which there is an entire paragraph, but the volume is too heavy to bring in here.  The Parliamentary Secretary may think that I have been making this point just to prolong the debate but he can get that out of his mind.  It is a good point for the Committee Stage of a Bill and I should like to hear the Minister's answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am interested in the point raised by Deputy O'Donovan and the House is indebted to him for bringing his analytical mind to bear on the words. <Col N="943" /> There is a lot of force in what he has said.  The draftsman says:</P>
      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Then the section goes on:</P>
      <P>Where a statement in contravention of subsection (1) of this section is made by or on behalf of a group of persons....</P>
      <P>Obviously, the draftsman, when drafting subsection (2), assumed that he had drafted subsection (1) something like this:</P>
      <P>A person shall not encourage or advocate the commission of an offence under subsections (2) or (3) of this Act....</P>
      <P>There is, however, the point that there is not one word in subsection (1) about a statement.  Surely somebody could encourage or advocate the commission of a crime in a variety of ways without issuing a statement.  He could, for instance, parade as a sandwich man, or he could encourage it by cheering the people on.  Although there is not a word about a statement in subsection (1), when we come to subsection (2) the whole talk is about a statement.  In my opinion, all this goes to show that this Bill was drafted in haste and in a fit of bad temper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this section is meaningless. I do not say subsection (1) is meaningless. The provision that a person who encourages the commission of an offence under subsections (2) and (3) is clear enough, but when we come to the next provision it seems to have been drafted on the assumption that subsection (1) was drafted otherwise, because in subsection (1) there is no reference to a statement good, bad or indifferent.  I do not know whether publishing something in a newspaper is making a statement.  Could it be argued that a person who walks up and down with a placard is making a statement? He could encourage or advocate people inside in a variety of ways other than by making a statement.  I suggest that subsection (2) should have been drafted like this: &ldquo;Where a person is charged with an offence under subsection (1),&rdquo;<Col N="944" /><i>et cetera</i>.&rdquo;  That might make some sense.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should have another look at the entire section. If he does I am sure he will come to the conclusion that there is a lot in what Deputy O'Donovan has said.  For instance, I should like the Minister to tell us whether, if a person encourages the commission of an offence otherwise than by making a statement, he is guilty of an offence.  The whole thing is a complete mess and it might be beneficial if the Minister devoted some time to dealing with these points than to dealing in a general way with the provisions as he has done to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister is not here to answer the question put to him by Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Fitzpatrick I might come in at this stage.  I hope these questions are being communicated to the Minister and I hope we may hear his answers to them in due course.  In the absence of an opportunity for him to do so at the moment I would like to refer to the Bill in general and this section, even as amended, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to lend my voice to those of the Deputies on these benches who have expressed unalterable hostility to this section no matter how it were to be amended.  There are probably few Deputies who have a better record of refusing to obstruct Government legislation for the sake of obstructing it, of not making lengthy speeches for the sake of making lengthy speeches than I.  Even this morning in the closing stages of the Committee Stage of the Higher Education Bill I expressed a view from my side of the House that acceptable Government legislation should be permitted to pass rapidly. However, when one comes to a measure as blatantly unacceptable as this then I think one is entitled to use the time of the House to express the dissent and distaste which one feels for it in the most forcible terms, even if in so doing one takes up the time of the House.  If in so doing one does take up the time of the House the fault is not one's own; it is the fault of the Government which has brought this strange, complex, unnecessary and <Col N="945" /> potentially highly dangerous measure before the House at this moment in time.</P>
    <P>I am not a journalist, I am not a lawyer, I am not competent to adjudicate specifically upon what constitutes journalistic freedom, although I have some small experience in that field. I am not able to tread my way through the legal intricacies of this Bill, if indeed anyone can.  I would have thought that this debate on the Committee Stage had demonstrated that no one can with absolute certitude since the wording of the Bill is so loose.  I know something about freedom as a valuable European concept and I know something about the very nicely drawn difficulties which attend upon the obligation to communicate with impartiality through the media.  I have some experience in these two fields: the academic field of studying what one might call the philosophy of freedom and the practical journalistic field of endeavouring to sustain freedom of communication in the face of a government, any government, in the case of my experience this government or one of its previous models, which did not cherish the ideal of journalistic freedom or freedom of communications pretty highly.</P>
    <P>The English philosopher John Stuart Mill in a memorable passage in <i>An Essay on Liberty,</i> a work with which, judging by the Minister for Justice's demeanour in the time I have known him I doubt if he numbers amongst his library, once said, &ldquo;All mankind hath not the right to silence one dissenter&rdquo;&mdash;a marvellous statement which is as true today as it was when he made it in, as far as I recall, the 1860s.  Today the dissenters, uncomfortable people, are the exponents of squatting, fish-ins and Women's Lib. It is fashionable to patronise these people.  I am not saying they are invariably correct in either their aims or their tactics but perhaps the fullest volume of patronisation comes from the benches behind the Minister.</P>
    <P>Today was Derby Day.  I suppose it seemed very funny and unfeminine when that suffragette flung herself in front of the royal horse so many years <Col N="946" /> ago.  Yet there are not now many of us who would say that votes for women was a funny or irresponsible claim to make socially.  Those people were similarly unpopular outcasts then.  Perhaps the Minister and we on all these benches, enmeshed as we are in the ritual of this chamber, and the parliamentary club atmosphere which surrounds it, should ask ourselves occasionally if similarly we too are not wrong and the dissidents, the uncomfortable people, are not perhaps right. After all, they were right in 1916.</P>
    <P>A section like this would have found itself very much at home in the Defence of the Realm Act.  Is that what we are reduced to 50 years later?  We imprison and silence not merely our actual protesters, some of whom may grate on our nerves, but also people who encourage or advocate the protests which they make, which under this Bill will become not merely civilly illegal as they are at the moment but criminally illegal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Encourage&rdquo;&mdash;what is encourage? This point has been made before and it deserves to be made again.  The Labour Party by its presence in this House I hope encourages a feeling of radical dissatisfaction with the society in which we live, encourages the <i>saeva indignatio</i> of Swift&mdash;at least I hope it does.  Does that make it guilty of a crime?  Is it a crime to tell people that the context in which they live is intolerably unjust and unfair?  Is it written down in Holy Writ by the Minister, the Taoiseach or anybody else that the only place in which people who have been inert and dissatisfied for 50 years&mdash;I blame all governments; I am not interested in who built most houses in 1930 or in 1935&mdash;can externalise their dissent is here in the national Parliament where they have so vainly tried to externalise it for so many years?  Is it a crime to say to them that much of the time of the House is wasted and they look in vain to us to bring relief to their misery and their poverty in the ghettoes and slums which still persist, for example, in the city of Dublin?  It is going to become a crime if this Bill becomes law as no doubt the Minister's docile majority buttressed in this instance by the friendly rhetoric of <Col N="947" /> Deputy Lenehan will ensure that it does become law.</P>
    <P>I wonder why these people feel it necessary to act in this forcible, slightly vulgar, ostentatious and to all of us perhaps inconvenient manner?  We are asked to reassure them that there is in Parliament a channel of communication which renders their undignified escapades unnecessary.  I wonder is that true?  Would the Minister not accept the fact as just about everybody else does that the increasing by-passing of this Chamber is not a functioning of some original sin or malevolent Moscow-financed or Peking-financed malice on the part of these people, rather is it due to the fact that we here have demonstrated to them that wherever else they may look for really radical social change they need not look here for it?  Would it not be better to blame ourselves for our inadequacies rather than penalise these people under this section for revolting against our inadequacies?</P>
    <P>This Bill, furthermore, introduces a concept of guilt by association which I find intensely distasteful and one which survives even in its amended form, but perhaps less grotesquely and offensively than in its original form. To me the idea that a person who is a member of a group should be required in law publicly to dissociate himself from the actions of another member of that group at the risk of penal consequences if he does not do so is a denial of human dignity, quite frankly.  We all look back with veneration on 1916.  We in the Labour Party take pride also in looking back on 1913.  At the end of the 1913 strike the strikers were asked to sign a form of capitulation to the effect that they, at least, were good, clean-living slaves of the then existing capitalist system and would have nothing to do with the late James Larkin.  The spirit of that demand to the unfortunate tram workers of Dublin in 1913 runs right through this offensive section in my eyes.  It brings back to me the evocation of poverty which you get in a book like <i>Strumpet City</i>.  It seems to me a terrible confession of failure, again, that in this day and age people <Col N="948" /> should be asked to dissociate themselves from the more voluble, radical, articulate of their fellow-members of those quasi-political groups as the Minister calls them, if they are to preserve their legal freedom.  I am not a lawyer but this is a concept which to me is unknown in the laws of decent communities but is very well known in instances, such as the one I cited of 1913, and in totalitarian societies where the principle of guilt by association has long existed.</P>
    <P>This is a principle which is being resisted in all countries not so much, as Deputy Dr. Browne, as I understood him, correctly put it, by the violent men who are out to destroy society in any case and to whom this Bill will become a quite welcome incentive to still greater violence.  This principle of guilt by association has rather been opposed by the liberals who cherish parliamentary institutions and the free making of decisions by discussion, voting and consent in a manner which the Minister alleges to cherish but does not in fact.</P>
    <P>I think of America where the principle that you would not testify against your friend under the Smith Act was asserted with honour and dignity by people with much to lose, playwrights, cinema directors, a singer like Paul Robeson.  Now this principle is to be breached here.  By whom is it to be breached?  To what group of men are we committing the powers of interpretation contained in this section?  Let me give two simple illustrations of the potential dangers to which this Bill, if it becomes law, could leave us open at the hands of these people.  The other day on a question on the National College of Art and the student agitations there the Minister for Education said to me&mdash;I am quoting him from memory&mdash;that the nature of the agitation showed a familiar pattern and that the same kind of people seemed to be involved over the past few years. When asked by me what he meant he said that the Deputy can work it out for himself or something like that.  In other words, there is no problem in the National College of Art; there is just a gang of organised Maoists, Communists and such like&mdash;a simple solution to an educational problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> Again, some years ago&mdash;I have mentioned this in the House before and I mention it again because I think it was despicable&mdash;a Member of the Upper House, a Member of the Minister for Justice's party, said of a certain priest who lectures in a college in this city that because of his political views&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain it to the Minister in a second&mdash;because of his political views, and the manner in which he influenced his students, he was not fit to hold the post which he held and if the said Senator had anything to do with it he would cease to hold it.  If this priest in a class says to his students that he advocates and encourages the commission of an offence under section 1 of this Bill is he liable to prosecution?  Indeed, should we not go further?  Do the rest of the Dominican Order not have to come in here on their hands and knees to the <Col N="950" /> Minister for Justice and dissociate themselves from him?  The Minister may think it is funny and he may think it is exaggerated but I do not.</P>
      <P>The wording of this deplorable section frightens me no more than does the demeanour of the Government over the past two years who will be empowered to operate this section.  The combination is terrifying.  I do not know if the Minister ever goes to the pictures. I have already recommended to him a book, when he was not here, John Stuart Mill's <i>On Liberty</i>.  I now want to recommend to him a Greek film called Z, also on liberty.  I would like to place on record that in my view, and I am not an extremist or an alarmist, the implications of this section for liberty in this country are as frightening as the assumptions of arbitrary authority which took place in countries like Greece before the final deluge which absorbed liberty occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section on the grounds that it tends to shift the onus of proof in effect from the prosecution to the defendant.  The kernel of this offence is ownership of the land or vehicle in question and what this section does is to make it unnecessary for the prosecution to prove ownership.  Consequently, it says to the defendant: &ldquo;We are not saying anything about ownership.  It is up to you to prove ownership; otherwise you are guilty.&rdquo;  That is putting the onus of proof on the defendant to show that he is guilty.  It is not a question of shifting the evidential burden that the Minister referred to while speaking on section 1 because it is the substance of the burden of proof that is involved here.  Let it not be directly involved but substantially that is what it means.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it seems to me that the section is now unnecessary by reason of the amendment to section 2.  Paragraph (c) of section 2 provides for exemption for persons who enter in pursuance of a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right. I expect that that subsection will be availed of in all of the cases arising under this Bill and that consequently the exemption contained in section 5 will not arise.  Another point that occurs to me in relation to section 5 is the wording of it where it reads:</P>
      <P>... every person whom he encouraged or attempted to encourage... 5785</P>
      <P>I have been puzzled as to how one can attempt to encourage or how any person can prove that an attempt to encourage was made.  I do not think there are any half measures about encouraging. One either encourages a person or does not encourage him.  I fail to see how one could attempt to encourage.  If one raised a hand in support at a meeting or if one voted yes or wrote an article or spoke, there would be substantial encouragement but there is no question of attempt to encourage involved.  Therefore, it renders the section ridiculous to have these words in.</P>
      <P>Another objection to the section is that in effect if it shifts the onus of proof with regard to ownership of land to the defendant and the defendant raises a question of title, every prosecution under this section becomes a title action.  That is hardly intended but that is the result that will follow.  If such a ridiculous result can follow, the section is bad and should be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is another of the more objectionable sections of this Bill in so far as that in effect it presumes the defendant to be guilty until he proves himself to be innocent or presumes a group of people to be guilty until they prove themselves innocent.  It is an alien idea to introduce this into legislation.  When we cannot give the world a lead in other respects, we should at least in our laws show the greatest amount of justice, fair play and civil rights.  It is legislation which contains sections such as this particular one that holds us up to ridicule not only to our neighbouring countries but to the countries of the world.</P>
      <P>Contained in this, as well as any of the criminal offences that have now been created, including the criminal offence contained in section 4 and emphasised by Deputy O'Donovan, is the criminal offence now of acting in contravention of subsection (1) of section 4.  A person, in order to contravene that section, would have to refuse to encourage or advocate.  If one refuses to encourage one commits an offence because one is acting in contravention. This shows how ridiculous section 5 is. It is not always possible, and a defendant in such circumstances may not always have the means, to prove innocence and, as in all laws, the onus of proof must lie with the prosecution. The onus should not be on the defendant to prove that he is innocent but that onus is being placed on him in this section.  Therefore, we would oppose the section strongly and vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person commits an offence of forcible entry or forcible occupation under section 2 or 3 of the Bill it will, in the overwhelming majority of cases, be in circumstances where he has no colour of right to the property entered or occupied.  Since it would be unreasonable to the point of absurdity to require the prosecution to go through the tedious and possibly costly process of proving ownership that is not being challenged, section 5 provides that, unless the defendant satisfies the court that he has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership <Col N="954" /> of the property, it will not be necessary for the prosecution to prove the ownership.  In practice the effect of this section will be that the prosecution will not have to introduce evidence of ownership of property unless the defendant raises and puts in issue a real question of title.  It should be observed that the onus placed on the defendant is minimal in that he is not required to prove ownership, merely to introduce a <i>bona fide</i> claim of title for which there is some colour or show of reason.  Once he fulfils that obligation the onus is firmly on the prosecution to prove the ownership of the property as part of its case against him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pattison is completely mixed up about what the effect of this section is.  He thinks it provides in some way that a man is guilty of one of these offences until he proves himself innocent. That is totally wrong.  It is necessary for the prosecution in proving one of these offences under section 2, 3 or 4 to prove quite a variety of different component parts that would go to make up the offence.  One of these, and one of the least important from the overall legal point of view, is the question of the ownership of the property.  If the persons who occupy a premises forcibly or remain in forceful occupation of it dispute the ownership of the property, then the prosecution has to prove it.  If they do not dispute it&mdash;and in 99 per cent of cases they do not&mdash;the prosecution does not have to prove that small component part of its entire case.</P>
      <P>The only reason we have this provision here is not to make things any more difficult for the defendant but simply and solely to save the time, trouble and expense of getting up title deeds and going through what could be a lengthy and expensive process of proving the ownership when that is not disputed by anybody.  In practically all business premises today the property would be mortgaged in some form or other.  The title deeds would be either with the bank on deposit for safe-keeping or they would be with a building society, insurance company or some other such organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> It is in the interest of the defendant who wants a speedy trial that this provision is here.  If he is arrested, say, this evening in a premises in Dublin, he could be tried in the morning in the district court, but if the prosecution had to send to England or send to a bank or somewhere else for the deeds of the property it would inevitably mean delay.  It might well suit the defendant to get his case over and done with there and then. It it quite wrong, and I cannot reiterate this often enough, to say that there is any question of the onus of proof being put on the defendant.  I do not know why people misread it in that way.  It is simply a question of whether or not the prosecution has to require the owners to bring in the deeds and other documents.  What this section provides is that if the ownership is not disputed it will not be necessary to produce the deeds.  If the defendant says he wants the deeds brought in they will be brought in.</P>
    <P>I cannot readily put my finger on the particular section but in the Housing Act, the Local Government Acts and other legislation there is a somewhat similar provision to the effect that where a local authority takes proceedings for possession of one of its dwellings&mdash;it happens every day of the week in connection with arrears of rent or something else&mdash;provided the city solicitor or whoever it is calls the rent collector to say that this is corporation property, the court accepts it at that.  If the defendant makes a song and dance about it, which he never does, the city solicitor could ask for an adjournment for a week or two in order to get his deeds.  The expense and trouble of that would be enormous. The result is that it is never done.  It is a similar provision to the one here, and the fact that this procedure is never adopted does no harm to anybody.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Minister knows, the normal practice is that the State must prove its case, must discharge the onus of proof.  For example, in a case under the Larceny Act the State must prove <Col N="956" /> that goods have been stolen; the property must be identified and the owner must prove that the property is his, that he did not give anybody permission to take it.  Then it must be proved that the defendant actually took it without the consent of the owner. Presumably if the Minister was revising the Larceny Act of 1916 now he would tidy it up a bit and put a clause into it that unless the accused person proved that he had a claim of ownership to the goods in question it would not be necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We shall come to that.  The Minister would put a section into the Larceny Act of 1916 that unless the accused person was able to show that he had a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership&mdash;those are the exact words&mdash;there would be no onus on the State to produce evidence that he did not own it.  The law at the moment is that the State must prove ownership, and, indeed, as the Minister knows, in cases of corporated companies it is necessary to produce the certificate of incorporation in court; many judges have asked for it.  The Minister has stated that in the civil courts in cases for possession or for rent it is not necessary for the corporation or the local authority to prove ownership.  Of course, it is not necessary because in all of these cases the tenant who is being ejected or who has a claim made for rent on him has signed a tenancy agreement, and the tenant is stopped by a long-established principle of law from disputing the ownership of the landlord with whom he has entered into a tenancy agreement. We should keep it clearly before us that here we are dealing with a criminal case and the case the Minister has been talking about, even if what he said were so, is a civil case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the necessity of producing title deeds in court, perhaps getting them from a bank in Dublin or Northern Ireland or even some finance house in London; or the way we are going on it might be necessary to recall them from further <Col N="957" /> afield than London.  However, we could amend this section in a way that would dispense with the production of the title deeds and provide that a sworn statement by the owner that he owned the property and did not give anybody permission to enter would be sufficient.  Surely in any proceedings under this section it will be necessary anyway, I hope, to call the owner to say that he did not give permission to the accused to go into it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

        <i>(Cavan):</i> He does, but it should be provided that it would be necessary for the owner to say on oath that he owns the property and that he did not give permission to go into it.</P>
      <P>I think we should discourage ourselves, if that is the proper word, from putting something into Acts of Parliament that is not capable of proof.  As I see it, it will be unnecessary for the State to prove ownership unless the accused person proves that he had a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership if he is charged with an offence under sections 2 or 3, but when we come to section 4 he will have to prove that everyone whom he encouraged or attempted to encourage had a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership.  With all due respect that is impossible to prove because presumably the person who is charged under this section will be some well-intentioned character who will probably make a speech outside the property concerned and there will be people going up and down.  How will he identify all those, bring them along and say: &ldquo;They are all the people that I encouraged or attempted to encourage and each and every one of those has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership.&rdquo;?  I put it to the Minister, in all seriousness, that that is an absurdity. It simply could not be done and if it could not be done there is no use putting it in.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Then why not go the whole hog and say something that is sensible, say that in the case of an offence under section 4 the State simply shall not have to prove ownership, full stop, without going on with this bit of camouflage that is there pretending you are giving the accused person some protection when, in fact, you are not.</P>
      <P>Again supposing he encouraged ten people who had a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership to go in and five who had not, where would the offence arise there?  The ten people might own it in common or have a claim to it under the absurd description of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in section 1.  They might go in and other people might go in with them. He will be charged then, and he will be innocent of inciting or encouraging the people who had ownership in the property and he will be guilty in respect of the other people.  The whole trend of this section is somewhat dangerous. We should at least make it obligatory on the State to prove the owner, or the person claiming to be the owner, and that it would be necessary for him in addition to saying that he did not give anybody authority to go in, to say that he is the owner.  We will skip the title deeds if the Minister wants to skip them, but I would put that onus on the owner because he will have to be called anyway.</P>

From the Minister's point of view it is a well-intentioned Bill and to his way of thinking even this section is well-intentioned, but it will be very difficult to operate it because there is another section that the Minister brought in by way of an amendment which says that anything that is done under this section, that is done <Col N="959" /> with the consent of the owner, is not an offence.  I think any lawyer defending an accused person will ask for a direction at the conclusion of the State case unless the owner has been called to say that he did not give authority. Surely the onus will not be shifted on to the accused person to prove that he had the authority of the owner?  I hope we have not got to that stage in this measure; and if the owner has to be called to say that he did not give authority why can he not say: &ldquo;I am the owner and I did not give authority&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In relation to this section as elsewhere in the Bill, there seems to be a certain discrepancy between how the Minister explains the Bill to the House and the ordinary literal meaning of the Bill as it stands before us.  The Minister has just been explaining it on the lines that if someone can show that he has a <i>bona fide</i> claim, or can even make a claim at all, then there is no, as he says, song and dance about it, that this is quite a simple case and that no important onus of proof is shifted at all.  On the other hand, the subclause beginning &ldquo;unless&rdquo; in this section seems to me to be very extraordinary and one which not merely shifts the onus of proof but shifts it to the point where the defendant can never prove what he is required to prove under the section. &ldquo;Unless the defendant shows to the satisfaction of the court that he or, in the case of proceedings relating to an offence under section 4, every person whom he encouraged or attempted to encourage has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to <Col N="964" /> ownership of the land or vehicle, it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to prove ownership of the land or vehicle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understood that the Minister is prepared to consider changes to this section but I did not understand if the changes he is prepared to consider involved section 4 which seems to be the most objectionable section. He has to prove that every person whom he encouraged or attempted to encourage has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership of the land or vehicle.  That would mean, for example, that if among the people he encouraged one had a <i>bona fide</i> claim but others who came to the help of the person who had the <i>bona fide</i> claim if they were encouraged, had not such a claim then the defendant would fail under this section.  This requirement is utter nonsense because it has been said by the Minister in relation to the offence of incitement&mdash;and the Minister claims that incitement is what he is dealing with under section 4, advocate or encourage, although he has used different words, no doubt deliberately &mdash;you do not have to prove that you encouraged anybody nor if a person is deemed to have encouraged people here would he have any means of knowing whom he encouraged.  He might know some of the people but he certainly could not know all of them, but here he has to show that every person he encouraged has a <i>bona fide</i> claim even though almost by definition, in the case of words spoken before a wide audience, or the printed word or words on television there is no means of knowing who was encouraged or not encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the offence of attempting to encourage only the person who spoke or wrote the words complained of by definition can know fully whom he was attempting to encourage.  After that he has to convince the court that these were the persons he was attempting to encourage and after that he has to show that all of them, every person, has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to the ownership of the land or vehicle.  It is deplorable to introduce such a crushing, impossible burden of proof into a subordinate clause in a Bill.  The <Col N="965" /> Minister's language when replying to a similar point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick was revealing.  He seemed to indicate that it was all right to put an impossible burden on them because they should not be trying to do these things anyway.  That shows a lack of sensitivity towards the rights of people, even people who may do something to which the Minister objects.  Specifically we would like to know whether if the Minister is going to make changes in this he will be prepared to drop what seems to us this extremely objectionable and deliberate imposition of an impossible burden of proof on a given class of persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 is in the name of Deputy Cooney.  If the Deputy agrees, perhaps we could take amendments Nos. 13 and 15 together as they are related amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 45 and 46, to delete &ldquo;either by the owner of the land or vehicle to which the offence relates or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 6 makes provision for a court, in dealing with a prosecution under this Bill, to award compensation to an owner whose property may have been damaged because a defendant has had to be forcibly removed.  Paragraph (a) of section 6 provides that:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act is committed by a person (in this subsection referred to as the defendant) who, upon being requested (either by the owner of the land or vehicle to which the offence relates or by a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform) to leave the land or vehicle,</P>
      <P>That would suggest that it is dangerous to leave it to an unidentified civilian, so to speak, to say to a person at that stage, who is not a convicted defendant but who may be before the court, although no offence has been proved, that he must do or desist from doing something.  Such an order, if it is to have sanctions or criminal consequences, should be given only by a person who can obviously be seen to be a person of authority, namely, a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform.  Again, one could have difficulty in knowing if that power of request would be available to an agent of the owner as well as to the owner. Having regard to the wide definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in the definition section one could have an owner delegating the right to demand possession to some of these private detective forces we have nowadays.  That could lead to a very undesirable situation.  It would be much better, and it would not in any way lessen the effect of the section, if the power to make a request to an alleged defendant were left to a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same arguments do not apply to amendment No. 15.  My reason for wanting to take &ldquo;owner&rdquo; out of paragraph (b) is that there would be a temptation&mdash;perhaps temptation is the wrong word&mdash;to an owner, if he is entitled to compensation for damage done when he is ejecting an alleged defendant by force, not to be discreet <Col N="969" /> in the method of removal of the trespasser. If we are entering into the realm of criminal law again it would be quite sufficient, I think, to leave enforcement entirely in the hands of the Garda Síochána.  If compensation for damage is going to arise as a result of a removal effected under this measure it should arise only when the damage is unavoidable and reasonably caused.  As it is, this opens the door to the undesirable possibility of private detectives being engaged for the purpose of clearing premises and the owner then being able to ask the criminal court to award him compensation for the damage done by these persons.  At the moment, as the Minister is aware, any person can use force to evict a trespasser from his premises.  If I found squatters in my home I would not wait to invoke the law to get rid of them; I would get rid of them myself.  I am entitled to use as much force as is reasonably necessary in doing so but, under the common law, I would not have any consequential right to compensation, except in so far as an action for trespass might lie, and then there might be difficulty in proving that the damage was sufficiently closely related to be consequential damage.</P>
    <P>This is a novel legal principle and I would, first of all, give a right to make a demand and give that right only to a person in uniform.  Secondly, I would award damages only when the damage was caused by a member of the Garda Síochána.  The difficulty of having it otherwise is that a person to whom a demand was made could ask a civilian: &ldquo;What is your authority?&rdquo; and the effect of the measure would be nullified, or else there would be a row, and that would be wrong.  Putting agents in a position to be compensated would remove the onus on them to be careful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Cooney on his attempt to bring some degree of justice into this measure but I still think it would take more than what Deputy Cooney proposes to make the section acceptable.  Because of the preceding section and the new offences it creates the only way one could achieve what Deputy Cooney <Col N="970" /> wants would be by making the Bill even more ridiculous than it is at the moment.  The suggestions I have to make might appear ridiculous on their own, perhaps, but taken in conjunction with what has gone before, there is sense in them.  The only way the section could be made acceptable would be by providing that only a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform could forcibly remove from any land or vehicle any person or the goods of any person.  At that stage we would nearly want to make it an offence for the owner, as defined in the Bill, forcibly to remove any person or goods.  One would have to create more offences.  That is why I say my suggestion might appear ridiculous but, having passed the preceding section, this is the only way we could bring some balance into the Bill.  It is completely one-sided in favour of people with property.</P>
      <P>In order to balance the scales, as it were, of justice in this case, it should be equally an offence for an owner forcibly to remove a person from his property and it should not be an offence in a subsequent prosecution for an owner to prove his ownership.  The kind of a suggestion we must make at the moment, possibly a ridiculous suggestion, is that when somebody has to be removed from property it should be only a member of the Garda Síochána who should do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept these two amendments.  We should not start off in this section on the premise that it is the duty of the Garda to effect repossession of property.  That approach, which is implicit in Deputy Cooney's amendment, is exactly the one that was criticised by several Opposition speakers, possibly by Deputy Cooney himself, on Second Stage.  They objected to the criminal law being used to enforce private property rights.  It could be argued that that would be precisely the effect of Deputy Cooney's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my belief that an owner should be the primary person <Col N="971" /> to enforce his own rights and that the gardaí should enter into the matter only when it is impossible for him to do so because of the overwhelming weight of numbers against him.  Deputy Cooney made reference to private armies.  The possible difficulty that would arise out of that is dealt with in my three amendments Nos. 16 to 18, inclusive, which make it clear that an owner in entering his property endeavouring to eject somebody clearly will be doing so within the law.  In line four, page 4, paragraph (b), it is stated that any entry by an unreasonably large number of people which would cause damage going beyond what is reasonable would not come within the scope of the section.  Therefore, there is no encouragement at all to bring squads of people or to encourage them to lay about them too much.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think the Minister should have further thoughts about his attitude to the amendments, which have considerable merit.  The Minister will appreciate that when we have reached the situation which this section deals with, we will have an explosive atmosphere. We will have a person, according to the Minister, unlawfully withholding possession, we will have the owner demanding possession and taking steps to get it, and obviously there will be a breach of the peace.  What the Minister is doing here is legislating for a breach of the peace.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I was saying, when the situation envisaged by section 6 is arrived at there will be a rather explosive atmosphere in the vicinity of the premises concerned because there will be somebody in possession, according to the Minister and the owner unlawfully in possession, and the owner will be endeavouring to get that person out.  I think a breach of the peace is inevitable and that the Minister here seems to be legislating for a breach of the peace between two private individuals. <Col N="972" /> It is much more likely that unnecessary damage will be caused to the property and that there will be unnecessary bodily harm caused to one or other or both of the people concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not think this is a situation that should be dealt with at all by civilians and there is no use in the Minister complaining that we on this side of the House want to invoke the criminal law.  The Minister has done that.  He has made this matter the subject of criminal law.  He is handing over the execution of the criminal law to a civilian.  In the interests of law and order, in the interests of the preservation of peace, the amendments being sought by Deputy Cooney, therefore, have a lot to recommend them.  There is no extreme urgency involved here.  The owner or his agent would have every opportunity, I am sure, of notifying the Garda Síochána and asking them to intervene.  It is much more likely that possession will then be taken and the offenders ejected in a rational and reasonable way, a way in which the minimum of damage will be caused to the property and a way in which no bodily injury will be caused to the offending person or to the owner.  It is a mistake to let this section go through as it is.</P>
      <P>Another thing that strikes me is that some person assuming ownership could come along here, demand possession and proceed to take possession. I know if he did any damage he might get himself involved in the civil law later on, but it is far more preferable that the owner should have to acquaint the Garda and presumably satisfy them that he was the owner and that this other person was unlawfully in possession.  I think that is much more desirable than the procedure in the Bill as drafted which will create a brawl in which a great deal of damage may be done to property and much injury done to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does not indicate to whom the property belongs and this is an important point.  We assume that it belongs to the owner, but what about the family in the house? They may have improved the house <Col N="973" /> since they went into it and spent a good deal of money doing that.  They may have quite an amount of valuable furniture and possessions of their own. The owner or his gang of bullies may break in, throw them and their belongings out and in the process smash up their property.  That seems to me to be justified action under this section.  Such action seems to have the protection of the law and here again the only class of people protected are the property owners.  Damage done to his own property by the owner in the process of breaking in to his own property may be compensated under this section, but the persons in the house who may not have done any damage whatsoever to the property could be made to pay for the damage caused by the owner.  This amendment goes some way in trying to protect property other than the owner's property.  I do not think the section states whose property or to what property it refers.  Does it refer to the property of the owner, the property of the person in residence or indeed the property of the gang who are breaking in?  If for argument's sake the hired gang have some weapons for breaking in and these weapons are broken has the unfortunate defendant in that case to pay for the damage to the weapons? I understand these gangs use batons which are about twice as thick and about three times as long as the normal Garda batons.  If these are broken in the process of breaking in will the person being thrown out have to pay for all the damage as well as damage to the property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Pattison reads the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; it will clear up some of the points he has raised.  The Minister made the point that because the obligation is present on the parties to behave reasonably this would inhibit the employment, by a person seeking possession, of a private detective force.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out, the premises sought to be cleared might be occupied by a number of persons.  The person seeking clear possession would probably be able to argue that it was reasonable for him to have the assistance of a larger number of persons so that his <Col N="974" /> attacks on the premises could be effective.  When we enter the realm of criminal law I think enforcement of criminal law should be left exclusively to the Garda.  It might help at this stage if I were to move amendment No. 14 if that would be in order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The insertion of the word &ldquo;unavoidably&rdquo; after &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; would again reinforce the Minister's point that the section inhibits as it stands any extravagant action by an owner seeking possession.  I think the amendments are reasonable, they will not cause any difficulty and they will keep civilians out of what is now a matter for the Garda.  There is a further difficulty: if the civilian claims to be the owner to a person in possession of property which he is claiming and the person in <i>bona fide</i> refuses to go because there is no proof from that civilian that he is in fact the owner, that person could subsequently on the owner showing himself to be the owner, commit an offence and be responsible for damages.  A person should know from the very beginning that, if he is refusing something, that refusal could have monetary sanctions afterwards.  It should be very clear that the person to whom the refusal is made is the person of authority.  The only person who can clearly show himself to be a person of authority is a uniformed member of the Garda.</P>

      <P>This is a typical solicitor's amendment aimed at confusing the whole matter of the section so that it will be easier for solicitors to get even softer money out of it than they would get if the section was left as it is worded at present.  The section as I see it is reasonably innocent and is absolutely correct.  We have often heard about Daniel O'Connell's boasts about driving a coach and four through Acts of Parliament but if we were to heed some of the amendments which have been tabled in this House to Bills and to sections of this type it would not be a coach and four they would need but about six trains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> I cannot agree with what has been said and I doubt if any man in his proper senses could agree with this codology.  What is wrong in this section? Has anybody been able to point out what is wrong in this section?  The only thing which has been pointed out is some points which Deputies or their professional colleagues may hope to be able to use in the future for their own political benefit and for no other reason.  I think the Minister is a solicitor.</P>

      <P>They are slightly different.  I do not agree with the point put forward by the Deputy, who is a solicitor, about a fire breaking out in a house.  It is incredible that the Deputy could make the statement that if a person went in to save the people in the house where the fire had broken out he could be prosecuted. The biggest ass in the world would not believe that type of story. Anybody who breaks into a house where there is a fire, to save the family, or if there is nobody in the house to save the house, could not possibly be prosecuted.  Who would prosecute such a person?  Who would take that person to court or who would take the action against him?  Nobody could accept that as an argument against the section.  The only thing we should consider is the question of illegally taking over people's property.  Even the tinkers in their tents would not like to see people going in to take over their property.  As far as I am concerned I agree with this section.</P>

      <P>The political independence in Belmullet is getting rather chilled this weather and the Deputy is having second thoughts.  I can see no other reason for the Deputy's preoccupation with this Bill this evening.  This section is without question a deliberate incentive to any owner of any property or vehicle to cause damage to property indiscriminately and subsequently to seek damages.  This is a fair reading of the probable results of this section.  I maintain there are adequate statutory provisions in terms of action for damages in other Acts not to require the provisions of this section.  It is a very provocative section.  Once again we see in the Minister's action a twisting of the law against defendants on the assumption of prior guilt.</P>

      <P>I feel one must take into account the fact that where damage is caused a very difficult problem arises of assessing damages in relation to damage to property.  This problem is being deliberately elevated by the Minister.  The section and the amendment do not particularly make any improvement.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, the amendment will in no way succeed in improving the section.  In fact the section is a breach of the peace and it typifies the approach of the Minister. The amendment is not of any real consequence in the long term in relation to the section as a whole. I do not think that the amendment will in the long term change the purport of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> The Minister should certainly accept that his whole approach is entirely wrong and undemocratic.  It is right to point out that there are a great many disputes relating to property, indeed that there are a greater number of internal family disputes in this country relating to property than there are to other matters.  This is where the Minister by promoting this section and by adopting this attitude in relation to the amendment will, in fact, open up areas which certainly will result in damage to property and in damage of a physical nature to the persons in the disputes.  It confuses completely the statutory role and the protective functions of the Garda Síochána and the civilian population.  This is a basic problem arising in relation to the amendment and I suggest that the Minister would be wise to drop it before the section proves to be damaging to the country.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have pointed out in relation to this Bill that it was loaded in favour of the man of very considerable substance and against the mere occupier. Deputy Lenehan is a practical man and a man who brings an earthy approach to some things.  One need not always agree with him.  The Deputy obviously thinks that there is some merit in this Bill because it will protect the lowly caravan of the unfortunate itinerant.  In drafting the Bill, the draftsman seems to have gone out of his way to exclude the itinerant caravan and to leave it vulnerable to the man who thinks that the itinerant should &ldquo;get on and get out&rdquo;.  I do not think that the protection which Deputy Lenehan sees in this amendment in favour of the itinerant is there.  If we look at the definition of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; on page 1 we will see that it means an aircraft not in flight, a train, an omni-bus or a boat&mdash;presumably a pleasure cruiser&mdash;a ship or other vessel in any port or harbour, or in any river or lake in the State or anywhere in territorial waters.  There is not a word about caravans but somebody may say they are included in the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo;.  I do not think that is so. If we go to &ldquo;land&rdquo; we will see that <Col N="978" />&ldquo;land&rdquo; includes messuages and tenements of any tenure, land covered by water, houses or other buildings or structures whatsoever and parts of any such houses, buildings or structures whether divided vertically, horizontally or otherwise.</P>

If owners were to come along with private armies, as they have been described here, and to use more force than was reasonably necessary then they would not be lawfully entering and they would be outside the scope of the section.  Assuming that my three amendments of the section are accepted, and that these people would be civilly liable for injury or whatever damage was caused to the legal occupants, as well as being deprived of the benefit of this section which would cover whatever damage they had to do in the course of their lawful business in trying to enter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Can the Minister see any conflict between the common law right of an owner to evict and use reasonable force in evicting and an owner coming in and invoking the assistance of the gardaí under this section?  If an owner invokes the assistance of the gardaí under this section and damage is caused to his property and he is awarded damages in the subsequent prosecution can he still have an action for trespass on the civil side against the people he has evicted?</P>

One might make a case that where somebody purporting to be the owner of a particular property&mdash;he might be a returned Yank&mdash;proceeds to hire a group, or even his relations, and where he claims <i>bona fide</i> entitlement to be in dispute and proceeds to take over a property and to damage it very considerably and to involve the local gardaí in the fracas with his relations or the persons with whom he is disputing ownership, it might transpire subsequently on the production of title that it was not his property at all. I see no sensitivity in the Minister's mind for the inclusion of any section in the Bill whereby a person seeking entitlement was so damaged that he would have a counterclaim.</P>

      <P>If one had a civil remedy on the one hand why should one have criminal proceedings on the other hand?  This is the whole point of this legislation.  A person could be grievously damaged in his possession of a particular piece of property which could be taken over, destroyed and <Col N="980" /> damaged by any individual indicating that he is the owner.  Such a man may &ldquo;con&rdquo; the local sergeant and involve members of the Garda Síochána in circumstances where the Garda Síochána, from my experience of them, are extremely careful and reluctant to be involved.  Traditionally they should not be involved in property disputes.  The Minister is inveigling members of the Garda Síochána into such disputes throughout the country.  The Minister is of such a frame of mind, as he said at the beginning, that the purpose of the Bill is to get at a handful of people whom he cannot conveniently catch at this point in time, and he has, therefore, devised this elaborate piece of legislation which affects all property owners and occupiers and those in possession generally.  Nobody will know whether it is or is not his own car, tent or caravan&mdash;caravans are not included in the Bill&mdash;or whether anything is or is not his own piece of property.  The inconsistency of the Bill is continuously shown up and the Minister should have the good sense to appreciate the anomalies which are likely to develop.  I have in mind the kind of situation currently under the law.  I was recently involved in a case in Shankill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has stated that section 6 does not confer any right on an owner that he does not already enjoy.  I accept that but it does encourage him to take the law in his own hands.  It encourages him to engage in a breach of the peace. <Col N="981" /> It encourages him also to become involved in a fracas and that should be avoided.  If I may refer again to the definition of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; I would like to have a long discussion with the Minister on this because I believe that &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; does not cover &ldquo;caravan&rdquo;. As a principle of interpretation, once &ldquo;caravan&rdquo; is excluded from a definition of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo;&mdash;it is much more like a vehicle than it is a house&mdash;it would not be read by the Supreme Court into the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo;. The Minister will find that it is one of the rules of interpretation that if one sets out to define something and then excludes something from the definition, it will be excluded from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that serious breaches of the peace will occur if this section goes through as it is.  The Minister may say that the section does not give to the property owner any right of entry that he has not got already but the fact still remains that the circumstances that will surround the right of entry and the circumstances in which the entry will now be made will be far different from what they have been up to now and that it will be very difficult to maintain law and order when circumstances which, according to the Minister this Bill is aimed at rectifying, occur.  Unfortunately the steps taken in this section without the amendment as proposed by Deputy Cooney will give rise to many and serious breaches of the peace.  It will not be necessary for even a member of the Garda Síochána to be present while this type of evictions is taking place.  How, then, does one determine what is reasonable or what is a reasonable degree of force to eject people from property?  It would be merely one word against another.  In those circumstances one could not define what would be a reasonable degree of force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of this stems from the Minister's insistence on retaining in the section the words that Deputy Cooney wishes to have deleted.  In the case of a dispute in relation to property, if it is an offence for a person to enter a building forcibly, it should be an offence also for anyone other than a member of the Garda Síochána to enter property either <Col N="982" /> legally or in the belief that he has a <i>bona fide</i> right to enter it.  The Minister would not need to have any great imagination to realise the circumstances that will arise when this section becomes operative and when the procedure as outlined in section 6, without the necessity for the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána, has gone through the House.</P>

      <P>The strongest argument in favour of refusing to accept this amendment was made by Deputy Desmond who said that the gardaí should be involved to the least possible extent in matters of this kind.  As Minister for Justice that is also my view. At the moment an owner of property is entitled to put out an illegal occupant. Frankly, I do not wish that such activity would be forced on the gardaí to any greater extent than is avoidable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In those circumstances, until we hear from the Minister that he is prepared to accept that, we must be very suspicious of a provision which does not have such a word and which, in the absence of that word, does not shift the onus of proof adequately to the owner, that puts him in the position where he could inflict damage with a view to recovering damages from the people occupying the property.  The Minister must remember how these things operate.  The owner does not turn up himself in his little motor car, knock on the door and go in.  We know what happens.  He employs an agency to recruit any group of unemployed people they can get hold of and who are as tough as they can get, to come <Col N="985" /> and break down the place, throw the people out, beat them up in the street and do as much damage as they can. This is what happens, as I saw it with my own eyes in Hume Street.  It is no good the Minister raising his eyebrows. He was not there.  I was there a short time afterwards and saw the damage that was done and saw the way they behaved.</P>
      <P>This is the actual situation we meet, and having that evidence of how owners behave in certain circumstances we must be very suspicious of any provision which would put them in a position to extort damages from people occupying their property by doing more damage to it than is necessary to get them out.  Unless the Minister is prepared to accept the word &ldquo;unavoidably&rdquo; we must be extremely suspicious of the section.  I agree we do not particularly want to press the police to take the onus, but if we are to have this section at all the owner certainly should not be given that temptation, and if the section is to remain at all it should only remain with the provision in respect of the police who have no interest in doing damage.</P>

      <P>A particular case comes to mind where an old dilapidated lodge was occupied by squatters. They put in windows and a new door because there was no door or windows in the premises.  Would it be a good defence in such a prosecution for the defendant to say that the landlord would not be at a loss as a result of damage to the door or windows?  In this case I have in mind, if the landlord or the owner or anyone on his behalf were to proceed in accordance with this section, he could do damage to the doors and windows and have protection under this section.  In addition to that they could then go to court and claim compensation for such damage.  What provision is there here to protect occupiers in such a situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to understand this a bit more.  As I understand subsection (1), lines 10 to 15, the court can decide to impose these damages on the defendant.  There is <Col N="986" /> nothing to say that evidence has to be given at all on the subject of whether the damage was reasonably caused or not.  The court may infer that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It has, because the question arises whether this section with this phrase about the owner in it does or does not carry with it the risk that the owner could use it to extort damages from the people who occupied his property.  Either this is the case or it is not.  If it is not, then the amendment would appear to be unnecessary. If we are to decide whether to adopt the amendment or not we must be clear on how this would operate.  Supposing a case comes up and somebody is prosecuted under this Bill as an Act, and no evidence is given on the question of the damage, is the court, as I understand it from subsection (1), entitled to infer that the damage was caused and reasonably caused without the issue having been brought up in court and without the defendant having had the opportunity to answer?  Is the wording of it such that the onus is placed on somebody to assert that the damage was reasonably caused?  Secondly, am I not right in saying that once the assertion is made that the damage was reasonably caused, the onus of proof is then shifted to the defendant to disprove that, and unless he succeeds in disproving it to the satisfaction of the court, the court would or could accept the assertion of the prosecution in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that Deputy FitzGerald is wrong and that the answer in both cases is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The court cannot infer damage or cannot assume damage and then take it into account.  The clearest evidence would have to be given on the amount, and the reasonableness of it would have to be proved, and the onus to disprove reasonableness is not on the defendant. It is a matter for the prosecution to prove it.  Even if it is proved the courts still do not have to act on it.  If they see fit they need not.</P>

It may very well be that is a grossly exaggerated figure, but the accused person and his advisers are not in a strong position to quarrel with this man who has been wronged and whose property has been damaged.  They usually sit quiet and adopt the line of least resistance, hoping they will get away without a prison sentence if they do not question the damages.  That kind of atmosphere very often arises at the stage I am talking about.  This is a dangerous type of provision.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact, too, that this question of damages will only be consequential?  What will be before the court is a prosecution by a Garda for a substantive offence, and the court will not initially be considering damage.  It is only when it comes to imposing penalty that the question of damage will arise.  The court then will have to address its mind back to the evidence, after the hearing, on the question of whether it was reasonable or not.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick points out, and as I can confirm from my own experience, it would be a very rash line of cross-examination on the part of the defendant to start tackling the owner as to whether he should have taken <Col N="988" /> more care coming in to put the defendant out of his property.</P>

      <P>The point that has been raised in the last few minutes has really nothing to do with the amendments, that I can see, but I think Deputies should have more confidence in the ability of the courts to do justice. A district justice sitting there and seeing the whole thing will not let somebody get away with some outrageously high claim to which he is not entitled.  It is a matter of practice. They will not do it.  Very frequently one sees claims made in respect of malicious damage and so on that are a good deal higher than what the actual figure is.  The justice will not allow this.  One sees it even in the claiming of expenses by witnesses.  The justice will see that only the right figure is allowed.  The courts will see that justice is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point.  It is not suggested that the owner will exaggerate the value of the damage done.  He may do so.  That is a separate issue.  The suggestion is a different one.  The owner may, in fact, do a certain amount of damage more than is necessary.  The case is heard and this issue does not come up in the hearing of the case at all.  The defendant is then convicted. The question then arises as to what damage was done to be taken into account for the purpose of the penalty. The owner asserts that a certain amount of damage was done and the figure may be absolutely correct.  He may produce a builder's certificate for the cost of repairing it.  At that stage you then shift the onus of proof to the defendant because he then has to show that the damage was unreasonably caused because it is inconceivable that at that stage and in practice it will not happen, that the owner will get up and start calling witnesses on the question of the penalty to show that the method of effecting entry to the building was <Col N="989" /> the only possible way, that he went in by the smallest window and caused the least damage.  It is inconceivable that at that stage this evidence will be called. The owner will assert that the damage was caused and there will be a presumption that it was reasonable unless that is rebutted.  You then shift the onus of proof to the defendant.  It is because of that, that I think the amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>We cannot decide whether the amendments is necessary or not unless we are clear as to whether there is or is not a danger that the owner could be tempted to do more damage than is necessary because he would get away with this as a means of penalising the person concerned, either through the action of the court in imposing a penalty or by suing on a contract debt basis.  It is because I require that clarification before deciding on the amendment that I am pressing the Minister on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position under the section is that the owner must satisfy the court that the damage done to his property was reasonably caused. If he does something more than that, something that is unreasonable, he does not recover.  That is that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way?  The defendant is convicted.  The court is considering the penalty.  The owner is then called to say what the damage was or the solicitor is called. He says: &ldquo;£100 worth of damage reasonably caused&rdquo;.  He sits down.  Is it seriously suggested that the district justice will then ask him to stand up again and describe the damage in detail and to call witnesses to show that it was reasonably caused?  I do not believe that for a moment.  I believe once it is asserted that the damage was reasonably caused to conform with the Act that then unless it is challenged by the defendant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the words are inserted the section would read &ldquo;that where damage to property is reasonably and unavoidably caused by the owner or member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo; This is a novel section and it is importing an extra penalty on an offender and as it does contain within itself the temptation to the owner or member of the Garda to be careless in his conduct in clearing the property it is only right and in the interests of justice that it would be clearly seen by the court that the damage was unavoidably caused.  I do not think it is imposing any hardship or putting an undue onus on any of the parties in the proceedings to insert these words.  The debate on the earlier amendments covered most of the points that will arise in this connection.</P>

      <P>I have not got any very strong feelings one way or another about this amendment but I do foresee a difficulty if I accept it and that is that the case may well be made that if an owner, or the gardaí break down a door, which would be the normal method of entry, it could be put up against them that they could have, for example, got in by the skylight and that it cost £20 or £30 to fix the door and the skylight could have been fixed for £1 or £2.  There is that problem as I see it.</P>

      <P>That is what I am worried about, as to whether or not it would be &ldquo;unreasonably&rdquo;.  A defendant could, in spite of the fact that Deputy FitzGerald thinks that defendants will never open their mouths once they are convicted, get up and say &ldquo;Oh well, there was a skylight and there was only a pane of glass that size which would have cost £1 and you could have come in through that.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Each case will have to stand by itself in the court at the time. It will have to be left to the court to interpret &ldquo;reasonably and unavoidably&rdquo; in the light of the circumstances of the particular case.  However, I would like the section to make clear to the court in coming to its interpretation that there is no temptation beforehand for the people effecting entry to be unreasonable or to do something avoidable. If they are reasonable and the thing is clearly unavoidable they will not be prejudicing the conviction.  I would just like the onus to be there to make sure that there is absolute fairness on both sides.</P>

      <P>I could understand the Minister's reluctance if because the defendant asserted that it was unavoidable and because there was an element of truth in this he could not then be convicted and he could get off on a technical point, but we are talking about the size of the penalty and we should be concerned to ensure that no penalty is inflicted because damage is caused that need not have been caused. Even if there may be occasions when the skylight argument is put forward and stands up, the worst that would happen would be that in those circumstances because the gardaí chose the easier way out, causing more damage, the scale of penalty inflicted is not increased. That does not seem to be a very great loss to anybody.  The defendant should be protected and not be in the position where he can have imposed on him a larger penalty simply because the gardaí and the owner chose an easier solution than the one that would have caused least damage.  If it were a question of prejudicing the conviction then I could understand the Minister's concern but that is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 5, before &ldquo;entering&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of the three amendments is to make it clear that the provisions of section 6 shall apply only in relation to damage to property reasonably caused by an owner, or a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform, who lawfully enters, or attempts to enter, the property with a view to retaking possession of it from a person who has committed an offence under section 2 or section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> Section 6 is designed to apply to the type of case where it becomes necessary for an owner or a member of the Garda Síochána to use force to eject protest groups or squatters and in the process he causes damage to property. Since damage reasonably caused in such circumstances will be attributable directly to the refusal of the illegal occupiers to get out when asked to do so, section 6 provides that the court in coming to a decision as to the penalty appropriate to the offence may take account of the damage done as if it were damage caused by the defendant. It may also take into consideration whether the defendant has compensated the owner for damage.  The section also provides that the owner may recover the amount of the damage as a simple contract debt in civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that before the provisions of the section can come into play three things must have happened. First, an offence under section 2 or 3 must have been committed by the person who is squatting.  Secondly, the person must have been asked to leave by the owner or a member of the Garda Síochána in uniform.  Thirdly, damage to the property must have been reasonably caused by the owner or garda in entering, or seeking to retake possession, or in ejecting the squatters.</P>
    <P>Because the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is widely defined in section 1, some Deputies may be under the impression that the section confers on, for example, a ground landlord power of entry which he does not have at the present time and that the section entitles such a person to recover from the squatter damages caused by an entry, or attempted entry, which but for the Bill he would not have any right to make in the first place.  I am satisfied this is not a correct interpretation of the section but, in order to put the matter beyond all doubt, I am moving these amendments to paragraph (b), the effect of which will be to limit the operation of the section to cases where the entry, or retaking of possession, or ejection of the squatter is lawful in the first place.  Amendment No. 8 also had a bearing on this matter inasmuch as it makes clear that <Col N="999" /> nothing in this Bill confers on any person any right of entry which does not exist immediately before the Bill comes into operation.</P>

      <P>Nothing in this Act shall apply to an entry or an occupation of land or a vehicle in the exercise of lawful authority or with the permission of the owner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Proviso (i) of paragraph (b) provides for a situation where a court, in coming to a decision as to the penalty, and having heard evidence as to how the offence was committed and how the people were cleared from the house, if there was a question of an offence under section 3, will take into account whether the defendant at that stage has compensated the owner in respect of any damage caused in clearing the premises.  If the court finds he has not paid any compensation to the owner, bearing in mind that the owner is as defined in section 1, one presumes that the intention then is that it will be open to the court to impose a severe penalty.  Possibly it may impose imprisonment where it would have merely imposed a fine had compensation been paid.  The penalty section provides for a substantial penalty in the case of second and subsequent offences and a very heavy penalty in the case of a conviction before a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> If such a case arises and the court measures its dissatisfaction with the defendant's failure to pay compensation by imposing a heavy penalty, there is nothing subsequently to prevent the injured owner suing the defendant for damages by way of simple contract debt.  In effect, an injustice could be done because the failure to pay compensation will have been dealt with already by the court in imposition of penalty, presumably by imposing a heavy penalty.  Yet, the defendant having paid that penalty could find himself open to an action for damages.</P>
    <P>Provisos (i) and (ii) show the essential difficulty which this piece of legislation contains, namely, that the borderline between civil and criminal law is being criss-crossed.  The Bill sets out to create new criminal offences and to provide for them in the normal way by fine or imprisonment, or both, and then it goes on to compensate the owner for what is essential damage to his property by an act of trespass. Again we are back into the realm of the civil law.  This section is not good in that the second proviso, providing for an action for damages, should be left out of it because this is a criminal Bill and a criminal Bill only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to explain why we in the Labour Party will oppose this section.  Once more, let me emphasise that, in opposing the section, we are not thereby supporting all forms of squatting and all forms of forcible entry.  What we are saying is that the civil law is adequate&mdash;it may be a bit slow&mdash;to deal with these problems. These provisions make no distinction between the different forms of squatting, all of which are not unjustifiable. This section, like the preceding sections, continues the trend of making the strong stronger and the weak weaker.  As the law stands, the squatter, after certain legal process, is ejected from the place in which he is squatting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Government propose to make all types of squatting criminal offences.  Even the most justifiable squatting will be a criminal offence.  An unfortunate man with a wife and family may find himself a defendant in <Col N="1002" /> legal proceedings and subject to heavy penalties and to the payment of compensation. Still further penalties are provided in a later section.  There is no obligation of any kind placed on the owner.</P>
    <P>He is given wide powers of action. He will be in a strong position to justify to the court any action he takes. The unfortunate defendant, with his wife and children on the side of the road, will not be capable of taking hold of whatever legal straws are held out to him.  These sections, as I say, make the weak weaker and the strong stronger.  There is no obligation on the strong.  The weak are placed on the defensive all the time.  We must oppose this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooney made an interesting point.  I cannot answer the Deputy offhand, but he will recall that there are a number of provisions in our criminal or summary law where, when a fine is imposed by the court, the court has power to award all or part of it to an injured party.  That is not specially stated in this Bill and I am not clear as to whether or not it is an inherent power. I will have to look into that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the damage were taken into account and a correspondingly increased penalty were imposed because of non-compensation, it would certainly on the face of it be unjust to allow a right of action even though in practice that right of civil action would rarely be rewarded because it is fruitless to pursue these people.  On the face of it it would appear to be unjust <Col N="1003" /> Deputy Cooney has a point but, before I can answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; one way or the other, I will have to inquire whether that power is there.  I will inquire and we can sort it out on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister has met this in a reasonable way.  The section provides that:</P>
      <P>the court, in coming to a decision as to the penalty, may take the damage to property into account as if that damage had been caused by the defendant and may have regard to whether or not the defendant has compensated the owner in respect of that damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is quite right to look into this.  There is no power there, unless it is inherent in the criminal code, and I do not think it is.  I do not think there is any power providing that damages be paid by the offending party to the aggrieved party.  But it is obviously an invitation to the court to impose a stiffer penalty if compensation has not been paid than it would if compensation had been paid.  As Deputy Cooney pointed out, the next proviso confers on the owner the right to take civil <Col N="1004" /> action and recover damages.  This certainly needs looking into.  It is a pity the Minister did not see fit to accept Deputy Cooney's previous amendment which sought to confer only on a member of the Garda Síochána the right to use physical force either to get into the property or to get the offenders out. I hope I made the case pretty clearly on that amendment.  I invite the Minister to consider this again&mdash;on occasion he has been reasonable; on occasion he has been unreasonable&mdash; between now and the Report Stage.  If he does he will, I believe, see the force of the arguments put forward.  Really what we are doing here is inviting the owner to take the law into his own hands.  To take the law into one's own hands in an explosive situation, when tempers are high and reason cannot be expected to prevail, creates a very dangerous atmosphere.  More harm could be done by encouraging the owner to take the law into his own hands.  I agree with the Minister this does not confer any civil rights on the owner.</P>
