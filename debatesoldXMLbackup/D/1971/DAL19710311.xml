    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the question of civil rights for civil servants.  It is fair to say in regard to the employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that many of them do not hold what could even remotely be described as policy making functions in the Department.  They are restricted as to the exercise of their political rights.  On reflection, this must be seen to be quite intolerable.  I should like to quote the relevant rule which applies to officers of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is staff rule No. 9 in the Staff Rules published in 1961 for the government of the Department.  The rule says:</P>
      <P>An officer is eligible to be placed on the Register of Dáil Éireann Electors and to vote at Dáil Éireann Elections.  Nevertheless the nature and conditions of Post Office employment render it essential that an officer should maintain a reserve in political matters, that he should not put himself forward on the side of any political party and that he should be careful to do nothing that would give colour to any suggestion that his official actions are in any way influenced, or capable of being influenced by party motives.</P>
      <P>It is important to consider how the position of a postman or a postmaster could be interpreted as being endangered by having some connection with politics.  It is hard to argue that a person in such a position could be jeopardising his effectiveness in his job by having some connection with politics.  The rule goes on:</P>
      <P>The following directions are for general guidance :&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) An officer shall not act as a Personation Agent at the elections, <Col N="853" /> nor may any full-time officer act as a Polling Clerk.  A full-time officer may, however, be given leave to act as a Presiding Officer or Counting Clerk where the requirements of the Service permit and no additional expense to the Department is entailed.  Subject to the same conditions a part-time officer may be given permission to act as Presiding Officer or Polling Clerk.</P>
    <P>(ii) An officer shall not be a member of an association or committee for promoting the interests of a political party or for promoting or preventing the return of a candidate to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>To my mind, postmasters and postmen have the same political opinions as other people.  It seems wrong that they should not be able to participate in politics and support particular candidates. I can understand that the officials of the Department who attend the Dáil to advise the Minister should not take part in politics.  I can understand that there should be a restriction on their participation in politics. Obviously, they are engaged in politics in another sense in advising the Minister. To have them engaged in supporting my party against the Minister's interests would be an intolerable strain on the relationship which must exist between the Minister and his policy-making assistants.  It cannot be argued that the same relationship exists between the Minister and a postman down the country.  The same criteria cannot be applied.  There is no reason why a postman down the country should not be in a position to participate in politics.  Local government officials who, in many cases, are in a stronger position to affect the community than the postman are allowed to participate in politics.  Why should a postman and postal officials be restricted in this way?  I can see very little justification for it at all.</P>
    <P>Staff Rule, Part (iii) says:</P>
    <P>(iii) An officer shall not support or oppose a candidate or party by public speaking or writing.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to that. <Col N="854" /> Part (iv) which is probably the most noxious of all reads:</P>
    <P>An officer shall not make any statement in public (or which is liable to be published),</P>
    <P>It might be published without his having any knowledge of it.  Someone could attend a parents' meeting and find afterwards that his remarks were reported in the paper.  I know this happened in County Cork.  Such person would then be liable to disciplinary action simply because he was exercising his rights as a parent and commenting on, perhaps, the school bus service. He could be got at under this rule as making a statement which was likely to be published.  The rule goes on:</P>
    <P>and shall not contribute to a newspaper or other publication any letter or article conveying information, comment or criticism on any matter of current political interest, or which concerns the political action or position of the Government, or of any Member or group of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In other words, he could not comment on his own conditions of employment, in view of the reference to the question of the political action or position of the Government, because his conditions of employment are laid down by the Government.  As a member of a parents' association he could not comment on the matter of school buses or conditions in schools.  Not only is he prohibited from making a statement which he knows will be published but any statement which may without his consent be published.  This is gross invasion of the very basic rights of any member of a democratic community.</P>
    <P>Part (v) says that a postman or other officer, when in uniform, shall not take part in any demonstration of a party or political character.  That is quite acceptable; when in uniform he should not be in a position to engage in politics.  That and No. 1 are probably the only rules that I would accept.  I think the others are all wrong.  &ldquo;The foregoing directions apply to the action of an officer whether taken alone or in association with others. Any departure from official impartiality <Col N="855" /> will be followed by disciplinary action.&rdquo;  And it has been, I think, in many cases.  I remember asking the Minister previously in the Dáil what he was going to do about this and he said he was looking into it.  This was eight or nine months ago, perhaps more.  He showed evidence of great concern about the subject.  I hope that something concrete has been done in the interim and I should like the Minister when replying to tell us what exactly he has done since I put down that question.  He gave the impression that he was going to do something right away.  So far as I know, which may not be saying very much, nothing has happened.  Something must be done very quickly to remove these grave restrictions on civil rights.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the degree of automation of telephones.  In reply to a question which I put down to the Minister some days ago he told me that telephones are 83.2 per cent automatic. At present our main competitor in attracting industry is Northern Ireland or certainly Britain, if we feel we are not competing with Northern Ireland because we are part of the one country, and to my mind a country that has an automatic telephone service commends itself to business people.  An industrialist likes to set up in a country where he can dial a number and get it quickly instead of losing time waiting while one exchange gets in touch with another, and so on.  The existence of an automatic telephone service is very important.  As I said, 83.2 per cent of our telephones are automatic.  In Northern Ireland the service is 100 per cent automatic; in Britain it is 98.4 per cent automatic and in all but one of our prospective EEC partners the phones are 100 per cent automatic. That means that telephones even in the most remote parts are automatic in all these countries.  This does not apply to France where things are worse than in our case but we should not set our standards by the worst country in EEC.</P>
    <P>A more serious matter is the extent of the area covered by automatic telephones. In this country it is only one-third, and two-thirds of the area still <Col N="856" /> has the ordinary exchange system.  Anybody looking through the country section of the telephone directory will see that the areas that do not have automatic telephones are the least developed areas which are most in need of industry.  In my own constituency, generally speaking, the western part, the area most in need of industry, has not an automatic system while the area around Dublin where employment is relatively good, has the automatic system.</P>
    <P>Existence of an automatic telephone system is a factor influencing the siting of industry.  When an industrialist has established a business, and somebody comes to him asking if it is a good place to site an industry, if he has experienced a good telephone service, it is the sort of thing that will make him advise an associate to come there to establish a factory.  The telephone service is something that affects people. If it is bad or inadequate it annoys them.  The service needs to be good if people are to get a good impression of the country and be predisposed in its favour apart from strictly balance sheet considerations.  It is very serious that we are so far behind most of our prospective partners in the EEC in this matter.  There is only one country out of a total of eight&mdash;I have not details about Denmark and Norway&mdash;worse than we are in regard to the automation of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Even where we have an automatic telephone service it is subject to very frequent breakdowns.  I suppose no Deputy can produce hard facts and figures for this sort of thing.  We all rely on the personal experience of lifting the telephone, not getting the dial tone but hearing a squawk or some kind of &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; tone.  We know this happens repeatedly but we cannot document our case in a compelling fashion.  Everybody has had the experience. I have not travelled perhaps sufficiently to have a great deal of comparative experience but I was in the US last summer and I had occasion to use the telephone service.  There was never a breakdown.  At a minimal cost, something like a dollar, I was able from San Francisco to ring New York with no trouble and in a matter of minutes. <Col N="857" /> If one were to try to ring from Dublin an area in Ireland that is without an automatic service one would not get through as quickly.  There have been very serious complaints in one area in my constituency, the Navan-Trim area, with the 046 prefix.  There are two matters here to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and the House.  I wish to draw the Minister's attention to two questions I asked in the House.  At column 1410, volume 249 of the Official Report of 12th November, 1970, I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs this question, No. 136:</P>
    <P>If he is aware of widespread discontent with the telephone service in Navan and Trim exchange areas, County Meath; and if he will take remedial action urgently.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>A number of complaints have been received about the telephone service at An Uaimh exchange.  Owing to rapid growth in call traffic the switching equipment which serves An Uaimh and Trim automatic exchanges is inadequate during busy periods.  Relief measures are already in hand.  These include the installation of additional equipment which is at present in progress and which will improve the service within a few weeks.</P>
    <P>The nub of the reply was that the problem was due to the inadequate supply of switching equipment.  In question No. 86 of 11th February I asked the Minister at column 1267, volume 251 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>If there is an optimum ratio between the number of units of switching equipment in an exchange and the number of telephones connected to that exchange; and the extent to which each automatic exchange in the State falls below this optimum ratio.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was that there was no optimum ratio between the units of switching equipment in an exchange and the number of telephones connected to that exchange.  If that is the case how is the Minister able to tell me in the first case that the problem is due to the inadequate amount of switching <Col N="858" /> equipment?  What way had he of knowing that that was the problem if there is not an optimum ratio between the amount of switching equipment and the number of phones?  Surely there should be such an optimum ratio and if there is not he should try to devise one so that the Minister will have some way of measuring between one exchange and another whether the switching equipment is adequate and so that Members of this House will, from replies to Parliamentary questions, be able to find out how the Minister is progressing towards such an optimum ratio.</P>
    <P>This is something which is very elementary.  I understand there is such an optimum ratio.  It is a one-to-one ratio: there should be one unit of switching equipment per phone.  I may be entirely off the beam here but that is what I have been told.  If that is the case it should be immediately obvious when an exchange is becoming overloaded by simply totting up the number of units of switching equipment and totting up the number of phones. If we had such a method we would be able to know immediately whether or not the phone service was likely to go wrong and we would be able to take remedial action immediately, instead of having an outcry building up, as is happening in the Navan and Trim areas, among business people and ordinary individuals about the totally inadequate phone service.  I do not live in that exchange area myself but on the few occasions I have used the phone there I found great difficulty in getting a proper service and I am sure this is the case all over the place.</P>
    <P>It is possible that not enough money is being spent on the maintenance of phones, but the Minister may be taking a political decision, if you like, to allow more rapid installation of phones than he has financed for the equipment at the exchanges; that in order to satisfy local representatives and, I am sure, to satisfy myself, too, when I make representations, he is allowing phones to be installed at a faster rate than the finance can be provided for the equipment to ensure an adequate phone service.</P>
    <Col N="859" />
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley </NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy tell us where he is doing that?  It would be a great help to some of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton </NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where he is doing that but I am just judging from the evidence.  If that is the case, either we should take a decision to spend more on maintenance and more on equipment in the exchanges or else decide not to have quite the same rate of installations of new phones.  The telephone is an essential service and I would favour the expenditure of more money on the installation of equipment. We should not be trying to get a telephone service on the cheap if that is what is going on.  Obviously I have no way of knowing whether this is the case, but it is a suggestion that has been made to me by somebody who possibly knows more about it than I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem I have experienced in relation to the phone service is lifting the phone and hearing somebody else's conversation.  This happens very often.  It has happened on a number of occasions in reverse, too.  On two occasions the people concerned were kind enough to tell me they had lifted up the phone and heard me having discussions which they thought they should not have heard with people with whom I had dealings.  This sort of thing should not occur.  On the two occasions in question I reported the matter to the Department.  On one occasion they told me it was due to the crossing of lines which was an accident and so forth.  I wonder is there any way of being proof against such accidents.  On the second occasion on which I reported I received no explanation as to how it happened.  The man to whom I spoke did not seem to think it was due to the crossing of lines, although I may be misinterpreting him, but that it may have been simply inadequate maintenance of the equipment. I hope the Minister will take steps to ensure this does not happen. Possibly I would not have raised it at all but that it happened to me twice and that it brought the importance of it home to me with greater force than it might otherwise have done.  The idea that you could be having a confidential conversation with somebody on the <Col N="860" /> phone and that somebody else could be listening in is very serious.</P>
    <P>In relation to the postal services between Ireland and Britain and between Ireland and Northern Ireland industry is put at a disadvantage because our postal charges are higher.  In Ireland it is 4p for an ordinary letter. Northern Ireland and Great Britain which could be regarded as our immediate competitors in attracting industry within EEC conditions have a lower cost postal service than ours. While this point may be relatively small, nonetheless, it would act as a disincentive to people in setting up industries here, particularly those who would be relying to a large extent on the postal service.</P>
    <P>I have not read the Minister's speech in any great detail but I notice that he made a case for the increases on the grounds of cost.  I do not know how he could do this.  Is the postal service taken as a separate service from every other service?  If the postal service is not showing a profit, are the costs increased accordingly or could the profit from some other service, say, the telephone service, or whatever service might be profitable, be transferred to subsidise the postal service? In other words, are they accounted separately?  Of course, there may not be available any extra revenue but in the light of the criticisms I have made of the telephone service, any such extra revenue would be well spent in improving that service.  It is my opinion that the postal service should not be regarded as an economic service which should be profitable.  The service is a basic means of communication and it is particularly important to people living in remote areas.  Every effort should be made to prevent increased charges for this service.  The recent increases were excessive especially when one considers that the Government were trying to restrict increases in incomes to 7 per cent.  In the light of that restriction, an increase of 50 per cent on a basic service could hardly be justified.  This should not happen.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister intends abolishing Saturday postal delivery in the rural areas as he has <Col N="861" /> done in the city.  One suggestion I would make in this regard is that all Government Departments should set the headline of endeavouring to send out as much mail as possible by Thursday so that it will be delivered in time to allow people to deal with it over the weekend.  Of course, if there should be a choice between posting on Friday and posting on Monday, it should be done on the Friday.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which I am interested is the boosting of RTE, BBC and UTV stations.  I know that Deputy Crowley is interested in this matter also and I was inspired partly by a question he had down in relation to grants.  This question was rather narrow in its application and I put down a wider question on 25th February.  I quote from column 2237 of the Dáil Depates for that day:</P>
    <P>Mr. Bruton asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will consider an arrangement whereby UTV and BBC (Northern Ireland) broadcasts are boosted throughout the State in return for the boosting of RTE broadcasts throughout Northern Ireland, as a means of promoting the understanding the Government seek between people on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>In order to boost or relay UTV and BBC (Northern Ireland) broadcasts to give satisfactory reception throughout the State, we would need to establish at least two additional television transmission networks here, three if we were to relay both BBC 1 and BBC 2.  To ensure satisfactory reception of RTE television programmes in Northern Ireland, an additional television transmission network would be required there also.  On cost and other considerations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Note that the Minister said &ldquo;and other considerations&rdquo;, and not cost only.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>we could not seriously propose such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>First of all, I should like to know what are the other considerations?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton </NameTxt>
      <P>I have the interests of the people of West Cork at heart.  To my mind the main argument put forward by the Minister against this was the cost that would be involved in installing the transmitters which, in reply to a supplementary question, he said would be in the region of several million pounds.  The second item was the cost that would arise from the loss of advertising revenue to RTE by reason of the fact that UTV would be advertising all over the west and south of Ireland.  While both these considerations are important and might lead to a delay in bringing about this boosting, they are not so prohibitive as to lead to the rejection of this on principle.  The reunification of this country is a major national aim but we will only achieve this aim if there is a high level of understanding and sympathy between the ordinary people on both sides of the Border.  In order to promote such understanding, people must know how each other live, they must see each other not as standard political types but as ordinary people.  Television is the great medium which can be effective in this regard.  It is through television that people will come to realise that those whom they have been taught to hate are not so bad at all.  On that basis alone the expenditure of the several million pounds referred to by the Minister would be well spent.  If, in return for boosting their station, we could receive an agreement from the Northern Ireland authorities to have our station boosted there, we would have achieved a great deal.  Because there are not very many ways available to us in which we can promote understanding, we cannot afford to throw away lightly <Col N="863" /> the opportunity which television affords in this regard.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there is a less lofty argument apart from this and that is that a better service will be provided and that there will be a wider choice of programmes. That is important, too.  Those of us who live in the eastern part of the country are perhaps among the luckiest people in the world in regard to television viewing in that we have a choice of three channels, each of which is very good.  I watched television in America and I can say that the programmes produced by RTE and BBC are much better than the ones I saw there.  It is highly desirable that we achieve a situation whereby people in all parts of the country would have a choice of three channels.  This would put us ahead of the rest of the world. The expenditure of several million pounds on this would be well justified. Everyone is interested in television.  It is not a service for the wealthy now as it was when it started.  Almost everybody has a television set now.  This expenditure would be socially desirable. I hope the Minister will consider this very carefully.</P>
      <P>During the earlier part of the debate there was quite an amount of criticism by Deputies of television programmes. I do not watch very much television and I will not criticise RTE.  We would have a very bad station if the criticisms of Dáil Deputies were to be the criteria of what was put on television. If you were to try to satisfy all the Members of the House, you would never put out a programme at all.  I hope there will not be this gross overreaction to criticism on the part of television personalities.  It would be better if we did not criticise television too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer again to rural telephone kiosks.  You cannot get a telephone kiosk in a rural area unless there is a post office in the area and unless the telephone is used to a certain extent laid down by the Department.  I believe the criteria are unduly rigid. There are many places on busy and dangerous roads where there should be a kiosk but it will not be provided because there is no post office there. There are also many places which are <Col N="864" /> very remote and cut off from the rest of the community.  They should be considered on the grounds of remoteness and on the grounds of having to rely on telecommunications to a greater extent than other areas.  It appears to me to be wrong that an area which has a post office and which has the benefit of a means of communication, is the only area considered in relation to the provision of a telephone kiosk.  Surely the reverse would be more appropriate? Surely places which have not got a post office should get preference over places which have got a post office?</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that user of the post office telephone is an inadequate criterion when it comes to the provision of a kiosk.  Generally speaking, the post office is open during working hours only.  It might be necessary to make telephone calls at night and that need would never be indicated in the user of the post office telephone.  It is also possible that if there are many shops and licensed premises in the area with coin box phones and, as in my own constituency, these are more central and more convenient than the post office, people use them during the day time and those calls do not show up in the user of the post office telephone.  It is very important to have a public kiosk available during the night time when the other premises are closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the post office telephone is available for 24 hours of the day, but the local people do not like to knock up the family who are living in the post office at 1 o'clock in the morning unless it is absolutely essential for them to use the telephone.  Therefore, the user of the post office telephone is not a realistic guide.  I can see the justification for it in that it lets the civil servants off the hook.  They do not have to make value judgments.  They have this rigid formula which they can use, almost without thinking.  It is a kind of mathematical formula.  If the use made of the post office telephone goes beyond a certain level, automatically a kiosk is provided.  They do not have to make any local investigation.  They do not have to make any inquiry into the real need for a kiosk.  They have this ready-made <Col N="865" /> criterion which enables them to make a decision.</P>
    <P>This is not giving the best service. It is not giving the service we should be given.  The considerations I have mentioned should also be taken into account.  The nearness of an alternative telephone kiosk should be considered. I had a question down recently about Carbury in County Kildare.  Perhaps the use made of the post office telephone is not very great due to some of the factors I mentioned earlier but there is no kiosk within some considerable distance of Carbury.  That factor should be taken into consideration in deciding whether to provide a kiosk. Under the present regulations that cannot be done because of the rigid, ready-made criterion applied.  I hope that will be borne in mind and that the Minister and the Department will have the courage to revise this programme and bring in one which, although it might be more difficult to administer, would be more just.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley </NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to Deputy Bruton because he has voiced the feelings of many rural Deputies about telephone kiosks and about the quality of the telephone service generally.  Nevertheless it would be remiss of us not to say that there has been a tremendous improvement over the past couple of years in the rural areas, and we hope that improvement will continue.  The main concern of the people in the rural areas is to have access to a telephone in an emergency. By and large this need is being met, although there are isolated cases where the telephone service available is inadequate.</P>

    <P>We have had a very interesting debate so far on the issues that come under the aegis of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I have been pretty active in the past couple of weeks trying to elicit information from the Minister about various topics, especially about the installation of multi-channel television in areas which do not receive it at the moment.  I am fairly sure that the people who are not receiving multi-channel television would be prepared to pay more for the licence if it were possible for them to receive the variety of programmes <Col N="866" /> which the people in the east and in the north east seem to be able to receive at the moment.  However, I have already expressed my views on that matter pretty forcefully and I will not cover the same ground again today.</P>
    <P>Reference is needed from this side of the House to the tribunal which sat on the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; moneylending programme.  From listening to some of the Opposition Deputies one would imagine that all the people connected with the RTE programme on moneylending were sure nominations for canonisation.  They seemed to be under the impression that the tribunal completely vindicated their actions.  Maybe I have read the findings of the tribunal differently from my colleagues on the Opposition benches but is it not true that the tribunal found that while the programme claimed moneylending was widespread in all areas of the city and was expanding at such a rate that the number of unlicensed money lenders in the city was in the region of 500 this estimate was widely inaccurate?  The programme claimed that fears of threats violence and exposure were commonly used to secure payment, that serious physical violence is, in fact, inflicted on borrowers who fail to pay, that this violence is frequently inflicted by men employed by moneylenders for that purpose.  Is it not true to say that there was not one witness who knew or had even heard of serious physical violence being inflicted by moneylenders?  There was no evidence of anyone being employed by moneylenders to inflict violence and no evidence of a moneylending syndicate operating in the docks area.  The tribunal's findings were such that the conclusions to be drawn from them were that the programme was greatly exaggerated.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with that in a minute.  The Deputy had his opportunity to speak.  I can well appreciate how anxious the Deputy is to defend his friends in RTE.  It is the Deputy's prerogative in this House to defend those he thinks fit to defend and it is my prerogative to attack those I feel are worthy of attack.</P>

      <P>We know that Deputy Desmond is not reluctant to attack when he feels it necessary to attack. We would not deny him the right to attack verbally.  We know he does not enter into the physical violence arena as RTE claims moneylenders were doing.</P>
      <P>It is very important that what I say is not misconstrued.  I am not defending moneylenders, far from it.  I had a question down on the matter as far back as 1967.  I was one of the first Deputies in the House to draw attention to the fact that moneylending was going on and that it was a serious matter.  What I am objecting to is the presentation of the programme and the inaccuracies portrayed in it.  The theme highlighted in that &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme on moneylending was violence which was not at any stage substantiated by the witnesses before the tribunal.  The pervading atmosphere was an atmosphere of fear and violence.</P>
      <P>The tribunal also found that the self-confessed moneylenders and their associates, including the strong-arm men, appeared on the programme for the money they were getting and their statements were either wholly untrue or greatly exaggerated.  I do not think anybody can deny that.  They also found that some statements were telescoped and edited in such a way as to distort their meaning in order to fit in with the general picture the programme was trying to present, which was this tremendous fear of violence at all times.  The team must have known that this was not a fact when they were presenting the programme.</P>
      <P>One particular shot purporting to show moneylending transactions openly going on in Talbot Street was, in fact, staged in Montrose.  As far as I can remember this was defended by RTE as being permissible on the basis of being an illustrative shot.  Was this not far beyond anything that the team had actually witnessed or encountered in their investigations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusion drawn by the tribunal was that the number of moneylenders <Col N="868" /> far from being 500 was fewer than 50. Whether there are 500 or 50 moneylenders we all agree that moneylending is an evil, but in the presentation of a television programme it is very important to reflect as much as possible the actual scene as it is and to avoid, even for the sake of hyperbole, exaggeration or distortion.</P>

      <P>In replying to a question on the progamme on 26th November, 1969 the Minister for Justice said:</P>
      <P>To sum up what I have said,</P>
      <P>(1)  The allegation that strong-arm methods are being used by unlicensed moneylenders is, in the opinion of the Garda Síochána, without any foundation in fact.</P>
      <P>(2)  While the gardaí know that some unlicensed moneylenders operate, their number or scale of operations is nothing like that suggested by the programme.</P>
      <P>(3)  The statement purporting to be confessions by moneylenders about moneylending and strong-arm methods can be dismissed as wholly valueless.</P>

      <P>I suppose that is very likely, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Another item of special importance in the tribunal's findings was that because of the nature and the number of specific statements the programme as a whole conveyed the impression that, as a matter of fact, the Garda were lax in detecting illegal moneylending and prosecuting offenders.  This feeling could be said to permeate the whole programme and people would be forced to come to the conclusion that the Garda were not doing their job properly.  The tribunal found that this was an inaccurate conclusion.  They found that the impression created was not justified and that the gardai were doing their duty to the point that they were able to deny the allegations made about the extent and scope of illegal moneylending.  Their figures were found to be more accurate than the figures supplied by the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement by the RTE authority began by saying that it recognised that the tribunal's examination revealed certain defects in connection with the programme and that careful account would be taken of the criticisms of the tribunal.  This recognition falls far short of recognising what the report disclosed.  What the report revealed was not certain defects in the actual production but carelessness to the point of recklessness at some stages to present a programme about moneylending. I do not think anyone could have faulted the production because technically it probably was of the <Col N="870" /> highest order.  However, the content of the programme could not be put on the same basis.</P>
    <P>The RTE statement noted that the tribunal accepted that RTE's motives in making the programme were good and I think that we all subscribe to this.  However, when we consider the presentation of the programme I begin to disagree with the statement.  When it was decided to make the programme its format and contents were not known.  There is quite a difference between the actual programme that went out and the conception of the idea of the programme to which there could not be any objection.</P>
    <P>The RTE statement notes that the tribunal found that the programme was authentic in respect of the existence of illegal moneylending and that it was a problem of serious proportions in certain areas.  As the existence of illegal moneylending has never been denied, in my opinion the comment is in the nature of a smokescreen.  The same might be said about the figures regarding the high interest rates being charged&mdash;figures varying from 25 per cent to 100 per cent were quoted freely.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the conclusions of the Opposition who maintain that there was a threat of physical violence at all times and that there was fear of this violence.  There is no doubt that there was fear but it was fear of exposure rather than of physical violence.  I subscribe to the statement of the Taoiseach on 26th November that all this controversy could have been avoided had RTE stated at the outset that the characters and the theme of the programme were fictitious.  It is certain that a key scene supposed to be filmed in Talbot Street was filmed in Montrose.  The tribunal has also shown conclusively that not only the self-confessed strong-arm man, but two witnesses who were presented as living in fear of serious personal violence, were not, in fact, what they were presented to be.  If a person appears on a programme and if he is portrayed as being a strong-arm merchant, if his statements which are untrue are uttered in order to suit a particular programme, how can this person be described as other than a fictitious character?  As <Col N="871" /> far as I remember in this programme the man concerned kept his back to the camera and the question of fact or fiction arises only out of his claim as a strong-arm man, which has been shown to be fictitious.</P>
    <P>The RTE statement noted that the tribunal found that the participants in the programme were not paid to say what the producers or directors of the programme wanted them to say, nor were they supplied with drink to induce them to do so.  I do not think these charges were ever made and, therefore, there is no reason for this statement. The tribunal found that participants were paid for attendance and that most of them agreed to appear only because of the payment.  As far as I remember one of them said he would not have appeared otherwise.</P>
    <P>The report shows that at least some of them knew beforehand what kind of statement would get them a place on the programme.  The tribunal upheld fully the charge made by the Minister in the Dáil that no credibility can be placed on statements by people who appeared on the programme and who made the proper statements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <P>Obviously the Deputy has not read it.  In regard to the question of drink, the tribunal found that one key witness was under the influence of drink before he appeared on the programme and instead of rejecting this man as not being a proper person to put on television he was allowed to appear and was built up into a major character.  Before he went on the programme he was supplied with drink.</P>

      <P>It was conclusively proved by the report of the tribunal <Col N="872" /> that the whole question of physical violence was exaggerated.  In order to make the programme more sensational it was emphasised.  We would all applaud the motive and the reason behind presenting such a programme as this.  We all abhor the fact that there is this type of moneylending in the country and that it exists on such a scale.  It does not exist in the exaggerated form in which it was presented on RTE.  It can be said that the aims of the planners of this programme were probably laudable.  They fell down on presentation by not putting the facts before the public.  Later television programmes have been more balanced. More thorough research of the facts has been carried out before television presentation.  If the tribunal did nothing else but bring this standard to bear on our current affairs programme it has done a good job.  I see the necessity of having certain journalistic licence.  We all subscribe to that.  We must be careful where the line should be drawn. Any experienced journalist knows how far he can go.  The people involved in preparing the programme on moneylending went a bit further than they should have gone in exaggerating the theme because they were rather inexperienced.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister if it would be possible to have a regional television or radio station at Cork.  We all saw Deputy FitzGerald walking into Montrose without any prior consultation, sitting down and taking part in a programme.  Would this be allowed in the case of any Deputy in the Dáil? Can we all walk in and sit down and take part in a current affairs programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole format of that programme was decided on by somebody other than the people in RTE.  I would have thought that a programme like the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; would have researchers, producers and various other personnel to decide on its format and on the people to be televised, rather than leaving it to one person to recruit and instruct the people who were to appear.  In my opinion parts of the programme were <Col N="873" /> most disedifying.  Some good points were raised and because of them the programme was worth presenting.  It is very important to have current affairs programmes and that they should investigate social evils where they exist. It is vital that such investigation should protect the sanctity of the privacy of the individual.  In the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme on moneylending zooming cameras and hidden microphones were used.  It is disquieting.  I might be talking to someone in Kildare Street while someone 100 yards away was filming and recording the whole scene.  It is disquieting to feel that one's privacy could be invaded.  I do not think it will happen again after this programme but it is something we must guard against. Generally our TV personalities, in view of the fact that most of them went in as raw recruits completely inexperienced in television, have done a reasonably good job in RTE.  I have been infuriated on occasion by some of the programmes because of the unbalanced presentation but in the past couple of years balance has been achieved apart from occasional exceptions.  It is not surprising that there was a certain imbalance when we had Deputy Keating, Deputy Thornley and Deputy Dr. O'Brien in Telefís Éireann, now that we know definitely their political affiliations. It would be very remiss of me, however, to criticise Deputy Keating on that score because he did present excellent programmes for farmers. Nevertheless, it is rather significant that the principal political commentator became an elected member of the Labour Party.  However, that is in the past.  In the future observations should be objective at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the provision of a shortwave radio station.  The Minister has probably heard of this many times but in our position with so many emigrants abroad, with forces in two or three places in the world&mdash;and they could be in any other place with the United Nations&mdash;does the Minister not agree that it is time we did provide a shortwave radio station?  The power and scope of shortwave transmissions would prove an ideal means of communication between the fatherland and the people abroad.  There are many <Col N="874" /> Irish people anxious to hear all-Ireland finals and other broadcasts which would make their stay in other countries a little happier.  The Minister would be giving a good service to such people and, in our small way, we could perhaps contribute to a more balanced outlook in the world by propaganda by means of a shortwave station.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable talk of boosting RTE so that we can show people in the Six Counties how we live and that we are not as we are painted. There is an unanswerable argument for this and I hope the Minister will do everything possible to ensure that Six County people can receive our television programmes.  The Minister was asked recently in the Seanad if he would use his good offices to ensure greater use of the Radio Éireann light orchestra and symphony orchestra.  I endorse that.  The percentage of time we devote to serious music on television is out of proportion to the number of people interested in such programmes.</P>
    <P>As it would seem to be impossible to receive BBC and ITV in the Munster area would the Minister again consider the possibility of a second television channel?  By this means we could transmit what is best in BBC and ITV sports and cultural programmes and also have our own educational and cultural programmes.  We could have a &ldquo;university of the air&rdquo; which has been so successful in other countries.  There is a growing need for this.  The Minister would be serving the Irish people well if he would contemplate such a development.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister take steps to eliminate the tremendous backlog in regard to telephone installations?  I cannot understand why this backlog has accumulated.  There should have been intelligent forecasting of demand some years ago by the officials of his Department. They could have foreseen the demand.  They do not seem to have geared themselves to meet the demand. I understand it is shortage of technical personnel that is holding up installations in rural areas.  The telephone is very important in our daily lives, especially for those in remote areas.  It is the quickest means of communication <Col N="875" /> and those who have no telephone are at a disadvantage in an emergency. I urge the Minister to keep up the pressure to ensure that the backlog is wiped out and that new demands can be met almost immediately.  As well as providing a very important service, the Minister would be creating more income for the Department.  The longer people are without phones the greater the loss in revenue.  It is bad economics.</P>
    <P>In general I should like to congratulate the Minister.  He is a newly appointed young Minister in a difficult Department but I congratulate him on doing a very good job, for meeting people we have asked him to meet, for listening to our suggestions, answering our questions so comprehensively and for making information available to Deputies at all times.  It is right that Ministers should convey information as fully as possible to Deputies because even though we may have our political differences at times we all have the long-term interests of our constituents at heart and when we try to elicit information, it is really in the interests of the people and the more information we can be supplied with the better.  I would hope that the Minister might convey to the authority, as my colleague the Minister for Transport and Power has promised to convey to Bord Fáilte, the suggestion as to using the opportunity of the Eurovision Song Contest to present a tourism promotion film of Ireland.  We will have a viewing audience in the region of 400 million people which is a colossal number to get in one scoop.  Even if it had an impact on only the minutest percentage of those viewers then it would have been a very profitable exercise indeed.</P>

      <P>There are only two matters on which I want to speak on this Estimate.  The first is the question of broadcasting and the second is the telephone service.  I want to take this opportunity, for the first time since I have come into this House, of saying a little about broadcasting in Ireland against the background that I think I am the only person in the House who has been for a substantial period of <Col N="876" /> his life a professional broadcaster.  The last speaker named three Labour Deputies concerning whom this had obtained.  That is not so.  The record is as follows: I was a professional broadcaster for a little over two years. Deputy David Thornley was a contract broadcaster while he carried on his university post.  He participated in programmes on a regular basis but was not a full-time staff member of the broadcasting service.  The third person named, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, as one of the most distinguished persons now writing in the English language, not surprisingly has had matter from his pen braodcast from time to time but at no stage has he been on the staff of RTE nor has he been a regular broadcaster in terms of participating in a regular series.  This is just a matter of fact which I do not propose to dwell on, but personally I would wish that in matters like that the truth was given a little more respect and that the matter would be investigated more carefully before flat assertions were made which are not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to talk in rather general terms about the future role of broadcasting in Ireland.  There was a period when I was the consultant on adult education to RTE and for a period of my life I gave very considerable thought to the use of broadcasting in education in general and more especially in adult education, and this is an interest I have maintained in the three years or so since I left broadcasting.  It is a matter of very special importance in Ireland in view of the educational structure which obtains in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to put things in perspective let us talk about the evolution that is coming in television, though I do not make a very sharp distinction in these matters between sound radio and television. There is an evolution coming unless it is blocked for political reasons &mdash;I do not mean internal political reasons&mdash;unless it is blocked by international agreements between various Governments.  Such an evolution can fairly easily be brought about from the <Col N="877" /> technical point of view, of making television broadcasts available very widely.  We have had experience of this when programmes as far away as Mexico could be seen on the television screen.  It will certainly come in the very near future so that not only would we have the choice of BBC, ITV and the Irish channels but very many channels world-wide.  Unless it is blocked for political reasons it is inevitably coming.</P>
    <P>The other thing that is inevitably coming with the availability within the last 12 months of video tape recorders at a cheap price so that they can be owned by schools and even by private individuals, is recorded television programmes in the same range of availability as for sound record programmes over the past ten years.  This means that one is now in the process of being freed from being present at the precise moment of transmission of the programme; in other words it will be perfectly possible for schools and for a proportion of wealthier homes&mdash;it is much more important in regard to schools&mdash;to can programmes of particular interest to be replayed at a more convenient time and indeed to be replayed many times over.  The emergence of the video tape recorder, the availability in can, the availability of cassettes and the possibility of recording and re-using programmes people want is a major technical break-through, and so is the availability of programmes from many other countries and many other channels.</P>
    <P>These developments present new perspectives for us, and indeed new problems in a country like this, of the sort we have already seen in regard to colour.  The UK is in the middle of the colour development that the United States was in a little less than ten years ago.  A very rapid take-off into colour is taking place in the UK at the moment.  We will follow this inevitably. One important regret is that in a country like this such a large amount of our national resources will be deployed on the purchase of colour receivers.  If you cost them at £300 each and multiply them by the number of homes in the country who will buy them it comes out at a very large sum <Col N="878" /> of money.  Perhaps I could be accused of being a killjoy on this but I would wish the resources were spent in a more socially productive way.  However, as has been seen in the United States and in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, when people make up their minds that they want a colour receiver they are willing to spend a large proportion of their income in the rental of one if they cannot afford to purchase it.</P>
    <P>This presents a station like ours catering for a population of less than three million with very severe problems.  If you do not offer colour you lose your audience; if you do offer colour you bankrupt yourself because you have only a small number of viewers from whom to obtain revenue. This is a dilemma for a television service and we shall have other such dilemmas in the future as colour programmes from many parts of the world of fairly high quality become available. We have chosen the mechanism of financing our station partly through revenue from the people who receive television programmes and partly through advertising revenue.  You cannot retain your advertising revenue if you cannot retain your audience.  So long as the Irish broadcasting station depends for a significant part of its revenue on advertising it is committed to a sort of auction of popularity with other channels.  Again, at the risk of being labelled a killjoy, it is often an auction as to who can obtain the more degraded sort of film, the type of film that will command a vast audience.  We have the rather depressing spectacle that as Independent Television in Britain becomes lower and lower in taste, we must follow them in that downward trend in order to retain the mass viewing audience.  The dilemma facing us in this respect is a difficult one for people whose job it is to provide a mix in any television or broadcasting station.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, perhaps, I should put it on the record that, from my experience of little more than an hour's broadcasting each week over a period of a couple of years, I did not experience any personal oppression or influence in regard to programme content by reason of a few seconds advertising <Col N="879" /> between programmes.  Our system is much better than the American system where chunks of the main part of the time are bought by different commercial sponsors thereby making for much greater leverage.  Programme makers do not regard themselves as being oppressed because advertising time is sold during their programmes except in so far as that if one knows that one's tam rating goes down, the commercial time on either side of the slot that one is occupying becomes of less value and one is either pushed out to a much worse time in the spectrum of time taken up by the broadcasting service or else one is forced to trim one's programme in order to keep up the tam rating.  Either of these pressures is undesirable.  It is only fair to say that our system is vastly better than the system obtaining in some other countries.  Our system of a mixture of State money and private advertising revenue for the financing of our service was all right in the beginning but it has these dangerous and indirect long-term influences on programme content and on programme-makers.  This is a real dilemma for us in the long-term and it is even a greater dilemma if we enter the Common Market with the prospect of being able to receive programmes by satellite from many parts of the world.  We would be able to receive programmes such as some I have seen on American channels, programmes that are so degrading, which are produced for the purpose of brainwashing the population and which could be very harmful socially to our people.</P>
    <P>The other point about broadcasting is that as one moves into a period where a great deal of information is received by sound through radio or, by picture, through television, the power of these media will grow to be even greater than it is at present.  Then in a country like ours which has only 3,000,000 people and, by the standards of the six countries of the Community and the four applicant countries, the poorest, we would then be faced with the prospect of how to maintain broadcasting that will protect the sort of national identity and culture that will be under threat anyway in the Community. <Col N="880" /> Personally, I consider that we are very fortunate to have this sort of national culture and national atmosphere and we must defend them at all costs.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the State will have to make available large amounts of money for broadcasting because of the importance of the media.  This is done in the case of the BBC.  I would hope that the role of commercial advertising moneys would dwindle and eventually disappear.  If we leave ourselves open to commercial pressures we will have the same sort of television as everyone else.  We will have the inevitable grinding down of our population by the media to the type of undifferentiated culturalist norm that now obtains all over the USA.  If we are to use the media, and particularly television, as a deepener and as a protector of our culture, we will not succeed in doing that on the basis of the present financial system.  At the beginning this system did not work too badly when there was not much availability of BBC or ITV but it is a system that will become less effective as time goes on when costs, inevitably, will continue to increase.  I hope that the nation will recognise this social charge on public revenue for the sake of worthwhile public, social goals.  Television is pulled in two ways.  It is used by people to enrich the whole cultural mechanism. It is used also as a purveyor by people who are concerned with making money. Therefore, there is a tug-of-war all the time.  At the beginning we compromised and I would not quarrel with the decision made at that time but we will have to decide now, in favour of public support, to operate the system on a much larger scale if we are to have a broadcasting service that will elevate our people rather than one that would degrade them as happens in so far as the vast majority of American television programmes are concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with the other great problem that faces any broadcasting station.  That is the problem of democratic control.  Newspapers, by and large, are owned by certain people. We have become accustomed to this in our society.  Speaking from these benches, we make a sharp distinction between the way journalists behave and <Col N="881" /> the way newspaper proprietors behave. Generally we reckon that journalists behave honourably and that they tell the story as it is.  On the other hand, speaking as socialists, we resent bitterly the political axe-grinding that goes on by newspaper management who are largely motivated by the desire to protect their own incomes.  Some democratic societies such as Sweden, for instance, have tried to improve the situation by providing large amounts of public money to the Press so that they would not be dependent on big advertisers or on grinding a commercial axe.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one witnesses the sad spectacle of a man who is trying to be an honourable editor but who is being pulled in two ways, the way of truth by those below him in the structure of the paper who are feeding him the truth and efforts being made the other way by people whose motivation is simply the commercial success of their newspaper.  In our society we accept this in relation to the newspapers but this is not the place to pursue the matter.</P>
    <P>With the advent of television, we are faced with the choice of how this media should be controlled.  To some extent, the American solution has been a multiple one with private ownership but it has produced a degradation in the vast majority of American broadcasts. In Britain the problem was solved by setting up a national network, the BBC, and then setting up parallel commercial channels.  We solved the problem by having a national network but we sold some commercial time.  As television becomes more important, the question of democratic control becomes a very central issue in the whole fabric of our democratic society.  The question of real democracy in broadcasting is one of the most important questions that a democratic nation must face because there is the dreadful prospect which we have seen not only in Eastern Europe but much nearer home. We have seen it in France where the national broadcasting service was put totally under the command of the Government. During &ldquo;the great days&rdquo;&mdash; and I use that phrase in inverted <Col N="882" /> commas&mdash;of General de Gaulle, French television was a sorry and pitiful and disgusting spectacle.  There were honourable people in that service who either had to get out or lose their honour because they could not broadcast with any freedom.</P>
    <P>The situation was not quite as bad as that here at any time, but there was a period in the latter days of my work for RTE&mdash;and, in fact, it contributed in part, although not entirely, to my leaving it&mdash;when we had a Television Authority consisting of people whose names I will not mention, but they are known.  In this country a little less than half of the votes go to the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have a distortion of proportional representation which gives that party a slight majority of the seats in this House. That party used their power under the Broadcasting Act to nominate people to the Television Authority so that it was totally unrepresentative of the balance of political, social, and cultural outlook.</P>
    <P>Not only did they nominate people of clear political commitment in the vast majority of cases, but they also nominated people who were without stature culturally in broadcasting or in any other way except in their political reliability.  A very scandalous and shameful situation obtained in relation to the Broadcasting Authority of RTE a few years ago.  It contributed a great deal to the malaise in that organisation and it contributed to the fact that people with some of the finest and most creative minds who ever served Irish broadcasting, and the Irish people through Irish broadcasting, left in disgust.  The situation has improved a little but the present structure is open to abuse and, in the recent past, has been very shamefully abused.  However, it would be unjust to say that the situation has not improved.  It has improved a little since those days.  It is a little better now.</P>
    <P>The problem of the really democratic control of broadcasting is unsolved.  Therefore the problem of creating an atmosphere in which our broadcasters can do really creative and constructive work is also unsolved. This is a very central problem which <Col N="883" /> must be solved because it is not sufficient, in my view, just to nominate certain persons to the Authority.  One has to develop mechanisms by which very many of the strands, not just political but also social and cultural, are represented on the authority.</P>
    <P>That will be countered by asking would this not mean that every type of pressure group would be poking their fingers into the affairs of the broadcasting station and that work could not go on.  I will deal with that in a moment.  I recognise that this is a difficulty.  I suffered from it when I was trying to make programmes.  I know what it is like to have people without knowledge putting on pressure, for the clearest of partisan reasons, about what should go into a programme or be kept out of it.  Of course, that inhibits the creative work of people who are trying to broadcast well.  People who are very proud of their profession are often very disturbed and very disgusted by the atmosphere in which they are required to work.</P>
    <P>We must do two things that seem to be conflicting.  As in many other instances, it is a matter of reconciling and balancing conflicts.  The authority must reflect the many different strands in the country.  I have referred before to Ireland's diversity, cultural, ethnic and linguistic, being its glory.  Any effort to simplify us as one cultural, or ethnic, or linguistic strand, is a disgraceful effort which diminishes the nation.  We have to generate mechanisms through which the different strands are really represented, not in the person of&mdash;I will not use the phrase that sprang to my lips because it is one of contempt and ridicule and I do not think that will advance the situation&mdash;individuals of known political reliability.  Let us have angry people, and quirky people, and individualistic people, and people with strong points of view, who are their own men, to reflect all those strands in our Television Authority.  The present structure of the democratic control of broadcasting is quite inadequate to bear the stresses of the future and to channel the immense power which <Col N="884" /> broadcasting has, and which grows everyday, for creative purposes.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the creative freedom of broadcasters.  I believe that the Authority should meet rarely and should set the atmosphere. It should have as its prime task the generation of an atmosphere in which the creative worker can work and create freely.  The creative worker in television is the producer.  The rest of the machinery, be it engineering, advertising or publicity, exists to support and cherish and hold up the producer and make his work more creative.  You cannot get creative work from a producer in an atmosphere in which he is continuously under pressure.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of the system which I do not advocate in the financial insecurity of our society, but which works very well in the more advanced societies that exist in Scandinavia. There are people in television production in Scandinavia who are on very short contracts indeed.  The contracts are renewed as long as the work remains good.  While they are on a contract they enjoy the most enormous freedom to act according to the dictates of their own conscience, their own insight, their own knowledge of the world.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a conflict between the creative freedom of the producer and the democratic representation of many strands in the Authority.  These things can be reconciled and have been reconciled in other places with a higher level of democracy and a higher level of social behaviour.  They will never be reconciled until you get people of very high moral stature on to your television authority to generate an atmosphere of moral authority and intellectual stature in your station.  Every time you put somebody on your authority because of his political reliability, you degrade the whole apparatus.</P>
    <P>Perhaps surprisingly, I want to endorse and perhaps amplify a little a suggestion made by Deputy Crowley. He used the phrase &ldquo;the university of the air&rdquo; which is what the British call it.  There is a peculiar circumstance in this country which I encountered and tried to do something about.  For a period I thought I was doing something <Col N="885" /> about it in agriculture.  Because I am more familiar with it I will outline the problem in relation to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people now operating farms finished their education at 14.  They did not receive any education in rural science because rural science was dropped from the old national school curriculum at the beginning of the 'thirties.  They are faced with a highly technological and sophisticated task and they have no training for it.  Because of insufficient investment in the past, the education of our people has been defective by the standards of a modern, democratic society.  The way to remedy that is by a system of adult education.  The way to get at adults is through television.  It is not so necessary in places like Scandinavia where the level of education of children and indeed structured adult education is vastly better and richer than it is here. The only way to give the entire population the necessary information for the effective running of society is through broadcasting.  We need a vast extension of the use of television in education.</P>
    <P>I had the great honour&mdash;I reckon it was the most useful thing I have ever done in my life&mdash;to participate in the Telefís Éireann farm series of programmes. In this programme we pioneered a technique which was new in the world and that was the use of voluntary viewing groups as the structure of study.  Hitherto programmes had been used in schools and universities but they had never been used carrying the whole structure through Macra na Feirme, and all the other groups who co-operated so freely and so magnificently.  This programme excited interest all over the world in places as far away as India and the Scandinavian countries.  To my great chagrin it was dismantled but it is something which we must do again in many other fields.  We have to have this sort of educational effort, not just in agriculture, where the need was particularly obvious and pressing, but in the whole area of enrichment.</P>
    <P>We have a great word tradition in this country but we have a deplorable tradition in the visual arts: sculpture, painting, architecture and interior design.  To put it at its lowest we <Col N="886" /> cannot compete industrially making products that anybody else would want to buy if we do not have a sense of physical beauty as well as utility.  If we do not have that we shall fall by the way industrially.  Television can be easily used for this sort of enrichment. There are many brilliant examples of its use all over the world.</P>
    <P>We have to have something a great deal simpler than a university of the air which makes people automatically think it is at the level of a university degree.  It is not enough to buy Sir Kenneth Clarke's series on Civilisation and transmit that.  Unless the sort of education I am talking about is followed up with printed material, with organised viewing groups and with a discussion on programme content it is quite useless.  It is a nice little genuflection to culture to buy cultural programmes and transmit them but it is not education through broadcasting.  Television is much more powerful as a medium of spreading information, but more important than that, of spreading a psychological attitude which makes people want to know.  It is vastly more important for doing that than any other medium at our disposal and we are neglecting it at serious peril.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend much time on this sordid business of the Seven Days Tribunal.  I do not want to enter into an auction with the last speaker as to what party has more supporters in the television station.  I could tell a tale of people dismissed and replaced on a political basis.  I do not propose to do that, because I do not think it is good for the morale of the station at this time.  We all know in the broadcasting station who is one party and who is the other party.  We all make programmes honourably just the same in which we do not grind our personal political axe.  Anybody who knows journalists knows that so-and-so is one party and so-and-so is another.  It does not come through in what they produce as copy because they have a sense of the honour of their profession.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that my party should contain people of more creative cultural talent than the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am therefore not surprised that <Col N="887" /> our particular political outlook should be more strongly represented in the creative work of this country.  I should be amazed if that were not so.  That is a totally different thing from sneering at Labour Deputies on the basis that we will stand up for our people because they are our people.  If we want to start counting heads in that station we could say who were whose people starting at the authority and going right through. One would then see the placing of people not on the basis of ability, talent, creative work or constructive contribution to broadcasting but on the basis of political reliability.  Were it useful to play that game, which it is not, it would demoralise the station and I do not propose to do it.  Neither do I propose to listen to the sneers of people who suggest that we have exerted improper influence on any broadcasters.</P>
    <P>Let us turn now to this sordid Seven Days Inquiry, very briefly on my part. The full fatuousness of complaining about people being paid for appearing on a television programme is now evident to everybody.  The full fatuousness of complaining about participants on a television programme being given drink either before or after is also evident to everybody.  The ludicrousness, when one considers the source of some of those complaints, is also obvious to everybody.  I need not spend time on that.</P>
    <P>What I want to say after the investigation is this: a working Deputy, particularly if he is in a city or near a city constituency, has a vast spectrum of experience about social situations, such as a moneylending situation.  In my constituency of North County Dublin there are built-up housing areas. I know from my direct experience many things which I cannot prove, as does every other Deputy, journalist and broadcaster.  We cannot prove them. We do not have the right to spray innuendo around us.  Neither have we the right to suppress the magnitude of a problem when we feel it is a real problem.</P>
    <P>I want to put my opinion on record. When it was asked whether the number of moneylenders operating in the whole <Col N="888" /> of the Dublin area was 500 or less than 50 and when it was insisted by official spokesmen with the whole back up of the police, that it was of the order of 20, this to me was not just wrong but ludicrous.  It was directly in conflict with my experience and the experience of many other urban Deputies.  The fact that it could not be brought to light with the sort of proof which would stand up in court need surprise no one. As I say, we know many things of which we do not have that sort of proof.  In my view the estimate made by a small number of hard-working broadcasters about the scale of the problem was many times more accurate than the estimate made by the Minister with the whole police service to back him up.  It is my view, for the record, that &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; was right and the Minister, Deputy Ó Moráin, was wrong. This is the experience and conviction of many other people apart from myself.</P>
    <P>On the matter of whether intimidation takes place&mdash;not just a fear of exposure but a fear of being beaten up&mdash;that problem existed then and still exists in Dublin.  To that extent the programme was right and the denials of such occurrences were wrong.  I do not propose to go further at this time except to say that so far as I am concerned that investigation was a sordid affair.  It should never have happened because the initial attacks on the programme-makers should not have occurred. When one considers the nature of the inquiry it is a considerable vindication of the programme-makers and more than I thought possible having regard to the type of inquiry and the pressures that were exerted.  It was a sordid episode of efforts to put pressure on broadcasters and, from the point of view of those people who perpetrated that effort, it is best forgotten. I would not have introduced this matter had not the previous speaker done so.  He may sneer as much as he likes about those people he is attacking but we have a responsibility to do all we can to generate more free comment in this country, not less free comment. All of the key areas of broadcasting, whether the democratic control of broadcasting, the financing, or the use of broadcasting in the area of <Col N="889" /> adult education, are in great need of reform.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on our telephone service.  I have had the good and bad fortune to work as a scientist and as a broadcaster and journalist in a number of countries.  There are countries where the telephone service is worse than in Ireland.  For instance, in my opinion the service is worse in France where it is almost quicker to write a letter than to make a long distance telephone call.  However, there are other countries where the service is much better than in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have a small population which is widely dispersed.  Where there is a rather poor population a tremendous strain is placed on the fundamental investment that is required to provide the necessary services.  This applies equally in regard to transport or in the maintenance of roads.  The only way out is to generate a much larger volume of usage and this applies to all kinds of services.  If the usage could be increased the inevitable investment could be spread over a wider area.  In the case of the telephone service it is the circumstances of the vicious circle. If the service is bad the telephones are not used, if there is an alternative; accordingly, the revenue is not generated to enable an improvement in the service.  A rising revenue will give rising investment which leads to an improvement and generates more use. The wheel turns either one way or the other.</P>
    <P>As Deputies we must conduct much of our work either by telephone or by letter.  I have frequently found that after waiting in vain for 20 minutes for a telephone call I end up by writing a letter.  Countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden have a much more efficient service.  I note that the Confederation of Irish Industry has listed the quality of telephone service as one of the obstructions to a more efficient business situation in this country.</P>
    <P>It is possible to generate higher usage of the service in two ways: first, by a better service and, secondly, by a public relations exercise.  It is a pity that the United Kingdom had to wait for the hiving off of the Post Office <Col N="890" /> into a private corporation before they started selling communications in an active and progressive way.  The structure of the posts and telegraphs system originated a long time ago and it has now become somewhat ossified.  Its management mechanisms are old-fashioned and many of its structures are out-of-date.  Nobody wants to go into this section and tear the whole structure apart in a ruthless way.  On the other hand, to the extent that reform is not carried out in this sphere people will find other mechanisms.  This may be one of the lessons of the postal strike in Britain.  The mail service there had got inefficient and people found in the course of the postal strike other ways of transacting business and the use of this service will diminish.</P>
    <P>We have the same situation in regard to our telephone service.  We have all seen the facilities that are available in the United Kingdom.  The odd thing is if one goes and badgers the Post Office people here one finds that there are an extraordinary number of facilities available which nobody knows anything about because no effort has been made to explain what kind of facilities are available.  There should be a public relations effort to explain to the public the range of facilities available. It would be sad to think that we would have to wait for the dismemberment of the Minister's Department and the taking of the postal services out of his direct area of control before this could happen.  I do not think one has to wait for reform until one dismembers long-established and often well-consolidated and efficient organisations. It is not necessary to take them out of Government control before reforms are instituted.</P>
    <P>However, there is the problem of a long existing structure becoming ossified but the problem is soluble.  The same kind of modern management investigation, business efficiency investigation and public relations exercises which have been instituted in a number of European countries in recent times, and in the United Kingdom, are essential in this area as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I trust he will <Col N="891" /> continue to be co-operative and do his best to ensure satisfactory post office services throughout the country.  Postal charges and telephone rentals have increased since he became Minister, postal charges by 40 per cent and telephone rentals by approximately 33 per cent.  This should bring in greatly increased revenue, though there is a possibility of a reduction in the number of letters as a result of the four new pence or ten old pence.  That seems a very big increase.  Of course, revenue has to be found to pay the salaries and wages of those who run the postal services.  I understand the problems.</P>
      <P>In certain parts of the west we have not the kind of services we would like. We are grateful for the erection of the new modern post office in Claremorris. This is graded A.  We trust there will be a commensurate improvement in the postal services.  Large areas in my county have no night telephone service. According to the regulations there must be 35 connections in an area before an all-night service is provided.  In Hollyamount there are 32 connections.  Garda stations are being closed in that area and a night telephone service is most essential.  Such a service is also required in the Knock area.  If one has an urgent call to make one must either go to the public kiosk or to the local curate's house.</P>
      <P>I had a question some time ago about a public kiosk in Meelick and I was informed by the Minister that, if there was no post office in the area, a kiosk could not be erected.  The distances between sub-post offices in the west are very great and kiosks are most essential. I would ask the Minister to consider the position.  These problems do not exist in the east but they certainly exist in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure most Deputies have experienced delay in getting phone calls out from here.  One can ring as many as ten times before getting through.  It took me practically half an hour yesterday to get through to a particular Department.  Who is responsible for these delays?  Rural Deputies have a great deal of work to do and the telephone is a tremendous convenience, or it should be.  I would appeal to the <Col N="892" /> Minister to provide a better service here in Dáil Éireann in particular.</P>
    <P>There is a backlog of 14,000 applications for telephones.  Where an applicant is three miles from an exchange he has to pay 32s per furlong per year over the standard rate.  There should be a flat rate.  I applied for a phone and, because I am seven furlongs over the regulation distance, the phone rental would cost me an extra £4 per year, roughly.  I regard this as dishonest because everybody pays where the Post Office is concerned. There should be a flat rate regardless of distance from the exchange.  There was a regulation in the Minister's Department under which exchanges were graded as centres.  I wonder has the Minister investigated this.  Is it a fact that this regulation existed?  In certain areas there are measurement centres from post offices and this cuts out the three mile limit from an exchange. I do not know whether this system operates at the moment.  If the Department have discontinued this system I cannot understand why.  I do not see why centres should be chosen in County Clare and County Galway. I would ask the Minister to consider the measurement centres from post offices and the system which operates.</P>
    <P>People from the west of Ireland who work in the Post Office in Dublin have complained about the system relating to promotions.  I know of people who, having done all the necessary tests, looked for promotion but did not get it.  Perhaps the male section of the Department are opposed to the female section.  I know a lady who was looking for promotion for two or three years but did not get it.  She was a first-class official.  The official who was junior to her was promoted.  This should not happen.  It may not have been political.  This does not happen in the country.  I have no complaint from any officials in my area.  The staff are excellent and get promotion in their turn.  I will discuss this point with the Minister later.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to speak on the subject of Knock.  A film was shown on this shrine by a Mr. Gallagher and a Fr. O'Doherty.  It was a disgraceful film.  As a Catholic parent I condemn <Col N="893" /> it.  The film tried to degrade the Catholic heritage of the country.  I know of many things which happened at Knock.  Telefís Éireann are supported by public moneys.  They should not show such a film.  If Mr. Gallagher wants to degrade our Catholic heritage there is a place for him behind the Iron Curtain.  If the reverend gentleman who was on the programme wants to degrade Knock there is a place in Holland to which such progressive priests can go.  Thousands of pilgrims visit Knock annually.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that such films are not shown on Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>The gentleman in charge of the film went so far as to say that Rome was probably laughing at the idea of the Knock shrine.  Rome have recognised Knock for the purpose of indulgences. I condemn the production of a film when proper information and guidance have not been sought.  Many letters have been written condemning this film.  If those who portrayed it are anti-clerical the parents of this country will condemn them.  They will not change the outlook they have held for the past 700 years at the behest of a few anti-clerical people who are trying to upset the whole Catholic heritage of this country.  I hope that this will be a warning to people who are showing films.  They should show films factually and not criticise or degrade people.  I speak on behalf of the people of my area.  I know of one mother who carried her baby to Knock on three occasions.  I saw this baby, and he was not able to walk.  On a later occasion I myself saw the mother and son coming to Knock in thanksgiving.  The child was cured.  When the mass media of this country criticise this type of thing it is about time that the parents formed an organisation in every parish to see that this anti-clericalism which is inclined to creep in will be eliminated. While there will be a small section anxious to promote it, we will not accept it and it will not succeed. I trust that the Minister will consider the points I have made about the telephone service in the west of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>To a great extent I agree with what Deputy Finn has <Col N="894" /> said.  On any occasion that RTE people have gone west&mdash;you can interpret that as you wish&mdash;they have tried to hold up the west to ridicule in any way they possibly could.  From Belmullet to Blacksod and even further there are only two bad houses and one bad church but when the RTE people came there, these were the only three buildings they filmed.  The church will not fall down for another 100 years although it may not be up to modern standards.  In Belmullet, where we have probably one of the most modern and best churches in Ireland, they did not film it, nor did they film the thousands of houses built between Belmullet and Blacksod.  They filmed anything they could find which they thought was wrong.</P>
      <P>Most of these people now in RTE are nothing other than the woodlice of the newspapers who have come from the <i>Irish Times,</i> the <i>Irish Independent,</i> and the <i>Irish Press.</i> If the Minister is responsible for them it will not be long until he is bald because this matter is a public disgrace. These people are not representative of Irish life, not even in its worst form in the suburbs of this city or anywhere else in Ireland. What they put across as the position in this country is not true.  They went down to Achill and tried to film pigs under the bed.  They forgot that there was no pig in Achill since St. Patrick banished the snakes.  A funny thing&mdash; those who tried to film in this way were drowned two days afterwards. This is true.  I do not tell lies.  We have very few bad houses, especially in my area.  It is a disgrace that such things should go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finn mentioned Knock.  The big point in regard to Knock is that if you do not believe in the story of Knock it is dafter to believe in the story of Christ because we have no documented history there at all.  I am sorry that Deputy Finn has gone.  If you do not believe in Knock you might as well believe in nothing.  There is no option.  Aer Lingus advertise at tremendous cost to bring people to Lourdes, Fatima and other places. Knock is too near and has no aerodrome and that is the only reason they do not advertise it.  Where does one <Col N="895" /> draw the line?  Do we accept it or say: &ldquo;It is all cod.&rdquo;  If we do that we might as well give up our religion altogether. Somebody said that the man who would believe the story of Jesus Christ would believe anything.  So if we believe that&mdash;and we do&mdash;we must believe in Knock and many other things.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that what RTE did in regard to Knock&mdash;and it was disgraceful&mdash;had nothing to do with Government policy.  I hope Deputy Finn does not associate the action of the people who went down there with the Government party or Government policy.  It had nothing to do with them.</P>
    <P>Another gentleman last night said our country was upside-down because of drugs, drink and sex.  I know a fair amount about drink and sex but I know nothing about drugs.  Advertising of drugs, drink or sex should not be carried out on radio or television. When I was young there was no wireless. I am 55, not 35 as some people think.  There was no television but we learned how to drink and how to go with women.  We did not take drugs. We did not have to get any tuition on how to drink or court.</P>

I probably would not have a family now if television had been invented then because, between the pill, the antipill and the new pill&mdash;the fertility pill, about which the Deputy would know more than I do&mdash;we would not know where we were.  A fellow at Rooskey gave the fertility pill to his sheep and every one of them had five lambs.  Advertising this type of thing on TV does not have any effect on me.  I do not know what effect it has on the younger generation.  It did not stop me from producing six children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of bluff is put over particularly on television.  You have all sorts of contests or alleged contests, all fixed in advance.  It would be very interesting to see the next fight between <Col N="896" /> the alleged Mohammed Ali and Joe Frazier.  These people made a fortune out of TV and there are people in this country also making a fortune out of it.  On one occasion I was brought to something which I thought was a joke and I got about £10 for going there.  People are getting this money and unfortunately people who have television and radio sets are paying heavily for it.  So are the advertisers, who must be paying a tremendous amount from what I can see.  We must reach a point when we can no longer be just a small Britain or small America.  We should either assert our rights or cease asserting them.  Saying that by going into the Common Market we will lose our identity is something like that.  We have already lost it, certainly in regard to our television service.</P>
    <P>There has been lobbying for a new radio station.  Why put it in Galway, in Iar-Chonnacht wherever that is?  I do not know and I have done a lot of travelling.  If it is established there the programmes will only be received by fellows fishing out in Newfoundland or some place like that.  Why not put it in Mayo where it would be between Donegal and Galway?  There are more Irish speakers in Donegal than there are in Galway.  This is only a gimmick and a racket; if you exert enough pressure here in this House it is amazing what you can put across.  If there is £500,000 to spare for that kind of thing the Government must have a tremendous amount of money.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on this the first Estimate he has brought in.  Posts and Telegraphs is, except for the Land Commission, the most backward Department, and any improvements that have taken place have been due to the present Minister. At last we now have a direct telephone service to the west.  We no longer have to use tom-toms or smoke signals.  I often had to spend an hour-and-a-half or two hours here before I could contact my own house.  I do not know how many are on the waiting list for telephones. I have no complaints in that regard.  The Minister must have fixed us up so I had better keep my mouth closed.  I wish him the best of luck in his new office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is singularly privileged to the extent that they can raise the cost of postage without any reference whatsoever to Dáil Éireann.  In the period I have been in this House postage has been increasing steadily.  Recently on the introduction of the decimal system they succeeded in slapping another penny on postage.  Many people did not grasp the fact that they were paying tenpence for a letter as against ninepence before.  I do not think it is right that postage should be increased without reference to Dáil Éireann.  Dáil Éireann has to vote the necessary funds for expenditure incurred in respect of the various Departments but seemingly it is not the case with this Department. Perhaps when the Minister is replying to the debate he would clarify the position.</P>
      <P>The telephone service is an essential infrastructure for which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has a national responsibility.  It is very unfair that people who live off the beaten track are obliged to pay an excessive sum for a telephone.  This militates against many people but largely against farmers because they are the people who live in outlying districts. They have to carry on their business the same as anybody else and in modern conditions they depend on the telephone.  In the telephone service there has been continuous overloading of the main trunks.  That is the answer that is given if one raises the question of a bad service.  The main centres are very well looked after.  It is the outlying districts that suffer all the time. If I want to ring Dublin, Cork or Limerick I am sure to get a good line but if I want to ring someone in my own constituency who may be only ten or 20 miles away the service is appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the overloading of the trunks brings me back to the point that the telephone service is a national institution which is vital to production and to the economy as a whole, and this should be recognised by the Government. I appreciate the fact that Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs are generally a fairly junior appointment <Col N="898" /> in the Government and they are largely pushed aside as the Department of Education used to be up to fairly recent years.  They were treated as the Cinderella of the Public Service and had to wait for their cut off the joint until everybody else had been well served.</P>
    <P>Our telephone service does not measure up to the standard of other countries.  The reason is that there is not enough capital investment in it.  In his opening speech the Minister did not give us any idea as to what funds would be available or as to long-term planning.  There are hundreds of people looking for telephones in every constituency. They have to pay, as far as I know, three to four years rental in advance and in outlying districts the amount is even higher.  Surely this is destroying the future planning of the telephone service.  In other words, money is being paid in now which should be available to the Estimate in years to come.  If somebody got a telephone in 1964 he would be paying a rental up to practically 1970, and, therefore, the period 1965 to 1969 is robbed of the annual return due.  There is something wrong in this.  It is a capital expenditure and that capital expenditure is being got together by the filching of the income that should normally accrue annually.  The people who live at a distance have to pay the full amount for the installation of their telephone, so that this Government do not recognise the telephone service as a national liability.  The telephone service requires enormous capital investment. I am sure the Minister realises this point and I have no doubt he will force the point home.  I am trying to assist him as a member of the Opposition who has been in this House for many years.</P>
    <P>If you make a telephone call in any part of Europe you get on in a few minutes and you would get a proper line.  You will not have the farcical situation here in which you are talking to somebody, there is a loud click, a jazz band operates for a few moments and then the whole thing goes wallop or, else, it drops to a whisper.  The only cause for this is overloading of lines.  The answer to that is capital expenditure <Col N="899" /> and I would ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no recognition by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of the need for telephone kiosks.  These are the right of people who have not got private telephones.  If one asks to have a kiosk erected, he is told that the requirement in the area is not sufficient to justify the provision of a kiosk or, he may be told that the parish priest has a telephone or that there are already several private telephones in the area.  A private telephone is the property of the individual concerned and, while most people in the country are extremely co-operative in facilitating those who have not telephones installed in their homes, they should not have to do this.  I have no hesitation in allowing a person to use my telephone in an emergency but it is the duty of the Department to provide a public telephone kiosk in every village in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Again, the reason for this lack of kiosks is the already overloaded system that we have.  As the Minister is aware, if a person inserts money into a call box but if he does not succeed in getting his call through, he will be more likely to make a complaint than would a person having a private telephone. This is one of the reasons why the question of the provision of telephone kiosks is resisted.  When the Minister goes to the Government to seek the moneys that are necessary for his Department, I hope that these points will reinforce his argument.</P>
    <P>The other night we voted on a Bill which will give £3 million to Irish Steel Holdings but surely that money would be better spent in giving us a better telephone service, the type of service to which we are entitled.  I am sure it is not easy to get money from the present Minister for Finance but I hope that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be able to persuade him to make extra money available for this service.  It is in the national interest that he should do so because we cannot possibly face up to the standard of other countries in relation to a telephone service if it is not improved. Anybody who is on an automatic exchange, <Col N="900" /> as I am, will have no complaint but if one must receive hundreds of telephone calls, as I receive from different parts of my constituency, he has every cause for complaint because the caller is shouting at one end while the receiver is shouting at the other but each can barely hear the other.  This results from overloading and can only be solved by the provision of more money.</P>
    <P>Most people have mentioned television and I intend to say but a few words in that connection.  Television is a national institution.  It has a national responsibility which it should live up to.  I am sure that the people concerned are endeavouring to live up to that responsibility but, perhaps, the greatest challenge they have is the question of the unfortunate state of affairs that prevails at the moment in Northern Ireland.  The destruction that is being carried on there is a source of anxiety to all of us regardless of what our political sentiments may be.</P>
    <P>With the best will in the world, I am sure, Telefís Éireann adopted the attitude that they should let the world know of the injustices that exist in the north.  However they have succeeded in achieving the opposite.  I exonerate them entirely from any malicious forethought in that regard but this is what has happened.  About a year ago when the Reverend Ian Paisley appeared with his Roman collar&mdash;I suppose he would choke on the spot anybody who would refer to it as a Roman collar but it was a clerical collar of some sort&mdash;he received from Telefis Éireann far more publicity than he got from anybody else.  This was to the detriment of the Irish nation as a whole. From the point of view of people living in such places as Guatemala, Australia or elsewhere, he is an Irishman.  People in many parts of the world are not aware that this is a divided State. Telefís Éireann built up this man and then continued night after night to bring us his blaring voice.  They built up this man who preached such bigotry and who, to my mind, is a psychiatric case.  It is true that there is anti-Christian feeling throughout the world and that it is a question of communism versus Christianity but there is <Col N="901" /> no country in the world in which one would hear the type of bigotry that is preached by this man.  Yet, Telefís Éireann covered his rantings to the detriment of the Irish nation.  Even when he succeeded in gaining a seat in a strong Unionist constituency, the BBC only gave him a very small amount of publicity.  Why should we bother with people like this man?  All Telefís Éireann succeeded in doing was to portray us as a people who are mad.</P>
    <P>I have not met anybody who is not sick and tired of seeing the violence and the vandalism of the North of Ireland portrayed on their screens.  I know it is being done with the best intention in the world but all Telefís Éireann are doing is showing to the world the destruction that is going on in Ireland. Anybody who has travelled a good deal must be aware that 90 per cent of the people in other parts of the world know nothing of the position in relation to the North and the Republic. They do not know that this country is divided because British propaganda has kept that down all through the years.  The theory is being created that we cannot settle our own affairs and that we cannot agree among ourselves. One of the glories of this country is that this State was built up on a physical force movement.  We became more or less the admiration of the world.  Ireland became a major tourist centre.  People were interested in Ireland and were coming here but now this rotten image is being put across. I do not know whether the Minister has any influence in this respect.  I ask him to have another look at the situation. Since Telefís Éireann can show us pictures of the Japanese police with shields chasing people away surely Telefís Éireann can sell these pictures to others and this is to the detriment of our country.  How do they get them unless they are played back to them? Is it not true that Telefís Éireann can sell that stuff to the denigration of Irish nationhood and the decent people of Ireland?  As sure as I am standing here, over 90 per cent of the people abhor what is happening there, and are against it.  It is not a political movement any longer.  It is just that there is a pack of gangsters fighting up there. It is always the way in any revolutionary <Col N="902" /> movement.  Telefís Éireann have the right and the duty to create a national image and they are not doing that.</P>
    <P>Having said such hard things about Telefís Éireann, I should like to say that the service has improved.  I hear a lot of things on RTE with which I do not agree.  Nowadays on television, and in the newspapers, anything to the left is supposed to be terrific news. There is a leftish slant on Telefís Éireann but that is different.  That is a point of view to which they are entitled.  Generally speaking, they are fairly factual apart from that.</P>
    <P>They could show more sports films. There are many people in many parts of Ireland who receive Telefís Éireann only.  On Saturday afternoons when workers are free they are entitled to receive a sports programme like the one put out by the BBC.  If the answer is that it would be too costly, I suggest to the Minister that he could get the programme at second hand.  I forget what the correct television term is.  I think it is &ldquo;puffing&rdquo;.  RTE could get the programmes from the BBC.  They could show the racing and the football matches.  Surely they could show some of the international matches in which we would have an interest?  If, for example, Wales were playing Scotland that should be shown on Irish television in the afternoon.  Many people are interested in soccer matches also and they should be shown if there was no Gaelic game on.  I do not see why there should not be a television sports programme on Saturday afternoons.</P>
    <P>I was very critical of RTE but I felt I should say those things.  I do not know whether anybody else has expressed those views so forcefully during this debate.  The Minister should indicate to Telefís Éireann that they are, in effect, the custodians of the national image.  As we look into the future, it seems very likely that television services will play a greater role in the dissemination of news. Many of us will have noticed, with regret or otherwise, that a number of newspapers in many different countries are in difficulties, and are being forced to close down, largely due to the fact that the revenue they got now goes to <Col N="903" /> television services who have a virtual monopoly of advertising.</P>
    <P>To put it mildly, on Telefís Éireann we seem to have a superabundance of staff.  We have four or five news announcers and we also have a substitute news announcer.  It does not seem to me that we require all these people. If there are five of them on call it seems to me that they need only work limited hours.  If Telefís Éireann are, as they are supposed to be, in a shaky financial condition, surely they could get rid of some of those people?  I am fortunate enough to be able to watch the BBC also and, so far as I can see, they have only two weather forecasters and we have four or five.  I do not know if they are meteorological experts, and if they collect the data themselves or get it from somebody else.  They do not look to me to be meteorological experts and the results they produce are not always conducive to the thought that they are meteorological experts.  Of course, that is understandable because no one has ever been able to predict the weather satisfactorily in these islands.  A puff of wind from the east or the west may change the situation completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer, first of all, to the telephone service in east Mayo and in Mayo generally.  It is only fair to say that in the past 12 months there have been considerable improvements in the service.  I claim no technical knowledge of telephones, telephone installations, or the laying of coaxial cables.  It is noticeable that in recent times calls from Mayo to various other centres have been speeded up.  We appreciate this.  Down through the years I felt it my duty in this House to be very critical of the long delays we experienced in view of the fact that in the west the telephone service can be of great benefit to people living in remote areas.  The fact that in the past you had to wait for an hour to get a call was a very serious matter.  Despite the fact that the service has improved, we could achieve greater efficiency if we went over to the dialling system at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own telephone was installed in <Col N="904" /> about 1937.  The line ran four miles out into the country.  We still have to wind the handle and ring the local post office. Sometimes, due perhaps to understaffing in the post office, there can be delays of up to five minutes, and sometimes more, in these local exchanges. If we had the automatic system there would be a big improvement in the service.  The western region, and Mayo in particular, are deserving of special consideration in that regard.  The amount of money I paid to the Department since 1937 or 1938 must have been sizeable.  The Department benefited pretty well from the installation of that line.  I did not deal with the matter at the time but I understand there was some special charge to guarantee the telephone for a number of years.  As I say, it must have been a profitable investment for the Department and I am sure many people would have the same story to relate.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of frequent breakdowns.  I dealt with this matter before on numerous occasions when the Estimate came before the House.  The wire used for the installation of the line to which I have referred was put up many years ago.  It is quite understandable that with old wire there will be frequent breakdowns. The wire snaps somewhere and it comes down on the roadside and you have to go to town and notify the local post office that your telephone is out of order.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the servicemen in the Department do their best.  At times when there are violent storms communications between the main centres may become disrupted and it often takes two or three days to have them restored.  In my opinion the servicemen should be employed replacing the old wires, connections and instruments which were fitted many years ago.  Like an old car and an old truck there is bound to be a higher percentage of breakdowns in old equipment.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a telephone installation in the town of Foxford and a serviceman there, who is an old man, remembers dealing with it in Limerick 35 or 40 years ago.  It seems to be working reasonably well.  It may be worth a great deal of money as an <Col N="905" /> antique.  Perhaps the Department would consider setting up an antique section where old equipment could be collected and later sold profitably.  This might be a great source of revenue to the Department.  I would plead with the Minister to give us an automatic system at the earliest possible date.  I understand most of the cable laying has been done but rumour has it that it may be delayed for another year or two.</P>
    <P>I am heartened to learn there has been an improvement in the recruitment of staff.  We all appreciate that a man cannot be brought in off the street and told to deal with technical matters in relation to telephones and the laying of cables.  Properly trained staff are needed to do this work.  It is a pity that so many of the staff are employed in repairing old lines and in the servicing of out-of-date equipment when they would be much more usefully employed in making the change-over to an automatic system.  The Minister did say, during the course of his speech, that seven or eight people had been recruited but this is a small number.  I hope with more people going to vocational schools than heretofore this will result in more staff being available for the service in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde dealt with the question of kiosks.  They are of great benefit to small towns and there should be many more in rural areas.  I asked the Minister recently whether he would consider installing a kiosk at a place called Bonniconlon in the Ballina area but I received the usual answer that the population did not justify it.  This is a little village with a population of about 200, with the usual facilities&mdash;a post office, Garda barracks and a few pubs.  If a person in Bonniconlon wants to make a telephone call he either has to go into the pub or into a businessman's house and ask permission to use the telephone.  Generally speaking people are very co-operative and are willing to allow people to use their telephone but at the same time a businessman, or a politician, may have many calls to make on the line himself. One can understand the reluctance of some people to allow people coming in off the street to make a telephone <Col N="906" /> call in their house.  In an emergency nobody likes having to knock someone up at night in order to make a telephone call.  If a kiosk was available all one would have to do was insert the money.</P>
    <P>Up until a few years ago there was no telephone at all in Meelick, which is about seven miles from Swinford.  I have not heard any complaints from the people who have had the telephone installed but it is hardly fair for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to make people pay a substantial sum in order to get a telephone installed in a place like Meelick.  The Department have a direct responsibility to provide a telephone kiosk in a case like this. I would ask them to provide a service because it is much needed in the region.</P>
    <P>RTE has been both praised and criticised during the course of this debate. If a thousand people were to speak on the subject of RTE they would each express a different point of view about the Authority.  I do not seem to have as much time as other people to watch television.  I understand a reference was made this morning by Deputy Lenehan to the programme on Knock.  His references are not worthy of comment.  I did not see the programme on the Knock shrine but I did hear comments from a Member of this House about it.  I am not in a position, therefore, to speak on the subject.  I mention it because otherwise it might seem that I am keeping silent on the subject.  It is very unfair of television cameramen and a television service to portray something in such a way as to mislead. In such an instance I would expect their superiors to take drastic action.  They may have done so in connection with the showing of the Knock film.  I understand there was a second showing of a film of the Knock Shrine which, incidentally, I did not see either.  If cameramen or others break the rules or deliberately misrepresent a situation they should be punished.  However, generally speaking, the staff of RTE deserve much praise. They do their best and deserve credit for having introduced this new service because initially many of them were quite inexperienced and they must have been worried about the programmes. <Col N="907" /> It is obvious that if more money were available the programmes would be much better but in many cases they have to stretch things to a considerable extent because the money is not unlimited.  We are all inclined to grumble when the licence fee is increased by £1 or £1 5s.  We should remember that if we want improvements we must pay for them.</P>
    <P>I cannot claim to have any great knowledge of whether RTE are operating in an efficient manner.  Mention has been made by Deputy Esmonde about overstaffing in certain directions.  I shall not make any criticism on this point because I do not know if it is necessary to maintain all the staff at the station.  The Deputy mentioned that there were many newsreaders.  I listen to and watch the news bulletins and it is true that one occasionally sees different readers.  I appreciate that for one reason or another a newsreader may be indisposed and I know it is not possible to ask an untrained person to fill in.  It is essential that trained personnel be available and I accept that if the news personnel are employed in the station they must be required.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to Radio Éireann because, in my opinion, it far excels the television programmes in the matter of coverage and broadcasting time.  Radio Éireann starts at 7.30 a.m. and continues until nearly 12 midnight. The hours of broadcasting were extended in recent years and this is a tremendous advantage.  Radio is a boon for people in rural areas who may not always be able to obtain a newspaper. I usually switch on my transistor radio every morning when Radio Éireann commences broadcasting.  Frequently a namesake of my own is on the air at this hour&mdash;I hasten to add for the benefit of the Minister that he is no relation in case the Minister might think I got him the job through influence. The newscaster is very efficient and I should like to compliment him, quite apart from the fact that it is pleasant to hear one's own name on the air.  This newscaster appears to have a responsible job and works very long hours because quite often if I switch <Col N="908" /> on my car radio at a late hour my namesake is still on the job.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann starts its broadcasting with a news bulletin at 7.30 a.m.  Later there is a programme commenting on items of news in the daily newspapers. Unfortunately, the news is not cheerful but that is not the fault of the announcers.  The service that is provided on Radio Éireann is excellent and it is much appreciated by many thousands of listeners, including the many housewives who can listen in during the day.  In the medium of radio we have made much progress in the extension of hours and in the type of programmes that are presented.</P>
    <P>On the political side there is a short programme entitled &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  This is one of the most popular programmes but as it is only 15 minutes on the air it is too limited.  The people who present this programme do their best to give a reasonably good and fair picture of the happenings in Dáil Éireann.  The programme should be extended at least to 30 minutes to enable the events in the Dáil to be reported at some length.  A long sitting of the Dáil, such as occurred yesterday, cannot be dealt with in a programme of 15 minutes and I would appeal to the Minister to arrange that this programme be extended.</P>
    <P>I have one word of criticism of Telefís Éireann.  There may be a little bias involved but it appears that certain Ministers get a lot of publicity about the replies they give to questions they are asked but mention is not made of the Deputy who asks the question. Very often it may be Deputy Tully, for example, who is involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They pick that up from the newspapers.  There is one evening newspaper that is very selective about giving names of those who ask questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I noticed that. Many people have commented that the version given to RTE is one-sided.  If a Deputy asks a question his name should be given.  I do not burden the House too much with questions.  I am not a great publicity hunter, but I should like that type of thing to be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> The Minister told us that 460,000,000 letters were handled in 1969, an increase of 2 per cent.  He also told us there was a fall in the Christmas mail last year.  This was due, of course, to the outrageous increase in the cost of stamps.  Most people got their backs up and decided to send no Christmas cards.  They wanted to teach the Minister and his Department a sharp lesson; an increase of 50 per cent in one fell swoop was just not on.  I was talking to people in two different sorting offices, quite a long distance from where I live, and they told me there had been a substantial fall in the amount of Christmas mail last year.  I think the Minister gave a figure of a decrease of 20 per cent but I have a suspicion the figure was much higher than that.  The Minister would have been wise to introduce a more gradual scale of increases, 10 per cent or 15 per cent in the first instance and gradual increases again subsequently. Successive Ministers have made the point that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs must pay its way.  Charges should be such as to enable the services to pay or, at least, break even.</P>
    <P>The postal service is pretty satisfactory. Letters get to their destinations pretty rapidly.  The Minister referred to motorisation of the service. We will all regret the passing of the old rural postman, with his bicycle and whistle, from the scene but time marches on.  These postmen were an institution.  They were a means of communication. They had all the neighbourhood gossip and, if someone died, they knew the time of the Mass and the funeral.  Most Departments have been motorised and it is understandable that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should follow suit.  Motorisation could be a boon to those living in remote areas.</P>
    <P>During the bank dispute the Post Office had many pressures on it and many additional headaches.  I have not heard one complaint about the manner in which Post Office staffs discharged their duties.  Large sums of money were deposited in post offices.  Anyone who has had experience of handling money knows what a work it is and post office staffs deserve every credit for the <Col N="910" /> way in which they helped people to weather the bank strike.  They were efficient and courteous and they earned the respect of all.  I should like to pay my humble tribute to them.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is the second largest employer in the country.  We are fortunate in having reliable, trustworthy staffs in our post offices.  They are entitled to good salaries and wages for a job well done.  We have not had any regrettable breakdown such as they suffered across the water.  It is impossible to put a figure on the damage that did.  A breakdown like that disrupts the whole economic life of a country.  I hope the Minister will always deal reasonably with his staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will continue to deal reasonably with his staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does not he will have people like Deputy Tully at his heels.  I am sure the Minister has the interests of the workers at heart. Deputy Coogan raised the question of privacy in post offices.  Most buildings are rather limited in area and sometimes it is well night impossible to carry out confidential business in private.  A room should be made available for the purpose of transacting confidential business.  If such a room were provided there would be a substantial increase in post office savings.  If one goes to a bank one can see the manager or a senior official in what is called the &ldquo;sweat room&rdquo;.  There business can be transacted in private.  This is not the case in the post office.  Some post offices carry on a subsidiary business to supplement their meagre incomes and it might be difficult to remodel these post offices.  I firmly believe, however that more money would be deposited in post offices, to the benefit of the Department, if people had this guarantee of privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of making a telephone call.  If there is a telephone on the wall and one wants to make a call one is sometimes asked to speak up.  Sometimes a person may be reluctant to speak up because he knows that his voice is being heard all round the building.  There may be curious neighbours about and old people who are <Col N="911" /> not used to telephones but who would like to see how they work.  There should be more privacy in these offices. It should not be beyond the competence of the Department to install equipment which would prevent a voice being heard all over the post office.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I must say that I have very few criticisms of the Department. Much progress has been made in all departments and this progress should be acknowledged.</P>

      <P>The Post Office is an odd mixture of the ancient and the modern. There are many human messengers carrying letters to people.  There is the technologically attractive business of bouncing messages around the world by satellite.  The labour-intensive and socially desirable postal service is uneconomic and the capital-intensive telecommunication service is very profitable.  This was recognised in the new structure introduced into the British Post Office system recently, in which each section is run by a managing director.  This has had excellent results.</P>

      <P>The postal service in this country is of a very high standard. Staff relations in this service could well set a standard for other Departments.  I wish to compliment the Minister for utilising the behavioural sciences such as sociology and industrial psychology to create greater job-satisfaction among the staff.  In considering the postal services, there are two principal aspects to be examined, namely, the costly labour-content and the uneconomic service which is being provided.  Over 75 per cent of the expenditure goes on staff charges.  As the volume of mail rises, so too must the costly labour force unless we begin to mechanise the service and effect labour-saving changes.  We must introduce modern letter-sorting offices in the larger centres, equipped with automatic letter-sorting machines.  In Britain in the 1980s there will be 120 fully-mechanised letter-sorting offices catering for the entire country and thus replacing 1,600 manual offices in use <Col N="912" /> at present.  There will be about 30 automatic parcel-sorting centres catering for all the parcels.  Under the present system there is much sorting and re-sorting.  This is labour consuming and costly.  Such a programme will require considerable capital investment. We must begin to plan for a time 20 years ahead, allowing for an accelerated growth rate.</P>
      <P>In this field, as well as in the telecommunications field, there is an urgent need to establish and maintain close technological liaison with other countries.  Research is being carried out in Britain at present on an optical character-recognition machine.  In other words a machine is being developed which will read letters and sort them into compartments.  Another labour-saving device is the erection of postboxes at entrance gates to houses and lanes.  As a student I spent many hours trudging up long lanes to deliver the <i>Cork Examiner</i> to various people.  I have no wish to deprive the people of their paper, but I feel it is unfair that postmen should have to travel up long lanes just to deliver newspapers.  In the long term it would pay the Department to subsidise the manufacture of postboxes and to have them mass-produced.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of time is spent by office staff issuing television and radio licences to old age pensioners. Much time would be saved by issuing certificates of exemption to these old people.  I do not think it should be the function of post office officials to investigate whether television or radio licences have been issued to people.  I am sure that a guard in uniform doing house-to-house calls in a particular area would prove much more effective in making people take out licences.</P>

      <P>The strength of the force should be increased.  There is need for improvement in many areas.  Only about 30 per cent of the total route mileage has been motorised.  The Minister should continue his efforts to modernise this branch of the service. The routes of the postmen should be <Col N="913" /> reviewed every two years.  Many postmen are being unfairly treated.  They are being paid a rate based on the number of houses and on the routemileage that existed five years ago. With the erection of many more houses their work-load has been increased correspondingly without any extra remuneration. I ask the Minister to examine this point and I would like to suggest that a simple procedure should be adopted in most cases.  There should be a recommendation from the area postmaster; this should suffice rather than having the entire route examined by district inspectors.</P>
      <P>Auxiliary postmen are getting an unfair deal.  Many of them have given their lifetime to the service for a mere pittance each week.  The question of their permanent appointment should be considered.  Regulations regarding the knowledge of Irish in that branch of the service should be dropped.  These people have to face retirement and old age without any security whatever.  The Minister has a moral obligation to provide a decent standard of pay and retirement benefits for them.  I ask the Minister for his views on this matter.</P>
      <P>In the Telephone Branch our aim should be to run the growing service without a great increase in staff and to improve and extend the existing services. The Minister says that in the 1969-70 financial year trunk-calls increased by 14 per cent and local calls by 2 per cent.  This year the growth rate expected is even greater, with trunk calls expected to go up by 12 per cent in the first half of the current financial year and local calls by 6 per cent.  Over the next few years the growth rate will escalate out of all proportion.  In Britain within the next two years the number of calls is expected to increase by 50 per cent over the 1970 figure of 27 million calls per day.</P>

    <P>Thus a person who wishes to break himself off the drug habit but feels that he has not sufficient will-power to do so unless he is in a security institution may be admitted to the unit as a voluntary patient.

In the light of the urgency of the problem could the Minister not agree to a temporary arrangement <Col N="921" /> pending the findings of this committee which is set up?</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether I would be able to agree to a temporary grade being created because, the Deputy knows, with the formation of the health boards it is absolutely essential to have agreement both with the management side and with the unions side as to what should be the grades of the enlarged health boards; how the staffs are to be redistributed; and as to how they are to be placed in relation to the enlarged health boards.  This matter relates not only to the quality of the service to be provided but also to industrial relations. In trying to have a changeover of a most complex type, from 27 health authorities to eight health boards, the Deputy will appreciate one cannot rush one's fences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural electrification programme was reviewed in 1967 and a programme was drawn up to complete the post-development scheme by 31st March, 1973.  The limit on capital expenditure on rural electrification was extended to £50 million under the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1968.  At the same time substantial reductions in the higher special service charges were introduced as from 1st June, 1968.</P>
      <P>For various reasons the demands for new connections in rural areas has proved to be higher than anticipated. This is due mainly to the substantial reduction in special service charges. Increasing prosperity and a growing demand for TV reception have also increased the numbers seeking supply. In addition, the progress of the post-development programme has been retarded by the need to devote an ever-growing proportion of the capital available for rural electrification to the strengthening of the distribution network to cater for the rapid growth in consumption.  The rate of growth in consumption in rural areas has been about 13 per cent per annum for some years past compared with about 9 per cent in urban areas.  Furthermore, priority must be given to certain new connections such as rural factories, hotels, registered guest houses, new houses being built by existing consumers and new installations for the mechanisation of farms.</P>
      <P>Proposals by the ESB which envisage completion by 31st March, 1975 are at present under examination by my Department and by the Department of Finance.</P>

This is a matter which requires further finance if we are to complete the programme by March, 1975.  It will be new information for the Deputy to learn that the Minister for Finance and I, together with our officials, are examining this matter closely at the moment.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of Women was set up on 31st March, 1970.  The commission has informed me that they are giving priority to the question of equal pay and that they hope to have an interim report on this subject completed by the middle of this year.  The question of sex-differentiation of pay scales in the Civil Service is only one aspect of the problem <Col N="930" /> of equal pay; the employment of married women in the Civil Service is part of the wider issue before the commission. These matters will be considered by the Government when the reports of the commission are available.</P>

      <P>As announced in the Budget speech in April, 1968, a comprehensive review of the tax system was initiated before any decisions were taken in relation to the introduction of the value-added tax.  This review extends to corporate and personal taxation as well as to sales taxation and it influenced the budgetary measures introduced in 1969 and 1970.  It is of course a continuing process under which the implications for the tax system as a whole of any further proposals for reform, including the value-added tax, can be adequately assessed.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24, and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for additional land a smallholder must reside within a reasonable working distance&mdash;normally <Col N="935" /> a mile&mdash;from the land being divided, be dependent mainly on land for his livelihood and own not more than 45 acres of good land or its equivalent in land of mixed quality.  In the selection of allottees, emphasis is placed on the farming competence of the applicant. Land may also be allotted to former employees on estates acquired by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In exceptional circumstances the Land Commission may allot amenity or accommodation plots to persons outside these categories.</P>
    <P>In the case of migrants, the main criterion is the suitability of the surrendered holding for land settlement purposes.  The standard form of purchase agreement signed by an allottee provides, amongst other conditions, that he will not sell, alienate, sublet, subdivide or part with the allotment until vesting has taken place and that he will work the land in accordance with proper methods of husbandry to the satisfaction of the Land Commission. The allottee also agrees that in case he makes default in any of the terms of the agreement, the Land Commission may recover possession.</P>
    <P>After vesting, the land would be subject to the provisions of section 12 of the Land Act, 1965, which prohibits the letting, subletting or subdivision of an agricultural holding without the consent of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <P>My Department are giving considerable assistance to the sheep industry both by headage grants on the farm and by export subsidies on mutton and lamb shipped to Britain at rates equivalent to the rates of deficiency payments made by the British Government to home producers.  The headage grants were increased by 50 per cent last year and were extended to lowland hogget ewes as well as to mountain lamb and mountain hogget ewes.</P>
      <P>In the mountain areas, where headage grants have been in operation since 1966, there is evidence that numbers are now increasing.  The extension of the hogget ewe grant of £1.50 to the lowlands since last year should, likewise, be effective in increasing numbers.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>Without accepting some of the implications contained in these Questions, I am, as I foreshadowed when introducing the Prisons Bill last year, in the process of establishing, in consultation with the Minister for Health, an interdepartmental committee to examine and make recommendations regarding the provision to be made for dealing with mentally disturbed people, including those who come in conflict with the law.  Certain difficulties which arose in finding suitable persons to carry out this important investigation have now been largely overcome but I think it only right to point out that the subject is so complex that it would be unrealistic to expect any recommendations for quite some time, and certainly not in a matter of a few months.  I should also like to make it clear that this will be an informal committee which will be advising me privately, possibly from time to time as they come to conclusions on different aspects, and that a formal report for publication is not envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is a very complex problem.  However, I was not just concerned with the problem of what the Minister appears to believe is a category of the mentally ill.  I was concerned with all of those people who come in conflict with the law and the acceptance of the general principle that all people are responsible. A group of forensic psychiatrists, people with a special skill and knowledge, could help the courts&mdash;who have the final decision&mdash;in deciding on the <Col N="948" /> treatment for the individual, whether he is considered to be mentally ill or classed as a normal criminal.  Is the Minister going to confine his inquiries to the mentally ill or will he confine them to the whole question of criminality?</P>

I am anxious at all times to ensure that the most deserving on the waiting list get whatever houses are available.  I do not think a special case could be made here because there may be others much more deserving who would be by-passed by the persons mentioned by the Deputy if they were given special consideration.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of budgetary consideration.  There were delays, which I could not have envisaged in making final decisions in relation to the budgetary matters.  These matters include the amount of grants to be made available to health authorities. The only information I can give the House at this moment, because the grants have to be distributed according to a given order among all the health authorities, is that since the final details have been worked out a supplementary estimate to be taken the week after next covers the cost of increased remuneration for health staffs.  If their increased remuneration had been apportioned as between State grant and health rate expenditure on the same basis as is normally the case the automatic increase in the health rate to cover the debit balance on the 1970-71 account would amount to an average increase in the rates of 3s in the £. In fact, the whole of the cost of remuneration increases is being met by a State grant.  That will be some consolation to the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that. I said that the £4.85 million Supplementary Estimate for my Department prevents health authorities from having to provide a debit balance from the year 1970-71 representing the increase of remuneration which was not foreseen by them, quite naturally, in the estimates which they struck for 1970-71.

Last year the Minister mentioned 2s in the £. This year are we to assume that the figure is 2s, 3s or 4s?

    <Speaker pid="GerardCott" hpid="Mr. Cott Mr. Cott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cott</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the need for advanced planning.  I mentioned that in Britain within the next two years the number of daily telephone calls is expected to increase by 50 per cent over the 1970 figure of 27 million.  The number of telephones is expected to increase by 50 per cent up to 18 million.  This is to happen within the next two years.  In this country applications for telephones increased by 17 per cent between 1969 and 1970.  The waiting list last year was over 14,000 people.  I dread to think what the situation will be in another year or two.  The facilities at the moment are not able to cater for the number of telephones in use throughout the country.  The existing trunk line service is greatly overloaded. The exchanges here are not alone overloaded but antique in action.  This is due to low investment in the past.  The bulk of the equipment is of a type which was first produced in America in the early 1900s.  If we are to remedy the situation we will have to instal ultra-modern machines.  The electro-mechanical cross-bar type is now used extensively in Britain.  The answer to our problems may be coded modulation. Such a system enables 24 conversations to be held simultaneously over two single lines.  If such a system were introduced it would greatly lessen the overcrowding which exists on the circuits at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here in Dublin one has to spend half an hour dialling continuously trying to get through to a particular number.  The position is much worse if one is trying to get a West of Ireland number.  Sometimes they are totally inadequate.  If we were to introduce some form of electronic exchange these calls could be re-routed to avoid congestion, breaks and the like.  Capital investment needed here is very high and our resources very limited but I urge the Minister to plan quite a few <Col N="960" /> years ahead.  We can do this gradually. If we are starting new exchanges or converting exchanges it will help to lessen the burden.  Our planning has been piecemeal when we are supposed to be modernising a small branch line, for example, we find the equipment being used is completely out of date. This situation should be remedied.  We cannot afford expensive research facilities, nor does the size of our system warrant it, but we can benefit from research in Britain, America and Japan which are highly modernised.</P>
    <P>I believe that French technicians are being brought to this country to work here.  This is a very poor reflection on the Department because I know many of our own technicians abroad would very much like to come home but cannot get employment with the Department because of the present recruiting system.  This must be changed and we must also send our technicians abroad for advanced training.  Unless we do this we are only throwing away money in piecemeal development.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to extend the programme for the erection of kiosks in rural areas and in high population centres.  In replying to many Parliamentary questions the Minister has pointed out that there was a phone within a mile or two of the particular area in which I was interested.  The Minister must admit that a mile or two is a very long distance in an emergency. There should be no village without a public kiosk.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell very long on Radio Telefís Éireann about which much has already been said but I want to ask the Minister what are the prospects of erecting television boosters so that people in the west and south may receive BBC broadcasts.  It is inequitable that people on the east coast and in the midlands, for the same licence fee should have a much better service than those who are unfortunate in their geographical location in the west and south.  Instead of introducing colour television, which few can afford, I suggest the Minister should instead extend the present range of service. There has been much criticism of the importation of canned programmes from America and the criticism is <Col N="961" /> completely justified; these programmes are an insult to the intelligence of ordinary men and women.  Why cannot we have more Irish-based programmes? Irish artists enjoy a very high reputation abroad and surely, instead of having them working in New York and elsewhere we could avail of their services to produce first-class home-based programmes?  Arrangements should be made with the Abbey to televise Irish plays for showing on the home network.</P>
    <P>I must disagree with one of my colleagues who strongly criticised Frank Hall who is much maligned of late.  This is most unfair.  He is providing a very valuable service, high-lighting many social injustices, and if he upsets people at tea-time I must point out that if these people were to go around the country and visit the very high percentage of dry toilets which exist they would have reason to be upset.  He is acting, one might say as a national ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a brief tribute to Liam Nolan for his thoughtful and balanced programme on radio.  He deals with matters of public interest and his presentation is to be commended. There has been much talk about the political bias in RTE and a few speakers made the point that the Minister should try not to exert political influence on them.  I appreciate that when they come directly under his control, as they are virtually at the moment, it is hard to sit on the sideline but in the long run I think justice and fair play will always prevail.  I wish the Minister a happy time in his Department and express the hope that even a few of the ideas I have put forward will bear fruit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words especially in regard to the whole make-up of the Department which is not the most progressive Department with due respect to the present Minister. Since he came into office I have not seen any signs of a new image of the Department or where the Minister has imprinted his own progressive image on it.  I see it as an outdated Department, certainly not aware of the needs of the time or the needs of the future.  If we take the attitude adopted <Col N="962" /> by the Department in regard to a request for a telephone it is disturbing to find this attitude still pervading a Government Department to this day in regard to a telephone which is such a great necessity.</P>
      <P>I know of a case of a journalist who needed a telephone very urgently.  He applied almost eight months ago for a telephone.  He found he would be expected to wait a considerable time.  He just told me today that according to the engineer's report the cable situation had been resolved and they expected to instal the phone within the next month or two.  He says: &ldquo;I suppose this is something but coming eight months after my application it is hardly satisfactory.&rdquo;  This is a journalist for the national press who requires a phone not as a luxury but as a necessity. On that basis alone I can only condemn this Department for its slow inactive attitude.  I have had occasion to seek a phone and I found the Department far from helpful.  I am wondering what the waiting list at the moment is for Dublin city.  We are talking about the competitive age in which we live, about different industrialists requiring phones urgently because they must meet this competition. I know that any business that seeks a phone is always told there is a long waiting list.  I have had to make representations on behalf of doctors to see if they could have a phone installed without delay, and there always was delay.  Is this Department that deals with the installation of phones here to meet present-day needs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the case of the Department of Social Welfare, one Department which is constantly beseiged with requests, perhaps, for benefits and so on.  They are in an appalling way for phones.  When I put a question down to the Department of Social Welfare about this I was told the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were responsible. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs said they placed the order in 1969 with the contractor but that it would be late in 1971 before the phone would be installed.  This is an astonishing situation in this age when there are firms that could supply such <Col N="963" /> equipment at a phone call's notice.  You could send a telex to Japan and I could guarantee that you could have in Dublin the equipment by air freight within one week.  Firms in Britain, Germany and elsewhere are very anxious to supply this much-needed equipment.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary for the Department of Social Welfare arriving, and I have no doubt he will concur with me when I say it is a situation that should have been tackled.  It is not good enough for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to say that the contract was placed in 1969 but it would be 1971 before they could supply the much-needed equipment.  It seems from the gestures of the Minister at the present time that he is not even aware of this fact.  This is all the more deplorable because the Minister should be aware of the conditions existing within the Department of Social Welfare where you may ring for any time up to three hours without getting a reply. Deputies who are constantly in touch with this Department are aware of the shortcomings here and of the need for the provision of up-to-date equipment. I hope the Minister will be able to come through with an answer for me on this.</P>
    <P>I do not see in the Minister's speech any reference to the number of people on the waiting list for phones at the end of 1970, but there were 11,000 people at the end of December, 1969. This is not good enough for a Department which calls itself progressive. It should have been obvious to those who would have been planning for the years ahead what percentage increase to expect judging from previous years. The increase was 21 per cent greater in 1968-69 than in the previous year, and the Department should have geared themselves to a similar if not a greater increase for 1970-71.</P>
    <P>While I am on this question I might mention the telephone directory.  Anyone who uses a telephone directory knows the ordinary telephone directory will not last longer than four or five months.  The way it is printed and bound is appalling.  If you go looking for a phone book you will find it in a terrible condition long before the half year is out, never mind the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> This was brought to the attention of the Minister last year and the year before, and no attempt was made to improve the binding of this telephone directory.  I have found in the rooms of this House three telephone directories which have pages missing already and this is only March, so I wonder what they will be like before the year is out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the number of mistakes made this year are greater than last year.  A very important hospital department in Jervis Street has the telephone number of a small café in Capel Street.  People are not able to contact it and this café is inundated with calls which are intended for the hospital.  The Post Office telephone service is important, and looking through the telephone directory I do not find the information as readily available as it should be.  We are told the Department have done everything to improve this, but information on the emergency services and other services should be more clearly printed and available at the beginning of the book than it is at present.  I find fault with it because I cannot find the information I require at an instant's notice. It is buried somewhere in the green section at the beginning of the book, but I cannot find it when I require it.</P>
      <P>I am being critical because people are constantly in touch with me about the bad phone service.  People are dissatisfied with the phone service in Dublin.  Something has gone wrong with the system.  You may find yourself very often on crossed lines.  People are paying very heavily for the phone service nowadays, they are entitled to a good service but they are not getting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other matter in relation to the telephone is the account.  People are often inclined to put aside bills when they arrive, knowing there is a second one coming.  However, &ldquo;final notice&rdquo; is in very small print and people do not realise it is the final notice until they are disconnected.  I found myself in the position of having my phone disconnected. <Col N="965" /> I did not pay my bill on time. When this happened to me in 1967 I looked at the account and found that &ldquo;final notice&rdquo; was in very small type. I got on to the director and asked if these words could be printed diagonally across the card.</P>
    <P>Now, in 1971, that is still not done. I found that a number of business houses who inadvertently overlooked paying their accounts had their telephones disconnected.  I can appreciate that it would not be feasible to have people telephoning from the telephone exchange to tell a subscriber that his bill has not been paid.  In my case, I was very annoyed because patients were trying to get in touch with me and this caused some embarrassment. Perhaps I am seeking the ideal situation but I think that a subscriber who has had a telephone for a number of years but who overlooks paying his account on one occasion should be telephoned and reminded of his account and asked whether he wishes to have the telephone disconnected.  At least, some alternative to the present system should be found.  The final notice should be printed in bold red type.</P>
    <P>We have to deal each year with a different Minister.  I do not know who will be in the Department next.  I often look on this Department as a training ground for Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I should like to rectify some of the defects in the system.  A Minister who would have any vision or imagination would devote himself to shaking up this Department. I would like to see the Minister making his mark in this Department because there is so much to be done.  He should not be led by the Establishment but should insist on the defects being remedied.  Too often we find Ministers in charge of Departments who are not imaginative and who <Col N="966" /> have no vision or drive.  I had high hopes for the present Minister but I have read his speech and there is nothing in it but a rehashing of the speeches of previous Ministers.  In my estimation, the Minister has fallen down considerably.  Unfortunately, when we do not have men of initiative and drive in Ministerial office, we do not get the work done.  I had envisaged the Minister bringing forward proposals for turning this Department into a semi-State corporation, a corporation of which every branch would be improved but there has been no evidence of this.</P>
      <P>I should like to discuss the question of a post office for Ballyfermot.  I have asked time and again that a post office be provided there.  In this area there is a community of about 45,000 people but they are being treated very shabbily by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  There is a small grocery shop there which houses a small post office.  It is not possible to send a telegram from that office and certain other facilities are not available there either.  Despite the efforts that I have made on numerous occasions to have a post office provided in this area, this has not been done. In November, 1969, I asked for the establishment of a branch post office at Ballyfermot but the Minister told me it would not be justified.  He said that a full range of postal counter services were available in the two sub-post offices in the area and that these were adequate to deal with the business normally transacted.  Although Ballyfermot is bigger than Waterford city, which has three post offices, we have not one proper post office there.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is the reason for not providing a post office in this area.  As far back as 1957 the then Minister, Deputy Blaney, initiated an investigation into the matter.  As a result of that investigation, he told us that facilities were not adequate but nothing has been done since.  The then Minister said that the congestion was caused by a temporary shortage of staff and that steps were being taken to avoid a recurrence.</P>

    <P>I do not know whether the present Minister knows where Ballyfermot is situated but I would expect him to <Col N="967" /> know and I would expect him to know also where the sub-post office is situated. Undoubtedly, the services are far from being adequate and it is not good enough that the population of Ballyfermot should be deprived of proper Post Office facilities.  In 1969 I said that Ballyfermot had a population equal to that of Waterford City but it is now greater than that of Waterford city.  There are constant queues of people outside the sub-post office.  I went there myself recently to recheck on the situation and I found a long queue of people there.  If they wish to send a telegram they must use the public telephone and this can cause much inconvenience.</P>

      <P>When I raised this matter on the Adjournment at one stage the Minister was surprised that I should do so and he expressed the view that I was abusing the privileges of the House.  He said that, from what he could learn, the people of Ballyfermot were not dissatisfied with the situation there in regard to Post Office facilities.  However, in a recent issue of a magazine that is circulated among the community, one resident is reported as having said that when he saw a building being constructed in the area, by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs he was very pleased because he thought it was a new post office but, however, he was very disappointed to find that the building was to be used only as a sorting office for Ballyfermot.  When I raised this matter on the Adjournment of the House the Minister told me also that he had checked within his Department but had found no records of requests from tenants' associations for these facilities. He said that the facilities in the post office there were overtaxed only on days on which children's allowances were paid but he said the same difficulties arise in many other post offices. The former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Lalor, said that he was aware of Ballyfermot and that <Col N="968" /> he knew the area.  However, he seems to have overlooked one point.  He was suggesting what the people in Ballyfermot should do if they wanted to send a telegram.  This is interesting.  He suggested that they should call into the post office, count the words on the telegram, find out what it would cost, get the change, and go outside and put the money in the phone box.  If that is an example of the facilities provided by the Post Office it is deplorable.</P>
      <P>He also said something about having an investigation made into it and that he would check on it.  He said there were means of checking on the number of telegrams sent from this coin box and that the indications were that not many telegrams were sent from Ballyfermot.  I do not know how you could check on the number of telegrams sent from a coin box.  The Minister said he had looked into it. He said that in coin box telephones in kiosks every telegram sent is recorded on a slip and that there was no problem for his officials in supplying him with that information.  He said that the facilities were available to him but he did not say if any investigation was made into the number of telegrams sent.  I should like to have that information.</P>
      <P>He said that as far as he could as-certain there was no demand for this service but it is constantly being brought up by the community association. All the residents in the area want it.  I live on the edge of this area. Were I attempting to send a telegram from a post office this is the one I would go to.  These facilities are not available.  What is wrong with Ballyfermot that we are left out?  The Minister said that if a further investigation of the use being made of coin boxes for the purpose of sending telegrams showed a need for this facility, there was no problem about providing the service.  I want to ask the Minister now has an investigation been made?  If so, what was the result?  If there is a need, will he meet it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to discuss the recent increase in postage rates.  We were duped by the Department.  A 50 per cent increase was granted without proper notification.  We then had a further increase to the equivalent of <Col N="969" /> 10d on Decimal Day.  The Minister said that the postal services are losing money.  At the moment the Minister is destroying the postal services.  He is also making it more and more difficult for small businesses to survive.  He is making it difficult for the normal person to use the postal services since a stamp for a letter costs 10d.  This is the highest rate in Europe.  Having regard to all other factors including the cost of living, we are way ahead of any other country in Europe.  It is more expensive to send a letter from Dublin to Galway than it is to send a letter from London to Manchester.  I do not see why there should be such an exorbitant charge for posting an ordinary letter.  We are making it more and more difficult for people to use the postal services.</P>
    <P>If this demand for higher and higher rates for the postal service continues it will be priced out of existence.  I do not know why the Minister is attempting to do this.  If a business firm keep raising their prices they will have to close down finally, and that is what will happen to this section of the Department, with disastrous results.  At Christmas a determined effort was made by the public to resist these increases. This effort had its effect and there was a reduction in the number of Christmas cards sent.  The Department were very slow to reveal the figures but it was obvious that there was a considerable drop at Christmas.  The public should keep up this pressure throughout the year in an attempt to force the Minister to bring down prices to a realistic level.  We are not getting the service we expect.  If a letter costs the equivalent of 10d we should get a proper service.  If the service needs to be streamlined this should be done immediately. After improving the service it should be possible to post an ordinary letter for approximately 7d or 8d. We now see the second-class postage rate being used for private and confidential letters.  This is dangerous.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Post Office must make money.  The Department should consider ways and means of expanding the money order and the postal order services and other ancillary services.  This would enable the Post Office to enter into competition <Col N="970" /> with the banks.  People who have money on deposit in the Post Office should be issued with books of money orders or postal orders for a certain amount so that they could use the Post Office as a cheque book service.  In the States the private banks operate what is called a checking service.  You put your money in the bank and you have a checking account, not a current account.  If the ordinary person put his money into the Post Office and used it as a checking service, the Post Office could make a considerable amount of money.  They could enter into competition with the banks, and they should. Instead of going to the banks for a draft people could go to the Post Office.  They would be encouraged to put their money on deposit in the Post Office if this system was employed.</P>
    <P>We were very slow in not availing of the bank Giro system for the Post Office.  We should not have handed it over to the banks.  In the case of a Government service a Government Department should deal with it.  We should not have been put off by the fact that it was said in Britain that this system was no good.  In other parts of Europe it has worked admirably and there is no reason why it should not work here.  The Minister is a man of imagination and vision.  He might consider introducing this system into the Post Office.  If he did, one section could make up for the deficiencies of another.  The postal order and money order services could be expanded tremendously and this could offset losses in the postal services.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are encouraging more and more people to save through the Post Office.  I have seen two of their one shilling machines, but I should like them to encourage more group savings schemes in factories. Would it not be much better for people to use the Post Office deposit section for paying off debts rather than handing the job to private individuals who take over the payments for householders in many parts of the city?  This kind of thing would be of tremendous service to the community and would bring more and more revenue into the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Devlin Report in relation to his Department <Col N="971" /> was being carefully studied.  I should like to know the outcome of the study and what the Minister will decide to do.</P>
    <P>Television reception in city areas like Ballyfermot and Drimnagh is very poor.  I know this is not the fault of RTE but when people pay licence fees they are entitled to a service.  When the voltage drops it should be the responsibility of RTE to see that it is corrected.  Some people are without television from 6 p.m. and from what I understand it is due to excessive demands on the ESB supply.</P>
    <P>RTE are maturing.  We are getting well-balanced programmes.  I should like to comment on a &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; programme which was broadcast last week.  I think I can justifiably say that it was inaccurate and not properly re-searched. It portrayed life in Ballyfermot and it aroused the anger of the people there because this community, like any other working class community does not like a stigma attached to it. A stigma will be on the children of the people of Ballyfermot as a result of this programme.  The programme portrayed the youth of Ballyfermot as a cider drinking community.</P>
    <P>When I heard this programme was to be broadcast I rang up the authority and asked if they wanted any information on Ballyfermot.  I live in Ballyfermot and I know it very well.  They did not, however, contact me.  I think they should have contacted the public representatives who work in the area. They put the programme on without consulting the people concerned and they have done a great deal of harm.  If anyone from Ballyfermot applies for a job the chances of getting it, if he is in competition with people from other areas, is not good, because a stigma is attached to the youth of this area.  It takes years to eradicate this kind of thing.  Certain sections of this city like Cabra and Drumcondra have had a stigma for years.  RTE have done untold harm to the people in this area and I do not think they have a right to do this.  I have seen instances of cider drinking in various parts of the city but knowing the community of Ballyfermot as I do I would deplore this <Col N="972" /> type of presentation, which has a very traumatic effect.  People say to me now: &ldquo;That is a right area you serve.&rdquo;  I have no hesitation in indicating the personnel of &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; for this programme.</P>
    <P>I listen to the radio from early each morning and I am much impressed with the standard of broadcasting.  Radio Éireann involve many people, from many different parts of the country, in their programmes.  Such programmes will encourage people to take an interest in community life and community development in their local areas.  The Liam Nolan hour is the most popular radio programme today.  This man has done some magnificent work.  He has espoused many good causes.  It is a pity that he is not being given an opportunity to do the same thing on television.  People are asking why he is not being given an opportunity to do so and certainly I for one would like to know why he is not.  A man with his talents should not be deprived of an opportunity of appearing on television. I hope the authority will take this into account.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; is a very controversial programme.  It serves a very good purpose in Irish life today. It gives many sectors of the community an opportunity to voice their views. Some people say it is a mini-Dáil and in many ways it has done much more than this House in portraying various aspects of life and showing up injustices. When the farmers discussed their problems on television they rightly said that they were being given an opportunity on television to discuss agriculture which had not been given in this House.  That point was very well taken.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see any attempt made to curtail or subdue this programme even if it does at times speak out on issues which are not popular. What does it matter if people get annoyed?  Different people get annoyed on the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo; each week.  The programme serves a very useful purpose in that it interests the whole community in various aspects of life.  Certainly I did not know of some of the problems affecting sections of the community until I watched the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> I understand that under the new Broadcasting Bill an attempt may be made to curtail this and other programmes which speak out very forcefully on issues.  If we are to be deprived of programmes like the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo; freedom of thought will be abolished, and this is dangerous.</P>
    <P>On the question of Irish I hold a view which may not be very popular. While I was at school all subjects were taught through the medium of Irish&mdash; even Latin, science and physics.  There were not Irish translations for some of the scientific terms and in these cases our teachers had to coin the Irish words we used.  Perhaps it was the compulsory approach that made me antagonistic towards Irish and I realise now that this is a pity.  It will take a long time to overcome this inbuilt antagonism.  Telefís Éireann must remember that many people share this feeling of antagonism and the approach they adopt to this matter must be gradual.  They must not try to bombard us with programmes in Irish because in this way they may stiffen the antagonism that many people have.</P>
    <P>Many people who can speak Irish find that they cannot follow the Irish news bulletin on television each evening at 7.55 p.m. I can speak Irish but I cannot follow the news.  It may be that the announcer is speaking too rapidly and those of us who are not fluent in the language cannot understand what he is saying.  The authority might consider this matter with a view to encouraging people to listen to the news bulletins in Irish.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the &ldquo;Buntús Cainte&rdquo; programme continued.  The programme was popular with those who did not know much Irish.  In many cases the lack of knowledge of Irish on the part of parents meant that they developed an inferiority complex when they could not answer questions put to them by their children.  Consideration might have been given to the presentation of a morning programme on the Irish language on Telefís Éireann.  In this way parents could learn the language and be of help to their children.  A morning programme <Col N="974" /> giving some basic fundamental knowledge of Irish would serve a useful purpose and would go a long way towards restoring a love of the language.</P>
    <P>As politicians, it is natural that we would wish to see more political programmes on television.  Telefís Éireann may say that there is not a great demand but I have found even at medical meetings or other discussion groups that the main subject of conversation is politics.  People may not like politicians but they are vitally interested in politics and we should have more political programmes on television.  Programmes setting out what happens in the Dáil and giving details of the Bills and other matters that come before us would be of interest to many people and would be valuable to young people from an educational point of view.  I am sure other Deputies will agree with me when I mention that young people who visit Leinster House are extremely interested in the proceedings of the Dáil.  I have addressed meetings of schoolchildren and invariably they ask many questions about our Parliament. Telefís Éireann have an important role to play in providing educational programmes on this subject.</P>
    <P>In the country the radio is still very popular and the programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; is listened to by very many people.  It may not be so popular in the city where television is the favourite medium.  Having regard to this, more background work on a political programme for television might serve a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that advertising of cigarettes will cease as from 1st April. The advertisements still appear in the newspapers but the impact of television is much more considerable.  I am afraid much damage was done when cigarette advertisements appeared on the screen. I consider we were justified in pleading with the Minister to have these advertisements banned.  Television advertising has a powerful impact and we must be careful to ensure that proper standards are maintained.  Originally a body was set up to ensure that a certain standard was maintained and <Col N="975" /> that incorrect information was not given in advertisements.</P>
    <P>The association between drink and leisure is not good.  Advertising of alcoholic beverages does much harm in so far as drink is portrayed as the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing.  We are encouraging our young people to drink at a time when alcoholism is a major problem in the country.  I do not think the taxpayers would object to making a greater contribution towards RTE if they knew that drink advertising would be phased out, as has happened in the case of cigarette advertising.  None of us wants his children to grow up thinking that alcohol is a necessity.  It is not right to encourage it.  The law is lax in that no proper checks are made to ensure that people under age do not obtain drink in public houses.  Is it any wonder they seek after it when they are told in advertisements on television that it is the right thing to do?  Those under age follow the advice and the example given in television advertising.  It is no use imposing regulations and making laws to prohibit certain age groups from obtaining alcoholic liquor when they are encouraged by television to do exactly this.  What is the use of saying that smoking kills your taste for life when immediately afterwards cigarettes are advertised in association with athletic prowess?  The Department of Health is not doing its duty when it does not demand a complete ban on this kind of advertising.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that we must pay for television.  It is no good the Minister saying television must be self-supporting.  It is a very important medium of communication.  The sooner we face the fact that the Exchequer must come to the help of television the better it will be.  Money must be provided for proper programmes. Penny-pinching is quite wrong.  The sooner we realise that, the better. Television must be allowed to expand. Talking in terms of cutting back is a very pusillanimous approach.  If licences are not increased then money must be made available from the Exchequer to subsidise television.  Recently it was stated certain programmes would be dropped and staff would become redundant.  This is not the right <Col N="976" /> approach.  We must get our priorities right and make money available to Telefís Éireann.  With the limited resources they have they have produced some magnificant programmes.  Programmes on current affairs have been excellent.  They operate on a shoestring compared with Britain and other countries.  We all say we do not want canned stuff and that more home-produced programmes are essential but, unless we are prepared to provide the money for them, we will not get them. This is something we should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister said colour television will not be available for some years.  I am not very enthusastic about the idea of colour television.  I suppose we must move with the times but we should wait and learn from the mistakes and the research in other countries before we launch out into colour television. I should like to see more involvement of the people in the country in television programmes.  Such involvement is very important.  Television should not be Dublin orientated.  It is not good to have it too centralised.  I should like to see the people in Mayo, in Donegal, in Cork and Kerry regularly involved in television programmes. Their opinions are important. They should certainly be involved more in current affairs programmes.</P>
    <P>Advertising on television is dangerous. I believe it raises the cost of living and contributes to inflation.  Competitors will spend more and more on advertising thereby increasing the cost of the products they produce.  People are encouraged to buy luxuries.  That can have a harmful effect on the economy generally.  Perhaps it is the reason why our hire purchase debt is so high.  We should remember this and have another look at advertising on television.  Attractive advertising encourages people to go into debt.  Hire purchase can be quite an evil and a menace to those who cannot afford it.  At the moment I am trying to rescue a man who is being sent to prison for non-payment of a hire purchase debt. He was encouraged to invest in certain articles through television advertising. The articles were repossessed and now the father must go to prison for non-payment <Col N="977" /> of a debt.  The Minister for Justice will say that it is for contempt of court, but the fact remains that television advertising has contributed to this situation.  That is not a good thing.</P>
    <P>I wonder to what extent can the Minister interfere in television.  How much pressure can Ministers apply to have their own speeches reported so fully?</P>
