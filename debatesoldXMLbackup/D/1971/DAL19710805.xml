      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £99,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The activities of the Department of Taoiseach are not very extensive as such and, as the House is aware, this Estimate is normally the opportunity for a general debate on Government policy.  I propose to give a general indication of economic trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present period marks a critical and decisive phase in the affairs of our nation.  The developments of recent years and the events now unfolding will <Col N="3374" /> shape the course of our future progress for many years to come.  One obvious example is membership of the EEC, an event that can profoundly affect our future.  During the past year negotiations on our application for entry have made substantial progress and now appear to be approaching a successful conclusion.  These negotiations have been the subject of recent debates in the House and of a series of questions from week to week and I do not think it is necessary for me to discuss this matter in any great detail at this juncture.</P>
    <P>However, it is appropriate to record that since the last debate satisfactory proposals have been agreed on in regard to one important aspect of our negotiations, namely, our concern for the future of the motor assembly industry and its adaptation to other activities in order to ensure continuance of employment in that industry.  In the case of fisheries it is gratifying to note that the EEC countries recognise our position and Britain, as a fellow applicant, has favoured our approach to the solution of this problem.  We hope when negotiations resume in the autumn that this problem, as well as the few other outstanding problems, will be resolved satisfactorily.  The main outstanding problems are in connection with land acquisition by non-nationals and the continuance of our industrial development incentives.  It appears certain that during the next Dáil session we will see the climax of these events, during which the nation and the Oireachtas will determine the pattern of our future relationship with the neighbouring states of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland is another area where events are of crucial importance for the future of our country.  In the past two years we have discussed the Northern situation on a number of occasions and it has been the subject of frequent comment and questioning in this House.  Again I do not propose to deal with the subject in any great detail at this juncture.  I need only repeat that it is the wish of the Government, and the wish of the majority of the Irish people, to bring about a future in which our country will be united and peaceful.  The way to <Col N="3375" /> achieve this goal is not through any form of violence or force but through the development of friendship, goodwill, respect and understanding among Irishmen of all traditions.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the attainment of these results will be a long and arduous process since the task of reconciliation between estranged communities is not accomplished by instant or imposed solutions.  The people of the South recognise this and I believe, in calmer moments, the overwhelming majority of the people of the North recognise it also.  The tragedy is that some people get caught up in the heat and hatred of the moment and are deflected into the use of physical force.  The most urgent and most practical step forward is for all people, North and South, to avoid the passion of circumstances. Violence can only delay the reforms which every fair-minded person agrees to be necessary, reforms to which the Northern minority would be legitimately entitled, whatever their sources or form of government might be.</P>
    <P>The third area in which events have important implications for our future development is that of domestic, economic and social development.  These areas are, perhaps, of more immediate impact in the sense that they are within our control to a greater degree and also because they can lead to more immediate results.  Last year, when speaking in the debate on the Adjournment, I said that inflation was the most urgent problem facing us.  At that time prices were rising at a disturbing pace. Moreover, there was no prospect at the time of an early improvement because the cost factors which push up prices, notably wages and salaries, showed no signs of reversing their upward trend. It was clear that a continuation of that situation would have created severe unemployment in the short term and would have seriously undermined the longer term prospects for improving the living standards of our people.  The Government, as a matter of priority, sought to correct this pattern of spiralling prices and costs.</P>
    <P>The first essential was to moderate the pace of increase in wages and salaries.  This is not an area in which <Col N="3376" /> any democratic Government can produce lasting and worthwhile results. Ultimately a degree of understanding and co-operation on the part of employers and employees is needed.  The National Wage Agreement of December last was the culmination of the prolonged and complex negotiations which took place in the autumn months.  This agreement was welcome because it marked the first step towards reducing the pace of inflation.  It was welcome also because it gave evidence of an understanding that, whatever differences there might be as between sectional interests on other matters, all parties had a common interest in curtailing inflation.</P>
    <P>I might say in this respect, particularly for the benefit of the leader writer in today's <i>Irish Times</i>, that we did not withdraw the Prices and Incomes Bill because we were afraid.  I should like to remind the House and those who make facile comments in matters of this kind that we have always supported, and always will support, free negotiations in matters of wages and salaries.  As I have indicated, the position at the time was serious.  The inflationary situation was serious.  For several months we watched the efforts, the very notable efforts, of the Employer/Labour Conference to produce a wage increase formula to commence at the beginning of this year when the then current wage agreements were coming to an end.  It was only after several months, when these negotiations broke down, that the Government introduced their Prices and Incomes Bill as an alternative, an alternative, I might say, that we did not ourselves welcome.  I should like to remind the House again that it was only after the introduction of that Bill and after the Government had shown their determination to put that Bill through in the absence of agreement that the parties came together once more and it was only at the express request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that we ultimately agreed not to proceed with the Bill.</P>
    <P>We did not withdraw the Bill until a wage agreement had been satisfactorily negotiated.  There was no question of withdrawing or running away <Col N="3377" /> from anything.  It is not our wont to do these things.  No matter how unpopular measures may be if those measures are, in our opinion, in the best interests of the country we stand over them.  In the months since the agreement was signed the Government were conscious of and welcomed the dedicated manner in which both parties to the agreement, and especially the Irish Congress of Trade Unions&mdash;I say especially the Irish Congress of Trade Unions because I recognise the particular difficulty they have in this respect &mdash;worked so successfully to maintain that agreement and to operate its terms.  For our part we have sought to reciprocate this goodwill.  The Budget, for example, was designed to continue the damping down of inflationary pressures and, at the same time, ensure that employment and living standards would be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>In terms of the price record to date it might seem that there is little to show for these steps since price increases have been substantial.  However, it now seems reasonably certain that we have got over the peak period of price rises and that further increases will be at a more moderate rate.  In the 12 months ending mid-November, 1970, prices had risen by 10 per cent. This peak was again recorded for the 12 months to mid-February whereas the increase for the 12 months to mid-May of this year was 8.5 per cent. Some Opposition Deputies naturally, in their own interests, suggested that there was no sign of any such improvement. Deputy Cosgrave, for example, said several times that decimalisation had caused what he described as a prices explosion, but the figures I have just quoted indicate that there is no evidence of this.  There may have been in some instances undue rounding-up of prices but, by and large, the trend of price increases is now in the right direction.  One factor which has caused prices to rise recently at a somewhat faster rate than expected has been the trend of food prices in the United Kingdom market.  Naturally the consequence of that was better prices for our agricultural exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Another consequence was that meat prices here also rose.  The boost to farmers' incomes resulting from these higher food prices is both to be desired and welcomed and I hope that view will be shared by Deputy Clinton.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that, although a further slackening in the rate of price increases is expected in the coming months, the resulting picture is not a fully satisfactory one.  The level of price inflation is still uncomfortably high and it is essential that we continue our efforts towards reducing this level during the next year.  We have been able to escape the harmful effects which inflation has on employment and on exports largely because our main trading partner, the United Kingdom, has also been experiencing severe inflation during the past year.  This has given us the necessary breathing space within which to put our own house in order.  It is important that we should use whatever time we have to the maximum advantage. We cannot expect other nations to experience inflation indefinitely and we must, therefore, see to it that we are able to trade competitively.  An indication of the narrow margin of safety is shown by the trend in our trade statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first six months of this year, imports showed a rise of £66 million over 1970 whereas exports rose by £37½ million.  As a result, the trade gap increased by £28½ million, but it must be said that part of that rise is explained by the purchase of two Jumbo jets which account for £20 million of that increase.  Because of the volatile nature of some categories, it is too early yet to make a reliable forecast of the balance of payments out-turn for 1971 as a whole but it is expected, excluding the exceptional aircraft item, that the current deficit will show some improvement on the 1970 level of £62 million.  Such a deficit does not present any immediate problem because of the high level of external reserves.  Moreover, deficits of a substantial level are <Col N="3379" /> to be expected because of the large volume of foreign investment which is now taking place, because this investment calls for heavy imports of capital equipment.</P>
    <P>The present level of deficit is, however, too high for comfort and it is important that the drive for increased exports should continue successfully in order to reduce this deficit to a more tolerable and sustainable rate.  A lowering of inflationary pressures and the containment of the balance of payments deficit are in turn a necessary precondition for a more rapid expansion of the economy.</P>
    <P>The signs are that the recovery from the sluggish performance of 1970 is now well under way.  As yet, there are no official data on the actual level of industrial production this year.  However, the results of business surveys suggest that output will show a reasonable expansion this year.  Investment, likewise, shows signs of this recovery. Imports of capital goods for industry have risen significantly so far while revival in building activity following settlement of the cement dispute has continued.  Consumer spending for the early part of this year has been advancing more or less in line with national output and this is a very healthy sign.  When consumer spending lags behind growth in output it dampens down business activity or, as is more common nowadays, when spending increases more rapidly it adds to inflationary pressures which may ultimately call for corrective Government action.</P>
    <P>Overall, the pace of economic recovery is broadly in accord with the pattern expected at Budget time and there are grounds for, as the Central Bank put it recently, cautious optimism about the coming months.  The attainment of a faster rate of economic growth is an important objective in its own right, given the present day expectations and desire for higher living standards, but economic growth has also important social implications. Foremost among these is the effect it can have on unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Emigration has stayed at the comparatively <Col N="3380" /> satisfactory figure of last year while industrial employment increased by some 3,500 in 1970.  This is a slower rate of increase than that recorded in the two previous years and is a reflection of the slower economic growth of last year.  It is the Government's wish to expand employment as rapidly as possible and to do this it is necessary that we quickly regain a more rapid pace of economic growth.</P>
    <P>Here it is worth noting that industry is at the present moment short of skilled workers despite the presence of many unemployed people.  Some hundreds of vacancies for workers, mostly men with particular skills, have been reported to the National Manpower Service and have been circulated not only through the network of our own employment exchanges but also among Irish organisations in Britain.  This has culminated, I am glad to say, in the return of some scores of emigrants. However, this is far from enough.  We are still short of certain industrial skills and as economic recovery proceeds and development plans materialise, demand for skilled workers will increase still further, substantially so in some cases.</P>
    <P>To expand the supply of skilled workers in this field in the future, we have allocated more money for training. An Comhairle Oiliúna&mdash;AnCO as they are called&mdash;are now making the necessary arrangements, including negotiation with the trade unions, for the harmonious acceptance into the skilled work force of the newly trained workers that the country will require.  I am sure Deputies will join with me in urging that all concerned &mdash;AnCO, employers, trade unions and individual workers&mdash;will co-operate in seeing to it that shortage of skilled workers will not impede industrial expansion and better job prospects for all.</P>
    <P>Parallel with the stepping up of training, the National Manpower Service, whose nucleus of placement staff has been recruited and trained during the last few months, is being developed. These officers have taken up duty in selected centres and are now familiarising themselves with the manpower situation in their areas.  Some of them <Col N="3381" /> have already been active in cases where workers were under notice and have been able to have many of the workers involved placed in other jobs.  I was gratified to hear Deputies recently pay tribute to the members of the new service. It is the intention of the Minister for Labour to cover the whole country when sufficient placement officers have been recruited.  I hope that before long we will have a first-class service of job placement, information and guidance, available to our workers, a service which will be of immense benefit not only to our workers and young people but also to employers and personnel managers of firms who in the future will be seeking more skilled and better equipped people.</P>
    <P>To complete the improvement in our manpower services there is the legislation which has just been enacted to increase benefits for redundancy payments very substantially without any increase in the contribution rates.  We are experiencing a degree of redundancy in certain sectors at present. There are a number of reasons for this, such as changes in consumer demand, intensified competition and the response of industry to the demand for adaptation.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate that some measure of continual change and adaptation is becoming a permanent feature of modern industry.  The worldwide tendency towards freer trade in industrial products may have served to accelerate this process in some industries but it is wrong to regard our trading relationship with other countries as the main source of redundancy problems.  The pace of technological change, the rate at which new products and new processes pour from the laboratories and drawingboards is, I believe, the underlying cause of this change.  A firm may not wish to adapt themselves to changes in manufacturing techniques or in market conditions since such adaptation may result in some redundancy, but failure to act could result in the firm being faced with total closure later on.</P>
    <P>The solution, then, is not to delay the necessary action but rather to ensure that the problems which redundancy creates are satisfactorily resolved. <Col N="3382" /> The increased benefits provided under the new legislation are designed to ease the short-term financial problems of displaced workers.  The training and placement services are intended to speed up and assist in the process of finding fresh employment.  It is obvious that this task of resettling redundant workers will be most successful when the overall level of employment is high and new job opportunities are plentiful.</P>
    <P>A more rapid rate of economic expansion is thus necessary so that we may cope not only with the long-term structural shift from agricultural to industrial employment but also with the more short-term problem of redundancy. A stronger economy also provides the essential underpinning for expanding and improving social services and facilities.  Here, despite the difficulties of the past year, further improvements did take place.  In the health sphere, for example, additional facilities became available for the care and treatment of the aged and the handicapped. In housing, building continued at a record level, marred only temporarily by the loss of production due to the cement dispute.</P>
    <P>In education the provision of new school and college facilities also continued at peak level to cater for the record enrolment of pupils and students.  Social welfare payments were increased and extended in coverage to aid more effectively the weaker sections of the community.  These achievements are gratifying but the Government are impatient to secure even faster rates of progress in the future.  For this to be possible it is necessary, of course, that the financial resources become available and this can only be done if national prosperity and wealth are increasing. If our expectations about the course of economic events are realised then we would approach 1972 with a sound basis for fresh initiatives.  In the field of incomes it would be our hope that arrangements could be negotiated for the period succeeding the present national wage agreement which would provide both a faster rate of increase in real incomes and a further lowering in the rate of price inflation.</P>
    <P>It would be our desire that any such <Col N="3383" /> arrangements would continue the trend towards improving the position of the lower paid and weaker sections of the community.  I know that trade union leaders and workers are genuinely concerned about the improvement of the position of these lower paid workers, but it would be tragic and self-defeating in its purpose if when the lower paid workers improved their positions, the better off workers then tried successfully to maintain the differentials between them.  Satisfactory arrangements in the incomes sphere would create the necessary climate for an expansion of industrial output, particularly in the vitally important export industries.</P>
    <P>An upsurge of industrial output and investment would be expected naturally to boost industrial employment. The emergence of these more favourable trends would enable the Government to shape their budgetary and related policies so as to complement and support such expansion.  Some of the retarding influences on business expansion which of necessity had to operate severely in order to cope with our inflationary problems could then be relaxed.  It would also be possible to accelerate development in such areas as housing and social services where further improvements must, because of financial considerations, depend on a vigorous and healthy expansion of the economy.</P>
    <P>Apart from the satisfactory arrangements for incomes increases the scope for strong economic growth would be greatly reinforced by a firm decision taken during 1972 by the people to enter the European Economic Community. Agriculture would be the sector which would most obviously receive an immediate stimulus from such a decision.  The knowledge that secure and profitable markets were available for all products would enable farmers to make the necessary plans and efforts for increasing output. Again, the Government, for their part, would ensure that advisory services, credit facilities and other supporting agencies would gear their efforts towards reinforcing this expansion in output.  Since entry to the EEC now <Col N="3384" /> appears so probable there are strong grounds for expecting that favourable agricultural trends would combine with a favourable industrial climate to present us with an unprecedented opportunity for initiating a sustained period of soundly-based economic growth.  This is a prize which we cannot and should not allow to slip from our grasp.  The decisions and actions of farmers, employers and workers over the coming months will play an important role in determining the wellbeing of the economy in future years. The Government for their part will direct their efforts and influence towards securing these results which will help to achieve the goals of ending inflation, increasing employment and raising the living standards of our people.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a moment ago the Government's desire to achieve faster growth in social developments and the relation of this faster growth to financial considerations, but not all the social developments which we desire are conditional on or delayed by financial stringency.  In several areas matters which have been discussed either inside or outside this House affect the interests of various sections of the community in diverging and sometimes conflicting ways.  In these cases, however impatient the Government or the supporters of change might be to introduce some new development, it is important to temper zeal so that the democratic process may function fully and effectively.  To do this calls for an adequate expression and examination of various viewpoints.</P>
    <P>In the case of health, for example, the introduction of the choice of doctor scheme has not proceeded as rapidly as we would have wished.  The delay of several months was necessary in order to deal adequately with the points raised by the medical profession and the eventual outcome may confidently be expected to be a more satisfactory health system than that which would result from any arbitrary or hasty solutions.  Similarly, in the case of education the discussions of the community schools proposals and developments in the field of higher education have proceeded at a pace which could perhaps <Col N="3385" /> cause impatience on the part of those anxious for change.</P>
    <P>Again, in an area of a more immediate political nature the White Paper proposals for reorganising the structure of local government have produced many conflicting or diverging views which must be adequately studied before a final pattern is determined. This list of examples could easily be extended but it is not necessary to recount all the possible topics which might be the subject of legislation or Government action during the next session.</P>
    <P>In each case there is the need to govern in a truly democratic way.  To do this it is not only necessary to legislate for the wishes of the majority, for this as we know can result in unreasonable repression of minorities; but we must also ensure that our laws give adequate safeguards to minority wishes without providing legitimate offence to the majority.  It has been, and will continue to be, the aim of this Government to implement their policies in this fully democratic manner.</P>

      <P>Fair enough.  This unity of approach underlies our actions in all political, social and economic spheres.  In this we have the full support of our party, a party united in their policy and in their purpose.  The separate policies which we have been and are pursuing, on the European Economic Community, the position in Northern Ireland, the reunification of our country, and domestic, economic and social interests, are not a random set of responses to different events; they are all part of the coherent and comprehensive ideal in which we believe and for which we work&mdash;an Ireland in which all its people may live and work in peace and unity, an Ireland which does not seek to stand apart from its fellow states but <Col N="3386" /> one which can fully take its place among the nations of Europe and of the earth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach endeavoured, in the early stages of his speech, to quote some statistics which appear to give the impression that price rises had abated somewhat and apparently expressed satisfaction that the pace of the increase had lessened somewhat, according to the figures he quoted, compared with the period in May last and the earlier figures quoted for February and November.  I do not know what later statistics the Taoiseach had, but the last information that was given to this House in reply to a question which I addressed to the Taoiseach on 1st July gave the percentage changes at mid-May, 1970, as compared with mid-May, 1971.  I shall quote only some of them.  The rise in prices has been phenomenal.  Beef prices, for round steak, increased by 14, 15, 12, 13, 14 and 16 per cent.  Mutton prices showed a rise of 8 per cent for a leg of mutton; mutton chops, nearly 9 per cent; cutlets, 10 per cent.  This is at a time when, as Deputy Clinton interjected, lamb prices have shown a catastrophic drop compared with last year.  There were other increases.  The price of men's clothing, heavy overcoats, lined, low-priced, showed an increase of 10 per cent; women's coats, again low-priced, 18 per cent; coats, medium-priced, 13 per cent; two-piece suits, low-priced, 17 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression that the Taoiseach tried to create was that the Government had intervened when they thought it was in the national interest to do so in order to contribute to the stabilising of prices.  What has been the direct Government action?  At least it might be said that the price rises to which I have referred were in the private sector.  In the case of motor taxation, which is directly attributable to Government action, there is a rise of 26 per cent; motor cars, motor cycles, an increase of 20 per cent; bus fares, an increase of 36 per cent; train fares, 24 per cent; motor insurance, 26 per cent. In respect of one sphere in which only the Government have responsibility for making changes, postal charges, there was the highest single rise that I can <Col N="3387" /> find on the list, 49 per cent.  That is the Government who have alleged that they are contributing to price stability, price stability in which the Government's own action was the biggest single factor in increasing prices.  Is it not correct to describe the postage increase as licensed robbery under statutory authority?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has the audacity to refer to what I described as a prices explosion.  Was it not a mild term for the increase in prices that has occurred in that period?  While that has been going on unemployment has continued at the highest rate in normal conditions when there are no external factors such as wars that have an impact on prices or on the economy.  In that situation the Government endeavoured to interfere and they altered the rate of unemployment benefit payable in respect of certain categories.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly expressed our concern about the dangers which flow and which must flow from the Government's unwise policies in industrial expansion.  The Taoiseach rightly referred to the increase in industrial exports, an increase stemming from and, indeed, almost entirely dependent on the tax concessions in respect of exports that were introduced by the late Deputy Sweetman on behalf of this party.  The fact is that our industrial exports have increased and that that increase has been primarily due to the special tax concession on exports. However, we now face the problem&mdash; and it is one of the problems to which we have adverted in the course of comments we have made&mdash;that if this country becomes a member of the European Economic Community, these assistance measures and the concessions in respect of export tax that have been available to industry will have to be phased out.  It has been our constant concern that no adequate alternative incentives have either been thought up or been proposed by the Government; in fact, they have been content to accept that these measures will cease and that industries that have depended to such an extent on the incentive value of these measures will have to face direct competition. <Col N="3388" /> It is obvious that the national wage agreement has advantages in endeavouring to get some sort of order into wage and salary adjustments, but unless there is real evidence that prices are being held down, then the chances of this agreement holding in the coming months is slim.  Here the Government's policy of drift and adopting <i>ad hoc</i> measures is not nearly adequate. It is a fact that the Government withdrew, under pressure, the Prices and Incomes Bill.  They recognised that that Bill as presented would not work, but at the same time they continued to implement in legislation, because industrialists and traders had not the same economic or compelling power behind them to resist the proposals, proposals imposing additional heavy taxation on industry, to such an extent that our rates of tax are now substantially higher than those operating in Britain.</P>
    <P>This is the situation in which industry faces the end of the transitional period under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  This is putting and has already put pressure on large areas of industry.  It has been reflected in the loss of some jobs and in the collapse of a number of weaker firms. However, that is only a prelude to the competition that must be faced when this country becomes a member of the European Economic Community.  It is in this industrial field that we need to re-think the whole structure of taxation and incentives, not to accept complacently that what was initially introduced 15 or 16 years ago as an enlightened progressive measure of assistance can be continued indefinitely or is suitable for continued application in entirely changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have emphasised repeatedly that the effects of joining the European Economic Community may provide opportunities but it will not provide an easy way out of the problems which face industry or, for that matter, any other section of the community.  We have repeatedly expressed our view that, if Britain joins, then, of the options open to us, because of our large trading interest with Britain it is in this country's interest to join as well.  That must be clearly decided in a referendum in which the issues must <Col N="3389" /> be put before the country clearly and simply.  This is an attitude that must be put before the people for separate decision in the light of information and facts on the basis of the terms that will be made available both to the Dáil and to the country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach dealt with a number of aspects of Government policy but there were certain aspects of Government policy on which he was silent and which, so far as this House is concerned, may have to a large extent passed without notice.  I have before me the report of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on crime for the year ended 30th September, 1969.  This is the latest report in respect of crime which is available.  I understand that the report for the year ended September last will shortly be available.  The figures contained in this report for the year ended 30th September, 1969, show a continuing and alarming increase in crime, and if one is to judge from people and from reports of cases before the courts for the period up to September last all the indications are that the trend shown in this report is continued. If we take the figures as presented in this report, giving the number of indictable offences for the years 1967, 1968 and 1969, we see a substantial increase. In 1967, there were 20,558 indictable offences; in 1968, there were 23,104; and in 1969, 25,972.  This shows an increase of 2,868 in respect of the year 1968 over that of 1967, and an increase of 5,414 in respect of 1969 over the total for 1967.  The number of offences detected is a continuing example of the effectiveness of the Garda force in respect of detection.  In 1967, 64 per cent of the cases were detected.  This figure dropped to 61 per cent in 1968 and the same figure of 61 per cent in respect of 1969.</P>
    <P>These figures show an alarming growth in the number of crimes committed. They emphasise, as an urgent national priority of Government policy and of national policy, the need for increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána.  The need for a new recruitment drive is clear.  In this field of national activity as in so many others the Government have let down the people of the country.  Of a total of <Col N="3390" /> 25,972 indictable offences recorded in the State in 1969, 15,200 or 59 per cent of the total were in the Dublin metropolitan area.  In the remainder of the State the number was 10,700.  The percentage increase in 1968 was 9 per cent in the Dublin metropolitan area and 17 per cent in the rest of the State.  If one looks at the figures in the category of crimes against property, with violence, which include burglary, house-breaking, robbery and malicious injury to property, one will see that there is a startling table in the Commissioner's report which shows that the number of these offences went up steadily between 1964 and 1969 from 4,282 to 7,563.  The figures up to September last will shortly be available. I have no doubt that the serious deterioration shown in the position regarding violence in respect of both public and private property will be evident from the figures between 1964 and 1970.</P>
    <P>In all cases the percentage of convictions obtained by the Garda Síochána is reassuring.  This shows beyond doubt that the high quality and reliability of this unarmed force has been maintained.  I want to put on the record again my conviction that this country has never adequately realised the debt that the community owe to the Army and the Garda.  When this State was in its infancy, the Garda, by discipline and sacrifice, secured the peaceful future of the State.  It is in this regard above others that the Government have failed to maintain the Garda Síochána at effective strength. The Government have allowed the strength of the force to be run down at a time when the safety of the State is under threat from forces of subversion and from self-appointed warlords who have never had to face an Irish electorate.  There is no basis of comparison between the trivial matters we have been discussing here for weeks and the acts of those who have been masquerading with arms, and firing shots and volleys.  I do not condone squatting in any form but it is trivial compared with these acts.  The Government have turned a blind eye and have refused to accept responsibility because they were pursuing their separate policies in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="3391" /> Party.  They were pursuing their separate policies&mdash;some doing one thing and others ostensibly doing another. &ldquo;Ostensibly&rdquo; is the operative word.</P>
    <P>The Government had not to deal with an Opposition that is conniving at disorder and disrespect for the law. Members of the front bench here were giving verbally their tacit approval to Government policy, while some members of the Government back benches were on the fringe of funerals because they regarded it as politically advantageous.  That is the difference between a patriotic, disinterested Opposition and a party who, in the Taoiseach's phrase, &ldquo;pursue the separate policies which we are pursuing&rdquo;. Is it any wonder that people now realise and are saying openly on all sides that we have no Government in this State?</P>
    <P>The Government has failed or delayed to redress the legitimate claims of the Garda in respect of pay and conditions of service.  It has failed to ensure&mdash;as we did when in Government&mdash;that there would be only one Army and one Garda force.  It has allowed illegal bands to parade, to train in armed camps, to drill, to shoot, to rob banks, and in one case to gun down an unarmed member of the Garda.  The Garda strength should be increased forthwith by at least 1,000 and, in order to provide extra personnel quickly&mdash;I know recruitment is comparatively slow and that the Civil Service Commission and other methods of recruiting for public appointments is a protracted business&mdash;a number of soldiers who are willing to transfer into the Garda force should be offered permanent positions.  Those who are prepared to accept such transfers could be assigned without delay for duty where need is greatest&mdash;in the Dublin area.  In this way the Garda force could be augmented rapidly.</P>
    <P>The reason I speak with such force on this topic is because of the effect that it has and may have in the future on the serious situation that has developed in the North of Ireland.  We have long recognised that the deep division between the two communities <Col N="3392" /> in Northern Ireland has always held within it the danger of a violent sectarian or intercommunal conflict.  Our view has always been that the problem could only be resolved by a peaceful resolution of the existing antagonism. We have always recognised, as has anybody who has seriously considered the question, how difficult such a peaceful solution must be.  The wrongs suffered by the minority in Northern Ireland go back over many years and the bitterness and resentment which they caused is deeply ingrained.  We recognise, as realists must recognise, that this bitterness and resentment cannot be wiped away overnight by a few last-minute reforms wrung under intense pressure from a patently reluctant Government.  The history of the reform programme in Northern Ireland is a sad record of &ldquo;too little, too late&rdquo;. Measures which at an earlier stage would have been accepted as reasonable and progressive are delayed so long or given so reluctantly that their value is vitiated.  On the other side, we must equally recognise the deep rooted and genuine fears and suspicions of the Northern majority.  While it is widely recognised that the <i>status quo</i> cannot be permanently maintained we must also recognise that there would be a determined resistance to any attempts by minority elements to use force to achieve what has not been achieveable by political means.</P>
    <P>For a long period there was some hope that despite all these difficult and seemingly near-irreconcilable positions some common ground might be found between those in each section of the community who wanted peace rather than violence, who were prepared to work constructively for the evolution of a more just and democratic society in Northern Ireland.  It may have been naïve to think that such a thing was possible, given all the past history of the present intense stresses within that community.  Unfortunately, recent developments seem to be leading towards a formal division of Northern society on sectarian lines which must be regarded as discouraging and seeming to lead us appreciably nearer to violence. The division of Northern Ireland into two groups openly hostile to each other, dedicated to each other's destruction, <Col N="3393" /> must be seen as a first step towards a civil war situation.  There are in Northern Ireland society evil elements which want to bring this about and which believe that their own ends can only be achieved by violence. These people are prepared to gamble with the lives of thousands of innocent people in pursuit of a policy which has never had the support of more than a tiny fraction of the people North or South of the Border.  These are people whose declared aim is the establishment by violence of a military dictatorship not just in Northern Ireland but in this part of the country also.</P>
    <P>The great danger of this situation, indeed the greatest danger of it when we face it at the present moment, is that those who believe in democracy and in the solution of political problems without violence, whatever their creed or political views are and whether they be from north or south of the Border, will fail to get together and act to defend the fundamental values of the vast majority of the people against the sinister threats of a small irresponsible group or groups.  If this country or any part of it is allowed to drift into civil war through such a failure to act strongly and courageously together, then the damage to the country's future will be incalculable. Let nobody think violence offers some kind of short cut solution to these problems and that it is possible to have a quick bout of bloodletting and that this will resolve these issues.  The events of 50 years should have taught us in this part of the country a lesson we should not easily forget.  The wounds of a civil war are slow to heal and when they do, the scars left behind can cripple the morale of a nation for generations.  If the present situation in the North drifts into a civil war it would be a civil war of such bitterness and savagery as to leave what happened here 50 years ago appear like a minor skirmish.</P>
    <P>Nor is it likely that such a conflict would be confined to the six north eastern counties.  On the contrary, civil war embracing the two communities in the north east of the country could hardly go on for long without engulfing the rest of the country.  I believe there <Col N="3394" /> is a dangerous tendency among many people north and south of the Border to take a fatalistic view of this situation. Many people, and comments in the Press and otherwise, envisage conflict as being inevitable and the problems as unresolvable.  To talk or accept that, particularly as Christian men with the gift of reason, is to me to refuse to face this problem fairly and squarely.  We cannot and must not accept such an evil as inevitable or any problem as unresolvable but in this the Government must be prepared to take initiatives which may carry a political risk at home in order to do everything possible to avoid such a conflict.</P>
    <P>It is in this regard that I want again to express our regret that ambiguity still surrounds the Government's attitude to this question.  The very phrase which the Taoiseach used, whether it was used deliberately or not, emphasised the lurking fear at the back of his mind that they are pursuing their separate policies.  This must have been abundantly clear in the Government's attitude to any groups in this Republic who openly advocate and prepare for violence.  There has been a long record over many years of compromising with the law when it came to dealing with these illegal groups. This party have consistently spoken out and acted against irregular activities. We believe the Government has a grave responsibility, transcending all other responsibilities of government, to see that the full resources of the law are fearlessly and unambiguously used to bring to justice those who in one way or another flout the democratically made laws of this country.  I am not talking about comparatively harmless&mdash;I do not condone them&mdash;offences of squatting.  This is an open challenge to the authority of this Parliament and to the authority of the institutions of this State and this challenge must be met and defeated with the resources of the people, with the people acting, speaking and defending their rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing in the present political situation is to keep a clear view of the long-term <Col N="3395" /> considerations of this national problem and to avoid being panicked into short-term moves.  We must try to resist any temptation for a short-cut out of the difficulties by neglecting to act fearlessly in the public interest however difficult this may be politically.  Certain people have openly declared that their purpose is to destroy this State by violence.  The overwhelming majority of the people have repeatedly made clear in election after election and through all the organs of public opinion and public information that they do not support this.  The soundest and surest way of retaining the support of the majority is by holding firmly to the just application of democratically created laws.  If under pressure the normal legal processes are suspended then those who seek to destroy those process will have achieved a large part of their purpose.  It is important, therefore, to make it clear that because we have refused to resort to internment in this part of the country it is not in any way taken or accepted as support for terrorism in the north or an unwillingness to apply the full rigour of the law to illegal organisations or unlawful acts here.  In this whole situation there is a fundamental division between those on the one side who believe they have the right to use force on their fellow citizens to impose political ideas which those citizens do not share and, on the other side, the vast majority of the people north and south who believe in the peaceful and democratic solution of political problems. It is here that the Government must make it clear not only by words but by their actions on which side they belong.</P>
      <P>It must indeed be obvious to those who take a longer term view of the situation in the North that it can only be resolved by agreement unless one accepts as an alternative the bloody struggle that I referred to a few moments ago between the two communities in which one finally defeats and virtually annihilates the other. That possibility must be so abhorrent to the vast majority of decent people that the search for agreement must be intensified in order to avoid the other outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3396" /> Such an agreement must involve, in the first instance, acceptance by the two communities in Northern Ireland of equal citizenship for all.  This will imply on the side of the northern majority accepting the need to build a radically new political and social structure in Northern Ireland to ensure not only that no new inequality between the two communities will be created in future but that the accumulated inequality of 50 years of injustice will be eliminated as quickly as possible. The legacy of 50 years of unjust government will not be wiped away by a few tentative and marginal efforts at greater participation for the minority.  It is too late for that.  Concessions which might have helped 20, ten or even five years ago are now only drops of water sprinkled into a furnace.  On the side of the minority there has to be acceptance of the fact that any effort to try to force changes in the present position of Northern Ireland can only increase the likelihood of conflict and decrease the possibilities of achieving social and political equality.</P>
    <P>In the present situation we in the Republic must work unceasingly to convince the majority in Northern Ireland that the welfare of all, Protestants and Catholics, depends on working and living together.  This will indeed be difficult and to some well nigh impossible, but it is the only way: there is no other road.  Only when a normal, just, democratic society based on full equality for all citizens has been established in Northern Ireland will it be possible to think in terms of seeking consent for purposeful and realistic changes to meet the aspirations of all sections in the community.</P>
    <P>The promoting of agreement and the avoidance of a bloody inter-communal struggle in Northern Ireland rests jointly with the British and Irish Governments.  It would be well for the British Government to recognise this clearly.  The Irish Government have it within their power to prevent any solution which they do not accept or which the minority in Northern Ireland do not accept.  No constitutional position in Northern Ireland can be made <Col N="3397" /> viable without the consent of the Government of the Republic.  If any lingering illusions still remain with the British Government that they can solve the Northern Ireland problem on their own by the use of their army for pacification, or by any other military or political means, then they had better drop these illusions quickly.  The fact that we are where we are after 50 years is the most conclusive proof that this problem cannot be solved by the British Government alone.  Some allegedly informed people thought it was unwise in August, 1969, but at that time I said &ldquo;The re-introduction of British troops is a step backwards that can never be welcomed here.&rdquo;  In the present circumstances in the Six Counties they appeared and they were accepted at the time as being a lesser evil than the `B' Specials.&rdquo;  I went on to say that this was the largest British army in the country since Dublin Castle surrendered to Michael Collins.  The fact that events have proved that the British Army are not acceptable as a peace-keeping force is now recognised widely, but the events of the past two years have reinforced that conviction and everything that has happened during that time has indicated clearly that the time has come for further discussion.</P>
    <P>During this debate I have no wish to quote from the many articles and the many comments that have appeared during recent months in the Press, particularly the British Press, concerning Northern Ireland.  Most of these articles are indicative of a similar attitude and I shall quote from one entitled &ldquo;Time for United Ireland&rdquo; which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of the 30th May, 1971:</P>
    <P>It is time to think the unthinkable in Ireland.  All administrators know that there is never a right moment for reform: if things are going badly it seems wise to wait till they have settled down, and if they do settle it seems a pity to disturb them. In the end, change is dictated by disaster.  Before that point is reached again in Northern Ireland, it is surely right to re-examine the idea which was explicitly in the British Government's mind when it divided <Col N="3398" /> Ireland in 1920, which (as a hope or a fear) has underlain the whole dispute ever since, and which is not necessarily wicked because it is now espoused by wicked men: the idea that in due time the North should be progressively reunited with the South....</P>
    <P>The final shape of a settlement of the Northern Ireland problem must involve a continuing joint guarantee by the Irish and British Governments of equality of rights and full social justice for every citizen in the North.  It must involve a joint responsibility by the two Governments to create and maintain a new constitutional position acceptable to the people in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.</P>
    <P>If that responsibility was assumed unambiguously and jointly by both Governments and if at the same time there was a clear and total commitment against unlawful and illegal activities on both sides, we would be faced at least in the right direction towards finding a solution, even if the process of evolving one is still a long, painful, and at times, frustrating activity.  Peace in Ireland can be secured only if the people accept the basic underlying fact that peace can come only when people recognise that the maintenance of such a situation depends in the last analysis on all sections realising that it must come with the consent and support of the governed.  The problem at present is not only the restoration of peace through justice but the overriding urgency of combining all sections of opinion, not least in the British political parties, that things can never be the same again.  This involves a new approach, an approach that is courageous and progressive, an approach whereby there is a willingness to learn from past mistakes and to forget past differences and whereby the aim will be that of achieving an acceptable solution that will ensure the safeguarding of the rights of all sections.  That has been emphasised in the article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> to which I have referred and I quote:</P>
    <P>Many people will regard overt discussion of Irish reunification as an encouragement or even a surrender to the men who commit murder in <Col N="3399" /> its name.  Yet the refusal to discuss it has not been an epic success either; and the uncomfortable fact remains that ideological terrorism has only been successfully held down in recent years by regimes prepared to be as uncompromisingly repressive as the Portuguese in Angola.  In Palestine, in Cyprus, the patience of the British authorities&mdash; for all their protestations&mdash;was outlasted by the endurance of the zealots.  The same thing happened to the French in Algeria&mdash;where the settlers' subsequent counter-revolt was not of the same durability.</P>
    <P>These parallels are not far-fetched. Northern Ireland is the last and most delicate of Britain's post-colonial involvements.  The colonial comparison will serve a little further, too. The classic unraveller of those tangles was the constitutional conference. Should not the device be dusted off one last time?</P>
    <P>I want to advocate that such an approach must be made sooner or later &mdash;better sooner than later&mdash;involving the British Government, the Stormont Government and all shades of Opposition or minority representatives and viewpoints in the North of Ireland and the Government of the Republic.  As this article said, Britain, in this regard, is arraigned before the world as the last remnant of colonial arrogance with the exception of the satellites under Soviet dominance.  It is not an unrealisable aim or an Utopian dream for the future: it is a <i>sine qua non</i> of peace now and progress in the future to hold such a conference: it is essential for the North of Ireland, for all schools of opinion in the North, for all persons regardless of what religious faith they may possess; it is essential for the Republic and, above all, it is essential for Britain.</P>
    <P>In the present circumstances a fresh effort should not be postponed.  The gravity of the situation and the absolute urgency of finding a solution must be obvious to the most committed, be their commitments religious or political. These facts outweigh all other considerations. Unless all sections of the Irish people&mdash;this cannot be over-emphasised&mdash;are prepared to find a <Col N="3400" /> solution to this last remaining political problem with Britain and ourselves, no one else will either provide us with a solution or point the road to a reconciliation of the political and other differences that divide us.  It is essential that parades of a provocative character in the North should get banned, that the Government there should have the moral courage to assert their authority in the interests of peace and harmony between all sections.</P>
    <P>These are only temporary arrangements for dealing with a problem that must, sooner or later, be dealt with at the conference table and which, if it is to provide this country with the type of situation and conditions to which all people and all sections in both parts of the country aspire, can only be secured through discussions and negotiations between all sections in the North, the Government here and the Government in Britain.  This, in our view, is the overriding political problem that faces us at the moment and must be faced in a realistic, purposeful fashion before it is possible to look with any confidence or hope to the other economic and social problems that are the subject of a debate such as this and will be the subject of comment and discussion by other speakers in the course of this debate.  It is an absolute priority to maintain the institutions of State here in order to convince ourselves and every section of the community, to convince those in the North, to convince those with whom we have been in negotiation and discussion in Europe, that we have secured the right to govern ourselves here and that it will be maintained by the people of this country with all their traditional courage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any of us would share the optimism of the Taoiseach in his review of the economy here this morning, certainly not the housewife, certainly not the unemployed, despite the statistics he gave when he dealt with the cost of living and with the employment situation. Neither would I share his optimism, needless to remark, at the conclusion of his speech when again he intimated that the Fianna Fáil Party were the <Col N="3401" /> right and the best party to govern and that the affairs of the country were safe in the hands of Fianna Fáil. This can be stated by the Taoiseach, but I believe that if his own backbenchers spoke their minds they would at least say that never has a Government in this country had such a low rating.</P>
      <P>Of course, the economic situation has been overshadowed by certain events, some manufactured or caused by the Government, others over which they have no absolute control.  In recent times the economic situation and debate on it has been overshadowed by the insistence of the Government and the Minister for Justice in this House on pushing through the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill.  Of course, the country also, without knowing a lot of the details, is preoccupied with thinking about and speaking in private conversation about the prospect of membership of EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill is concerned, in the normal course of events I would not expect that the Taoiseach would intervene at certain stages in order to show absolute support for the proposals of the Minister for Justice, but this was a different piece of legislation.  This was a piece of legislation about which people had deep feelings, where the deep feeling was demonstrated over a long period and particularly in the last few weeks by the Press.  The Taoiseach mentioned this morning the editorials in the <i>Irish Times</i> in particular.  He should also have a look, when he has time during a lunch break or some time tonight, at the editorial which appears in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I have not seen the <i>Cork Examiner</i>. There has not been any editorial comment from the <i>Irish Press</i>.  &ldquo;Not an Inch&rdquo; is the heading of the editorial in the <i>Irish Times</i>.  It has an ominous ring.  Without my having to quote from various parts of it I think it does, indeed, demonstrate the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party not alone towards the minority in this House who now happen to be the Opposition but to many other people as well.  That is the reason why I comment on the fact that <Col N="3402" /> the Taoiseach did not intervene nor did he make any mention of it this morning.  I do not think the Government have yet realised, certainly the Minister for Justice has not realised, the damage they are doing, the damage they have done, particularly yesterday, in going ahead despite opposition not alone from the people I have mentioned&mdash;the Press, Members of this House&mdash;but from the general public as well.  Mark you, the editorials are, in the main, designed, I believe to reflect the feeling of people in the country.</P>
    <P>The use of the guillotine, as I said last night, was scandalous for this or any Government.  There have been complaints about long speeches, particularly speeches by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and Deputy FitzGerald on section 4.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach, and maybe he would bear this in mind when the Minister for Justice or any of his other Ministers come in here to promote legislation in this House, that they should, as has been the practice up to recent years, stay for as long as they can in this House in order to hear comment from the Opposition.  I do not think it is good enough that we should have the attitude conveyed in this House by backbenchers of the Fianna Fáil Party that no matter what you say or no matter how long you take to say it we have a majority and we will steamroll this piece of legislation, this amendment or this section, through.  That is not, to me, indicative of democratic discussion.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Justice had listened to some of these speeches, and I do not believe he even read them afterwards, he might have had second thoughts, if not about all the Bill, about certain sections in it.  I think he would also have saved the taxpayers of this country the expense that I am pretty confident will surely be incurred when the constitutionality of this Bill comes to be contested in the courts. Here he had legal arguments as to why certain amendments should be made and certain deletions should be made. When this Bill comes before the courts to test its constitutionality the arguments of the two gentlemen I have mentioned&mdash;Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;and various other <Col N="3403" /> Members will be repeated at the expense of the taxpayers.  But the Minister for Justice, who is now in receipt of something like £6,500 a year, had not time to avail of the opportunity to hear arguments from people who get £2,500 a year.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the length of the debate.  People are shedding crocodile tears because we are sitting into August.  I have been in this House long enough to remember how long Fianna Fáil wanted to discuss certain legislation and motions, and how long they wanted to spend on Adjournment Debates over the past 25 or 26 years.  It was not unusual to sit into August.  In the first year of the first inter-Party Government the Dáil sat through the 6th, 7th or 8th of August&mdash;I forget which of those dates but it was at least until the 6th August.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party believe that, as soon as the month of August arrives, we should all shut our mouths and give them the legislation that is being discussed. We deprecate the use of the guillotine.  If time is running out, as has been suggested, could we not sit longer in the week?  Three years ago on behalf of the Labour Party, I suggested certain reforms to enable this Parliament to work much more efficiently and effectively than has been the case in recent years.  For example, we suggested that the weekly sittings should be longer. Particularly in the past five or six months the Government availed of every opportunity not to have a Dáil sitting on particular days.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that proposal should be given serious consideration by the Government.  The British Parliament sits from Monday to Friday.  Westminster can sit four and five days in the week and, if we are to have serious and effective debates on a measure such as the Forcible Entry Bill, we should give ourselves time and, as I said, the Government should not be shedding crocodile tears and throwing in the face of the Labour Party the staff of this House who are members of the trades union movement.  Of course, the Government forget their lack of concern for the staff during the <Col N="3404" /> long debate in May, 1970.  It was only because of the&mdash;I will not say insistence &mdash;persuasion by a Member of this party that some members of the staff got some compensation for the long hours they had to spend here, particularly the Official Reporters.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Government to accuse us of either filibustering or prolonging the debate because since it was introduced&mdash;if the first week in August was the deadline &mdash;they had ample time to have all Stages of the Forcible Entry Bill debated.  The guillotine has an ominous ring about it.  What I am afraid of is that in future somebody else, or the present Ceann Comhairle, will act as he did yesterday and refer back to the precedent of 4th August, 1971, in effect giving himself licence by referring to that precedent to do whatever he likes, or whatever the Government like, to stifle any contribution from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on the implications of the Bill but a few simple questions must be asked and have been asked in the editorials to which I referred: why the rush to get it through? Why go into recess now?  Why the deadline of 6th August?  I have a suspicion, which I hope can be disproved by the Taoiseach, that the Government want to go into recess and have a long recess so that they may have government by order or government by edict.  We saw a relatively small example of that&mdash;but with big repercussions for those involved&mdash;in the introduction of the order which completely wiped out the payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I also have a suspicion that during the Recess the Government or the Taoiseach may intend to introduce internment without trial.  I am asking the Taoiseach now to recall the Dáil in that type of situation.  If he has decided now, or if he decides during the Recess, that internment without trial should be introduced, that must not be done while the Dáil is in recess. It must not be done without adequate discussion and consultation within this House.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the economic picture has been more or less blotted out <Col N="3405" /> by certain events, including the prospect of Ireland becoming a member of the European Economic Community. We were regarded as being somewhat eccentric or troublesome over the past ten years when we expressed our opposition to Ireland becoming a full member of the EEC and when we expressed our fears about what will happen if we become a full member. We were ridiculed in the same way when the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was discussed during a special sitting of the House.  At that time we were told we were traitors.</P>
    <P>In recent months a Government Minister described those who oppose full membership of the EEC for Ireland as traitors and enemies of the country. Now we see that more and more people are becoming more and more concerned about our terms of entry.  It may be a little too late, because the Government have lulled many people into believing that, as soon as we become a full member, everything will be all right and that they would be very tough in their bargaining.  Of course that has not happened.  People are concerned, but the blase Minister for Foreign Affairs does not appear to be concerned and his attitude is reflected in the attitude of the other members of the Government.</P>
    <P>The trade unions of this country are concerned and they are the people who will be vitally affected.  Many of the unions are holding special conferences to make up their minds on what course of action they should take in certain eventualities.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to which the Taoiseach paid a fitting tribute this morning, will also hold a special conference. Whether or not the full terms of entry will be available when these conferences are held, I do not know. As I said, we were told that we were the odd men out, that we were the troublemakers, that we were against everything.</P>
    <P>The fishermen of Ireland are beginning to think now.  They are beginning to appreciate the damage that can be done to their livelihood by full membership of the EEC unless their <Col N="3406" /> interests can be protected.  The fishermen of Ireland are not irresponsible. They are certainly not affiliated to the Labour Party.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara, I am certain, have no affiliations with the Labour Party, but they also have expressed more than reservations about what appeared to be the terms that will be negotiated or are being negotiated, for fisheries in Brussels. Bord Iascaigh Mhara have said to the fishermen of Ireland, to the Government and to the Irish people that they should not give away their present fishing rights.  I think that is a very clear message which the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not appear to have got yet.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask him, if he intervenes in this debate, or the Taoiseach when he concludes, what is our position with regard to fisheries and to ask him the blunt question: Is there going to be a special deal for Norway? Will there be a permanent arrangement for Norway whereby she will have a greater limit than this country would have even during the transitional period?  It has been suggested that there would be a limit of six miles for this country and again we are not certain whether or not this would be a permanent arrangement or obtain only for the transitional period, although the attitude again of the Minister for Foreign Affairs as far as fisheries are concerned is, &ldquo;Look, let us agree to this, whatever it is&rdquo;&mdash;I assume he means the six miles&mdash;&ldquo; and then let us negotiate when we get into the EEC.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke in glowing terms about the prospects for agriculture, and I suppose that if one had regard to the weather and so on in the country over the past six months, one would say that as far as this year is concerned, the farmers can do pretty well, but apart from that, we who were the eccentrics and described as traitors and enemies of the State have now in our company, even though they may not share our opinions entirely, the National Farmers Association who are now not so enthusiastic as they were two or three years ago or during the period in which our application lay dormant in Brussels, because their <Col N="3407" /> president came back from a European farmers organisation conference and appeared, and I think said he was, worried indeed as to what would happen Irish agriculture.  He is concerned at the way the Irish negotiations are being conducted.  We were the odd man out 12 months and even two years ago, and I am glad to notice, from their speeches and from contributions made at their Ard-Fheis, that Fine Gael are also concerned about the terms of entry, and as far as I can gather&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;they have said that they will not make a final decision until the full terms of entry are known.  Our concern is also about the terms of entry because our economy frankly, in our opinion and in my opinion, is underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>We are concerned at the lack of a regional policy because above all the other countries, and particularly the applicant countries, there is none which needs a regional policy as much as this country does.  We want a regional policy in order that we can further develop this country and not run into what would be tantamount to industrial disaster.  It is ironic that in Britain, considered here to be a pretty well developed country industrially, the Labour Party is opposed to the terms of entry, again because of lack of regional policy, a regional policy that might be of some benefit to areas like Scotland, Wales and the north-eastern part of England.  They are also concerned at the lack of a regional policy and this is one of the reasons they made the decision the other day not to give their support until they saw the final terms.</P>
    <P>We have been chided also from the Fianna Fáil benches that the socialist parties of the EEC countries have not shown any opposition to EEC.  They are concerned&mdash;they are also concerned about regional policy.  There is no point in anybody telling us that the Treaty of Rome provides for such and there is nobody in the Community now pretending that there is one, in fact.  I would like, if we are being twitted about our socialism and our connection with the socialist parties of Europe, <Col N="3408" /> to quote two paragraphs from a document by the Italian socialists who appears also to be concerned about the way Italy has developed since membership of the EEC, but again without the application of a regional policy.  I quote from a submission of the Italian socialists at a congress of the social democratic parties in Russia.  It says:</P>
    <P>The customs union which has provided the great capitalistic companies with a larger market, thus enabling them to make better use of their production capacity than was possible on a national scale led to an intensive process of industrial concentration, and has also favoured temporary and permanent emigration on a massive scale from the economically depressed areas to the more developed regions without ensuring a substantial improvement of the social order.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The enormous increase in trade within the Community and with nonmember States which has facilitated the expansion of the European economy and helped to improve the standard of living of the European people has also widened the gap between different regions and social classes.</P>
    <P>It appears to me therefore that if there is not a regional policy and if that regional policy is not applied to Ireland, we may find ourselves in the same situation as parts of Italy and, as they now are, Scotland, Wales and even the West of Ireland.  If the Treaty of Rome provides for a regional policy, I think our negotiators should also press for this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed concern&mdash;at what stage he expressed that concern I do not know &mdash;when he announced recently that he had submitted a paper on regional policy and the necessity of such for Ireland.  Where that is going to go in the files in Brussels I do not know, but in any case I think we can legitimately criticise, from what we know from the Government, the way in which they have negotiated.  The Taoiseach this morning talked about negotiations and <Col N="3409" /> about the car assembly industry.  There are thousands employed there at present, and according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as far as their jobs are concerned, they will have a reprieve for so many years.  That is a good thing, but there are other industries in the country which are vulnerable and there is no indication from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, from the Taoiseach or from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the negotiators give a damn about the people employed in these industries.  It is not real negotiation. We were given to believe, as I said some time ago, that where an industry appeared to be vulnerable in a particular district, the Fianna Fáil cumainn were assured that there would be special negotations in order to get a good deal for them, in order to ensure that they would last.  It is difficult to know in any case how our negotiators are doing their job in Brussels and what sort of information they give to Brussels as far a the economy of this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have here a document, an information document, the product of the European Economic Community and perhaps the Tánaiste would try to get hold of it.  It is called &ldquo;The Facts&rdquo; and on page 22, there are tables giving, as they say, some international comparison figures for 1969.  This document has been produced by the information service of the EEC and it purports to give facts about the six member States and the four applicant countries.  I presume the facts in regard to Ireland were given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, therefore, they should know all about us.  How they can be aware of facts concerning Ireland if they are dependent on the kind of information contained in this booklet?</P>
    <P>On page 22 of this booklet there is an item headed &ldquo;Some international comparisons for the year, 1969&rdquo;.  There are errors in this but they have not been corrected.  We must not forget that this booklet is read by people in all countries in Europe, if not throughout the world, and it is certainly read by the Governments of the EEC countries and the four applicant states.  In <Col N="3410" /> this publication our gross national product is given as 3,000 million dollars; I have checked this matter and have found it should be 3.5 thousand million dollars.  Our imports for 1969 are given as 416 million dollars, instead of 1,413 million dollars.  This booklet gives Ireland's exports in 1969 as 203 million dollars when, in fact, they were 891 million dollars.</P>
    <P>Is this typical of the state of our economy?  I would suggest to the Tánaiste that he should look at this document and check if the facts are right or wrong.  I submit the facts are wrong, that the document should be withdrawn, and an apology should be demanded by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning of my speech I did not share the optimism of the Taoiseach so far as the economy is concerned.  Unemployment now is greater than it was this time last year. In saying this I am not armed with the statistics issued by the Department of the Taoiseach.  There have been so many fiddles and changes recently it is difficult to know in precise terms the number of unemployed.  However, I can see many more queuing up at the exchange in my home town, not with the prospect of employment but in order to draw the meagre allowance obtained through social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Of course, there was the fiddle in regard to the dole.  If the Taoiseach thinks there is less unemployment at the moment than existed last year he is mistaken.  In addition, redundancies are running at about 5,000 per year. None of us wants to gloat about this, on the contrary, but we read every few days in the newspapers about the closure of factories.  I know from investigation that this is the result of the decision the Government took in 1967 when they negotiated and signed the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  At that time we pointed out the industries that would be vulnerable and now we know we were right.  With regard to the textile and footwear industries, there is fear among workers and management about the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3411" /> I do not think the Taoiseach spoke about tourism but it would not be an exaggeration to say that so far as this industry is concerned it has been a disaster this year.  Again, we do not need to wait for statistics from the Minister for Transport and Power. From travelling around the country one can see there are not the same number of British or foreign cars on the roads or parked outside hotels.  I will not say the hotels are empty but there are not the same signs of the boom in the tourist industry evident four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>People may say that the northern situation has been responsible for this decline but this is not the complete truth.  To a large extent the blame lies with the Government, in particular with the Minister for Finance.  Visitors from Britain in particular do not find Ireland attractive any more.  What attracted these good spenders from Britain was the price of the pint, the bottle of stout, the bottle of ale, the price of spirits, of cigarettes and tobacco.  However, since the introduction of the wholesale and turnover tax it is no longer attractive for these visitors to come here.  I am not speaking about the people who bring over boats to sail on the Shannon or those who fish around the coast&mdash;although we are very glad to see those people&mdash; I am speaking about &ldquo;the chap with the cap&rdquo; who travels in a limited area and who looks forward to a few pints or a few half-ones at night time.  The responsibility for the decline in this sector of the tourist trade lies with the Government, and with the Minister for Finance in particular.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of marketing. I do not think it would be unfair to say that so far as publicising the attractions of this country is concerned we have had very bad marketing.  It was pathetic to hear the Minister for Transport and Power when questioned at the beginning of the year about tourist prospects saying that there was &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry and the Economic and Social Research Institute produce a quarterly report <Col N="3412" /> which does not bear out the optimism of the Taoiseach in regard to our industries. This report suggests that industry is working below its labour capacity and it states &ldquo;there is an increase in the number of firms who felt the level of exports was lower than for a similar period last year&rdquo;. According to this report a certain percentage of firms say they exported less in the first quarter of 1971 than in the quarter ended March, 1970.</P>
    <P>The figure of 5,000 redundancies per year was given by the Minister for Labour.  In the survey I have mentioned it is stated &ldquo;there is a more pessimistic outlook than any recorded since the survey started in 1967&rdquo;. Incidentally, I would point out there is no affiliation between the group producing the survey and the Labour Party.  I do not know whether we should believe those people who brief the Taoiseach or the people who are in industry who suggest that so far as the present year and the coming year are concerned the outlook is pessimistic.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say a few words about the north.  Before the Dáil meets again, unless the Taoiseach has a special session of it, he and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Heath, will have met.  I do not want to score any political points arising out of the questions that we had to the Taoiseach over the last two years but it seems very peculiar that last October the Taoiseach was in New York at the United Nations and there he met Mr. Heath and they solemnly decided they would meet again in 12 months time in October.  I cannot understand the reason for the delay nor can I understand the reason why it was kept such a secret because it was only when a question was tabled by Deputy John O'Connell and myself last week that we got this information.</P>
    <P>We have advocated this type of meeting for 18 months.  We remember the attitude of the Taoiseach when we questioned him about his proposed visit to the then Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Wilson, in May, 1970.  He did not appear to be too concerned to press for such a meeting.  However, I am not making any point of that nor do I intend to pursue the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3413" /> I want to say, as far as I and my party are concerned, if this mission is to promote peace and reform we welcome the meeting.  Unhappily it is true before this meeting takes place there will be a long and difficult period and there is likely to be further trouble, unfortunately of a grave character, because all of us recognise the significance of the date, the 12th of August and this can be a very dangerous date indeed. It can be most dangerous if the apprentice boys' parade is allowed to proceed. I, like Deputy Cosgrave, hope it will not be allowed because we know now the terrible dangers that could arise and we know the terrible trouble that occurred on a similar occasion two years ago.</P>
    <P>The danger of this situation was impressed on the members of the Labour Party who met them by the Social Democratic and Labour Party. According to the Taoiseach in his replies to questions he is also aware of those dangers and he says he has conveyed his concern about the holding of the parade to the British Government. We in turn have impressed on senior members of the British Labour Shadow Cabinet the danger there would be if this parade goes on.  We did this in the hope that if Mr. Heath decided that the parade should be cancelled he would know that the British Labour Party Opposition would support him and so offset any defections by right wing Unionists and their friends in the north of this country.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say, however, even if the parade is cancelled there still may be dangers and maybe for different reasons.  The march might be attempted.  We have seen things like that happen before.  Marches have been held even though officially banned. There are too many grounds for fearing that by October, when this meeting will take place, that the situation will be worse than it is now, even though all of us hope and pray that it will not be.  It might be suggested, as I have, that Mr. Heath and the Taoiseach might have met earlier.  When I say earlier I mean months ago but to insist now that they should meet between now and the 12th of August <Col N="3414" /> might have worse than negative results. If the result of such a meeting was the cancellation of the parade, the repercussions of this combination might be the reverse of what we want.  Frankly, none of us wants trouble, none of us wants to provoke trouble.</P>
    <P>I should say as well that in any case we should beware of expecting too much or indeed too little from this meeting between the British Prime Minister and our Taoiseach.  It is also fair to say that no Prime Minister, whether he be a Stormont, a Westminster or a Dublin one is in full control of the situation in the North or even of the will and the actions of either of the communities up there.  We know there are forces at work that have no respect for the three Prime Ministers, whether they be from Stormont, London or Dublin.  We have got to face up to that sort of situation and think much more about it than we have in the past.</P>
    <P>May I repeat, therefore, that we must not expect too much from this meeting?  Some of the Irish newspapers and the British newspapers seem to suggest that these talks could produce a formula for the unity of Ireland. They cannot do that at that sort of meeting no more than the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Hillery, could do it in August, 1969, when he made his submission to the United Nations Organisation.  Unfortunately, there were people at that time who were glued to the radio expecting&mdash;we did not&mdash;that as a result of that submission, as a result of discussion at that particular meeting, the unity of Ireland could be obtained.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising Deputy Dr. Hillery's effort at all.  All I am trying to emphasise is that the unity of Ireland is not and cannot be around the corner as long as we have the situation that exists there at present.  In any case anybody who hopes that negotiations between an Irishman and an Englishman can produce the unity of Ireland is indeed in grave error.  It will only be by negotiation and understanding between Irishmen themselves that unity will be produced.  The whole world can see how far we are away <Col N="3415" /> from that sort of agreement.  We are seeing now the result of an attempted settlement imposed over 50 years ago, a settlement which was unacceptable to one-third of the population in Northern Ireland.  Again, we have got to ask ourselves, particularly those of us in the South, what would be the result of an imposed settlement unacceptable to two-thirds of the population there.  These are questions we should think about more seriously than we have in the past because, as I have had occasion to say, we did not care about the North for decades until we had the civil rights marches three and a half years ago.</P>
    <P>We have also to ask ourselves if we want a north where one-third of the population are held in suppression.  We do not and we in the Labour Party feel deeply about this.  We have got to ask ourselves another question: Do we want a united Ireland where 1,000,000 Ulster Protestants would have to be held by force, whether by an Irish Army, a British Army or a contingent of soldiers from the United Nations? We do not.  Or do we want a solution on the basis of driving one of the two communities out of the North?  We do not.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we reject those outcomes, as I believe we do, then we must realise there is not an instant solution.  If it is unity by consent we want, then we should not demand a unity which the other party do not even want to discuss.  It is not because we desire the unity of the Irish people less than others.  On the contrary, we desire it much more, and we have reason to know more about the situation in the North than those who make more noise about unity.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement have shown how to unify workers for industrial objectives.  They have tried it during a long period of years and it has been a slow, painful process which has been interrupted now and again by those who, under the pretext that they are defending one or other of the communities, use the gun to terrify the others.  The very existence of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions testifies to a great deal of success by the trade <Col N="3416" /> union movement in the whole 32 Counties and I have seen my colleagues in the last three years demonstrate this at gatherings of the ICTU, specifically at annual conferences.  I saw it in July this year, I saw it last year and the year before.  I saw hundreds of Northern workers, the majority of them, I think Protestants, sitting for four days hammering out social and industrial policies not for the Twenty-six Counties but for the whole Thirty-two Counties.  There was no bitterness or acrimony.  There were Protestants and Catholics.  That is an example of how by dialogue and conversation we can unite Irishmen.</P>
    <P>The ICTU have been eminently successful in getting Protestants and Catholics together in a very difficult task, to unify workers on industrial policy.  It is very much more difficult on political questions and we have got to face up to it as Irishmen that in many cases we are not guided by our heads but by our hearts and that when political questions are raised we tend to become emotional.</P>
    <P>We hope that the emphasis in the discussions between the Taoiseach and Mr. Heath will be on reforms which will improve relations between the two Northern communities.  Specifically, the need is for urgent reforms, establishing Catholics for the first time as fully equal citizens with Protestants.  This requires that the minority have a share in political power proportionate to their numbers.  That cannot be ignored any longer because if it is the present system will collapse.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned about individuals in the Stormont Government.  The Social Democratic and Labour Party have produced such proposals but have withdrawn from Stormont until such a principal of proportionate participation is put into operation.</P>
    <P>There may be two points against that argument in favour of a share in political power proportionate to numbers as far as membership of Stormont is concerned. It may be said that any reforms suggested would arouse hostility among the Protestant community.  This is unfortunately true among some Orange-men but not true about a greater number <Col N="3417" /> of Northern Protestants.  Orange resentment is not sufficient to delay the principle of immediate reforms and the British Government should not be allowed to use this argument to delay reforms.  For our part, the Dublin Government should help the introduction of these reforms by reassuring Northern Protestants that they will not be forced against their will into an Irish State.</P>
    <P>The second objection may be that the time has gone for reforms.  This has been suggested by some people in recent days&mdash;those who say the present atmosphere of violence is not conducive to the type of reform I have proposed. Some say that the only solution is the gun.  I and my party have always resisted that.  What is the situation when one-third of the people in the North are against the present system?  What would it be if two-thirds were against it?  I do not think there is room now for a drastic solution by either side. All we can hope and work for is that the Taoiseach should insist on reforms which will allow Catholic and Protestant, however grudingly, however suspiciously, to get together on equal terms.  This would be a new departure for the North but it is the best hope for the people because the only unity worth having is unity by consent.</P>
    <P>I have tried in my contribution on the Northern situation to avoid scoring political points in this very grave matter.  However, there is one point I should like to relate to Twenty-six County politics and I propose to be very brief on it.  We in this party repeatedly and vehemently have been accused by Fianna Fáil, by the Taoiseach and Members of his Government, of seeking to promote violence and anarchy.  This is a suggestion which, seriously or in the heat of the moment, has been hurled across the House.  It was done particularly during the last general election campaign when we were accused of being in favour of revolution.</P>
    <P>If this were true we had ample opportunity of demonstrating it and exploiting it in the last two years.  All we had to do was to encourage the dissidents of the Fianna Fáil Party and to encourage and to incite members of other semi-political parties or organisations. <Col N="3418" /> We could have encouraged the dissidents in Fianna Fáil by whipping up mass emotion in denouncing a peace policy as national treachery. These words must ring ominously in the ears of Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House.</P>
    <P>We could have done that if we had been troublemakers.  The whole country knows we have never attempted, particularly in the last two years, to try to get a single vote through the courageous stand of the Labour Party. The Taoiseach and the Government know that we favour peace and persuasion, peace by persuasion.  He also knows we do not oppose him when he genuinely pursues a policy of peace. We have contributed towards all efforts to attain stability in a most difficult situation.  We do not want credit for that.  There is no political kudos to be gained from it.  Sometimes, in certain quarters, the contrary is the case. In view of what has been said, in view of this malicious criticsm and these malicious attacks that have been made on us, we have the right and I, on behalf of my party, have the right to demand that these slanders should cease and that the Taoiseach should ensure that they cease.</P>
    <P>Much more could be said about the North; much more could be said about the campaign on one side or the other or, should I say, on four or five different sides.  I do not propose to delve into these things here today and I hope that in the time left for this debate nothing damaging will be said by any Member on either side of this House which would aggravate the situation there, a situation which could become so explosive in a very, very short time indeed.  I hope that the meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Heath, will be a step towards ultimate peace and unity, not alone in the Six but in the Thirty-two Counties.</P>

      <P>I am talking about repetition on a far greater scale than anything the Taoiseach said.  The second purpose in prolonging discussion on a particular section of a Bill would be that Deputies might imagine that by doing so they may persuade the Minister responsible to change his mind.  It was perfectly evident at the end of two or three days discussion that the Minister was holding to his position.  A third reason for such a discussion on a particular section would be if, in prolonging debate, such an overwhelming public opinion revealed itself as opposed to a particular section that the Minister might, for political reasons, change the Bill.  But none of these things happened.</P>
      <P>I should like now to pose a question: what proportion of the people who read the Dáil Debates were reading any of the speeches made by Fine Gael and Labour Deputies on this section of the Bill after it had already been debated fully?  What proportion of newspaper readers, whose minds were not already made up one way or the other, were reading these prolonged speeches, with all their endless repetition, repetition wasting the time of this House?</P>

      <P>I was referring to Deputy Corish's remarks about the Forcible Entry Bill.  The Labour Party deliberately filibustered in relation to this Bill.  The public had ample opportunity, without any filibuster, for hearing all the arguments for and against the different sections of the Bill.  The democratic processes were fully availed of according to the best traditions and there was nothing irresponsible in our applying the guillotine.  The extraordinary thing was that, at the end of it all the Labour Party failed to vote in the last two important votes that took place here.  They disappeared from the House, by implication, according to the strict rules of democracy, taking no side one way or the other.  That may be recorded in history as an extraordinary <i>volte face</i> in their approach to this measure which is so urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke of the fear he had that the Government would govern by edict or order during the Recess. The Deputy, on the whole, made a constructive speech, but I wonder what he meant by that.  Was he trying to alarm the Irish people into believing that we would take over the country and exercise dictatorial powers?  The Deputy should know that we govern by legislation enacted in this House.  He knows the extent of the emergency powers that are in the hands of the Government; he knows all the legislation of that kind, which is very limited.  Why did he want to suggest that we were guillotining the Forcible Entry Bill in order to have a long Recess and during <Col N="3421" /> that long Recess abandon all concepts of democracy and govern by edict?  It was an extraordinary charge to make and very irresponsible on the Deputy's part.  He spoke very wisely in other ways.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that the Government must be able at all times to exercise any powers required to deal with unauthorised violence and that they are given powers by this House to do so. The Deputy should know all about this and there is no call to suggest that we would make use of powers that have not been derived from the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish also suggested that they were extremely responsible in that they did not whip up support in the country for violent policies in relation to the North for the sake of embarrasing Fianna Fáil.  I do not know to what he is referring.  The overwhelming mass of the Irish people both North and South do not believe in violence as a method of securing reunification and if the Labour Party engaged the whole of their powers and resources in trying to step up a policy of violence in order to embarrass the Fianna Fáil Party they would not have succeeded and would have done themselves a great disservice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the difficulties we faced in connection with the tourist industry.  I only wish to deal with one of the matters about which he spoke.  He said one of the reasons for our tourist difficulties lies in the higher prices that now exist for accommodation and other amenities required by tourists.  I was <Col N="3422" /> speaking to the Minister for Transport and Power the other day on this subject and as ex-Minister for Transport and Power, as far as I know it is a fact that prices for accommodation have increased but this country remains relatively in the same position in regard to price levels taken as a whole, as it did some three or four years ago when prices in European countries are compared. When I was Minister for Transport and Power there were habitually four countries in Europe where the prices were definitely lower.  This country came next.  Other countries either had slightly higher or very much higher prices.  It is equally true that prices in relation to the tourist industry are very much affected by inflation because it is a labour intensive industry and if there is inflation, relatively speaking, the hotel industry would be more adversely affected than other sections of the trading community.  I think I am right in saying that we hold the same relative position.  It is no good imagining that in the future, no matter what Government is in office, people will come to this country as a country which is cheap in terms of accommodation and amenities because that just will not be so.  We must make sure that value is given for money, that good services are provided for the money spent and that we do not lose our relative position in Europe in regard to this by having our prices skyrocket so that they no longer occupy the position relative to other countries that they have held up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reflecting on statements by Members of the Opposition suggesting that Fianna Fáil somehow in the last two years have not proceeded with the business of developing the economy and developing social and economic services.  The suggestion has been made that there have been massive discussions in the House in relation to matters affecting the Fianna Fáil Party and that the Fianna Fáil Government therefore have not had the opportunity of preparing and enacting legislation in order to ensure that the country develops socially and economically.  I was going through some of the measures enacted in 1970 and 1971 to show that this is a completely false statement.  There has been very great <Col N="3423" /> progress in legislation all of which is designed to enable the country to progress. We have had a number of Social Welfare Acts with improved scope in social services and increases in benefits and these increases have far surpassed increases in the cost of living since Fianna Fáil took office in 1957.  For example, the increase in maintenance allowances for disabled persons more than double the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Health Act under the auspices of my Department has been passed and it is resulting in tremendous administrative changes throughout the country with the object of having more efficient domicilary and decentralised services while at the same time preparing to face the inevitable changes that are taking place in hospital services through the growth of specialisation and the need for a far greater percentage of patients to be examined by a team of doctors with full paramedical equipment and services available to the patient.  We have seen further progress in the health services in the agreement that I have been able to make with the Medical Association and the Medical Union for the choice of doctor principle which will commence in April, 1972.  This will amount to a very much desired revolution in the world of those holding medical cards who receive medical services from general practitioners, particularly in city areas.  I am very glad to see the dispensary system disappear as it has existed for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="An Tánaiste Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of dispensary doctors are most dedicated men but they are working under absolutely impossible conditions.  I look forward to the choice of doctor resulting in a very great improvement of outpatient services.  We have also seen the development under the new child health services of the examination of infants of pre-school age.  I am gald to say that some 83 per cent of mothers of children of six months in the areas where this service operates applied for paediatric examination of the infant. <Col N="3424" /> Of those who took part in the service and examination, some 13 per cent of the infants required further examination, indicating the very great value of that new service.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, as the House knows, has raised the limit for social welfare insurance and I, as Minister for Health, have similarly raised the limit for those who have limited eligibility service in relation to health.  We have had a Housing Act in the last two years which contained many provisions.  It enabled the Minister for Local Government to concentrate on the development of private housing at more reasonable prices and offered further scope for the whole of the housing programme.  We are now building houses at the rate of 13,000 to 14,000 a year, and that is a noteworthy development.  I always try to give a statistical picture like that some sort of imaginative touch, and I think it is true to say that every two years we are building enough houses to represent the complete building programme of Cork city so far as the residential dwellings there are concerned.  There are 28,000 residential dwellings in Cork city, so we are doing the equivalent of rebuilding Cork city, housewise, every two years. It is a very remarkable effort.</P>
      <P>Again, this Government have amended the Redundancy Act and provided extended benefits to ensure that the Act will operate in the best possible way.  Deputy Corish referred to redundancy.  There will always be redundancy in this and in every other up-to-date country.  We want to avoid redundancy arising from factories, businesses, that are not paying their way, that are facing difficult circumstances or are operating inefficiently, but there will always be some element of redundancy in any modern industrial society operating under any kind of Government.  We wanted to ensure that the redundancy provisions were adequate for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is equally developing the facilities under AnCo for the retraining of workers who become unemployed, for the training of new workers, and this, combined with the development of education in the technological colleges will begin to <Col N="3425" /> ensure an adequacy of trained, skilled labour for the industrial development that is continually taking place.</P>
    <P>In another field, the Minister for Local Government enacted the Rates Act enabling county councils to raise extra moneys for the relief of rates for those who are unable to pay the full rate or unable to pay rates because of their circumstances.  That was a very wise provision.  Equally, it is now possible for the community to pay rates by instalments where the county council make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>During the whole of these two years there have been enormous improvements in educational facilities.  With the development of the new and advanced syllabuses for the primary school and the post-primary schools, the increase in school accommodation &mdash;admittedly it is very difficult to keep up with the demand that resulted from free post-primary education&mdash;there have been tremendous improvements in the whole of the educational structure.  The Minister for Education, through the Higher Education Act and the College of Art Bill, is extending facilities which will improve artistic education, and provided for a body that can make long-term studies of and recommendations for higher education.</P>
    <P>In the case of industry very remarkable changes have taken place in the organisation of the Industrial Development Authority.  They have been largely decentralised with the appointment of regional directors.  The county development teams have been brought into close touch with the Industrial Development Authority, with the object of both encouraging small industries, through the small industries grants, and planning for more industrial development in the west and in the less developed areas.  At the same time, the Industrial Development Authority are proceeding to examine regional plans for development, and recently we have seen the decision to set up advance factories in certain towns that have not benefited in the same way as other areas have from industrial development.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that much of this new development was the result <Col N="3426" /> of the enormous success of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company over which I had supervision for some ten years.  Legislation was passed giving the Shannon Free Airport Development Company the power to look after the whole of County Limerick, County Clare and the North Riding of Tipperary, because of the great success they have had in providing new industries which in a recent year were responsible for 25 per cent of the total exports of the country.</P>
    <P>There have also been new and favourable developments in relation to other State companies.  Legislation has been passed enabling Irish Steel Holdings to expand and make progress.  The same thing applies to Nitrigín Teoranta.  There has been a Bill to enable the British and Irish Steam Packet Company to take advantage of their recent financial success and go ahead with further development. New legislation has been enacted in relation to air navigation and our participation in air navigation throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>We have passed legislation which went a long way to re-plan freight transport.  This transport legislation was preceded by some excellent surveys of the character of road freight in Ireland. By freeing transport for the purpose of carrying cattle the legislation was eliminating an anomaly; and increasing the areas of operation of licensed carriers was all part of taking advantage of changes in the pattern of transport that were urgently required.  I might add in that connection also that we do have full riciprocity with the north in relation to the use of licensed carriers, and the passage of transport vehicles from one part of the country to the other has been almost completely liberalised.</P>
    <P>There has also been legislation to ensure that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will make progress.  It is very interesting to note that for the first time we are beginning to export not only shellfish and smoked shellfish but also fresh fish.  I hope Board Iascaigh Mhara will make further progress in this connection, because most of our fish is only 24 hours old and, if properly iced, processed and packed, there is no reason <Col N="3427" /> why we should not develop an export in fresh fish.</P>
    <P>Again, during the past two years, there was legislation in connection with Bord Fáilte.  The Minister for Transport and power established the National Council for Tourism, placed two new directors on the board of Bord Fáilte and ensured that Bord Fáilte would be able to tackle the problems of marketing which have arisen in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Progress was also made in regard to finance.  There was the passage of the Central Bank Act which gives wider powers to the Central Bank and which places the Central Bank in a position of being able to influence the economy and influence credit in a more meaningful way.  The Decimal Currency Act was passed, and decimalisation has been a very successful operation.</P>
    <P>In so far as our plans for the west and the undeveloped areas are concerned, we can show solid progress in the last few years.  With the decentralisation of the Industrial Development Authority, with the provision of hotel accommodation in the west, with the provision of farmhouse accommodation through the establishment of grants to farmers who wish to take tourists in during the summer period, and through the growth of afforestation in the west, we are making continual plans in order to try and stabilise the population in the west to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke as though migration within a country was something that could be wholly prevented by Government action.  I know of no country in the world where at least internal migration on a massive scale has not taken place.  If any Deputy can tell me of any country where there is no internal migration I shall be glad to hear of it.  What we want to ensure is that the small farmers are able to find employment for their families in industry in the neighbouring towns so that the family farm will be preserved. We want to ensure the development of agriculture to the maximum possible extent, and if migration is essential, if people migrate from one part of <Col N="3428" /> Ireland to another, or from a very small village in the west to a large town in the west and do not have to leave the country, Deputy Corish will surely understand that is the most we can do and the most that any country can do in regard to this.</P>
    <P>Deputies have been referring to the agricultural position from time to time in the last few years.  There has been a very big improvement in the farm structure of this country.  One only has to see the number of farmers who take farm building grants, grants for new piggeries, grants for silage, grants for land project work; one only has to see the very big increase in the consumption of fertilisers, in order to recognise the growth of modern techniques in farming which is a sign that the farmers have faith in the future.  There have been big advances in agricultural exports and production.  Evidence of the growth of farming prosperity, whatever the problems of trying to equate farm incomes with industrial incomes, is given by the increased prices paid for agricultural land.  Very high prices have been paid by professional farmers wishing to buy land as compared with the prices paid four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>I wish to say something which one has to repeat on every occasion of a general debate.  I speak of inflation. Luckily for us, this has been almost worldwide in character and the fact that inflation is taking place in Europe on a fairly wide scale has meant that our difficulties in regard to exports and to maintaining a competitive position have been moderated.  We and the British have shared the doleful reputation of having the highest rate of inflation in northern Europe and the largest increase in wage costs per unit of output since 1963.  Both countries have faced similar difficulties as a result of excessive inflation.  We were able to deal with this problem before.  We had some comparatively mild inflation in 1961 and we dealt with it successfully. We had inflation which was slightly more serious in 1965 and 1966 and we dealt with it effectively.  In the period 1967 to 1969 the economy had resumed the advance which has been so notable since Fianna Fáil took office in 1957. Now we have faced perhaps the most <Col N="3429" /> serious inflation ever in the period 1970-71.  We will not be able to make progress unless in 1972 the employers and the trade unions think seriously what the future position is likely to be if there is a rapid and inflationary rise in incomes and consequently in prices.</P>
    <P>I should make it absolutely clear to the House that one can examine any country in Europe and relating prices and incomes in that country and here one will find no evidence that prices of commodities in this country have increased more than they should have in-relation to the increases in salaries and wages.  Any Deputy can look at the figures for Great Britain and ourselves, taken over the last three, four or five years, and examine the increases in incomes and prices.  The increases in Great Britain in prices, as compared with the figures here, will show that there has been no savage or undesirably high growth in prices here which cannot be accounted for by the increases in salaries and wages which of themselves inevitably increase the cost of production and distribution.  The same thing applies in Europe.  In Germany, Denmark and Sweden if one allows for the growth of productivity relative to the position here, one will see that there is no evidence that the inevitable result of salary and wage increases is having worse results in relation to prices here than in such countries.</P>
    <P>In 1972 both employers and trade unions must take account of the fact that we are more than likely to enter the EEC and must consider the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement before they settle on increases on wages and salaries that could bring this country to disaster. The trade unions can get all the facts and figures needed in advance.  The Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce can forecast approximately the effects on prices of any likely increase in wages and salaries. They can estimate the effect of higher import prices on the economy rather accurately, thus enabling the employers and unions to make the necessary decisions. We hope the unions and the employers will make wise decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the increased unemployment of the last 12 <Col N="3430" /> months.  There has been a similar increase in unemployment in other countries severely affected by inflation.  If we want to escape from unemployment we must not only continue to ensure that industrial development takes place on a massive scale but we must also avoid inflation.  There is no way out of it and if people want full employment they can only have it if the rules in relation to productivity are kept.  I hope that there will be a wise decision in regard to this point.  It seems useless for the workers to get a 21 per cent increase in wages over a three-year period and then to have that increase reduced to a mere 8 per cent because of rising prices.  They could have been told in advance that this would happen. If they had asked for less they would have kept a greater proportion of what they earned without having to face the frustration and personal difficulties of watching prices increase the moment they obtained larger pay packets.  If they had taken the advice offered, most of the increased pay packets would be worth the same value at the end of the year as at the beginning, and their real incomes would not have suffered at all as a result of taking an intelligent decision on this matter.  This kind of inflation benefits neither worker nor employer.  It particularly results in adverse effects on the lower-paid section of the community who always get into the worst position during any period of extreme inflation.  The trade unions can be told if they ask for exceptional increases in salaries and wages that taxation will have to increase in order to make social service payment increases possible.  Social welfare payments must advance by what is necessarily required to allow for increases in the cost of living.  The same people can be told that if they ask for excessive increases in incomes, more money will be taken in taxation to be transferred to farmers so that the farmers, until we join the EEC and operate under different conditions, will see that at least to some extent their incomes are increased to meet the increased incomes of the non-farming community.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to tackle this problem of inflation this year.  The <Col N="3431" /> Taoiseach has given the House figures showing that inflation is slowing down and slackening.  If this can continue until the end of the year and if at the end of the year a satisfactory agreement is made, and provided that international conditions around us are favourable, and that there is peace in this country, there is no reason why we should not begin again to make the kind of progress we have been making continuously since 1958 but marked by the inflationary periods of 1961, 1965, 1970 and 1971.</P>
    <P>I might add in that connection that there are a great many respectable countries operating under democratic governments where there are interruptions in a period of say 12 or 15 years in the rate of their economic progress. We should like to see uninterrupted progress but Fianna Fáil need not be ashamed of the fact, looking at the 20 most wealthy countries of the world, that there have been interruptions. These interruptions are not exceptional; they are extremely common.  If we look at the near bankruptcy of our neighbour across the water, whose prosperity is so important to us, we see a highly intelligent country getting itself into appalling difficulties solely because the ordinary man in the street and the ordinary employer failed to see the light.  We can regard the difficulties we have had as of comparatively minor importance compared with some of the crises which have affected other countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish discussed our progress towards entry into the EEC. Having heard him and other Members of the Labour Party speak convinces all of us in Fianna Fáil that the Fianna Fáil Government and national organisation is the only Government and the only national organisation which can enact the EEC legislation with the certainty that it will be the right kind of legislation, that it will be passed and that all the steps required to ensure that we participate in the best possible way in the EEC will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident there is a deep division within the Labour Party not only on the subject of what constitutes socialism, about which there are at <Col N="3432" /> least 18 different opinions among the Labour Party, but there are also differences of opinion as to what they really feel about joining the EEC.  They range from absolute hostility to the idea to a begrudging acceptance that we have to join because the British are joining and we cannot remain out if the British join.  I would dread to think what a Coalition Government would be like at the end of the year 1972 or 1973 when we have to take the most serious constitutional step we have ever taken since the 1937 Constitution was enacted In my opinion if a Coalition Government could ever be formed it would be quite incapable of facing the realities, the difficulties and the good prospects of entering the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are, as I have said, deeply divided over what constitutes socialism.  There is a political gulf between Deputy Murphy and Deputy Browne which stretches further than any political gulf we have ever had on economic matters.  These two Deputies have absolutely nothing in common in regard either to their views on the Labour Outline of Policy or in regard to their views on what constitutes socialism.  At one end Deputy Browne believes in a 100 per cent socialism, a type of Marxist socialism which he fondly believes could be promoted without any fear of dictatorship or any fear of undue direction of persons and lives, and at the other end are members of the Labour Party who really privately believe in Fianna Fáil policy but who think we never spend enough money on this, that or the other and who think perhaps that our belief in a mixture of private enterprise and socialism should be slightly more coloured with socialistic belief.</P>
    <P>When I read the Labour Outline of Policy three years ago I realised it was a kind of shadowy socialist policy which could be interpreted in different ways.  Some of the individual paragraphs in that remarkable document indicated a complete socialist take-over of this State.  That document read as though it had been written by people with a great deal of theory but with very little practical political experience behind what they were writing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the necessity <Col N="3433" /> of taking care of industries which are likely to be affected by our joining the EEC.  Deputy Corish should know perfectly well that adaptation grants have been made available to industries to modernise themselves.  Deputy Corish has surely read the reports which have now been completed for the majority of our industries on how they are likely to be affected under free trade conditions, giving proper advice as to the changes in the pattern of the industry required, and giving warnings to the weaker links in the industry that they would have to make certain changes if they were going to survive.  Deputy Corish should also be aware that the Department of Industry and Commerce have a special section which gives advice and assistance to industries who inevitably face free trade because the world is becoming free trade minded.  Whether it is the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement or the EEC, in the next ten years we inevitably face under one guise or another a free trade world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish knows perfectly well that a great many steps have been taken to acquaint industrialists of their position. The Federation of Irish Manufacturers published an excellent document about the challenge to the future of industry indicating to their members quite clearly that in the European world the home market would be extremely small compared with the vast market offered abroad and that free trade meant inevitable structural and productive changes in industry here and that there would be great challenges, great difficulties and enormous opportunities.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech Deputy Corish said a few words about the Northern position.  He spoke very wisely and responsibly on this matter.  I I can find nothing with which to disagree with him on the general policy that he proposed for the North, namely that violence can do nothing but prolong Partition, that violence can serve no purpose and that if ever we are to have a successful and united country it must be through a growth in the unity of minds and hearts between the various sections of people in the North.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to <Col N="3434" /> follow either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste in reviewing the economy in detail in what has, I am afraid in part, been a rather turgid economic review. With respect to the Tánaiste, a general debate of this kind is not the time to tell the House about lorry licences or grants for piggeries; what we need at this time is the ability to rise above these mundane matters and to face the situation to which the Tánaiste referred very briefly in his closing remarks when he commented favourably on what the Leader of the Labour Party had said.</P>
      <P>No one would know from the speeches of either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste how grave a situation we now face in this country.  Those who listened, so far as there were people listening to them&mdash;there are not many people in the House at the moment&mdash;and who really care and are concerned about where we in this country stand today, North and South, could not but have been dismayed and disappointed that so little sense of urgency, concern and reality informed these speeches.  I do not think this is the time to be talking about the problems of our economy. We have had other debates on that subject recently.  There is much to be said and I would have no difficulty at all in speaking at length on it and in indicating aspects of Government policy and pinpointing areas where blame falls on the Government&mdash;not, as I have always emphasised when speaking in this House and the other House, that all the blame for our economic ills arises from Government action or inaction.  This Government has made serious mistakes which have created grave economic difficulties, but I do not want to speak about that today.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about a matter which certainly preoccupies my mind for much of the time and has done for a long time past and does worry and concern people throughout the country: that is the problem of peace and order, north and south.  Everything we do, everything we think of and everything we speak of today must be overshadowed by the grave and grim situation in Northern Ireland and by concern for its implications for this part of the country, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3435" /> All of us, even if we fail to mention this while speaking here, as the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have done effectively, must be concerned deeply at the threat to peace and order here in the Republic by men who, aware of their inability to win support for their half-baked economic views or for their glorification of extreme violence, seek to undermine our institutions by armed raids and explosions.  Ireland today is a unit so far as violence is concerned.  We cannot insulate ourselves in one part of this island from what is happening in the other part. For a long time we thought we could so insulate ourselves.  For decades we had happy little anti-partition speeches in the confident belief that they did not matter, that they could not do any harm in Northern Ireland where nothing ever seemed to change but that they might win a few votes from thoughtless people in this part of the country.  The days when that kind of tactic could be adopted by any political party are gone.  Every word spoken with regard to Northern Ireland and its problems must be weighed carefully. In this respect it must be said to the credit of this House and to the credit of all parties here that since the events of August, 1969 the words that have been spoken here have been, with few exceptions, weighed carefully to an extent that, perhaps, was greater than public opinion or the Press have given credit for.  Parliament has risen to that extent on this occasion.  I do not think we have shown ourselves to be brilliant in devising solutions and neither do I think that we have avoided mistakes from time to time&mdash;the Taoiseach included&mdash;in the way things have been put and said but by and large, faced with the threat to peace in the whole of the country, we in this Parliament have responded reasonably well.</P>
    <P>However, it seems to me that the positive response which found echoes in the debates of October, 1969 and even during those difficult and dramatic days of May, 1970 has been lost to some extent.  Two years ago&mdash;certainly one year ago&mdash;neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste would have come into this House during a debate of this kind and <Col N="3436" /> spoken so perfunctorily about the North.  Something has gone wrong that they should do so.  The Leader of this party, leading for the Opposition on this debate, tried to put facts back on a more realistic track.  He has spoken with clarity and wisdom of the problems facing us.  He raised the tone of the debate and I hope and expect that other speakers on the Opposition side will continue to do so, will show their genuine concern for these problems and their ability to speak constructively on them.</P>
    <P>For some time past we have been promoting this country as a unit for tourist purposes.  The Tánaiste himself had a direct role to play in this promotion during his term of office as Minister for Transport and Power.  We now reap the consequences of that promotion and none of us would regret the attempts that were made to sell Ireland as a unit and to put it across as a peaceful country to which people could come for their holidays.  It is now rebounding against us in this part of the country because although life here is still relatively peaceful and the average tourist here is not likely to encounter an explosion unless he happens to be visiting a mine, or to encounter a bank raid unless he is unlucky enough to be changing his travellers' cheques in the wrong bank at the wrong time, we are suffering from the fact that, partly because of our own desire to put across to the world that this country is, geographically, a unit, those people from other countries who might think of visiting the Republic are not now coming because they associate us with a level of violence that does not exist here yet but which does exist in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Not only is the tourist industry in Northern Ireland wrecked, as some recent figures have shown, but our tourist industry, already suffering from the inflationary problems to which the Tánaiste referred, is suffering further because of the unwillingness of tourists to come to a country which they associate with the bomb and the gun.  What is more serious perhaps, because tourists have short memories in general and when peace returns to any country they flock back again fairly quickly as <Col N="3437" /> they flocked back here after the losses of 1956-57, is that hidden loss of which we can as yet know nothing: the loss in terms of new industrial activity generated in this country by foreign investment that is needed so badly.  We do not know yet nor can we assess to what extent our efforts which, until these events occurred, had been growing in success, have been damaged by the events of the past two years.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to attract industrialists to the Republic are not on a united Ireland basis.  We know that in Northern Ireland industrial development has come to a halt.  In fact all kinds of development have come to a halt there.  Nobody will attempt to develop a property there or to establish a new industry because of the conditions existing there, conditions that are having their effect on employment, and unemployment aggravates the political problem, so that it is a vicious circle.  Things are not that bad here yet but, undoubtedly, industrialists seeking a peaceful climate in which to manufacture goods or provide services and, consequently, to earn profits and give employment, will now be less inclined to come to this part of the country than they were in the past.  It will be some time before that percolates through in figures of jobs because first, it takes time for an industrialist to make up his mind where he will site his factory.  Once his mind has been made up it takes another two to two and a half years on average before the factory begins production and it is a further 18 months before it reaches full output and employment.  Therefore, between four and five years can elapse from the time an industrialist makes up his mind to build a factory and the time when the full effects of that decision are evident.  Several years will elapse before the impact on this country of these events will become clear but none need doubt that the conditions that have been created in Northern Ireland and which have overflowed into this part of the country will have such effect.  One cannot have a position where investment in a mine by foreign capital is destroyed by bomb explosions or where, no matter with what provocation by way of bad industrial relations, buses engaged to take <Col N="3438" /> workers to a factory, are burned, without there being also serious discouragement to industrialists who might be thinking of coming here.  Some of them may carry on regardless but others, more timorous or uncertain, or whose investment here is more marginal or who can go elsewhere, will not come.</P>
    <P>Not only is it true that no man is an island but no part of an island is itself an island and no part of this island will cut itself off from the other part. Even if it were the case that peace and order were being maintained in this part of the country and that no one had anything to fear, there would not be success in every case; but unfortunately, peace and order are not being maintained and there are good reasons for people believing that this is not the place either for tourists or industrialists to come to at present.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we have now a sinister situation in which there are men in this part of Ireland who believe that their only path back to power is through escalated violence in the North spreading the fever of extreme nationalism. Such men are in a powerful position of leverage in this country through their position in the Government party. Some of them are men who did not achieve, in their period of power, a reputation for disinterested idealism. Virtually every person in the country who woke up on the morning of 6th May and heard they were dismissed from the Government, in one case at least, if not in both, expressed great puzzlement as to how they could have got involved in something which seemed so unlikely to yield quick profits, which seemed so unlikely to yield material advantage.  These are the men now who hold the leverage, ultimately the control of the destinies of this country, through their power in the Government party.  This is a situation to which I shall return later on.  It is one which must and does worry the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  They ought to know it worries many of the rest of us as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two ways of destroying our State and our society, two ways in which our society can be undermined. One is by toleration of violence by a weak Government, fearful of their own right wing, being unwilling to act against violent forces seeking to destroy our society.  The other way is along the path which Governments from time to time follow and recently there have been signs that the British Government are following it in Northern Ireland, the path of unthinking repression, suppression <Col N="3440" /> of free speech, threats of internment when they have not even begun to enforce law and order by the ordinary means before them in the courts or attacks on the weak, people who cannot defend themselves.  A society can founder if a Government adopt either of these two courses.  We are in the unhappy position that we have a unique Government who manage to adopt both simultaneously.  This requires considerable juggling and indeed must place some test on the Cabinet responsibility to which the Tánaiste referred.</P>
    <P>This Government have totally failed to tackle the problem of violence in this part of Ireland.  We all know why. We all know that they cannot afford to act lest the militant speeches of the man who is no longer in this Dáil, Kevin Boland, should become echoed by similar speeches from the back corner of the Government benches.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste makes a claim of purity of thought and action on the part of his Government which I have never heard claimed for or attributed to any other Government. Every Government must be concerned, to some degree, with remaining in power.  Some Governments are more concerned than others.  Some Governments do, as our first Government in this State did, what they think right, even at the expense of not remaining in power.  Every Government since then has had to bear in mind the lessons learned when a Government act without regard to political advantage and have to pay the penalty.  This Government have never shown themselves unconcerned with remaining in power. No one, even supporters of Fianna Fáil, have been very edified in the last 18 months by the lengths to which they will go to remain in power.  The Tánaiste suggests that they are above all this, that they never even think, when they take a Government decision, whether it will secure the support of <Col N="3441" /> Deputies Blaney, Brennan, Haughey and so on.  This is to make a claim which he cannot expect us, as fellow politicians, to take seriously.</P>
      <P>This Government have totally failed to tackle violence in this State.  We have had again and again parades of uniformed men openly claiming to be illegal armies tolerated and permitted to parade and to intimidate our people because the persistence of this kind of display does intimidate people when they see a Government unwilling and afraid to act.  We have had guns fired in cities and countryside with impunity and no action taken.  We have had armed raids occurring with impunity, armed raids which have pointed to the complete breakdown not simply of the system of government but of our judicial system contributed to by the Government's unwillingness to do anything about it.  We have the absurd, tragic and intolerable situation in which when men are arrested and charged with serious crimes the courts cannot deal with them then, that week, that month, that year.  Because there are not enough judges, not enough court officers, not enough courts, it is impossible for these men to be tried and under our Constitution, which defends the innocence of those charged with crime until they are proved guilty, they have to be released on bail.  I do not personally challenge that although things have become so serious that one is permitted to wonder whether that particular principle can be maintained any longer but the answer lies not, I think, in weakening that principle but rather in making the system work. There is only one reason why there are men today raiding banks, out on bail, charged, out on bail again, raiding more banks, watched passively by a police force which cannot act against them.  The reason is because the legal system has broken down, because when a man is charged he cannot be brought to trial that month or even that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had statistics in this House in reply to questions a fortnight ago which show that people charged years ago have still not been tried, charged as far back as 1967, if I remember rightly, and not tried four years later.  They must be released on bail under our <Col N="3442" /> Constitution and laws unless there is evidence that they intend to abscond and they clearly have no intention of absconding from a country in which they can get money so easily by dropping into any bank or post office in their neighbourhood.  Unless it can be shown that they intend to abscond they must be released on bail.  That problem is one which can be dealt with easily and simply and it is inconceivable to me that this Government should have failed to do so.  It is inconceivable that any Government would allow the process of criminal trial to lapse, fall into disuse virtually and create a situation in which men cannot be brought to trial and must be released to commit further crime if they so wish, and create a situation in which police have to follow around men released on bail as they reconnoitre the place for their next raid as has happened within the last couple of weeks in this city.  I heard about a week or so ago of a particular case where this happened.  It was in Killester.  I heard this two days before the raid in Killester.  One of these men had been reconnoitring the place, going round the roundabout looking at the various places he was going to raid followed quietly by the police who could take no action about it and who knew that when he committed the raid they could not arrest him.  First of all, there would have been the problem of whether if they attempted to do so they would be shot dead.  Secondly, if they arrested him he would be released again on bail for another couple of years before anything would be done about it.  Two days after I heard of that car circling the roundabout in Killester, followed by the police, there was a raid in Killester.  I have no knowledge of whether it was the men I mentioned who committed it but it seems somewhat suggestive that a Member of this House can know of reconnoitring activities having to be watched passively by the police of men out on bail charged with armed robbery and a couple of days later a robbery occurs in that exact place.</P>
    <P>If this were occurring in Liberia or Costa Rica we would regard it as a joke or as one of the funny things that happen in far off countries, like the <Col N="3443" /> experiences of the ancient people of Georgia, or the queer things that used to happen in Bosnia before the war when it was then a part of a somewhat different Yugoslavia.  They are happening here in Ireland, in this relatively civilised country, in this relatively civilised corner of the world.  In our Parliament we have a Government&mdash; and we as a people permit a Government to remain in office&mdash;which will not appoint judges and court officers to try people charged with armed robbery, and solemnly release them to commit more robberies time and time again.  This matter has been raised in this House on more than one occasion. What has happened?  I have heard, but the public have not been told yet as far as I am aware, that in fact another appointment is to be made, that some action will be taken to appoint one more judge to try to reduce the time lag from four years to three years, or something like that.  This has not been announced yet.</P>
    <P>I am also told that, even if the Government could get around to this onerous task of finding time to appoint another judge, the judge could not, in fact, operate because the whole system is so run down that there are not enough court officers.  As in every other part of the public service, by their neglect the Government have left us without enough officers to carry on in key jobs.  Therefore, having an extra judge would be no help if there is nobody to run the court.  I am told that it will take some time before such people can be appointed.  In the meantime, innocent people will be attacked and robbed; post offices and banks will be raided and criminals, parading from time to time as having some political motivation but showing remarkable reluctance to hand over any of the loot even for a political objective, will continue with impunity while the Government wonder whether at some stage this year or next year they will get around to appointing another judge and some more court officers, and start the long process of making these appointments which should have been made years ago.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing a Government <Col N="3444" /> are for it is to do the necessary minimum to maintain law and order.  Over the centuries Governments have taken on new functions, they are now concerned with things like economic management, but the one thing Governments have always been for is to maintain law and order, to maintain justice, to maintain peace, and to enable people to live without fear.  Is there any bank official, is there any sub-postmistress at the moment, who can live without fear? Do they not know, by name, indeed, the men who are likely to call in on them, the men against whom this Government have failed to take any action, the men they have released on bail and not bothered to take the steps to try? Why should we be in a position where innocent people, doing their jobs, do not know at what moment a band of men with guns and stockings or false beards to disguise themselves, although very often everybody knows who they are, will drop in, tie them up, beat them up, and shoot them if necessary and take from them the property they are there to guard?</P>
    <P>That is the situation which has been created by this Government.  I do not know why.  There are times when the Government's failures can be attributed to the fact that they have the wrong policy on some issue.  We may think they should be doing a certain thing with the country's money, such as building houses, and the Government may think they should be doing something else.  There may be legitimate differences in policies.  We are not talking here of vast sums.  We are talking about a matter of a few thousand pounds which are required to make the judicial system work.  I do not know why the Government have failed to do so.  This is a most serious neglect of their duty on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government must tackle this problem.  We cannot be left in the situation of having no protection against unscrupulous men who can act with impunity, and boast of it, knowing that no matter what they do, years will elapse during which they can increase their ill-gotten gains before they are likely to be tried finally.  Perhaps after three or four years when it comes to <Col N="3445" /> their turn to be tried, they will abscond but they will not go until the last moment, until they have collected every last halfpenny they can get from our banks and post offices.  Then no doubt they will abscond, as one or two of them did previously.  Are we to allow that to happen?</P>
    <P>I think there is now sufficient evidence to say in public&mdash;one is reluctant to say it; one is certainly reluctant to say it until the evidence is there&mdash;that there is now the spectacle of juries, faced with the inaction of this Government which created an atmosphere of intimidation throughout Ireland, failing to convict in the face of clear evidence and open admissions of guilt.  We have had this in several cases.  There have been some cases where one can argue about the evidence.  There is one notable case in which the evidence did not seem adequate to many people. There are other cases where there has been an open admission and proclamation of guilt and where juries, seeing that the Government are conniving at these activities, seeing that the Government are not prepared to take any action, perhaps not unnaturally feel: &ldquo;Why should we stick our necks out when the Government are not prepared to do anything?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Juries are composed of men and very occasionally women.  We are a people with long memories.  You do not have to have a very long memory, you do not have to be any older than I am, and I am not the oldest person in this House, to remember when a juryman's wife and children were killed because he had dared to do his duty as an Irish citizen.  People who are called to act on juries in cases of this kind remember that.  If they are younger than I am they have heard of it from other people.  When they see a Government unwilling to take any action, sometimes they do not see why they should stick their necks out.</P>
    <P>Not everybody is a person of great moral and physical courage.  Not everybody feels that he must take on himself the onus of protecting and safeguarding the interests of society when he sees the Government failing to do so.  This has now begun to happen.  We saw it last week and we saw it on <Col N="3446" /> other occasions.  People have stated: &ldquo;Yes, I had guns.  I had guns for Northern Ireland&rdquo;, and they have been acquitted at that point by the jury. At this stage the combination of the Government's failure to appoint an adequate number of judges and court officials, their failure to act in a manner that would inspire members of juries to do their duty, has led to what now amounts to a complete breakdown of justice and consequently of law and order in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>So much for the Government's weakness. As I said before, the Government are unique in combining weakness and timidity in dealing with the real dangers and combining that weakness and timidity with the repressive attitude that it is safer to act where people do not carry guns but protest and do such dreadful things&mdash;not raiding a bank&mdash; that is not of any importance&mdash;or shooting people or blowing things up &mdash;that type of thing is tolerable&mdash; as having the nerve actually to occupy somebody else's empty house before it is knocked down for development. Then this Government will be courageous and will act, and will take up the time of this House day after day over six months in order to deal with these desperate criminals who are safe to deal with, men who will not take very violent action, men who are not any threat to the Government, men who perhaps have not got the same powerful friends in the Fianna Fáil Party, a party who have not got that many members who are sympathetic to people who are short of housing, but rather more members who are concerned with the developers and their problems.</P>
    <P>So this courageous Government come along with their Criminal Justice Bill which, however, they had to drop. In the Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill which they have forced through this House, and will now presumably force through the other House, they endeavour to ensure that criticism of their activities will be minimised&mdash;I need not go over that after the events of the past few weeks&mdash;not only by legislation such as that which we have had, but also by the pressures put on to ensure as far as possible that radio and television will toe the line and <Col N="3447" /> operate an adequate system of auto-censorship.</P>
    <P>I do not think Ministers like having to ring up RTE.  They recognise that it is necessary, for a period of years, to create the pressures in order to achieve this auto-censorhip hoping, if they keep at it for a few years the system will operate itself because, especially if they use the tribunal mechanism, the time will come when people in RTE who feel they have other things to do than spend weary months before a tribunal of judges defending the details of a programme will decide that it is easier to get on with their job and avoid trouble, and the Government have very carefully worked things out so that that process will operate as far as possible.  Fortunately, there are still courageous people who are not prepared to toe the line but certainly it is much more difficult for people in RTE to put on the programmes they used to today than it was a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>We also have as evidence of the Government's willingness to be firm where it is safe to be firm the fact that so many Bills coming through this House contain what I regard as repressive provisions, provisions which give the Government more power where it does not need power, provisions like those in the Higher Education Authority Bill, designed to make sure that there will be the minimum amount of freedom for a body purporting to be autonomous.  We have the same thing, though even worse, in the College of Art Bill which unfortunately has not reached us because of the Government's determination to force through the repressive Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970, when they should have been dealing with the much more serious problem that arises in the College of Art&mdash;but that takes second place.  Everything takes second place when there is a little bit of repression to be carried out.  We had the Minister's and Secretaries Bill setting up a new Department in the Public Service upon which the entire reform, 50 years overdue, of the public service depends.  Has this been brought before the House?  No, we have inquired for it occasionally but the Government do <Col N="3448" /> not regard that as of any importance. The reform of the public service, the implementing of the Devlin Report, trying to get an efficient system of government which will work smoothly, efficiently and adequately&mdash;that does not matter.  The important thing is to deal with these great menaces to our society, the squatters.  Efficient administration&mdash;that can wait; the menace of the IRA&mdash;that can wait; but where there is a little bit of repressive legislation to be put through, everything else must take second place.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government sat back and looked at their public image and looked at the way in which they have been handling our affairs for the past couple of years.  I suppose that if one is in government for a long time, one does lose touch.  We have had evidence of that&mdash;I think we had evidence of it in the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government in its closing years and certainly evidence of it with Fianna Fáil in 1948 and we have certainly had evidence recently, but even a Government which inevitably after a long period in office tends to lose touch is capable of sitting back and taking stock and the best time to do it, I humbly suggest, is the long summer recess.  I think that the Fianna Fáil Party could usefully, without perhaps some of its members who are no great help to it, have a weekend seminar&mdash;let its hair down&mdash;to consider where it stands and whether some greater reconciliation of these two different arms of policy&mdash; weakness in the face of a real threat to our society and repressive action where they feel that repressive action is safe, could not be brought together.  Could we not in the next session have a reversal of these arrangements, a new resolve by Fianna Fáil that they would deal firmly with the real threats in our society and leave on one side these minor problems on which they have been wont to spend so much of their time in pursuit of their present attitudes?</P>
    <P>How are they at this stage to tackle the real threat to our society at present? By applying the normal process of law to those who seek to destroy our society and proclaim their intention of setting up in this country, South as <Col N="3449" /> well as North, a military dictatorship. Do I have to tell them&mdash;apparently I do&mdash;what the normal processes of law are?  First of all when people commit offences against the laws of this country, offences associated with illegal armies and with violence, the Government should, as the inter-Party Government did, regardless of the effect on its popularity with some floating voters at that time, 1956 and 1957, charge these people either with summary offences in a court of summary jurisdiction, with six months sentences, or by indictment by way of jury trial.</P>
    <P>I know, and I have already said, that as far as the latter is concerned, there will be cases in which juries will not convict.  It may well be that if the Government pursue the course they should pursue of charging those who are threatening our society with the offences they are committing and proclaiming they are committing&mdash;publicly admitting to and announcing that they are committing&mdash;in a number of cases they will not secure conviction. Possibly even some district justice may not have the courage to do his duty. This can happen, but I do not think it will.  It is quite possible, and we have seen it already, that juries will not do their duty, but let the normal process of the law take its course.  Let the Government prosecute and if repeatedly over a period of time, it emerges that the law has broken down and that because of the way the Government have allowed this evil to grow, the courts are not able to deal with it, juries are afraid to deal with it and witnesses are intimidated, as happened in another recent case&mdash;if these things happen and are shown to happen, and our people can see that they are happening, our people and this Opposition will support the Government in the next stage.</P>
    <P>What is the next stage?  Not internment. The next stage, because these things must be done in due order and with process of law stage by stage, is that if the jury system breaks down and district justices fail to convict in cases brought before them&mdash;if that does happen and I do not think it will&mdash;in that event, and only in that event, the Government can proceed <Col N="3450" /> and can get power to proceed&mdash;and have done so before&mdash;to act without juries, through special criminal courts. This can be done.  It should not be done and should never be done, unless it has been shown that it is essential and that the system has broken down. That must be shown first.</P>
    <P>May I say that when and if the time comes, unhappily, in this country, to establish special criminal courts, I hope the Government will have the common sense to appoint to them judges and that the past practice, which may have been thought necessary in the past, but which I think is undesirable, of appointing military officers, will not be resorted to. This places an unfair burden on the Army and it is not their job.  Internment can only arise in any democratic society with a democratic Government in certain special circumstances, only if the normal processes have failed, if trial by jury has failed, and if trial without jury has failed.  If that happens and if despite using the full panoply of the law, including the emergency laws&mdash;if all that fails&mdash;and the country is then faced with the threat of civil war, at that stage and in that last resort, internment may be necessary.  No Opposition can say to a Government: &ldquo;You can never in any circumstances intern anybody without trial.&rdquo;  In the last resort, society must be able to defend itself, but only in the last resort.</P>
    <P>What have this Government done? They have talked lightly of introducing internment before they have even had anybody up before a jury, never mind before a special criminal court, arising out of some imaginary pub talk about an assassination plot.  Internment can only arise if the problem is on such a scale that civil war is threatened and society as a whole is threatened and when all other methods have failed. This Government have discredited themselves by threatening to resort to internment at a stage when they have not begun to use the normal processes of law and they perhaps have made it more difficult for them to proceed according to the proper process.  Let us not hear any more of internment until and unless other methods have failed and if this Government can come to this House at some stage and say <Col N="3451" />&ldquo;We went through trial by jury; witnesses were intimidated, juries were intimidated and we had to introduce special criminal courts.  We did that: we charged people, but the scale of the problem is such that we are now threatened with civil war and the only solution is internment&rdquo;, the Government will get from this party support in that action&mdash;then and only then; but it will get that support when necessary because this Party has always stood by any Government, no matter how much it is opposed to it, which, acting properly and with due process, seeks to protect the liberties and lives of our people and the society in which we live.</P>
    <P>In all this we cannot ignore Northern Ireland and one very good reason, if the Government need any other good reason for not introducing internment when they have not tried out the ordinary process of law is the effect this would have in Northern Ireland.  The first good reason for not using internment is that it is wrong to use it until it is shown to be necessary.  The second good reason is that, it being wrong and being seen to be wrong, any Government which does introduce it when it is not in fact necessary at that point&mdash; such a Government will lose the confidence and support of public opinion which it will need to carry through its policies of dealing with the threat to society.</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I have been informed that the chief executive officer group of the County and City Managers Association have recommended to their members that widowed psychiatric nurses reappointed in the psychiatric nursing service be granted a marriage allowance in addition to their salary as in the case of married male psychiatric nurses.  My Department are in correspondence with the chief executive officer group in regard to certain aspects of this recommendation which will require to be clarified before I can indicate to the group what my decision on the implementation of the recommendation would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the number of staff at administrative and clerical level rather than medical and para-medical staffs. The total number of administrative and clerical staff below management level engaged in health work on 31st March, 1971 is estimated at 1,200. These staffs automatically transferred to the health boards on 1st April, 1971 and there was no increase in the number of posts attributable to the changeover. At management level there were 11 officers engaged full-time and 68 officers engaged part-time in the administration of the health services on 31st March, 1971.  The total number of management posts authorised for the eight health boards is 47.  Some of these posts have not yet been filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to administrative staff.  I gave the Deputy the figures for what is described as &ldquo;management&rdquo; staff separately&mdash;programme managers and so on.  The number <Col N="3454" /> of management posts authorised for the eight health boards is now 47 and they replace 11 full-time officers and 68 officers engaged part-time in the 27 health authorities that have been abolished.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in regard to matters relating to medical cards formerly one wrote to the county manager for the area concerned and received a reply from him?  Now it is necessary to write to the county manager, he writes to the regional board, the regional board reply to him and ultimately the county manager replies to the person who wrote to him originally.  I do not see how this makes for economy and perhaps the Minister would clarify this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a system established whereby a Deputy should be able to make his appeal for a medical card to the officer delegated in a county area to deal with medical cards.  It should not be necessary for letters to pass from one person to another.  I would point out that the health board administrations have been in operation for three months only and it will take a considerable time before all these problems are straightened out.  I should not imagine there will be a complete structure of the health boards until 1st April next year.  There are still some vacant posts and there must be an examination of how to work in the new posts.  The McKinsey Report on the administrative structure has yet to be examined in some areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree completely with the Minister in what he <Col N="3455" /> has said.  However, the difficulty is if I write to the regional health board I do not necessarily get a reply.  Heretofore I wrote to the county manager and received a reply within one week but now I must write to the Minister for Health, as he is aware, and he writes to the health board and I receive a reply.  I would not get a reply otherwise.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  The Minister is replying to a different point.  The Minister has said that the present set-up will lead to more economic administration.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he has examined the feasibility of introducing some form of price concessions for tourists in respect of petrol and other commodities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and I are very conscious of the need to take all possible steps to ensure the competitiveness of holidays in Ireland.  A number of proposals for tax concessions, including a tax remission on petrol for foreign tourists, which would have some impact on tourism growth, were examined from time to time but it was decided that, apart from serious administrative difficulties, these proposals would not represent the best use of public moneys available for the development of the tourist industry.  At present the possibility of duty free facilities on cross-Channel passenger routes is under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the Minister is aware of the fact that the high cost of commodities such as petrol and drink are being held up as having serious adverse effects on the whole tourist industry?  I am sure the Minister is aware of that and I am sure he will agree that it might be desirable to explore every possibility in this respect.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>On 20th July, 1971, I gave the House a report on tourism based on traffic returns for the first six months of the year.  I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the up-dating of the information in that report will not be possible until the results of the board's survey of tourist traffic in July and the prospects for the coming months are available later this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House that we are examining proposals at the moment for next year in this respect and I would not be at all as alarmist as the Deputy has been in regard to the trends in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the National Tourism Council have had discussions with Bord Fáilte and other interests with a view to introducing a special off-season package particularly aimed at the market in Britain?  If this is so, could the Minister say what is the attitude of the Government?  Are they going to give the special finance necessary for this?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister is postponing an assessment of the situation and that he will be <Col N="3467" /> able to put it off now until the Dáil meets again?  Is the Minister aware that in one midland hotel, which has always been full at this time of the year, when asked last week if they had 14 single rooms available, were able to answer: &ldquo;Yes, come along&rdquo;?  Is that not an indication that fewer people are coming?</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say whether or not any possibility of leasing aircraft in the off season as was hitherto done has now been ruled out and that the only possible alternative is to explore the possibility of some working arrangement?  Is that the reason why this has arisen?  Apparently the leasing arrangements for the Jumbo Jets has fallen through.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The leasing arrangements have fallen through due to the backing out of the contracting party to the original arrangement. There are further arrangements or possible arrangements being explored very actively at the moment by Aer Lingus. This is strict commercial business which they are naturally seeking to explore to the fullest advantage for themselves.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that if somebody who was ill and was declared not unfit by one of the Minister's officers, though his own doctor certified him as being unfit, fails to get a referee to consider his case for six weeks at the end of which time he is declared to be unfit, this is an unfair way to deal with the sick poor of this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many such cases.  It is sometimes not possible for 11 doctors to get around to all the cases as quickly as they might.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But these people are not getting any money.  They cannot go to the grocer with their own doctor's certificate and get food on it.  Does the Minister know that the average period of waiting is five or six weeks and will he not agree it is a grave hardship that when somebody has been declared not unfit he is unable to get money anywhere until he is seen by the referee?  The referee has three or four meals a day while the unfortunate person whom he is supposed to examine <Col N="3470" /> and to certify has to do without any food.  It is a disgrace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the failure of banks to pay interest on money placed in current accounts during the recent bank strike has caused hardship in many cases because such money was inaccessible to the depositors during the strike; that this failure has caused many people to discontinue saving through the banks; and that any likelihood of a strike in the future may cause a run on the banks if their present attitude is unchanged; and if he will take steps, if necessary by the introduction of legislation, to <Col N="3480" /> ensure that interest is paid in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the implications in the Deputy's question either regarding hardship to current account holders arising from the bank dispute or the effect of the dispute on savings.</P>
      <P>As regards current accounts, while it is true that the holders of the accounts did not have direct access to them in the sense that cheques which they drew could not be debited to the accounts, the fact is, as stated in the survey of the effects of the bank dispute published recently by the Central Bank, that cheques continued to be acceptable widely as payment for goods and services throughout the dispute, so that private persons as well as firms were enabled to extend credit to one another in very substantial amounts. Far, therefore, from restricting credit, the dispute had precisely the opposite effect.  Many people took a credit holiday and the net result was that some £50 million of additional credit over and above the credit guidelines set by the Central Bank was pumped into the economy at a time when seriously inflationary conditions called for the opposite action.</P>
      <P>If there should be account holders who suffered hardship because of the dispute, it is not, subject to the account holders being of good standing, because the means of obtaining cash or credit were not available but that they were not availed of.  The fact that the cheque system was capable of being, and was availed of, was widely known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the savings side, persons having money in deposit accounts have been credited with interest on their credit balances for the period of the dispute. They have not suffered any loss of interest which might be a disincentive to saving.  Persons who could not lodge funds to their deposit or other accounts in banks which were closed had available to them a wide range of alternative financial institutions, for example, the post office and trustee savings banks, building societies and merchant and industrial banks not affected by the closure.  Deposits in such institutions increased during the period of <Col N="3481" /> the closure and, indeed, it is known that in some cases encashment through business firms of cheques drawn on banks that were closed provided funds for lodgment in deposit accounts, interest being earned on these funds.</P>
    <P>However, in the year ended April, 1971, that is when the associated banks were functioning normally, the growth in deposits with these banks showed little change from that of the previous year.  I would remind the Deputy that both parties to the dispute have undertaken to consider implementation of the findings of the Fogarty Report which, <i>inter alia</i>, deals with the question of steps to avoid possible future disputes.  There are signs that a better climate of comprehension and understanding is emerging between the two sides.  In my view it is in this way that progress will be made rather than by compulsory legislation directed against one side or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that a person who had only a nominal sum on deposit, who had hire purchase commitments and whose cheques would not be accepted by the hire purchase companies and who was charged excessive interest by them because he was late in the payment of his instalments, suffered a hardship inasmuch as he had to pay to the hire purchase company considerable interest while the banks were investing his money and were enjoying that interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has in mind people who had money in current accounts.  As I pointed out, those who had money on deposit got interest. Those who had current accounts if <Col N="3482" /> they had any reasonable credit standing at all were able to get cheques cashed.  In the kind of case he mentioned, they could have got cash for cheques and paid the hire purchase companies if they would not accept cheques.  All the figures show this is what happened.  People got a great deal more credit than they would have got if the banks had been open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware&mdash;he represents the same constituency as I do&mdash;that very many people in the lower income group had very modest savings in the banks? They were not known to other traders or hire purchase companies and so cheques would not be accepted.  Since they were not normally accustomed to cashing cheques they were not in a position to get their cheques cashed and, through no fault of their own, they had to run into arrears over several months with hire purchase companies and were subjected to interest to which they would not normally be subjected if the banks had been open and they could have got the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of such cases must be very small indeed and, in most cases, it must have been due to the fact that the people did not avail of what they could have availed of or did not do what other people were doing.  I would suggest that in any such case as described by the Deputy in which there was no possibility of people being able to cash cheques and pay debts, if they can establish this to the banks the banks will deal with them sympathetically in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider a case in which a person lost close on £150 in interest because of having to pay the hire purchase company an excessive rate of interest and would he not agree that this is a grave hardship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the circumstances are as the Deputy indicates, and these people have no other way of dealing with them, I believe the banks would deal sympathetically with these people.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why <Col N="3485" /> a price lower than that paid for skim milk in areas in County Kerry under the Dairy Disposal Board was paid at Tarelton creamery, Macroom, County Cork, during May, 1971.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>The price paid for skim milk by the Dairy Disposal Company at Tarelton Creamery for May, 1971 was lower than the price at only some of the company's creameries in County Kerry.  These latter creameries were supplying large quantities of milk to a processing firm which agreed to pay an extra price.  The principal processing firm being supplied from Tarelton creamery has, however, not agreed to pay this price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain why the price differs from one creamery to another?  The difference can be as much as one penny or twopence per gallon in the case of skim milk and as much as seven pence in the case of whole milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case referred to in Deputy O'Sullivan's question, some of the dairy disposal creameries <Col N="3486" /> in Kerry benefited by quite a substantial quality payment in respect of skim milk supplied to a particular firm.  The Dairy Disposal Company creamery in the Tarelton group did not have this outlet.  The outlet they did have did not pay any quality payment. They had, in other words, a better market.  Deputy Creed has a question down on this later.  However, we hope to see some developments that will remedy the position in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why farmers are asked to pay such a high price to the Dairy Disposal Board for the taking-over of creameries; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the financial terms on which certain of the Dairy Disposal Company's creameries have been offered for transfer to producers' co-operatives have exceeded the levels which their values would warrant.  The company's creameries are of course State property which cannot be alienated without reasonable compensation.  As I have previously indicated, I accept the principle of transfer of Dairy Disposal Company creameries to co-operative ownership at an appropriate commercial valuation.  Negotiations for transfers are at present proceeding in <Col N="3489" /> three areas and will, I hope, be brought to a mutually satisfactory conclusion in each case as early as possible.  I have offered whatever assistance myself and my Department can give towards this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he further agree that the price is a very inflated one in view of the fact that a great deal of the machinery and equipment put into the Dairy Disposal Company creameries is paid for out of the profits of the milk supplied by the farmers over the years?  Is that taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The basis of Deputy Creed's contention is that the asking price is unreasonable.  I cannot accept this contention because the value of the State's investment in the Dairy Disposal Company creameries in that area is quite considerable.  As the Deputy well knows, the matter is now the subject of negotiation.  Both he and I hope these negotiations will be concluded to the satisfaction of both parties.  I am optimistic that they will be.  I do not think that anything he or I would say now would assist the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not in mind the area mentioned by the Minister.  I have in mind that this is one of the factors &mdash;I agree with the Minister&mdash;in the rationalisation of the industry on a national basis which could delay such rationalisation for a considerable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there is a certain amount of horse trading that must go on.  The co-operative societies are in the process of purchasing additional plant and they owe it to their shareholders to transact this business as profitably as possible.  On the other hand, the Dairy Disposal Company owe it to the State to see that the taxpayer gets a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3490" /> The problem is to reach a reasonable compromise between the two.  The overall objective is to get the best possible price for milk producers and get the milk industry on as rational a basis as possible as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the continuing unsatisfactory price for wool; and if he can take any action to ensure better prices for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that because of the general decline in world demand for wool, market prices here have been somewhat lower this year. Good presentation and marketing are now more than ever essential if farmers are to get the best possible return for their wool.  Regulations under the Wool Marketing Act, 1968, to improve the wool grading and purchase arrangements were brought into operation this year and a distinct improvement in the presentation of the wool offered is already evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation was introduced here in the past couple of years for the purpose of sustaining a floor price at least on wool and would the Minister agree that the Wool Marketing Board seem to be having no effect whatever in stabilising the price and giving a reasonable return to farmers?  Would he not agree that the whole matter of the price of wool this year is utterly disastrous and is there any action he can take to rectify it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the main purpose of the legislation in 1968 was to secure better marketing of wool and in that way procure optimum prices for wool producers.  I accept that there has been a considerable drop in wool prices this year.  The Deputy will be aware that the wool clip is to an extent of 80 per cent exported into the current market where there is a price drop of between 20 and 25 per cent simply because of competition from synthetics. The contraction in the price of wool is a world-wide phenomenon and there is very little we can do about it. <Col N="3491" /> The encroachment of synthetics is progressive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the sheep farmers of the West are facing disaster because of the effects of this?  Can he hold out any hope for the future other than a woolly statement trying to pull the wool over their eyes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think witticisms will solve the problem.  I accept that the general profitability of flock masters is affected adversely by the drop in the price of wool and other factors.  It is a matter of concern to the Department but the facts I have been mentioning, such as the price of wool in markets where we must sell our products is a reality and we must face up to that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will give details of the warble fly eradication scheme for the coming year; the total cost per annum to the farmers; and if there will be provision in the scheme for compensation in respect of any losses suffered as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the warble fly eradication scheme for 1971 will be issued to every herd owner in the country within the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>In brief the scheme provides for the dressing of cattle by the AI services during the period between 15th August, 1971 and 15th November, 1971.  The scheme will be backed by a statutory order making it an offence for any person to have in his possession or under his control after the 15th November, 1971, an animal not accompanied by a certificate of dressing or other prescribed document in lieu.</P>
      <P>The charge to the herdowner for dressing will be 20p per animal and the total cost to the herdowners this year should be approximately £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dressing charge includes the cost of treatment and certification as well as an element in respect of compensation <Col N="3492" /> for any losses in which the involvement of the dressing is confirmed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the 20 new pence per annum is a very high figure and that this will defeat the purpose of the scheme from the outset. I am appalled to hear that the cost to the farming community is so high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree totally with the Deputy on this matter.  I have discussed it at great length with the farming organisations and, as a herd owner myself, I can certainly say that leaving aside the actual specific application of the warble fly eradication scheme for that purpose, the general benefits in the elimination of animal parasites is worth well more than 20 new pence per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of misconceptions about the use of the dressing.  For instance, it is commonly held that pregnant animals can be adversely affected and caused to abort by the application of the warble fly dressing.  This is not the case, generally speaking.  I do not contend that this is absolutely true in all cases but in the vast majority of cases abortions attributed to the use of the dressing can commonly be traced to accident or contagious abortion or other reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme was drawn up in 1969 and the estimated cost then was £75,000, later revised to £100,000. This was rejected by the then Minister for Finance, I take it on the question of cost and value for money.  Recently, the present Minister for Finance received a deputation from Glengad arising out of which a scheme costing £25,000 has now been approved and of which Donegal County Council will be asked to meet 25 per cent.  It has gone to the county council and I understand they have given their approval to this, subject to receiving official confirmation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to go further back in relation to what he has just said about the former Minister for Finance rejecting it?  That rejection of the proposal was before it was actually costed and came before the announcement of 1969.  In fact, the 1969 proposal was before the Government and was approved by the Government.  I was authorised by the Government to make the announcement.  The Minister for Finance of the day was present at that time.  In the subsequent compilation of the Estimates for the following year the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, agreed that this was to be done.  Therefore any rejection of it since then has been done by the present Minister, not by the former Minister who was got to change his mind after a bit of an argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, might I ask for the information of the Deputy and the people concerned in Glengad whether what is now proposed to be done is in no way a substitute for what was proposed to be done, in that the original, larger scheme was a shelter and an anchorage for boats, whereas what is now proposed to be done is nothing more than an extension of the existing pier which will aid landings but will not add to the protection which is the kernel of the problem up there all these years?  Might I further ask whether it is true that even this small, rather useless scheme which is now being perpetrated on the people there, allegedly with the agreement of the people in Glengad, only came after the deputation had been fully, finally and irrevocably assured by the Minister for Finance that there was not a hope of getting the original scheme?  Is that not the manner in which agreement was dragged out of them?  In addition to that is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there was no provision for a local authority contribution in the scheme announced by me on behalf of the Government in 1969 and that, therefore, if there is £25,000 of a job to be done, there should be no contribution from the Donegal County Council?  Is it not also a fact that <Col N="3496" /> sanction for this miserable little job came between my putting down the question to inquire about it and the answer being given in this House last week?</P>

Doing this job would be a hindrance to carrying out the scheme originally intended, because it was envisaged that the extension of the pier would be made across an area in which a basin with gates was to be erected.  If a concrete construction is built it will be a hindrance rather than a help.  I now say that if this job is done there never will be a shelter built in Glengad, and this is what is being foisted on those people <Col N="3497" /> up there.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, further to a reply of 17th June, 1971, he will state what has been the outcome of his correspondence with an insurance firm in connection with substantial increases made by them in insurance premiums.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the correspondence referred to by the Deputy has not yet been finalised, more detailed statistics recently supplied by the insurance company concerned suggested that cars garaged in the area to which the increase applies do present a greater risk to this company than cars garaged in other parts of the country.  It was on the basis of these statistics that the company considered itself justified in applying an area loading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in answer to the Deputy's question on 17th June last, the question of area loadings has been the subject of correspondence between my Department and a number of insurance companies.  I consider that the area loading applied by any one company <Col N="3505" /> should not be considered in isolation but in the light of the level of and justification for area loadings applied by insurance companies generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that in my original question on this matter I asked him about the 17½ per cent increase that was allowed plus the 20 per cent loading increase for the Dublin area and the compulsory £4 to £5 premium for personal belongings. Is the Minister aware that clients of this particular company to which I referred have been informed since, and prior to my putting down the question, that in any correspondence or any consultations they had with the Minister, he did not even once raise the question of this loading charge for the Dublin area?  Will the Minister state now whether he has raised this question or is this company suffering under a delusion because it has been raised generally and not specifically with them because they have informed their clients that the question of the special loading for the Dublin area has never once been raised by the Minister with this firm?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when motor insurance premiums become due for renewal excessive increases are now being demanded, that there is a feeling abroad that some insurance companies are holding over in the hope of some increase coming from this commission on motor insurance? Is he further aware that since car owners are obliged by law to insure their cars they have no option but to pay these exorbitant increases?  Will he now take some steps to moderate these excessive increases and lift the load on the motoring public immediately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did give sanction for an increase in insurance premiums by 17½ per cent about the 1st August last year.  I have been keeping under as close a surveillance as I can the general overall increase in premiums.  In the investigation of this I find that in certain cases additional risk may be involved. I would have no hesitation at all in moving to clamp down on overall increases in premiums if I thought that was necessary and justified.  I have not got evidence of exorbitant increases.  I think this is the term the Deputy used.</P>

There are a number of factors that enter into the occasioning of a further increase in insurance premiums.  In addition to that I am mindful of the fact that very few&mdash;indeed, I do not think any&mdash;insurance companies at <Col N="3509" /> present are seeking motor insurance which can be a reasonably positive indication of the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 to 47 together.</P>
      <P>The statement in question was, according to newspaper reports, made by the chairman of the off-licence section of RGDATA and, while there were some differences in different newspaper accounts, the burden of the statement was that shops holding what are known as sweets licences are responsible for widespread sales of cider to teenagers and that I, as Minister for Justice, was doing nothing about it.</P>
      <P>Since then, the main body of RGDATA was reported as having publicly repudiated the statement as being unfounded in fact.  Garda information confirms the view of RGDATA that there is no evidence to justify what was said.</P>
      <P>The Garda are aware that there is cause for concern in some areas about the drinking of cider by teenagers and that, in a minority of cases, the drink is being bought directly by persons under age but, in these cases, the people responsible are people duly licensed to sell the drink and not those blamed in the recent statement.  There is of course a genuine problem for licensees in knowing whether some customers are under age or not but some licensees could do more than they are doing to prevent abuses.  For the most part, however, Garda information is that the problem is not caused by the sale of drink directly to people under age but by the fact that older youths who can buy the drink lawfully either in off-licensed premises or in public houses do so and later pass it on to younger companions.  This is a problem that is beyond the reach of the law as it stands or, in my view, of any amending legislation that would be likely to be regarded as reasonable or that would be capable of enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that cheap wines are being consumed <Col N="3522" /> by young people in Dublin?  In addition, in a certain area in Dublin firelighters, which contain a high content of methylated spirits, are being mixed with cider and cheap wine.  The Minister should come out with a better answer than saying his Department can do nothing to curtail the sale of alcohol to teenagers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated in my reply, for the most part the alcohol in question is being sold to people above the legal age limit who pass it on to people under the legal age limit. As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda can do nothing to prevent that as it is not an offence for someone under the age of 18 years to consume intoxicating liquor.  In a number of cases where young people became disorderly as a result of this activity, the Garda arrested and charged them with the appropriate offence.  There have been a number of charges against people for selling intoxicating liquor to persons under age but the number of convictions has been significantly less because it is necessary for the Garda to prove that the person who sold the intoxicating liquor was aware that the purchaser was under age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This might be a matter on which the House could spend some time in regard to any amendments that are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to consider amending legislation to prohibit the consumption of this type of liquor in public places as is done in Canada? The Canadian authorities can control the problem of the consumption of cider and other drinks by teenagers by preventing its consumption in public places, with the exception of public houses or in homes.  Would the Minister investigate this possibility?  The problem is serious and the Garda have difficulty in trying to control it.  Legislation on the lines I have suggested might be of assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The only case in which there is no provision for legal aid where a plea of guilty is offered is where a person charged with an indictable offence, other than murder, treason, piracy or an offence referred to in the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962, pleads guilty in the district court and is sent forward for sentence to the circuit court.  An extension of the legal aid scheme to cover that type of case would entail a change in legislation and not in the regulations.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that district courts are refusing legal aid certificates in cases where pleas of guilty are offered and in cases other <Col N="3524" /> than those the Minister has mentioned on the grounds that the regulations enacted do not provide for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No. As a result of the passing of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, a certain limited category of cases where a plea of guilty is made seemed inadvertently to be taken outside the scope of the legal aid scheme and when an amendment of the legal aid legislation is envisaged I certainly propose to insert a section which would cover that situation.  The granting or otherwise of legal aid is a matter entirely within the discretion of the district court or the appropriate court and it is open to them to grant or refuse it in the appropriate cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I want to put it to the Minister that the regulations as drafted at the moment appear to preclude the district court from exercising any discretion in a case where there is a plea of guilty. This is the interpretation being put on the regulation by the district court and I do not think they have any choice but to put that interpretation on it.  It is working a great hardship, especially in the children's court in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that that is not so, that there is a limited number of cases where there is a plea, inadvertently taken out of the scope of the Legal Aid Act.  I will rectify that at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said as to what is the position with regard to interpreting the legal aid regulation, would he look into it and if he finds out that what I say is correct perhaps he will indicate to the district courts that their interpretations have been wrong in regard to those regulations?</P>

Since it was established, many changes have been introduced in the Force in pursuance of recommendations of the Conroy Commission and the council played an important part in ensuring the smooth introduction of these changes.  The various interests represented on the council agree that the discussions at the council enabled difficulties that would otherwise have arisen to be foreseen and avoided.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 to 57 together.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that my functions in the matter arise only in relation to the enforcement of the law by the Garda Síochána and I do not think it would be appropriate for me to express any views as to drug-taking on particular occasions or at particular events.  The Garda Síochána maintain a close liaison with the Department of Health, which are the Department primarily concerned with this problem, and there is a constant pooling of information and a constant exchange of views as to the problems that arise and the best methods of dealing with them. I do not think that there is any significant body of opinion, among those who have studied the problem, who believe that drug-taking or drug-abuse can best be kept in check by treating it as a matter primarily for the police and the criminal law and, while I do not seek to evade responsibility in so far as the matter is one for the Garda, I think it is serious misreading of the nature of the problem, which is a growing one in every country we know of, to suggest that it can be solved by police action.  If it could, it would not be the international problem that it is.</P>

Surely the Minister should accept some responsibility for the enforcement of the law in relation to drugs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is suggesting we should put a stop to pop festivals I could not go along with that. Nor would I accept that 90 per cent of those attending such festivals take drugs.  I understand pop festivals are a new phenomenon in this country.  Two have been held in recent months and at each members of the Drug Squad were on duty and they made a number of arrests.  It is grossly unfair to suggest that 90 per cent of those who attend such functions take drugs.</P>

      <P>As I understand the Road Traffic Act, interpretation is a <Col N="3542" /> matter of judgement on the part of the Garda authorities.  It has recently become possible to set up objective standards of noise in terms of actual description by decibels of noise volume.  Would it not remove the possibility of error in individual judgment to lay down base lines to which people could conform?  This could be done if some standard were introduced.  Would that not make the work of the Garda easier?  Would the Minister look at that aspect of the matter?</P>

      <P>This boy was, in fact, charged with an offence in the civil courts before he was recruited, tried by a jury and discharged.

Is it not a fact that this boy was recruited with two companions from the same area, that the other two went absent and that he remained in the Army; that he gave satisfactory service and was commended by his immediate commanding officer?  Is it not true that the only other reason that could be given was that he had been in court and acquitted by a jury?

I am not prepared to say what the reasons were but I can assure the Deputy they were very good reasons and in fact had nothing to do with the incident to which he referred.</P>

      <P>I hate to disagree with what the Minister has said, but I am not prepared to accept that there was any reason.  Either the Minister is deliberately misinforming the House or alternatively has been himself misinformed. I propose to take further steps to see that this sort of codology, which is not new with some people in the Army, will not be continued much longer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the estimated number of widows who will qualify for an allowance under the Army Pensions Bill, 1971; if the widow of the holder of a special allowance will qualify for an allowance and if any estimate has been made of the number of such widows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that 3,300 widows of military service pensioners will qualify for allowances under the Army Pensions Bill, 1971.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the condition of the Liffey gives rise at times to unpleasant smells.  The present unsatisfactory condition of the river is, I understand, caused by two main sources: the flows from the Camac River, itself heavily polluted, which joins the river at Heuston Bridge and the overflows from <Col N="3562" /> the city centre sewers which are at present overtaxed.  The Greater Dublin Drainage Scheme or Grand Canal Scheme, the planning of which is being designed as rapidly as possible by Dublin Corporation will, however, take the discharges at present polluting the Camac and will also intercept the flows from the city centre sewers thus eliminating the principal sources of pollution. The whole scheme has been approved in principle and I approved contract documents on the 23rd March last for that section from Mulhuddart <i>via</i> Blanchardstown to the Navan road.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a rather scientific explanation for some of the odours and I think it would be valuable that the House should know about it.  The principal causes of the unsightly conditions and of the odours seem to be the deposits of organic matter and silt which accumulate on the bed along the sides at dead spots, that is, slack water caused by obstructions and by irregularities in the river channel.  The organic matter decomposes under anaerobic conditions with the production of hydrogen, sulphide and methane.  In warm weather the occluded gases in the sludge mass expand and cause lumps of decaying matter to rise to the surface causing unsightly floating slicks of black sludge.  I have asked the city authorities to investigate the feasibility of cleaning the bed of the River Liffey <Col N="3563" /> in the city centre area where most of this sludge is deposited in the hope that by removing it we can remove also this evil odour which occurs there at certain times of the year, depending on the temperature and so on.  However, I hope that the outcome of the investigation will be that it will be considered feasible to do this work and that in doing it we can eliminate the odour for some time.  Naturally this type of stuff will begin to accumulate again after another few years, but I think it is a job worth doing, even if it only has effect for a few years, because it is most unpleasant and is something I would be anxious to have removed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already issued detailed general advice to planning authorities in connection with the statutory review of their development plans, including advice on specific development and control problems of particular concern to them.  This advice was contained in a circular letter issued by my Department on 15th January last. Copies of the circular were sent to all Deputies at the end of last month in response to a request made to the Parliamentary Secretary during the course of the debate on the Estimate for my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the circular had to stress that the responsibility for the production of effective development plans rested with the planning authorities, it promised all possible assistance to them from my Department and An Foras Forbartha. It listed a number of planning studies, either completed or expected to be completed in the near future, which would be of particular benefit to them. It also mentioned that my Department, in co-operation with An Foras Forbartha, would be organising a number of conferences and seminars dealing with particular aspects of development plans, and that the Department's administrative and technical planning staffs would be available to advise and assist in relation to any particular problems planning authorities may have. <Col N="3565" /> Action along these lines has in fact already been taken.  A planning officer of my Department has had local discussions in 22 counties over the past three months about the general planning position.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think I should mention the preparation of regional reports by the regional development organisations in which my Department participates.  A lot of the work that has gone into the preparation of these reports will be of considerable value in the statutory review of the plans.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3573" /> Excluding smaller families who are rehoused by the corporation as a result of being displaced by statutory operations, Dublin Corporation are at present rehousing families of four or more persons.  They are not as yet in a position to say when they will be rehousing smaller families, who do not come within priority categories. Depending on housing conditions generally in the area, and the local demand for housing, families of less than four persons are being re-housed by other housing authorities from time to time in various areas of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Minister is concerned naturally with the demand for housing in Dublin and is trying, within the finances available to him, to meet the situation as best he can. The corporation's policy in the circumstances is reasonable.  That is not to say that I am not concerned about the smaller family who may seem to be in a much weaker position to get a house and may have to wait much longer, and who may in fact feel that they have no chance of ever getting a house from the local authority. I am having a special look at present at this position to see if I could initiate some special housing programme to cater for the needs of very small families so that they will not be left constantly on the side.</P>

      <P>While written replies will be given to questions already on the Order Paper, what I am concerned about are questions that were put in last Friday and have not appeared at all on the Order Paper on the basis that they were allegedly late and since the deal for questions today seems to have usurped the time that might have been used for questions tomorrow these same questions which would have been in time for tomorrow, naturally with no questions, are not being taken. They are not on today's Order Paper. They were urgent.  There is no question of written replies.</P>
      <P>The two questions that I am concerned about have to do with the impending visit of the Taoiseach to Mr. Health and the agenda for that meeting. I went to particular pains to make this known in the General Office and I understood that they would be taken. Now I find that technically they are said to have been late, by the Taoiseach's Department.  It was they, apparently, who ruled that they were late rather than anybody else.  Then with the switch around from tomorrow to today, in so far as double time is concerned, I have been ruled out there as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that Deputy Blaney's disappointment will not deter him from contributing to the debate in due course.  In all I have been saying and in all that we have to say in this House about our problems in this part of the country we cannot ignore the situation in Northern Ireland.  It is not enough to get from the Taoiseach pious platitudes about a pluralist society, pious platitudes about having regard to the interests of the minority down here, while at the same time he is instructing the Leader of his party in the Seanad to vote against having even the First Reading of a Bill dealing with one of the matters about which he is expressing himself so piously as being something we should be looking at.  I do not think any man is entitled to claim credibility when he simultaneously expresses concern on the subject of matters like contraception and then takes all possible steps to prevent even the most preliminary discussion of the matter in a House of the Oireachtas not because, as is sometimes claimed, he has an alternative measure he is about to bring in, but because he simply does not want to discuss it at all because the Government cannot make up their minds.  If they cannot make up their minds as to what line they will take frankly he should shut up about the subject and not be mouthing platitudes about it as if he meant something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not enough also to make sympathetic noises to the minority in the North, which we hear from the other side of the House and from the Taoiseach, while at the same time giving bad example and giving heart to all those in Northern Ireland who favour repressive measures, giving that bad example and giving heart to them by the kind of measures introduced down here such as the Forcible Entry Bill.  It is not enough to talk about being the second guarantor, not to mind the phrase which will go down in history as the Taoiseach's main contribution to the English language, about not standing idly by.  It is not enough to talk like that when his own ineptitude in his speech in the Garden of Remembrance has lost him whatever power he had to persuade the United <Col N="3614" /> Kingdom Government even to avoid the most obvious blunders of repression and military stupidities in Northern Ireland.  What kind of a guarantor is it who has so little influence that when he raises his voice he is simply told effectively to shut up by the British Government when they feel that he asked for it by introducing the Partition issue at the wrong moment?  Whether he asked for it or not, he certainly can no longer claim to be the second guarantor when that is the kind of answer he gets from the British Government.</P>
    <P>This Government are unable to give a firm lead on these matters&mdash;to lead us along the tricky and delicate path between two courses of action&mdash;one of weakness and one of repression. They are unable to give us a firm lead. They must constantly look over their shoulders to their Republican supporters. So, while we have had from the Taoiseach a kind of endorsement, in a broad sense, of the Fine Gael/ Labour policy, the policy launched by Fine Gael in September, 1969, and supported by the Labour Party, seeking reunion only by agreement, while that evoked from the Taoiseach on the day it was published by Fine Gael a statement that this was in line with traditional Fianna Fáil policy, a statement which was untrue but which was intended presumably as an indication of support for this view, the resistance of the men the Taoiseach looks towards over his shoulder, has prevented him from carrying this endorsement through to its logical conclusion.  When I, in this House, at the end of 1969 tried to get him to make an explicit commitment on this point he dodged the issue because, while he likes to talk in terms of unity by agreement&mdash;violence is ruled out, we cannot coerce the majority &mdash;he also, on other occasions when it is thought appropriate to try to rally some of his faithful, as at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, will trot out the old cliché about no part of this country having a right to opt out.  I think sometimes the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; used in that sense and not in the sense of right and wrong has done more harm to human beings not just in this country but in others than any other word in the language.  The question of whether <Col N="3615" /> the people in Northern Ireland have a moral right or a legal right to opt out is irrelevant.  The fact is they are out and have been out for 50 years and the only way they can be brought together with us again is either by violence and re-conquest or by agreement. The Taoiseach at times seems to be thinking of a middle course, some other approach under which while not using violence or re-conquest directly he would hope in some way to get the British Government to coerce the Northern majority into rejoining us against their will.</P>
    <P>You cannot pursue that policy and the policy of reunion by agreement simultaneously.  They are mutually conflicting, mutually contradictory.  You cannot talk about getting the British to drop their guarantee, getting the British to agree to pull out by a certain date, you cannot carry on that kind of talk and simultaneously talk with any credibility to the Northern majority of reunion being by agreement.  The first course of action to which the Taoiseach recently and unfortunately has returned, the idea of getting the British to force the hand of people in Northern Ireland, is one which is, of its nature, contradictory of the concept of reunion by agreement.  Every time he or other people in Fianna Fáil raise again the hoary old anti-Partition slogan about having no right to opt out or the British dropping their guarantee or the British agreeing to set a date for the withdrawal of their forces, every time we get that talk from the other benches, it is a further nail in the coffin of Irish unity.  Unity will not be achieved by the Government of the IRA men.</P>
    <P>It will not be achieved by this old-fashioned Fianna Fáil approach to which the party still tends to revert under pressure from some of its more extreme supporters.  The idea of getting Britain to do our dirty work for us, of getting that country to force the reunion of Ireland against the wishes of some of the people, will not secure a union of hearts or minds or a peaceful reunion.  The more this policy is pursued the longer it will be before we reach the stage of achieving reunion by agreement.</P>
    <P>We must work for a situation in <Col N="3616" /> which the majority in Northern Ireland will agree, or at least acquiesce, in reunion. It might be that when this time comes some will retain doubts and will be unhappy about the change but we must create a situation whereby they will be prepared to accept the change and not to resist it violently.  Unless we can achieve this, any reunion can only be divisive and involve yet another civil war.</P>
    <P>The policy of seeking reunion by agreement involves as a condition precedent the normalisation of conditions in Northern Ireland.  So long as the two communities there are at loggerheads with each other, it will be impossible to get even a glimmer of a possibility of reunion by agreement. A great breakthrough occurred in the 1960s but it was unnoticed by most people in this part of the country.  It was when the northern minority decided to turn their back on the sterile policies of abstentionism or anti-Partition propaganda, or of looking to this part of the country to solve their problems for them.  This we cannot do as fundamentally they are the problems of Northern Ireland.  The northern minority decided to look to their own resources and to seek to create in Northern Ireland a normal, free and democratic society, a society in which injustice of the kind they suffered for 50 years was ruled out.</P>
    <P>That great breakthrough was led by the Civil Rights movement which, in turn, created the Social Democratic and Labour Party who have pursued this policy loyally since then, despite all the difficulties involved.  That breakthrough gave many people hope that there might be in our time the possibility of a peaceful solution to Partition.</P>
    <P>It is ironical, although perhaps predictable, that when the possibility emerged of a peaceful solution, those who had a vested interest in violence, those who could think of themselves as coming to power only by the gun because they lacked the qualities that would get people to vote for them, bestirred themselves and since then they have bedevilled the situation. They have provoked both the minority and the majority sides into actions <Col N="3617" /> designed to sabotage any possibility of a peaceful and normal evolution in the north that would lead to a peaceful and normal reunion of the entire country.</P>
    <P>It could have been foreseen that this might happen.  Most people thought the IRA would not stand for that kind of peaceful development and would look for an opportunity of stirring up the situation but not many of us foresaw how successful they would be or foresaw the many mistakes that would be made by people in the north, in the south, and in Britain.  These mistakes enabled them to make the progress they have achieved in undermining the possibility of a peaceful move towards justice in Northern Ireland and a peaceful move towards reunion of the country.</P>
    <P>How can we help here?  This is a question we must ask ourselves and it is one to which none of us has been particularly successful in giving a constructive answer.  If we are not able to sketch out a possible path, however difficult and thorny it may be, by which in time we could arrive at a peaceful and just solution, we will be talking in vain when we advocate a peaceful approach to the people in Northern Ireland.  We must show them there is another path.  I do not think we have been doing this with sufficient determination. There are still too many people in this part of the country looking over their shoulders and wondering if they will lose support or votes if they speak out truthfully and courageously. This is very evident in the party on the other side of the House. That party have made great progress in their policy in recent years in this respect but for every two steps forward they take one step backwards.  The party are dragged back by some of the men who still exercise great influence &mdash;although they no longer exercise power&mdash;in the party.</P>
    <P>In his contribution this morning, Deputy Cosgrave said:</P>
    <P>There is a dangerous tendency among people, both north and south of the Border, to take a fatalistic view of the situation.  Such people are beginning to talk about conflict <Col N="3618" /> as being inevitable and about the problems as being &ldquo;unresolvable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out:</P>
    <P>For Christian men with the gift of reason no such problem is unresolvable. We must not, and cannot, accept such an evil as inevitable.</P>
    <P>What then can we do?  First, we can commit ourselves absolutely, regardless of any temporary unpopularity with easily-influenced public opinion, to a policy of reunion by agreement only.  Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil have not been able to do this clearly and openly.  I believe this is the Taoiseach's own view and were he free to do so he would say publicly what I believe he says privately.  Unfortunately he is not a free man in this respect and his lack of freedom here is damaging the interests of this country and the interests of peace.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the two Opposition parties to proclaim their commitment to this ideal or to proclaim they are seeking reunion by agreement only, that they are not seeking to obtain from Britain coercion of the majority to force them into union against their will, regardless of the bloody consequences that could flow from that.  We must have that commitment from the Government also. We must have men on that side of the House willing to say publicly what they say privately, irrespective of the offence they may give to some of their extreme supporters.  They must come out firmly and totally for peace.  If they joined us in a whole-hearted way, if it were seen by the majority and the minority in Northern Ireland that there was unshakeable determination in the three parties in this part of the country to pursue that course of action, then some of those people who see opportunities to gain from violence in the north would realise they had lost their gain.  Some of those on the majority side who genuinely fear the possibility of this kind of coercion would begin to see we are not trying to force them into union against their will and, consequently, they would lose some of the fears that have provoked some of them to act irrationally and, at times, <Col N="3619" /> violently.  Unfortunately Fianna Fáil have not been free to do this wholeheartedly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that and I should be even more pleased to hear Deputy Blaney repeat it.  The second thing we should do is to defeat those who seek to profit in this part of the country from tension and violence in the north, those who have smuggled guns and, more recently, gelignite to gunmen in Belfast and Derry, gunmen spuriously posing as defenders of the minority when in fact they are seeking, with success, to provoke pogroms against that very minority in pursuit of their evil aims.  Fianna Fáil are not defeating and rendering harmless these evil forces here but have allowed them virtually free reign, as I said earlier.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, if we are to succeed in achieving a peaceful reunion eventually we must start by creating here a free and open society, with the fullest participation by all the people in our Government, and a socially just society which we can contrast with pride with the society in Northern Ireland.  That we cannot do.  A country which is building less than half the number of houses per 1,000 of the population as in Northern Ireland&mdash;not much more than one-third now&mdash;can hardly point with pride to its housing effort.  A country whose social services are so inadequate, not only in the amount of money paid but in how they are organised, in the manner in which they are run, so inadequate by comparison with those of Northern Ireland, cannot point with pride to its social welfare policy.  A country which finds it necessary to deal with squatting by the kind of measure we have had brought in here making it a criminal offence is not in a position to talk with any pride to a Northern Ireland or a Great Britain where they are able to deal with this through the ordinary mechanism of the civil law or alternatively through the local authorities making arrangements with the people organising squatting to have it done in an orderly manner using buildings that are temporarily vacant pending demolition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I have no more to say on that.  I am merely giving one sentence to each of these points to illustrate my thesis.  A country which is just pursuing a policy of eliminating in certain areas the non-sectarian community schools and handing them over physically to the trustees of one church is not a country which can talk with clean hands on the subject of sectarianism to a Northern Ireland which has resolved its educational problems in a manner which has been satisfactory both to the Catholic Church and to the other interests in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not think we have much to pride ourselves on there and I do not think the latest decision, which ensures that the schools which now exist in Blanchardstown and Tallaght and which are now open to the Protestant community in those areas, with their rapidly expanding population but will no longer be available as non-denominational schools to the Protestant community, who will have to make other arrangements, is one that will commend itself to the people in Northern Ireland or that they will feel that this is the kind of country they want to be associated with or to join.  A country whose Government even vetoes the First Reading of a Bill to take some steps to eliminate the situation under which it is a crime for people to carry on their own married life in a particular way is not one which commends itself to people in Northern Ireland, whether Catholic or Protestant.  We have much to do to set our own house in order if we are serious, which I am afraid many of us are not, about this question of reunion by consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fourthly, if we want to pursue this policy successfully we must ensure that we retain a sufficient influence with the British Government to be able to secure that repression is avoided in Northern Ireland and that the reform of the Northern system is achieved. This has been prejudiced by the Taoiseach's recent speech, although I must say that in reply to questions in the Dáil he did his best to undo as much of the damage as possible and skillfully undid a good deal of it.  In fairness that must be said, but his statement nonetheless is a serious one. It was a setback to our ability to influence <Col N="3622" /> the British Government and to command with it the kind of influence which we have to command if we are to persuade a Government, which has little knowledge of affairs in Northern Ireland, to avoid the kind of mistakes they have been making.</P>
    <P>Finally, if we are to succeed in preserving peace in the North and here, and succeed eventually in reunion by consent, we must offer hope to the minority in the North without at the same time arousing fresh fears amongst the majority.  It is not an easy task.  I am not saying that any Government would find it easy to pursue that tight rope with success, but yet it is the line we have to follow.  We must be able to hold out to the minority in Northern Ireland a hope of justice and equality, of full participation in their own community, not just practical participation in the sense of having an equal right to a job, having an equal right to a house&mdash;that is important&mdash;but a sense of psychological participation, a feeling that they really belong to their own community, that they themselves are part of the running of their own community and that they are not being run by a community to which they do not belong.</P>
    <P>This involves radical institutional reforms.  It involves the introduction of proportional representation in some form in Northern Ireland so that the moderates on both sides of the religious community barrier can pass their second preferences to each other and consolidate the centre instead of the present system which, as it operates in Northern Ireland, splits the centre and gives strength to the extremes.  Not only is that necessary but it will also be necessary as the New Ulster Movement have said, as the SDLP have indicated, to move towards proportional government in Northern Ireland in which in the Government itself, which is in fact not a sovereign Government but a glorified local administration, all the different strands in Northern Ireland will be fully represented and no one will feel he is being governed by an alien group, alien to him and hostile to him.</P>
    <P>These are the things we must work for.  These are the hopes we must be able to hold out to the people of <Col N="3623" /> Northern Ireland by virtue of the sanity of the policies we pursue and the influence we can exercise on the British Government by pursuing sane policies.  We can also look forward in a transitional period to various links between North and South which can be of such a character and so organised as not to arouse fears in the North and yet arouse hope and encouragement in the minority.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why there should not be far more informal links between the Governments and Parliaments.  We have Parliamentary Unions of various kinds, Parliamentary groups with Britain and France, Inter-Parliamentary Unions, all these different institutions, but yet in our own country we have no even informal link between the Parliaments of the North and South. It is absurd, tragic and disgraceful that until these recent events very few Members of this House ever bothered to go North and very few of us indeed had ever been to Stormont.  We should be able to institute these informal links.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Fianna Fáil not start that when the former Taoiseach went to Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A certain stage was developed by Fianna Fáil.  There had been certain precedents set at various stages in history from the time of the Collins-Craig discussions onwards, but what we have not had is the kind of informal links between ordinary Members of the Houses of Parliament of the two countries which would help to alleviate misunderstandings.  There is no reason why there should not be such links and some form of Parliamentary union established.  It would help and I think we would learn something from coming to grips with the real fears and preoccupations of the Unionists.  They would learn something when they would come to see how we regard the links between the Orange Order and the Unionist Party just as we would learn from them how they regard the influence of the Catholic Church down here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing like direct confrontation to bring this home to both sides.  It can only be salutary.  Here it <Col N="3624" /> has not happened but we must work towards it.  There is no reason why, as time goes on, we should not make more imaginative moves than that.  We need not be tied in this period of history when the old simple concept of sovereign government is dissolving in the face of new ideas and new concepts in international relations.  We should not be inhibited from thinking in terms of the possibility of Members sitting in each other's Houses of Parliament, even of a member of the Northern Ireland Government sitting in our Government and a member of our Government sitting there.  These things may be without precedent in international relations but in any event our relations are simply not international ones.</P>
    <P>In any event those old simple concepts in international relations and of national sovereignty are, as I say, dissolved. We could even at some stage move towards mutual representation of the two judiciaries.  Is there any reason why the judges North and South should not be appointed jointly by the two Governments to adjudicate in both areas?  It may well be that it would be a bad idea but we should be thinking in those terms.  Indeed, some people are.  Some of these ideas I mention now are not my own but were put forward at a conference in London some time ago by Senator Mary Robinson.  Any one of these may be good or may be bad, but we should be trying to think in terms of doing something a little different and not in terms of waiting and doing nothing until some day a federal solution springs up out of the ground, out of nowhere.</P>
    <P>We ought to be thinking in terms of moving towards an economic council for Ireland.  It may be a long time before we reach the stage when there will be reunion.  It may well be that some kind of <i>ad interim</i> informal condominium could be established to give reality to the concept of the double guarantee for the two communities in Northern Ireland&mdash;the guaranteed interests of the Unionist majority by the British Government which they would accept, and the guaranteed interests of the minority by the Irish Government which they would accept.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3625" /> These are things for the long haul but we should be thinking in these terms now and offering some kind of hope to the people in Northern Ireland who see no hope.  These things can happen only if we and the British Government and the Northern Ireland Government and the Northern Ireland Opposition work together to bring normality back to Northern Ireland, first, by isolating the extremists and secondly by bringing together the moderates, as indeed a change in the existing system would help to do.  No consideration of party, no sectarian loyalties, no relic of ancient hatred can be allowed to stand in the way of this kind of progress.</P>
    <P>We are facing into the ultimate crisis in which those who decide&mdash;as they see the dangers ahead and as they see the possibility of a wave of extreme nationalism being launched as a result of more trouble in Northern Ireland, &mdash;to turn about and run with the wind may readily be captized as they turn because they would be so far off course that they would never reach their destination.  Only those who ride out the storm, refusing to turn about in face of contrary winds, have any hope of winning through.</P>
    <P>The greatest danger, as Deputy Cosgrave said this morning, is that those who believe in democracy, those who believe in the solution of political problems without violence, whatever their creed or political views may fail to act together to defend the fundamental values of the vast majority of our people against the sinister threat from small, irresponsible groups.  That is the danger.  It is when good men fall silent that freedom fails, and democracy does not survive without leadership in times of crisis.  It trundles along all right in normal times, even in the hands of men of limited vision and little courage, but not in times of crisis. Then it depends for survival on the calibre of its leaders.  It is not clear that we have leaders of sufficient calibre in our Government at this moment. All else is of small importance besides this issue.  There will be no economic growth, nothing but poverty and misery, if we fail to halt the present rush to destruction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3626" /> I make no apology, then, for not speaking of economic problems in this debate.  There are other times for that. We face immediately ahead of us in a weeks time the confrontation of 12th August when a weak Northern Premier, a prisoner of his extremists, may feel it necessary to risk lighting the spark of a conflagration that could spread throughout North and South.  We face in the period of the recess ahead of us a situation when a small group of ambitious men in the provisional wing of the IRA in Northern Ireland, emboldened by support of powerful men in this part of Ireland and encouraged by the errors which the British Army and Government have made in response to earlier provocations, may make the effort which one of them announced in an interview published in one of the newspapers this morning, to provoke a final showdown and a bloody civil war.</P>
    <P>We face also two months hence a moment when the Taoiseach meets Mr. Heath.  They come together in a meeting which could have fateful consequences for this country for good or for bad.  None of us knows what may be the condition of our country when we return to these precincts.  None of us knows of these next two months or three will see crises threatening our nation's survival or if the Taoiseach will even see fit to call together this Parliament in which his own position is under constant threat by men nominally in his own party who make no secret in private or in public of their abiding hatred for him and of their determination to bring him and his Government down in ruins.</P>

      <P>Our country is not in secure hands.  All of us know that if the North goes up the survival of our Government depends on the Taoiseach keeping Parliament in recess and his own party on long vacation lest if either the Fianna Fáil Party or Parliament meet the Taoiseach would find himself swept aside by ambitious and ruthless men who are already licking their lips in anticipation of the meal they intend to make of him.  No country faced with such a crisis should be so <Col N="3627" /> governed.  No country can afford in such times to be led by men whose survival depends on muzzling Parliament and party, on ruling by decree for as long as possible, and no democratic country in our situation can hope to emerge in peace, never mind prosperity, from a situation in which everything we hold dear is threatened and its leadership is so manifestly inadequate as our present leadership is, <i>vide</i> the Taoiseach's speech here today, if any evidence of inadequacy is needed on leadership.</P>
      <P>However, do not let me end on a carping note.  We above all fear the weakness of the Government.  We fear their dependence on men dedicated to undermining the policy of reunion by agreement.  We recognise there is a great measure of agreement between Government and Opposition and between Irishmen generally on this policy. On this basic concensus we wish to build.  From this side of the House we say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Follow through this policy.  Do not allow yourself to be distracted from it by men who seek to encourage your destruction and that of peace in Ireland also for their own gross personal ambitions. Enforce the law against those who are prepared and willing to use gun and bomb against fellow-Irishmen.  If you loyally defend peace and order, if you work for conciliation and friendship between Irishmen, you may be stabbed in the back but you will not be stabbed from in front.  We shall continue to support these policies whether it profits us or not because we know they are right, but if you continue to react with weakness and hesitation, if you continue to fail to enforce the law or if you attempt to seek short-cuts to a united Ireland at the expense of attempting to coerce 1,000,000 Irishmen, we cannot go with you along those paths but will resist you and your Government to the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If on the other hand you are to attempt another short-cut by reverting to internment not justified by the failure of legal measures never tried, we shall criticise you as we have criticised you on other repressive measures, including the Prohibition of Forcible <Col N="3628" /> Entry Bill.  You know where you are, then, with this Opposition.  Would that you knew as well where you are with your own supporters.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning the Taoiseach stated that events in Northern Ireland are now reaching a stage of crucial importance for the future of the nation and he stated clearly that the way to achieve national unity was not through any form of violence.  He specifically used the words &ldquo;any form of violence&rdquo;.  I concur as indeed does everybody in the Opposition parties with that part of the Taoiseach's statement.  We stress it particularly this evening because there is still in the minds of many Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas the council of despair in statements issued inside and outside this House.  One hears the council of despair resorted to, the harking back to revolutionary violence as being a solution.</P>
      <P>There are in the minds of many people overtones of force and violence as being the simplistic political solution to the division between north and south.  One hears them even in the precincts of this House and at political gatherings.  One hears the political myth: &ldquo;This is yet an unfinished job&rdquo;. That terminology has been used in Leinster House&mdash;the statement that what started in 1916 is not yet over. Members of the Government party have made those statements.  They have talked about driving the British Army out of Ireland.  We also have heard the overtone: &ldquo;Let the British Army get out and then we will settle the question once and for all&rdquo;.  This statement has been made on public platforms throughout the country.  We have heard this simplistic formula being put in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to go on.  We are all familiar with that kind of political statement: this is the same kind of struggle as the Black-and-Tan war and what the provisionals are doing in Northern Ireland is adopting the same policy as was adopted here in 1916. There are some who were deeply involved in the struggle for independence who find it difficult to understand the attitude of both the Labour Party and <Col N="3629" /> the Fine Gael Party.  My own father finds my political attitude impossible to understand.  He was involved in the revolutionary movement.  He was in the North Cork Brigade.  He is now in his seventies and he is amazed that any one could put forward this particular policy.  He was a founder member of the Fianna Fáil Party in Cork.  He subsequently left it in 1930.  He has considerable difficulty in coming to grips with the kind of policy enunciated by the Labour Party, the policy subscribed to by all political parties here, the policy enshrined in a resolution proposed by Deputy Cosgrave to the effect that Dáil Éireann firmly rejects the use of force as an instrument in securing the unity of Ireland and welcomes the steps taken so far and promises to eliminate discrimination in Northern Ireland and looks forward to the establishment of full fundamental rights and freedom for everyone, irrespective of religion or political opinion.  That resolution was unanimously adopted by this House.</P>
    <P>There is a small minority who do not accept that resolution adopted by this House even though it is now the official policy of Dáil Éireann.  In recent months we have seen emerging a very complicated pattern of reprisal and counter-reprisal in Northern Ireland.  We have seen the development of senseless bombings and burnings by those who claim jurisdiction over particular streets and areas in both Derry and Belfast.  I am sure they find it difficult to understand why we in Dáil Éireann, the Government superficially and the Opposition adamantly, will not support that kind of political activity. We have, of course, very good reason for our objection to it.  We abhor the use of force in an effort to bring about the unification of our country.  We deplore the destruction and the interruption of progress towards reform in Northern Ireland.  If the present pattern continues no good will come in either the long or the short term.</P>
    <P>Irishmen, irrespective of political outlook or creed, must stand appalled at the pernicious developments during the past months in Belfast and Derry. We have had experience of killings.  In the case of troops this might be excusable <Col N="3630" /> because they are trained to kill; let there be no illusion about soldiers in arms.  Those who seek to engender civil war in Northern Ireland are, wittingly or unwittingly, playing into the hands of the enemies of a united Ireland.  I deplore and condemn the kind of senseless action that has taken place.  That kind of situation can deteriorate into mindless violence in a very short time and, in the long term, it can prove counter productive.  The minority should refuse to respond to provocation by counterfeit republican agitators.</P>
    <P>The reunification of our country can come about only through the promotion of peace and the end of discrimination on both sides of the Border.  It can come about only by promoting friendship, goodwill, co-operation and understanding.  Mental barriers will have to be broken down because such barriers are more powerful than any physical barrier.  This is the task of Dáil Éireann and its completion may extend well beyond our lifetime.  When one uses words like goodwill, friendship, co-operation and understanding one can sound almost trite.  One can sound almost irrelevant in a highly emotional situation.  But one has no option but to use such phrases because anything else would be a confession of failure and a resort to fear.  Fear, as we know, has thrived in Northern Ireland.  It has thrived on political ignorance and on sectarian ignorance. Unfortunately that ignorance and that fear abound on both sides in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Taoiseach went far enough.  He had many an opportunity for adopting a very, very definite stand in the last 12 months.  On several occasions he has gone to the brink and then pulled back again.  As Deputy FitzGerald said, he takes two steps forward and one step back.  We must, however, give credit where credit is due and, this morning, the Taoiseach made it quite clear that violence can only delay reform in Northern Ireland. He also said&mdash;and here I do not agree with him&mdash;that Fianna Fáil &ldquo;had a coherent and a comprehensive set of ideals in relation to national unity&rdquo;.  I do not subscribe to the alleged <Col N="3631" /> philosophy of Fianna Fáil because ever since August, 1969, we have seen massive confusion on the Government side. We have had a great deal of ambiguity and heard a great deal of democratic rhetoric from Kevin Boland who had the honesty to resign.</P>

      <P>In response to the Taoiseach's comment I want to put on record that no true republican, particularly anybody who would dare to present himself as a republican in the so-called Republican Party of Fianna Fáil, can afford if he is intellectually honest to become involved in sectarian armed confrontation and an armed polarisation of the situation in Northern Ireland.  This should be treated as anathema by anybody professing progressive republican views in this House: quite a few do it at the church gates at election time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the so-called Provisionals in Northern Ireland are in practise playing politics, a very dirty brand of politics, with the lives of the people of Derry and Belfast: I am conscious that many Deputies have strong views. It has been said that we have sufficient green fascists in this country without producing a republican brand of them. I suggest that any so-called republican organisation which would feed its supporters and young people in whatever county they may live on an exclusive, revolutionary diet which advances the doctrine&mdash;I believe rather perversely&mdash;<Col N="3632" /> that if you assassinate sufficient British soldiers, bomb enough Protestant pubs, blow up enough British factories North or South and if you annihilate enough people by means of booby traps and so on, automatically, in some way, you achieve the unity of the millions of people living in this island.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of concept with which we must come to grips rapidly. There is no excuse for Dáil Éireann not devoting itself to that question because there were Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House who passed around little notes in August, 1969, with the words &ldquo;Six divisions, six days, Six Counties&rdquo; written on them. This was their philosophy, their solution. Let us not be under any illusions about some of them.  To his credit, when the crunch came, the Taoiseach dropped them very quickly but, unfortunately, such were the exigencies of the votes situation that he had to keep them in cold storage and use them on rare occasions like last night when they had no hesitation, of course, while they scream holy hell about repression of a minority in Northern Ireland in walking through the lobbies in a guillotine operation which was certainly a classic example to the Ian Paisleys and John Taylors in Northern Ireland, one they could not better after total domination of Parliament on their part down through the decades in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, we must point out that any politician, North or South, who inside or outside the House deliberately places a gun in the hands of young men and produces the kind of bloody products we have seen in the past 12 months has a great deal to answer for and will most certainly be called to account not only in this life but in the next.</P>
    <P>Those who talk about force and the kind of force they had in mind are not capable of doing anything to lessen the realities of Partition, are not capable of lessening the all-pervasive influence of the Orange Order and are certainly doing precious little, as is quite obvious, even with a cursory glance at the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> to reduce the power and influence of the Unionist Party in Northern Ireland.  On the contrary, every threat, every <Col N="3633" /> killing, every burning and every widow and orphan in Derry and Belfast as far as I am concerned seem to bring comfort or a certain gladdening of heart in many ways to the extreme self-righteous extremists on the Unionist side.  We must avoid giving that kind of comfort and the provocation of a deliberate, extremist backlash which could quite easily come in Northern Ireland and which would, above all, endanger the working people of Northern Ireland, Catholic and Protestant, and could easily produce civil war.</P>
    <P>As I have said before here, one of the most tragic, disturbing and saddest aspects of recent killings is that in many respects the braver the young man is and the nearer he goes to heavily armed British troops&mdash;with, of course, the Provisionals staying comfortably behind firing off the occasional round to provoke the situation&mdash; the more sincere and patriotic he may be, the greater is the danger that unfortunate person represents of triggering off a situation which can become a holocaust.</P>
    <P>Those who have this appallingly narrow horizon of republicanism and revolutionary action and who, one might say, have as their sole criterion for a sincere and genuine republican, the accuracy with which he can fire a high velocity bullet against a British armoured personnel carrier&mdash;that is the criterion on which many of our republicans in Northern Ireland are now operating&mdash;can offer very little hope for the future of a political solution or social solution of Northern Ireland's problems.  Therefore, this House must condemn that kind of activity and disassociate itself from it.</P>
    <P>We have a potentially dangerous situation because at the moment, instead of trying, as they were a few months ago, to outdo each other in killing one another, as were the Provisionals and the Official IRA&mdash;they are now trying to outdo one another in the number of British soldiers they can kill and in the process how many young men and women will be injured or killed on their side also?  It is ironic to discover, when one reads the speeches <Col N="3634" /> of many of the provisionals, the number of occasions on which they invoke the assistance of God.  One comes to the conclusion that God has become a Provisional. Virtually every speech, every bit of demogogic rhetoric begins and ends with: &ldquo;With the help of God we will do this&rdquo; and &ldquo;With the help of God we will do that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One must put on record the fact that the policies of the Northern Ireland Government, the policies of the Unionist Party and those of the Orange Order have contributed to the situation in which we now find ourselves.  In the military and paramilitary situation in Northern Ireland it is noticeable that some of the actions of the British military authorities and the British troops, noticeably the Scottish Regiments, have been selective and discriminatory &mdash;particularly in the searches for arms, concentrating exclusively, on occasions, on minority areas.  This is something that we do not support and which we want to see ended.  We want to make sure that kind of activity does not foment an even more difficult situation, that friction between British troops and the minority in Northern Ireland does not reach a level where a holocaust will occur.</P>
    <P>In regard to the withdrawal of the Social Democratic and Labour Party members from Stormont, it is vital that they should not withdraw into a situation as Opposition Members of Parliament in Northern Ireland where they become captives of the provisionals or the creatures of any brand of IRA ideology.  Since the SDLP Members withdrew from Stormont, Mr. Gerry Fitt has taken a very courageous line on this question.  On the occasion of the Press conference they held Mr. Fitt said:</P>
    <P>Let us make it clear once again that we deplore and condemn outright violence as a means to political ends. Violent men must also take their share of responsibility for the suffering and death that results from their actions.  When the first stone is thrown or the first shot is fired no one knows where it will end, but any one who knowingly supports or creates a violent situation must bear <Col N="3635" /> his share of the responsibility for the consequences.</P>
    <P>Those are sober words from a member of Stormont and a member of Westminister who certainly has had his share of witness of violence in Northern Ireland.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>To our supporters we say firmly and clearly: &ldquo;Stay off the streets and do not give any support whatever to violence or the perpetration of it.  We are determined to create a solution to this problem, but violence, apart from the suffering and the death it causes in all areas, can only hinder us.  One year ago the whole world supported our cause and this is not so today because of violence and of violent men.</P>
    <P>I support Mr. Fitt in that statement. The Parliamentary Secretary has said that men went out in 1916 and fought for our independence and that what is happening in Northern Ireland is a logical follow-through of that.  From 1912 to 1922 armed force was used in Ireland against British troops to secure the partial political and economic independence we enjoy today.  However, this poses a problem, particularly for Fianna Fáil because they have always had the luxury of de Valera solving their problems.  He spoke and that was it.  There was no intellectual analysis from then on.  The question was solved, the policy was made and that was the end of it.  However, I question the application of such a simplistic attitude to the social and other circumstances of Northern Ireland today.  I am very conscious of the fact that the insurrection of 1916 and the subsequent executions in this city gave us our limited political independence, but we should not allow our history to spill over into a very persuasive but to me unconvincing solution for the problem in Northern Ireland.  There is no precisely similar set of revolutionary circumstances existing in either Derry or Belfast today, and one can discover that from even a cursory examination of the composition of the population and the political, social and cultural aspects of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3636" /> This has to be said not merely in Dáil Éireann but also in our classrooms, because it is there that many Irish political attitudes are fostered and developed.  If we do not start at that level we will never achieve that unity. The brand of history I was taught in Turner's Cross national school in Cork and later at secondary school was not of a type that is likely to resolve the national question in the generations to come.  Therefore, there is a very real need for us in the Republic to distinguish clearly between the historic role of revolutionary armed forces in Irish history and the futility at this point of time in our history of resorting to violent armed confrontation in Northern Ireland.  To advocate such a course is to seek to start a second civil war.  In saying this one is open inevitably to the charge, the entirely superficial charge, that one is comforting the enemies of Ireland.  One could be accused of being a pacifist, of turning the other cheek or one might be accused of failing to stand up and fight and of failing to bear arms for one's country, It must go on record again that though very tedious and simple as the proposition is, the avoidance of bloodshed and confrontation is, of course, the most difficult one for any politician to advocate.  This is the kernel of the dilemma facing Fianna Fáil in their evolution of attitudes towards Northern Ireland which have not developed to the extent that we would have wished them to develop.</P>
    <P>Having said all that I wish to add a further qualification and hope it will be understood: that of course there is in many ways a definite role for the use of the force of revolutionary armed insurrection in regard to oppressed peoples and exploited nations.  There is a role for a revolutionary armed force but to assert that we are now at that point in Northern Ireland is rhetorical nonsense.  That is the attitude of Deputy Blaney as has been implied but not put as precisely as that on the records.  Certainly, it is the attitude of the former Deputy Boland. It is the logical follow-through of Mr. Boland.  The justification of the particular strategy to be used and the need for an armed revolution in any one <Col N="3637" /> nation depends on the social and economic circumstances and on the political condition of that country. There are many examples of that.  I would consider Vietnam to be a classic example.  Possibly one could envisage that sort of action at some time in the future in Rhodesia or in Angola or South Africa.  Within our lifetime these areas may experience armed, violent insurrection and confrontation with military occupation forces.  No grand superficial strategy of military insurrection as is proposed for Northern Ireland can be drawn as an analogy with these places.  I regret to have to dwell at such length on this aspect but it is one that I myself have had to argue with fellow Irishmen of my own age because I consider it to be a responsibility on the part of public representatives to try to advance this view.  The provisionals advanced the superficially attractive proposition that we must gain peace in Northern Ireland through armed, political confrontation with the British Army and with the Unionists in that part of the country.  The only comment I would make on that is that the logical extension of that spurious assumption is that if peace is wished for internationally, there must be automatic resort in the short or long term to nuclear war. This is the kind of thinking behind that.  In other words, it is a question of peace through revolution.</P>
    <P>I submit that there is no peace to be won through such action in Northern Ireland because automatically a resort to that strategy would lead, as we know only too well, to civil war in Northern Ireland in which the working people of that part of the country would be at each other's throats.  That is the reality of the situation.  That is why I disagree profoundly with the attitude expressed in the current issue of the <i>United Irishman</i>&mdash;I suppose the Forcible Entry Bill will put paid to their October issue&mdash;but people have the right to publish and to disagree.  It is a free country but the kind of philosophy expressed here is a simplistic political assessment of the situation.  I quote:</P>
    <P>So also does the Republican <Col N="3638" /> Movement recognise that revolutionary military action must be the logical extension of revolutionary politics.</P>
    <P>There is the <i>raison d'être.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean &ldquo;incite&rdquo; or &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That argument, as I have dealt with it here, must be analysed, must be refuted intellectually and must be shown for what it is.  It is an attitude that is inbuilt in many of the historic attitudes of our own people. On the basis of it being analysed and refuted intellectually the argument is resolved.  It is not resolved by adopting the suppression of the publication itself.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we come to the nub of the question, that is: what are the prospects of success if we resort to the kind of policy advocated by the <i>United Irishman?</i> The sentence I quoted is in the artcle dealing with the tragic death of a fellow-Corkman, Michael O'Leary, who was buried in Cork on 8th July. That statement was made after the funeral.  One must ask the question which policy holds out the better hope of ending partition&mdash;military force or constitutional methods?  That is the way in which the question is now posed.  Unfortunately the question indicates the rut into which a great deal of national thought and Republican thought in Northern Ireland has been so fruitlessly channelled for more than 40 or 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should appreciate that during that period neither a variety of Parliamentary methods, such as abstentionist obstruction, nor lobbying in Westminister&mdash;and indeed, intermittent sabotage and guerilla warfare in Northern Ireland&mdash;has in any way weakened partition much less end it.  We can at least accept that much in 1971.  We must appreciate also that if the Government here were to accept the use of military force in order to end Partition, it would have to be strong enough to defeat a British Army entrenched, as it is, in a bridgehead on this island, and since the Republic possesses a smaller Army and would be obliged to retain a substantial proportion of that Army <Col N="3639" /> within the 26 Counties in the event of our deciding to resort to military action in Northern Ireland, it is safe to assume that it would be much smaller in terms of freedom for military action outside the Republic.  Since we have a nominal navy, a token air force and since we do not possess a single ammunition factory, for example, I think it is about time we realised that it is outside the realm of possibility that we would be able to undertake or sustain the required force in order to proceed with this kind of ambitious undertaking. This, incidentally, is what Deputy Boland wished us to undertake in 1969 when he drove around Dublin city in a State car for a number of hours, having tendered his resignation to President de Valera and President de Valera having advised him to go back and not resign but to stay within the Cabinet.  Deputy Boland was not quite sure whether he should ring the Taoiseach or ring his friends in the FCA. At that time I was on holidays in Wexford and I had some very peculiar phone calls from some very peculiar people who received some peculiar phone calls from Deputy Boland.  I think, therefore, we must accept that the military force capable of ending Partition would have to be of massive strength.</P>
    <P>We have equally seen that guerilla warfare in Northern Ireland is not successful. I remember as a young man in the 1950s when a number of my friends in Cork were shot in incursions over the Border.  They were classmates of mine.  At that time I did not regard guerilla warfare as being particularly successful.  Indeed at that time it did not require the British Army to deal with it.  The militarised police patrols of the RUC were sufficient to contain the situation.</P>
    <P>The final argument against any resort to force is that, if it were to be effective, it would have to be on such a massive scale from the Republic into Northern Ireland as to subdue a million Unionists, Protestants for the most part, and could entail the setting up of a concentration camp in Northern Ireland.  Into that camp we would have to put many tens of thousands of fellow <Col N="3640" /> Irishmen in Northern Ireland in order to contain the situation.  This kind of permutation is familiar to us in this House.  The tragedy is that the permutation has not been spelt out to Irish boys and girls who attend our primary, secondary and vocational schools and who grow up on a diet which, in a way, advocates that kind of final solution. This is why I have to deal with that kind of proposition.  We must come to grips with it.</P>
    <P>There is also the argument put forward, particularly by the Provisionals in Northern Ireland, that we must work into a kind of situation where Stormont could be abolished.  This is another of the classic arguments put forward. The point is made that it would bring about the resolving of Partition, that there would be a much speedier confrontation, that there would be a greater hope of taking on the Unionists and having a right &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the Orange order, that you would stand to resolve the question on a Dublin-London basis by abolishing Stormont and getting it out of the way.  It is in fact an argument which has certain attractions. Many Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have found themselves carried away by this argument on occasions. It is important that we should consider this argument and try to come to grips with it.  Indeed the argument has gained a certain unfortunate, undesirable, validity with the withdrawal &mdash;in my opinion the mistaken withdrawal&mdash;of the Social Democratic and Labour Party members from Stormont.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the tension, the provocation, the emotional setting and the sense of utter frustration and futility which surrounded that decision of Opposition members in Northern Ireland.  It is important to record that, notwithstanding their action, none of those members formally proposed that, Stormont itself should be abolished. Rather as a protest, as a massive rejection, particularly of some of the actions of the Prime Minister, notably his kowtowing to the Orange Lodge hierarchy, they lost so much faith in him in, one might say, a fortnight they withdrew in disgust.</P>
    <P>The argument for the abolition of Stormont has gained a certain momentum <Col N="3641" /> because of that reaction.  That very understandable reaction, to the tragic deaths of two young men in Derry. One can appreciate the decision particularly of men such as John Hume never known for their hysteria and men who are not known for their demagogic reaction, men who act with the greatest sobriety; they certainly cannot be faulted because of that decision. However, I believe, in retrospect, that the decision was not the appropriate one at the time.  It was a decision of desperation and one which I am quite certain can be set right, must be set right and will, I think, be part of the solution which must be brought about in discussions between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and between the Opposition themselves and Mr. Brian Faulkner later this year.</P>
    <P>It is important to appreciate also that many of the non-Unionists in other parts of Northern Ireland have had a marked reduction in their enthusiasm for the very rickety institution which is the present Stormont Parliament where for so many decades power was so completely abused and so many injustices were connived at. They certainly were not impressed by the way Stormont has muddled through crisis after crisis.  Since the British Government changed in June, 1970, and the British Conservative Party took over, I would find it difficult to blame many people for saying: &ldquo;Well, here we are now again with another British Conservative administration and the former powers of Stormont to inflict injustice on the minority will be reinstated by the Tories.  We would be better off without Stormont.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I still argue that nothwithstanding all these defects and deficiencies and inherent imbalances in the northern Parliamentary set-up, such as it is, they are not sufficient reason for wishing on us the abolition of that institution.  The alternative proposed by the IRA, the alternative proposed by the provisionals, the alternative proposed by some sections of the official Sinn Féin organisation is the abolition or suspension of Stormont and total and direct rule from Westminster.  We should think out the logical follow-up to that kind of proposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3642" /> If we are to return to the 19th-century position, with Westminster ruling the north directly, without any Home Rule-style-Stormont existing and working, this will not forward the future aim of national unity one bit.  We certainly will not welcome that kind of development.  Therefore the answer must be in the negative.  We must remind ourselves as Members of this House, that the Unionists never particularly wanted Stormont.  Captain O'Neill recalled the attitude of Unionists in an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> on 31st August, 1969, when he said that the Unionists of those days did not want any local devolution but that they wanted total political integration into the United Kingdom similar to that of Scotland and Wales.  To look for this today is to seek to have the north even more integrated into the United Kingdom than hitherto&mdash;that is if we advocate the abolition of Stormont and direct rule from Westminster. That is why I stand opposed to it, and I certainly stand opposed in no uncertain manner to the proposition of the Sinn Féin Party and of the IRA in Northern Ireland in relation to the abolition of Stormont.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on record again in this House that despite the total resort to the gun and the bullet and the booby trap and the killings in Northern Ireland, achievements have been secured, small as some of them have been, and not intangible in many respects as many of them have been, by operating through Stormont with pressure from Westminster.  They have not been so inconsequential as any sober analysis would show.  It took a tremendous effort to have Craig sacked when he was a Stormont Minister.  For many months the Civil Rights Movement destroyed the unity of the Unionist Party.  There were demands for reform and there was pressure from the British Government.  The total control of Derry Corporation by the Unionists was broken.  There was the winning of the commitment by the Unionist Government to the universal local government franchise.  That was won through Stormont in many ways. The ceaseless activities of the Opposition members in Stormont gained that <Col N="3643" /> in many respects again with pressure and assistance from Westminster.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a parliamentary commissioner was a gain which was won by using Stormont for what it was worth.  The commission to investigate complaints against local authorities and public bodies, the introduction of the points system in local authority housing in Northern Ireland&mdash;and incidentally since the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is present that is a points system which is far more equitable than that which operates in many local authorities in the Republic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>If they would operate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Only a very small minority of the local authorities in the Republic operate a points system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks well on paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We had agreement in Stormont to the setting up of a community relations ministry and a community relations board.  These are achievements, for what they are worth. They were Opposition demands.  They were Civil Rights demands and they were introduced.  Whether or not all these reforms operate effectively, whether there is any real drive or impetus by the Unionist administration behind them, whether or not Mr. Maudling the British Home Secretary insists on the reforms being implemented and operated day in and day out, are different questions.  These are questions which we must come to in connection with the Taoiseach's visit to London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the legislation to outlaw religious discrimination and incitement to discrimination in Northern Ireland.  That was tentatively unfolded in Stormont.  The commission to draw up the boundaries for new local government areas was another achievement. These were achievements of consequence.  It would be highly paradoxical and very perverse in the light of the achievements which were hard won, in the teeth of opposition and in the teeth of brutality on <Col N="3644" /> some occasions, and the Civil Rights movement having struggled so hard to win acceptance of the principle of one man-one vote in Northern Ireland and the abolition of gerrymandering, if some of them were now to look for the abolition of the very Parliament in which those reforms would give them in the future we would hope, pending the evolution of a national settlement, a greater say and greater influence than they ever had before.  If Stormont were abolished and we had 12 MPs going over to London, instead of having one man/one vote, we would have the classic situation of one man/no vote&mdash; essentially the kind of situation in which Derry city finished up by being administered by an appointed commission with no elected role and no local participation or involvement.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we come to the Taoiseach's meeting in London in late October.  I am disappointed that the meeting is not earlier.  I do not like to see any Irish Prime Minister getting the brush-off and that, in fact, is what the Taoiseach got with the setting of the meeting in late October.  The Labour Party leader rightly said this morning that we should not hold out any false hopes about this meeting.  A certain euphoria has been generated about what may evolve in the way of constitutional reforms for Northern Ireland, or about the prospect of setting up a council for Ireland, or the prospect of some miracle solution emerging from these discussions.  This morning the path to reconciliation will be very long and very arduous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>He cannot be blamed for any euphoria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept that. The Parliamentary Secretary is quite proper in making that comment and I would accept his point.  I think the euphoria was generated more outside than inside the House in terms of interpretation of what is likely to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I always have in the back of my mind the fact that there is a temptation for any political party in power to use occasions in the glare of international publicity and to use them, as the occasion of the Minister for <Col N="3645" /> Foreign Affairs' visit to the United States was used, as holding out unattainable hopes and prospects.  I think, therefore, that the Taoiseach in going to London has the authority to point out in no uncertain manner to the British Government that the Westminster Parliament, which has, after all, supreme authority under article 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, has the authority to exert a very considerable influence on the situation in Northern Ireland.  I think the Taoiseach goes to London in what I would call a one-dimensional divisional sense, because if I would find fault with the Garden of Remembrance speech, it would be that it was in the classic Fianna Fáil mould of the one-dimensional style of approach, the kind of approach which was so beloved of a former Taoiseach, President de Valera, that some day, by some sleight of hand or some political miracle, Dublin and London would mutually, and to their everlasting credit and satisfaction, resolve the national question.</P>
    <P>Of course, you do not approach Partition and the divisions in the minds of Irish people, North and South, on a one-dimensional basis.  Dublin, Opposition and Government, and Belfast and London must be involved totally and mutually, with complete involvement and complete interchange of opinions and ideas and no behind doors, cloak and dagger style arrangement has the slightest hope of bringing about success.  I think this is important if we are to have any hope of bringing about the political reunification of the country.  I think it is important that the Taoiseach in the Garden of Remembrance speech did not stress that adequately.  I do not think it is enough to say, on an implied threat basis, that the guarantees which are reposed in the British Parliament under Article 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, namely, the right of Westminster to legislate directly for civil and democratic rights in Northern Ireland&mdash;admittedly, Westminster has that right&mdash;should be used.  For the Taoiseach to imply that that right should be used exclusively to bring the Unionist Government to heel, as one might say, in Northern Ireland is a rather counter-productive approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3646" /> Nevertheless, I think the Taoiseach does go to London with the support and goodwill of everybody in the Republic, and certainly with the support and understanding of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party.  However, I think he goes as a captive, as a rather unfortunate captive, because he goes with the legacy of the Fianna Fáil policy on Partition, and this is the nub of the question again, because behind the whole theory, if one could regard Fianna Fáil policy on Partition as constituting a theory as such, we have the implied suggestion, the implied approach which was very much coined&mdash;that is not a derogatory term but the appropriate term&mdash;by Mr. de Valera in the Twenties when he indicated, before and after he entered this House and came to power, that it would be in many respects morally justifiable to re-unite the country by force, only, he said, if it were practicable, which of course, as I pointed out earlier on is quite out of the question.  Thus, while rejecting the coercion of the North, which incidentally I would point out to all the Provisionals today, Mr. de Valera had the good sense to reject as early as 1921, the impression has always remained within the Fianna Fáil &ldquo;theory on Partition&rdquo; that this is all being done as a kind of act of grace and favour on the part of Fianna Fáil because it does not possess the forces for coercion and therefore it will have to rely on unity of mind.</P>
    <P>I think that as most of the Fianna Fáil policy on Partition and most of the thinking of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party relies exclusively, one might say, on the basis of a great many of the highly ambiguous statements of Mr. de Valera on the question of Partition we find ourselves in this kind of confusion today, the kind of confusion where the Taoiseach can say that he is following the policy of Mr. de Valera, of Mr. Lemass and of previous leaders of his Party, all at the one time, and nobody questions that kind of statement.  I think the Fianna Fáil Party is slowly coming to grips with the fact that it has clung to a doctrine which is very difficult to reconcile with the non-coercion one that the <Col N="3647" /> problem of Partition is one that can be resolved by negotiation between Dublin and London and in many respects this is the logical follow-through of the Taoiseach's visit to London.</P>
    <P>We have had quite a few statements in the past history of this country from Mr. de Valera, and indeed from Deputy Aiken, that if only the British Government could be prevailed on to declare that a united Ireland is the policy of the British Government, then the problem would be well on the way to a general solution, and implied in that is the suggestion that the whole thing could be wrapped up within a few years, or indeed a few months.</P>

      <P>I am now interpreting the main Fianna Fáil theory.  This was resurrected around 1947 when we had the great anti-Partition process&mdash;I remember as a child flicking through these magnificent publications, with the Border going through various cottages and so on; I was quite taken by it&mdash; and a great deal of it was true but a great deal of it had not got relevance in terms of solution.  It implied that the resistance of the Six-County Protestants to re-unification is not very deeply rooted and that it is quite capable of being modified and reduced and removed by a change of policy in London, backed no doubt, as the Taoiseach implied in the Garden of Remembrance speech, by economic pressure such as the threatened removal of subsidies to Northern Ireland, financial and otherwise.  This line of thought implies that while we would not ourselves as a nation coerce the people of Northern Ireland&mdash;and we are not capable of doing so anyway&mdash;nevertheless they could at least be coerced in the <Col N="3648" /> future, either by means of parliamentary reform or by economic pressures and perhaps financial inducements by London itself.  I think this is a very wrong, fruitless and futile kind of policy and that is why I say that the Taoiseach goes to London with our support and our understanding of the situation but with no false hopes or prospects of an immediate solution.</P>
      <P>Nobody who has given any time at all to understanding the attitude of the Northern Protestants, nobody who has studied their history and their attitudes over the past 150 years or more, could share the optimistic belief of some political commentators in the newspapers that there might be a fundamental change in policy, either following a hint from London or pressure from London, or for that matter, economic pressure from London.  I think though we must accept that such pressure could bring about a change in the system in Northern Ireland.  It could also bring about a considerable change in the internal system of government in Northern Ireland.  Let that be the product of the Taoiseach's visit to London.  It is part of the development of Irish history, as we try to foresee it, and partcularly a change affecting the position of the minority in Northern Ireland.  This is my hope for the outcome of the London talks.  If I may presume to interpret the very extensive work done by the Labour Party spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, certainly from his quite extensive contacts both with British Labour Party and political opinion in London I do not think we would hold out a view which would be as optimistic as some people have tended to hold out for the resolving of the problems of Northern Ireland.  I certainly feel, with him, that a sober calculation of the chances of solving the problem of Partition through agreement with London and by overriding the Northern Protestants with aid from London show this idea to be chimerical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts of life about the situation in Northern Ireland.  The facts of life there are surrounded by political and historic truisms which, though they may be repeated very often, have to be slept on every night.  The hope <Col N="3649" /> we hold out that Dublin and London will do a deal in October which will resolve the problem shows a lack of understanding of the cultural and political ill-health and the deep psychological ill-health of the Ulster community at the moment.  When I hear so many of the sectarian overtones in the republican one-denominational style I have to take out the 1961 census of Northern Ireland and remind myself that we have there a multi-denominational society, a politically stricken pluralistic society, a society in which the influences of religious sectarianism and tribalism is at the highest in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>In the publication issued by the Northern Ireland Society of Labour Lawyers there is a breakdown of religious professions of persons as a percentage of the community in Northern Ireland.  I would recommend that every Fianna Fáil Deputy should sleep on the implications of the statistics given in the 1961 census in Northern Ireland.  It has never been placed on the records of the House in the formal sense.  In 1961, 497,000 persons, or 34.9 per cent of the population, were Roman Catholic; the Presbyterians numbered 413,000, or 29 per cent; the Church of Ireland numbered 344,000 or 24 per cent; the Methodists numbered 71,800, or 5 per cent; the Baptists numbered 14,000, or 1 per cent; The Congregationalists numbered 9,000, or 0.7 per cent; the Unitarians numbered 5,600, or 0.4 per cent; &ldquo;others&rdquo; numbered 23,4000, or 1.6 per cent; and &ldquo;not stated&rdquo; numbered 28,000, or 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is important in the Republic of Ireland, a nation in which so many people in the Republic use the phrase &ldquo;a 95 per cent Catholic nation&rdquo;, to point out that out of 1,425,000 persons in Northern Ireland in 1961, 497,000 were Roman Catholics and the other religious groups formed the remainder of the population.  I would ask the House to ponder on that fact of life in relation to Northern Ireland. Most electors in the Republic do not seem to appreciate the full implications of the fact that in the Westminster General Election of 1959 almost 500,000 of the electorate who voted <Col N="3650" /> gave their votes to pro-Partition candidates. In that election 500,000 people gave a pro-Partition vote and only 84,000 people voted for anti-Partition candidates.  The position generally was not that much changed in the Stormont Election in 1969 when 72 per cent of the poll elected 36 Unionists, three Independent Unionists, six Nationalists, two Republican Labour, two Northern Ireland Labour and three Independents.  The total electorate at that particular election was 912,000, but with seven uncontested seats in Northern Ireland the number of voters was 778,000.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming electoral support for Unionist candidates was self-evident in that election.  This is a fact of life that everybody in the Republic should consider.  Reality cannot be wished away.  Gerrymander or no gerrymander, there is generally a one man/one vote system in operation in Westminster elections.  All sober Irishmen and women would do well to ponder on the elementary political, social, and religious facts of life in Northern Ireland.  Those who plot guerilla warfare from Kevin Street or, for that matter, from Gardiner Place would ignore these facts of life in terms of changing the political structure of Northern Ireland by the use of the gun, but they would ignore these things at a terrible cost.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the visit of the Taoiseach to Westminster in October, I feel it is going to take a great deal more arduous work by this House over many decades before we can overcome the fact that we had a Cromwellian Settlement in 1649 which entailed the driving out of, one might say, the then almost entire native Irish population. They were replaced by settlers of the Scottish Presbyterian stock and by the big English landlords and merchants&mdash;who of course got the lion's share at that time.  A large number of the Presbyterians and Protestants were reduced very quickly to the status of tenants in that historic settlement.  This is the settlement we are coming to grips with today.  No amount of rhetoric from Mr. Kevin Boland about eradicating the history of British rule in Ireland <Col N="3651" /> is going to overcome the reality that there are in Northern Ireland 1,000,000 people whose forbears have been there for several centuries&mdash;and whose descendants will probably be there for several centuries to come&mdash; who will not, be coerced even if they are pushed far enough by the gun with a crucifix on one side and a shamrock on the other side and expelled either back to England or to the Scottish Highlands.</P>
    <P>This is not the kind of Algerian situation with which so many provisionals, Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil republicans try to draw an analogy.  It should be remembered that many of the people in Northern Ireland who are in a state of extreme tension about the activities of the IRA have extensive military training which they got with the former B Specials, the RUC, the Ulster Defence Regiment, the Ulster Volunteers and their own internal militia.  Many of them have a long family involvement with the British Army.  I certainly do not wish to see a civil war fought out in these terms.</P>
    <P>We must accept that what we witness on many occasions in Northern Ireland is the extreme form of political tribalism, particularly epitomised in the personal attitude of Ian Paisley.  We have his counterpart here in terms of the Kevin Boland-Blaney axis.  In recent months in the political speeches of Ian Paisley there have been heavy insertions of extreme Protestant piety&mdash;a kind of jingo devotion to the long lost and vanished British Empire.  There is a perpetual historic recollection of service in the arms of the British Crown forces.  With that kind of attitude it is extremely difficult for many republicans to contain themselves and refrain from reacting in like manner.  The introverted reactions of the extremists in Northern Ireland is one of the big dangers of the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are going to change their attitude but we can reach for reconciliation and brotherhood with hundreds of thousands of the majority community in Northern Ireland.  I do not believe that the 1,000,000 people in Northern Ireland <Col N="3652" /> all share to the same degree of tension the kind of near-hysterical religious militancy of Ian Paisley.  It would be an intellectual travesty if they did.  I do not believe the people on the majority side&mdash;to use the comfortable term&mdash;in Northern Ireland share the local demogogic tradition of the Ian Paisleys, the Craigs or the John Taylors.  The kind of trumpeting career which John Taylor has had reflects the extreme neurosis of the Protestant majority.  I do not think we can accept that the demagogic heights which these spokesmen reach represent the broad national community concensus in Northern Ireland.  I have too much respect for all shades of opinion in Northern Ireland to think that that kind of nostalgic politics would indeed have total control over the situation.</P>
    <P>I feel that fact must go on record and that is why I welcome the Taoiseach's visit to London.  When the people in the north hear Kevin Boland and Deputy Blaney they have a right to be assured by us that we do not share their views, because unlike some Fianna Fáil Deputies I am not at my happiest when I am attending a funeral in a republican cemetery.  I can not accept the statement made by Deputy Blaney, when he was a Minister, on 9th November, 1968, when he said:</P>
    <P>The Stormont Prime Minister assumes the right to talk, as he so often glibly does &lsquo;for the people of Ulster.&rsquo; I come from the most northerly part of Ulster and I absolutely deny his right to speak on the Border question for me or the hundreds of thousands of nationally-minded people in the Six Counties, or the people of the three free counties of Ulster.</P>
    <P>That kind of absolute denial from a Cabinet Minister is a good start to polarisation; it is not a good start to dialogue and that is why Deputy Blaney was ditched when the crisis came.  He should have been ditched when he made that statement on 9th November, 1968 because when one Irishman denies absolutely the right of another to talk for and on behalf of another Irishman we know we are dealing with the extremes of political attitudes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3653" /> We hope Mr. Edward Heath will be in good form when the Taoiseach goes to London.  We hope he will have won his joust with the sea&mdash;that might have an historic impact on Irish national unity&mdash;because I understand his reactions tend to resolve around his prospects at admiralship.  No kind of tea party in London will obliterate the fact that there exists a rigid Catholic-Protestant class structure in Northern Ireland. One might ask who is to blame for that&mdash;the politicians or the priests?  I do not think we need look very far if we are to apportion responsibility in that regard.  There is a deep conservatism in the extremes of both religions in Northern Ireland&mdash;let us be under no illusions about that.  Deputy FitzGerald alluded to it very strongly in his speech.  On the Catholic side there is the belief that the whole truth is theirs alone; there is an equal certitude on the Protestant side that not only is the whole truth theirs alone but that the Republic is the sole preserve of the Roman Catholic Church.</P>
    <P>It is only when one begins to appreciate the deep cultural, social and political sickness of Northern Ireland that one understands the spiritual sickness prevalent in that community.  I submit the attitude of the Catholic Church in Northern Ireland to marriage, to marital practices, to private morality and to education in Northern Ireland has made a profound contribution towards the political situation and the polarisation of sectarian thought in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking at a Tuairim debate a few years ago about segregated Catholic education in Northern Ireland.  A young nun from Belfast became most irate; she assured me that this kind of policy in the past decade, and the religious education given to young Catholics in regard to fraternisation and marriage with Protestants, of social intermingling with Protestants and interpretation of their religion, had no impact on the social or political climate in Northern Ireland. From what I could gather of the political and spiritual paranoia of the Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, I found it difficult to accept this was so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3654" /> There is also deep Catholic and Nationalist hatred of the settlement of the 1700s and they have reacted with even greater paranoia.  Although the Taoiseach has the best wishes of this House, he is going to London a very sober man with these chilling realities in Northern Ireland.  I might add these realities are not taught in our schools or universities; they are not taught in our social study conferences; they are not analysed by Irish people, North or South; and, as a result, they are not discussed in an open manner in relation to the position in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the solutions that will be advocated in London will be the federal solution.  We should stop talking a lot of nonsense about this subject.  When I hear the Taoiseach talking about the federal solution and then hear the former Deputy, Kevin Boland, speak about the matter, I realise it is a throwback to a kind of mystical solution Fianna Fáil once used for getting out of a jam.  When the former Taoiseach, now President de Valera, said that coercion would not be used following 1921 it was necessary for him to have another solution and, therefore, he discovered the federal solution.  This has now entered the canon law of Fianna Fáil theories for solving Partition.</P>
    <P>The proposition is that once British groups were out of the way agreement would be reached because the Ulster Protestants&mdash;being a minority nationally&mdash;would be forced to come to terms with the majority.  It is suggested that we would offer them extremely generous terms&mdash;we would offer them a federal solution.  Naturally it would be absolute folly on their part not to accept this solution and, therefore, the Taoiseach is off to London.  There is this kind of glib anticipation that perhaps he will come back with a federal solution.</P>
    <P>It would be dishonest if we did not accept that the thinking behind this suggestion is the idea of coercion because the majority in Northern Ireland have not the slightest interest in a federal solution.  The Fianna Fáil development of this possible solution is combined with the quite unwarranted and arrogant idea that, whereas the <Col N="3655" /> convictions of Nationalists are deeply rooted and worthy of respect, those of the Unionists are shallow, are based only on historical personal advantage and will be easily abandoned for motives of greed or fear.  This is an extremely dangerous error.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong proposition advanced by the Provisionals that the British troops should get out immediately, that they should not be here at all, and so the argument goes on. If British troops were withdrawn, I have no doubt this would be followed by a civil war in Ireland.  In many ways this would be precipitated by the Unionists attempting to reimpose their will on minority areas, particularly in Derry.  One could visualise the extreme backlash once the British troops had departed.  The Protestants would decide to settle the question; the Craigs and the Paisleys would achieve a victory if the British troops moved out and they would proceed to bring pressure on Brian Faulkner to precipitate a civil war.</P>
    <P>If the majority in Northern Ireland sought to reimpose their will, particularly in Derry, there would be intervention across the Border.  The only prognosis we can come to in this matter is that it would be an extremely bloody civil war.  It would involve the massacre of a fairly large proportion of Catholics in Belfast and would probably involve the massacre of a large number of Protestants in Derry.  It would be quite inconclusive and would leave the country more divided than ever.  Although we might have a quite different Border, without question relations between the Republic and Northern Ireland would be more bitter and confused.</P>
    <P>Therefore, no sane person can talk realistically about British troops leaving Northern Ireland overnight.  I am as resentful and as unhappy and as opposed as any person to the extreme actions of British troops in Northern Ireland on occasions, and I shall always condemn that kind of action by British troops.  It is a question of what will happen if another proposition develops.  I was perturbed, therefore, <Col N="3656" /> when I read the reaction of Mr. Kevin Boland, the former Minister for Local Government, who gave an hour long interview at his home in Rathcoole on November 6th, 1970.  He was then talking in a Fianna Fáil context and he said:</P>
    <P>That solution might very well involve a certain arrangement to begin with&mdash;two Parliaments in a Federal Irish State and it might be that because of certain fears the majority in the Six Counties would seek a certain measure of autonomy, but that could be worked out around the conference table.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>For some time the 32-county State would contain a dissident minority and we might have to adopt the same methods as Stormont have been adopting for 50 years to keep the dissident minority in subjection.</P>
    <P>This is what he said would be the development of the use of force in Northern Ireland.  It is ironic that so many of the Fianna Fáil official policies on Partition support a federal solution as also does Kevin Boland.  I could give several quotations of Deputy Blaney who time and again has advocated a federal solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney, of course, has a much more exotic version.  He has us all travelling to Armagh, of all places.  The last time an Irish Parliamentarian travelled to Armagh was when Mr. de Valera, in the middle of the night and in relation to a certain piece of legislation, hotfooted it to Armagh and made his views known in no uncertain manner to a certain gentleman.  A letter to a newspaper was promptly withdrawn.  I do not think any Irish Parliamentarian is seriously upset by the proposition of Deputy Blaney that we should have an assembly of all-Ireland in Armagh as though this in fact would be a solution to partition.</P>
    <P>The federal solution is not one for which I see very much hope because the majority in Northern Ireland are not particularly interested in it, the minority in Northern Ireland have no particular illusions about it and the only people who are impressed by it <Col N="3657" /> are of course the professional republican politicians who seek to cash in on that kind of development.  I feel we should be very circumspect in the Republic about giving advice to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was a statement issued by the regional executive of the Six County Republican Clubs this week and this was quoted in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 4th August, 1971.  The article stated:</P>
    <P>A statement issued by the Regional Executive of the Six County Republican Clubs last night stated that Mr. Kevin Boland sought &ldquo;to pimp off the sufferings and sacrifices of the Northern people by identifying himself with the continuing national struggle in the North&rdquo;. It claimed that the aim of the new republican party was to defeat the Lynch administration and return Mr. Haughey and Mr. Blaney to power within Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I will not quote the full statement but that part alone shows the reaction of the Northern Ireland Republican Clubs.  Indeed, they have something to say about Deputy Blaney who often expressed appreciation for and understanding of the republican movement in Northern Ireland.  They stated:</P>
    <P>But when Mr. Blaney was Minister for Agriculture he was quick to protect the robber rights of the &lsquo;belted earls&rsquo; of Ireland's rivers and lakes. These same &lsquo;belted earls&rsquo; pimp on one of Ireland's finest national resources with the full support of Mr. Lynch and the additional promised support of the Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, but neither Messrs. Blaney nor Boland will complain.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Taoiseach will have to press very strongly in London to ensure that the reforms in Northern Ireland giving elementary protection to the minority in Northern Ireland are in no way diluted, are in no way mitigated or circumscribed by the Faulkner Government.  He will have to ensure that the British Army are not used in a situation in Northern Ireland in which, as is now developing in England, a military solution might <Col N="3658" /> be regarded as the only solution to the tragic situation in the north.</P>
    <P>Successive GOCs in Northern Ireland have repeatedly pointed out that a military solution is not on.  I should hope that Mr. Ted Heath and Mr. Maudling, for whom I have a great regard, would not be tempted into the typical British Army 30-day solution and have a holocaust.  The Taoiseach, provided he still has the opportunity of making the point, should stress in no uncertain manner that no military solution is ever likely to bring about peace in Northern Ireland.  There is great support for that type of solution in the British Press and British public opinion but of course they have never been known for their sensitivity in terms of the peculiar national problems affecting this island.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should also press very strongly to ensure that legislative guarantees against discrimination, on grounds of religion, in regard to the allocation of jobs or housing, and that legislation outlawing incitement and religious discrimination in Northern Ireland should be operated with full impartiality and supervision by Westminister, if necessary.  There might also be a better system of independent inquiry into grievances which develop and inquiries which are called for in relation to members of the police force or the operations of the British Army in Northern Ireland.  The refusal of the British Army forces in Northern Ireland to agree to an independent inquiry into the death of two civilians in Derry was a stupid blunder.  Inquiries into complaints which are warranted should be held and should be seen to be fully in operation on all occasions in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach has the obligation to insist on that kind of approach.</P>
    <P>Also he should insist on the setting up of an impartial Westminster boundary commission to draw up fair local government areas and electoral divisions and thus prevent the prospect of a new-style gerrymander as was contained in the Faulkner plan for local government reform.  This is warranted and the Taoiseach should insist on it in his submission to the British Government. The Heath-Lynch consultations <Col N="3659" /> should also make it mandatory in the future for Stormont to employ the PR system of election with, I would suggest, though it goes against the grain, a single transferable vote both for Stormont and local government elections.  PR was introduced by the British Government and it existed in Northern Ireland in the early twenties. It was abolished within a few years because it proved far too advantageous to non-Unionists.  In Derry and Enniskillen there were Nationalist majorities. The reintroduction of PR would be a very favourable approach.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Taoiseach is in difficulty having regard to the Government's recent decision in the Republic to have PR abolished.  The advantages of it in Northern Ireland are quite patent.  It is not only the fairest and most democratic system&mdash;certainly I would not be here if it were not for PR&mdash;but it would have the merit also of giving the Unionist Party a choice between its own extremes.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should be courageous enough also to advocate institutional changes in Northern Ireland.  Mr. John Hume has spoken of them.  The Unionists see red when one talks about constitutional changes but I do not see anything unusually inappropriate in having one-third of the Cabinet in Northern Ireland statutorily reserved for Opposition members.  This might be regarded in Northern Ireland as a peculiar variation of democratic rule but if there is to be any reorganisation of any functional organisation under Stormont, I feel the minority must have some participation in government and in the Parliamentary cabinet institutional control structure.  One must get the Opposition out of the Opposition straightjacket in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is why it would be well for the Taoiseach to put forward this type of proposition.  Mr. John Hume, as far back as 18th May, 1964, wrote this in an article in the <i>Northern Catholic,</i> quoted in the <i>Irish Times</i>.  He was referring to the Nationalist Opposition:</P>
    <P>In 40 years of opposition they have not produced one constructive contribution on either the social or economic plane to the development <Col N="3660" /> of Northern Ireland which is, after all, a substantial part of the United Ireland for which they strive.  Leadership has been the comfortable leadership of flags and slogans.  Easy no doubt but irresponsible.  There has been no attempt to be positive, to encourage the Catholic community to develop the resources which they have in plenty, to make a positive contribution in terms of community service.  Unemployment and emigration, chiefly of Catholics, remains heavy, much of it no doubt due to the skilful placing of industry by the Northern Government, but the only constructive suggestion from the Nationalist side would appear to be that a removal of discrimination will be the panacea for all our ills.  It is this lack of positive contribution and the apparent lack of interest in the general welfare of Northern Ireland that has led many Protestants to believe that the Northern Catholic is politically irresponsible and immature and therefore unfit to rule.</P>
    <P>That makes interesting reading and is food for thought for many of us.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, welcome the proposed meeting of the Taoiseach and Mr. Heath.  In this evening's <i>Evening Press</i> there is a London report by Aidan Hennigan which states that the former Labour Home Secretary, Mr. J. Callaghan, in the House of Commons called on the British Government to establish an all-Ireland council.  He also asked that the Taoiseach and the Stormont Premier should be invited to London forthwith for consultations with the British Government.  The report says Mr. Callaghan was listened to with complete attention by members on all sides of the House and after he sat down he was told by the Home Secretary, Mr. Maudling, that his suggestions would be studied intently.</P>
    <P>While I have reservations about Mr. Callaghan's understanding of the position in Northern Ireland, I would go along with that approach.  It is reasonable and one can support it.  I also go along with the demand of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for reforms in Northern Ireland.  I had the privilege last month of being a delegate to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions <Col N="3661" /> conference with Deputy Corish and I met several hundred trade union members from unions in Northern Ireland and participated in discussions with them.  There are 250,000 trade union members in Northern Ireland affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I have known many of the delegates for many years.  In 1969 the Irish Congress of Trade Unions issued what they regarded as the basis of reform in Northern Ireland.  It was headed &ldquo;A Programme for Peace&rdquo; and it was issued by the Northern Ireland committee. Many of the reforms suggested have been introduced.  Their full implementation is still in question.  Certainly the statement issued by the committee after a meeting with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland at the time, Mr. Chicester Clarke, contained the basis for normalising politics in that region. The ten reforms listed in the reform programme of the Ulster Movement are steps in the right direction.  Admittedly they pale into insignificance when you have, on the one hand, a gun and, on the other, an unarmed civilian or a British soldier.  For too long in Irish history the gun has been the magic wand for sounding community relations.</P>
    <P>These suggested reforms must be taken seriously.  They form a major starting point and there devolves on the Protestant community in particular, irrespective of any history of violence in recent months, the responsibility of ensuring that the word &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo; retains its honourable connotation in Irish history.  The best way in which that can be done is by deliberately implementing and encouraging these reforms.  The ghettos, in many ways a legacy of Protestant domination, and the victimisation in regard to employment, and so forth, will have to disappear. Political justice and even political hygiene demand these reforms. The Protestant community will see its finest flowering when the John Taylors are removed from the political scene. When his kind of articulate bigotry and prejudice are removed there will be hope for political commonsense. Dynamite and gelignite have been used as destructive agents, but it must be remembered that both dynamite and gelignite can make a positive contribution. <Col N="3662" /> They can clear away obstacles. Dynamite could clear away some of the frustration, the fear of confrontation, the twisted political thought and the sterile politics.  Dynamite could clear new ground.</P>
    <P>No group has done more by way of contributing towards peace than has the trade union movement.  Last month in Limerick we had 400 or 500 delegates, many of them with their wives, representing over 500,000 members, sitting down together, as no other group in this country can do, setting aside divisions which have beset our people for so long, political divisions, cultural divisions, spiritual divisions and ideological divisions.  They did that in the confines of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>The late Jim Larkin, a former President of Congress and a Labour Deputy in this House, speaking in Belfast in 1949 spoke very vehemently about the Government of Ireland Act, 1949.  He said:</P>
    <P>This special character of the movement is of particular importance today when such persistent attempts are made to single out and emphasise the differences and the peculiarities of the common people rather than their essential unity.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the late Jim Larkin made an impassioned and rational appeal, speaking as a trade union leader from Dublin and as a politician, for national unity.  He made that appeal in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Despite ponderous dissertations on the existence of &ldquo;two races&rdquo; by politicians who, in their second breath, use the generic term &ldquo;Irishmen&rdquo; for people both North and South, no Irishman, whether from the Shankill Road or the Falls Road, whether from Derry or Cork, denies his Irish birth, disowns his native land or fails to proudly assert his right to be known as an &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo;. It can be further stated, without fear of contradiction, that whatever the political changes of recent years have brought in the way of division and even the apparent fixation of those divisions, no thought, other than that of the basic <Col N="3663" /> and essential unity of the Irish people, ever originated in the mind of any Irishman no matter where his political loyalties lay.</P>
    <P>If this underlying sense of unity is still deep down in the minds and hearts of our people, and why should it not be when these same people live together and pass among each other in their daily lives, finding a common purpose and interest in the hundred different facets of life, how much greater must that instinctive sense of unity be in such a movement as our Trade Union movement. Not merely have we such unity in an instinctive form, but we openly recognise and value it, and in our organisations, and in our Congress, have sought to give practical expression to our belief in the essential unity of the ordinary people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We, who meet here today, whether from North or South of the Boyne, have each in our own way worked and sacrificed to build and maintain a united Irish Trade Union movement of the workers in all arts and crafts of our common country. That instinctive desire for unity not only springs from our working-class concern with economic and social issues but also from our acceptance of our common heritage as Irish men and women.</P>
    <P>If our struggles to build and maintain a united Irish Trade Union movement carry their own justification then should we not, with equal frankness and fortitude, face the logical corollary&mdash;a united, political, economic and social system, attuned to the real needs of the working people and their future welfare&mdash;a united nation and people living together in amity and liberty, bound together by a love for and an acceptance of democracy in its true sense, respecting each other's views and acknowledging each other's rights...</P>
    <P>In this Trade Union movement of ours we have always tried to keep clear heads, to resist the blandishments of politicians and apply ourselves to furthering the welfare of the working people.  If, therefore, I speak <Col N="3664" /> of the fruitful word &ldquo;unity&rdquo;, I do not do so in any light-minded or inconsequential manner.  I know only too well that in the clash and conflict of the political arena, the picture has been drawn only in stark black and white, the issue presented so uncompromisingly as to become a monstrous obstacle, and no opportunity allowed for thought as to what there is in common where we touched and found contact, but rather a never-ending emphasis on what divides and frustrates us.</P>
    <P>I think these were prophetic, historic and appropriate words.  He concluded by saying:</P>
    <P>If ordinary people live together they have to learn to adjust their personal likes and dislikes, their idiosyncracies and differences, to compromise, to live and let live.  If two or more sections of the Irish people, holding different viewpoints on vital issues, are to live together then they also must solve the problem of adjustment the same as individuals. But so embittered and bedevilled has this whole problem become, so much have the slogans &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; or &ldquo;unity by force, if not by consent&rdquo; become the daily catch cries of the fanatics on both sides, that the voice of reason, of understanding, is characterised as that of supine surrender.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not think that any Deputy or former Deputy could put our views in relation to this matter so clearly.  He went on in conclusion:</P>
    <P>Clearly if reason and adjustment, mutual understanding of conflicting views and problems is ever to be attained it can only be done by the Irish people themselves and the more flexible and impermanent are the barriers dividing us the greater the ultimate possibilities of reaching a basis of common endeavours. Equally, must this effort to approach each other be the accomplishment of the plain people rather than that of Government and parties.  It was for these reasons that the passage of &ldquo;The Ireland Act&rdquo; by the British House of Commons was viewed by <Col N="3665" /> many as a tragedy, arising from lack of understanding and appreciation of the whole problem.  The intrusion of an outside authority into a domestic Irish problem, the rigid fixing of a barrier which can have no ultimate permanency, because it is so contradictory to the instinctive beliefs of the Irish people North and South, and the placing of the decision as to any future change solely in the hands of a political caucus rather than leaving it to the people as such, all contributed to make this Act the subject of such reasoned and right-minded protest as that adopted by your National Executive.</P>
    <P>That was Jim Larkin in his presidental address if 1949.  I make no apology in this House for stressing it and for quoting very much at length his contribution because so very often he spoke with commonsense on problems affecting the people of this country.  He also gave some words of wisdom which I think the Taoiseach when he leaves for London next October should bear in mind.  We shall not meet in this House, I understand, until the end of October.  In regard to the relationship between the two countries and the hope of rapprochement he said:</P>
    <P>It might be argued that what has been done might well be left alone and that we, as trade unionists, should eschew politics, but to expect that the problem of our people's disunity will cease to be a continuing source of friction and frustration is to indulge in day dreams.  Better it is to face realities, and, even now, to seek a path along which reasonable men, and there are reasonable men on both sides of the quarrel, can approach each other and by contact discover if they can come closer together.  Let those of us who urge the unity of our common country examine the very real economic and financial problems which are involved in overcoming the present division and put forward our positive solution; let us state in definite and defined terms the undertakings we are prepared to give on issues of minority rights and questions of conscience.  Let us do so not through the changing character of a Government in office, but rather through the <Col N="3666" /> more permanent organisations of public opinion, the leaders and political parties, committing themselves jointly and severally in public declarations to the guarantees they feel called upon to provide to meet the reasonable views of the minority. Let us do so not in any expectation of immediate results or responses but rather as our declaration of good faith and our desire for harmony and friendship with all sections of our own people.</P>
    <P>Let us urge upon the Governments in both areas the need of utilising every opportunity for mutual exchange of views and, where possible, joint endeavours in dealing with problems of economic development, trade, transport and cultural extensions, so that our people may come to learn in a practical manner of the possibilities and advantages of co-operation.  Above all, let us not feel that any effort to find a bridge, however slender, across the gulf dividing the ordinary people, North and South, is a betrayal of principle or a compromise of positions.</P>
    <P>Certainly, we can respect the views of the former Deputy Jim Larkin who had such a perceptive understanding of the problems of Northern Ireland and who above all had a great entree into the minds of the Protestant working men of Belfast and who could never be accused of acting in a purely southern, republican manner.  This is perhaps the great contribution he made in his political life towards the national question.  Therefore I suggest to the Taoiseach that when in London he should try to hold out the hand of friendship.  Admittedly, it has to come through London but the hand of friendship has still to be extended to our fellow Irishmen in Northern Ireland, so that we can open up joint co-operation with Northern Ireland and have, I suggest, joint trading agreements and perhaps have in the future, for example, a joint tourist board in operation.  We might even extend to a greater degree the joint production of hydro-electric power.  There is also great scope for co-operation in forestry, inland waterways, sea and air transport and the marketing of livestock.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3667" /> There are many examples of co-operation in such matters as the sugar beet agreement.  There is an urgent need to share our commercial intelligence north and south in coping with the effects of the freeing of trade in Common Market conditions, particularly in such vulnerable industries as the textile industry.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely tragic that in our university life and in the life of our technical and technological colleges there is no cross-fertilisation of scientific and management research.  These possibilities must be explored.</P>
    <P>There must also be joint endeavour in the fishing industry so that we do not have the kind of artificial situation which arose when the fishermen from the north went down to Dunmore East and were bitterly resented although they were fellow Irishmen&mdash;and we talk of national unity.  I would hope to see co-operation in regard to fishing, fish canning and ancillary industries.  It is to the eternal credit of the late Mr. Seán Lemass, the former Taoiseach, that he took his courage in his hands and made that prophetic statement late in 1963:</P>
    <P>In the times we live in I believe that the rate of increase in the prosperity of North and South will be accelerated by co-operation in matters relating to industrial, agricultural and tourist development.</P>
    <P>There are many possibilities, which are well worth discussing, and I hope that Captain Terence O'Neill will agree, that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>And I would urge Deputies to bear this in mind</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;without political pre-conditions, arrangements for their discussion at whatever level is likely to be most fruitful, should now be made.</P>
    <P>How many former front bench members of the Fianna Fáil Party would make that kind of statement?  The Taoiseach says that his policy in relation to Northern Ireland is a reiteration of the policy of the President, Mr. Eamonn de Valera, and of the late Seán Lemass.  Let him reiterate, therefore, in London that as far as he is <Col N="3668" /> concerned: &ldquo;Without political pre-conditions... at whatever level is likely to be most fruitful&rdquo; we shall renew &ldquo;co-operation in matters relating to industrial, agricultural and tourist development.&rdquo;  The response which came at that time from Captain Terence O'Neill must also be put on record.  He said:</P>
    <P>It has been demonstrated in the past that there is no bar to specific co-operation measures, provided that these are of clear mutual benefit, have no political or constitutional undertones and can be carried out within our limited powers.</P>
    <P>That is the way it all began, that is the way it must continue.  The work started by the late Seán Lemass in opening up the prospect of mutual co-operation must be advanced if we are to honour his contribution to Irish political life.  In the past we had co-operation in, for example, electricity supply through the Erne Hydro-electric Scheme; in the sugar agreement between the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture and the Irish Sugar Company; in the setting up of joint committees on farming to deal with farming problems; or in the agreement, of which Deputy Blaney would not like to be reminded, between the Northern Ireland Fire Authority and the Donegal County Council under which Northern Ireland firemen crossed the Border into Donegal to fight fires.  Deputy Blaney, of course, never heard of that kind of mutual co-operation under the existing Northern Ireland administration.  The Foyle Fisheries Scheme also springs to mind, and the joint railway board which catered for north and south.  In none of these projects were there any political overtones.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of co-operation reared in relation to tourism and in relation to horticulture which is at a critical stage.  There is no doubt that in EEC conditions horticulture in both parts of the country is in for a terrible hammering.  I would go even as far as to say that economic and industrial co-operation could include the attraction and location of new industries. Regional planning resources should be pooled, and when it comes to cross-Border roads and the main arterial <Col N="3669" /> roads structure, the Border must be ignored, as it must also be ignored in the development of our natural resources, particularly mineral resources, the oil resources of the Continental Shelf and of the seas around this country.  Above all, when it comes to the exploitation of foreign markets for Irish-manufactured goods and agricultural products, north and south must be jointly involved.</P>
    <P>There is a great future for this country&mdash;and the gunmen of either extreme, north or south, cannot stop that development&mdash;in the struggle for national unity and the evolution towards a pluralist society, of an Irish social democracy, and the bringing in of a better parliamentary system, north and south.  This is being given a rather perverse momentum and in the south the Government must remove the clauses from the 1937 Constitution which show sectarian influences.  They must do this not only as a gesture towards national unity but also as the evolution of a more democratic political structure in the Republic itself.</P>
    <P>The relevant recommendations of the all-Party committee on the Constitution should be implemented with that aim in view.  I am disturbed and upset and, indeed, one would want to have a thick skin not to become cynical in the process when I think about the disgraceful treatment that was given for example, to the request by an Irish Senator&mdash;Senator Mary Robinson&mdash;in an Irish Seanad to have a Private Member's Bill published.  All she requested was the simple democratic right to have the Bill printed and circulated to Members of the House. She did not ask that it be even debated but with a kind of brutish parliamentary destructive negativism, Senator Ó Maoláin, the leader of the Upper House as we call it, decided to guillotine it savagely out of the way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling but it is a new one to me.  It is an odd ruling but if it is true that is all the more reason why we need constitutional and parliamentary reform.  In <Col N="3670" /> any event, Private Member's Bills that are an expression of democracy, regardless of whether one may agree or disagree with their content&mdash;that is entirely a different question&mdash;should be allowed so that members of both Houses would have the right to have their political views printed and circulated for public debate.  At least this would give the Desmond Fennells and the Joe Foyles of this life something concrete to argue about.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I assert that our constitutional and social legislation should be reformed immediately.  There is a real need for an appreciation of the cost of unity, north and south, in terms of the subsidies which Northern Ireland receives from Westminster.  If re-unification were to be effected these subsidies would be removed and there must be a sharp analysis of the cost of such exercise.</P>
      <P>Our duty here is to ensure that Catholics and Protestants, both north and south, realise that they have much more in common with one another than they may realise and that they have more in common with one another than they have with those in politics, either north or south, who may exploit them for political ends.  James Connolly said that the revolutionary task is to apply social democratic principles and ideals to the political, social and economic structure, to the future pluralistic structure of this country.  That was his message and it should be the message also that goes out from this House.  It is a message on which the workers of every denomination as well as the small farmers and the politicians in all parts of the island should ponder deeply.  We hope that parliamentary democracy in this country is not the private property of gunmen, north or south, and that if men or women hold political views, regardless of what these views might be, they would have an opportunity every five years of putting themselves up for election and of seeking the support of their peers and bringing forward their political views so that we do not drift into a gunman's State in either part of the country.  It would be a sad day if this country were to drift in that direction.</P>

When the Taoiseach was faced with the North of Ireland problem he did everything he could do for the people there.  This Government and this party tried to be as helpful as they could and we succeeded in having our Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the advice of the Taoiseach, raise the matter of Northern Ireland and the difficulties of the minority there at the United Nations. All the missions we have in other countries were instructed to raise this question. For 50 years the minority in the North of Ireland were kept in subjection. Various British Governments have that responsibility and they cannot get away from it.  They knew what was going on.  They had been told often enough.

It is easy enough to ge up here and condemn the Orangemen and to condemn everything that happened in Northern Ireland.  It is easy enough for the pseudo-republicans we have here in the south to try to start another civil war here in the south.  That is what they are trying to do.

It is easy enough to make a bad case worse. When you tear everything asunder you make the case worse than it is.  Successive Governments here have tried in a spirit of goodwill to win over our own people in the North of Ireland.  The Orangemen are our people too.  They are Irishmen.  In 1916, 1917 and up to 1921, when we got our freedom, we <Col N="3676" /> were fighting Britain.  Even if we had 60,000 soldiers to go into the North of Ireland we would be fighting our own people and having another civil war. We have been trying to build up a spirit of goodwill.  Time is a great healer.  We have reached the point now when the Taoiseach is going to meet the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <P>We all hope that when the Taoiseach meets the British Prime Minister in October the climate of public opinion will have changed amongst the Orangemen and the Paisleyites and a number of others.  I hope that major reforms will be put into operation in the north very soon. I hope that they will realise there that they cannot carry on with those abuses.  I hope the British Prime Minister will realise that he cannot continue to bolster up the majority of the Orangemen in the north to the detriment of the Catholic minority.  These people should realise that they are Irishmen.  I do not want to say anything hard against them.  They should also realise that there is a future for them if they adopt the policy of goodwill. The people who are using the gun today, and even threatening us here in the south, are not contributing to the elimination of the misunderstanding of the past.  They are only putting off the day of unity.  They should realise that what they are doing is not helping us one way or the other but causing division.</P>
      <P>There is much co-operation between north and south and we hope it will continue.  We have co-operation in relation to tourism and electricity.  A number of businessmen and ordinary people north and south are meeting day after day.  I hope that will continue and that the seeds of goodwill that are being sown north and south will continue to grow until such time as we can bring about the great day of unity for this island.  I hope that the British public especially will give their wholehearted backing and support to what we believe is the natural thing, that is, that this island should be governed by one Government.</P>

      <P>They are not able to take the great advances we have made in this country since 1957.  They are squealing now and saying that there is unemployment, crime and this, that and the other, but they have to realise the wonderful advances which have been made year after year, with the result that every section of our people are better off than they were at that period.  We have had great advances in education, in the number of schools built, in the provision of free secondary education and free university education.  We have had great advances in the building of houses for our people, irrespective of what the housing action people say about us, in the thousands of homes built for our people during this period, in the grants given for the reconstruction of old houses.  Our tourist trade, when I came to this House in 1944, was about £1 million and today it is worth over £100 million.</P>

The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have been getting together with them and are deeply grateful for the help they have got.

I know from speeches made from both sides of the House that we are anxious to see that this Parliament would be supreme and that nobody would have the right to interfere with any rulings made here.</P>
      <P>I will finish on the note on which I started.  Great things have happened in our time.  In our present Taoiseach we have a great man.  We have confidence in his judgement and in his leadership.  The Irish people have confidence in what he is doing and anybody who tries to belittle him as our leader is in the wrong.  He is doing a good job for our country and he is steering the ship of State in a manly, diplomatic way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the Taoiseach's contribution, I would like, first, to endorse what the leader of our party, Deputy Cosgrave, has said regarding the tremendous increase in the cost of living which we have witnessed over the past two years.  News has come since then of further increases. The greatest increases which we have had to suffer from any Government Department which is under direct Government control were the increases of 48 per cent imposed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which we believe now are in financial difficulties and cannot meet their commitments in regard to the provision of telephones or an efficient postal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We learn from this evening's papers that there is to be another increase in the price of coal, turf and briquettes. English coal, which was the subject of the catch phrase of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="3686" /> Party in 1932 when they attempted to get into office, &ldquo;Burn everything British but their coal&rdquo;, is being increased by 150p per ton bringing the price from £18.50 to £20 per ton.  Turf briquettes are going up from £10.50 to £11.50 and machine-won turf is going up from £8.5 to £8.45.  Where is this increase in the cost of living going to end?  How can incomes possibly keep up with the phenomenal increase in the case of the necessities of life?  We are also faced with increases in the price of bread and in the cost of other essential commodities.  We have witnessed a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance increasing taxation on essential medicines and at the same time giving exemption for medicines prescribed by veterinary surgeons for dogs, cats and budgerigars.</P>
    <P>At the time of the coalition Government people could afford to send their children to university but all this has changed and one of the greatest shams is the so-called free education scheme. The cheapest part of a secondary education always was and always will be the fees and the most expensive part is the maintaining of the student and the supplying of school books, equipment and clothing.  We in this House have recently witnessed the Government's refusal to accept responsibility for the 25 per cent increase in the fees of University College, Dublin, and University College, Cork. What kind of credibility can the Government and this House have?  It is true to say that collective responsibility of the Government no longer exists.  It is obvious that one Government Minister will not communicate with another because of personal differences.</P>
    <P>A report was recently published by two well-known members of the medical profession asking the Government to provide some form of social amenities and some education in order to offset the drug problem which is developing here.  Questions were put down to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Justice and what happened was that they were all lumped together and dealt with by one Minister. <Col N="3687" /> The Minister for Health said, &ldquo;I am the powerman, I am the man who looks after all these things&rdquo;.  How can the Minister for Health look after an education programme in the schools? How can he look after the Garda Síochána who detect people abusing this scheme?  How can he possibly provide local amenities as suggested by these medical men?</P>
    <P>Why is the Government burying its head in the sand?  There is a danger on the political front with regard to the crisis in Northern Ireland.  There is a danger here because the working class are completely and utterly dissatisfied with the set-up and are taking the law into their own hands.  There is little or no credibility in the Government Departments and in Government Ministers and there is very little credibility in the Taoiseach himself.</P>
    <P>On the front page of the <i>Evening Press</i> tonight there is a story of yet another robbery in which four masked men, with nylon stockings over their heads, went into a shop in the Summerhill area, took the cash box and made off towards Ballybough.  This is the sixth successive armed robbery which has taken place in Dublin.  Is it unknown to the Taoiseach, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice that the plan of intent to carry on these robberies is to collect funds for subversive illegal organisations?  I would say they are well aware of the obvious campaign of these subversive armed groups.  I would say they are well aware that these attacks on post offices, banks, insurance companies and the pay rolls of big firms is in order to obtain funds for such organisations. I would say they are well aware also of the practically open recruitment which is taking place in certain areas of this city.  I say this with good authority.  I believe I am the first person to have said it during this debate.</P>
    <P>Despite this the Government have taken no action whatsoever to enforce law and order in the city.  Members of the Garda Síochána are becoming disillusioned and disheartened and it will not be long before they renage and go after the simpler types of crimes and get tied up in the administration of <Col N="3688" /> bringing the simpler criminal cases to court instead of getting at the root threat to the democratic institutions of this State which is very prevalent at the moment and which is growing not month by month but day by day.  We were warned of this some time ago and now we see it happening.  It is not for me to mention the names of people who are involved; the Minister knows many of the people who are involved and little or no action has been taken.</P>
    <P>There is a law for Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil supporters and a different law for the rest of the community.  We witnessed it in this House during the last two sitting days.  The amendment being discussed was concerned with the preservation of the freedom of the Press but discussion on the matter was guillotined.  Was it guillotined because one of the national newspapers possibly is in financial trouble?  Was it guillotined to prevent the remaining national newspapers from promoting anti-Government propaganda?  The phrasing used in the Bill was unique. I spoke on this matter briefly.  I consider the remaining newspapers will be muzzled effectively because of what happened in the Dáil yesterday.</P>
    <P>Like myself, Deputy Tunney who represents the constituency of Dublin north-west, has had questions on the Order Paper for the past two or three weeks but they have not been answered. We represent 43,000 constituents but we have not had an opportunity of receiving replies to our questions and obtaining the information we requested. Last Friday morning we were told the Dáil would adjourn on 6th August and there was no opportunity of getting information by putting in more questions, as Deputy Blaney pointed out today.  Not only was discussion on the Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill curtailed, but the democratic rights of Members to represent their constituents have been infringed also.</P>
    <P>Dictatorship has crept into this House.  In former times Fianna Fáil leaders kept the dictatorship to the party rooms and it was not, perhaps, so apparent in this House.  Now it has come out into the open.  One of the greatest criticisms I would level at <Col N="3689" /> Fianna Fáil is that they make no attempt to disguise the blatant corruption and political jobbery in which they engage.  In the end this will bring about their downfall.</P>
    <P>One year after the Taoiseach applied to meet the British Prime Minister, Mr. Heath has consented to the meeting.  Members of this House have attempted to find out the agenda for that meeting but they have not succeeded. I presume they will discuss the north, our entry into the EEC and, presumably, they will discuss the possibility of the British Parliament refusing a majority vote in favour of entry&mdash;although I admit this is a remote possibility.</P>
    <P>The delay of the British Prime Minister in meeting the Taoiseach follows a period of nine months when the Taoiseach applied for a meeting with the former Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson.  It appears we are not much more than a small county council in the eyes of the British Government. This was illustrated when the Holy Ghost Fathers from this country were imprisoned in Port Harcourt, Biafra. They were left without food but the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Cabinet would make no attempt to alleviate the suffering of the priests.  There was nothing but idle gestures for fear of offending the British Government; a Government that refused to recognise the rights of a minority in Biafra but, at the same time, recognised the rights of a national minority in this island.  This was a completely contradictory situation but our Government went cap in hand to Downing Street and channelled aid to the British support of Nigeria.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach meets Mr. Heath he should point out the complete unsuitability of keeping the British Army in the north.  Two years ago they were welcome because of the obvious bigotry of the B Specials towards the people living in Catholic areas.  However, since January, 1971, the British Army came into breach of their own regulations by setting up clubs and dance halls.  They enticed sections of the female population to those clubs and excluded members of <Col N="3690" /> the male population, Catholic and Protestant.  In that way they triggered off a wave of reaction against them and broke regulations by their action. It was not the troops themselves or the NCOs who were responsible; it was the officer in command who instructed that this campaign of integration with the locals be started and excluded males from the functions they held.</P>
    <P>This was one of the most disgraceful acts any army have engaged in. The time has come for the Taoiseach to inform the British Prime Minister that unless a United Nations force is allowed into the north he will withdraw the Irish contingent in Cyprus who are keeping peace on that island in company with the British forces. Incidentally, it should not be forgotten that the trouble there was created by maladministration and lack of understanding by the British.  There are 500 of our crack troops serving side by side with the British Army, under British Army command under the guise of the UN, but in this country there are sections of the population, both Catholic and Protestant, being shot at by the British Army who are under orders to shoot on suspicion.  It is completely contradictory for this country to allow hundreds of our best troops to serve with the British Army in order to keep peace in a troubled spot where the trouble was created by British colonial policy.</P>
    <P>It is embarrassing to be compelled to state that there are Irish troops guarding the Border wearing British Army uniforms.  The only difference between those soldiers and their counterparts across the Border are the berets and the flashes on their shoulders.  About 18 months ago I asked the former Minister for Defence where the last purchases of uniforms had been made and I was told they were purchased in Ireland.  I pressed the Minister on the following week and asked if any uniforms had been purchased from the British Army and he replied we had bought more than 2,000 uniforms from the British.  His successor, Deputy Cronin, admitted that the uniforms worn by the Irish Army on Border patrol were ex-combat uniforms of the British Army.  It <Col N="3691" /> is on the record of this House that the only difference between those uniforms and the uniform which the British Army are wearing on the other side of the Border is the flashes.</P>

      <P>It must be quite ridiculous, if they have the same uniforms in Cyprus, if a member of the Irish Defence Forces has to go to hospital in Famagusta, which is run by the <Col N="3693" /> military.  We have been trying to provide some form of career in the Irish Army but we have had nothing but insult after insult.  It was pointed out recently by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence that an Irish Army driver can be fully qualified to drive an Army car, an Army tank or an Army lorry but he is completely unqualified to drive a private motor car unless he gets his own car and undergoes a test for driving.  This is because of the bureaucracy of the Government, whose leader is not able to drive a Government.  This could well be the last opportunity in this Dáil that I will have to put this on the record.</P>

A short time later he admitted it was tendered after it had been asked for, in other words the man was sacked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and God knows what medication he was on at the time. There is one other point I want to refer to about that time, which I think is one of the most scurrilous things that ever happened in this House.  At the time of the crisis debate, after the longest debate in the history of Europe, because it was the worst crisis that ever hit a Parliament in peace time, the Taoiseach listed one after the other the injuries which had been suffered by one of his top Cabinet Ministers. He listed them here under the privilege of this House.  He abused the privilege of the House in doing that.  I am not saying there is any love between myself and ex-Minister, Deputy Charles Haughey, but it is hitting below the belt when a Taoiseach comes into this House and lists a man's injuries.  He is not entitled to have this information because it is professional secrecy between the man and his doctor.  It would at least be an act of decency that he should not say here in public in front of the Press and have on the Dáil record a man's injuries.  The Taoiseach said in his opinion, and he is a barrister by training, that Deputy Moran was medically unfit to hold his position as Minister.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the blueprint of the subversives who are carrying out these armed robberies, which work out at the rate of one per day; I have mentioned the phenomenal increase in the cost of medicines to the people of this country; and I endorsed fully what our leader said with regard to the phenomenal increase in the cost of living over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to say a few words with regard to our Department of Foreign Affairs.  For over a year we have been kept completely in the dark regarding the negotiations with the EEC.  What we have been handed out is in the form of simple literature with practically <Col N="3695" /> no information.  The Minister said that if it were too detailed the people would not be able to understand it.  He must be thinking of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers because any Member who is able to read and write has been in one Ministry or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not use disparaging remarks about Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard of ministerial behaviour we have had has been utterly disgraceful.  I think we are faced with great danger in having this team to negotiate EEC membership. We have a team divided down the middle.  How can we expect any decent deal to be negotiated by people who are looking over their shoulders or over somebody else's shoulder or at somebody's back?  How can they do a deal for the people from which the people will benefit adequately and, of course, lose a lot in the form of sovereignty and family life?</P>
      <P>I do not think we have the proper team negotiating for us.  An issue like this should be decided by the people and I do not think the people are at all satisfied with the way the Department of Foreign Affairs have been tackling matters.  I can think particularly of the Biafra situation in 1968-69 and of the aid they have given in the Pakistan crisis.  We have seen the offhand manner in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has treated the efforts to set up a disaster committee. We could have given a little more in recent years to nations who have undergone natural disasters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was brave to go there with him and I compliment him.  In the matter of EEC membership, we should remember the old saying: &ldquo;We fear the Greeks when they bring gifts&rdquo;.  We have been promised so many things from Europe, great things for the farmer, help for the undeveloped areas, help for industry, and now there is a suggestion that the whole of Ireland might be termed an undeveloped area and that in this way we might become extremely privileged as regards financial aid from the EEC. I for one am extremely suspicious and fearful of it because there is a grave danger that Ireland could become to the rest of Europe what the west of Ireland is to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, I do not think anybody <Col N="3697" /> has confidence in our present negotiating team.  How can they concentrate on the negotiations when every time they go to Brussels they are in danger of being called back to settle one of their own differences?  They should get out and stop this nonsense. They will have to go in two years anyway. Let them go now.  What is £5,000 in salary to them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody hates Fianna Fáil except the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Get out and let a Government take over who will run the country.  Fianna Fáil are here only because of the gerrymandering imposed by a man who has now gone.  They are here on a minority vote.  That is the system they are operating.  The system I want is that which will give the people the Government they want. They do not want Fianna Fáil any longer.  Even Fianna Fáil people are fed up with them.</P>
      <P>A matter was discussed here today with the Minister for Justice and I was surprised at his reaction.  It is something every parent is concerned about.  It is the ready availability of alcoholic drink to youngsters, the availability of cheap wine and cider to children between the ages of 12 and 18 years.  The Minister for Justice told us today there is nothing he can do about it.  Four separate, responsible organisations have written in protest to him.  We have had questions on the Order Paper for several weeks in an attempt to get some reaction from the Minister and because of the imposition of the guillotine there was a danger that we would not get oral answers today and thereby make our views known.</P>
      <P>Nobody knows more about this problem than Deputies Dowling and Tunney who were at a meeting.  We know the problem it has created in the Chapelizod area.  We were today trying to get some reaction from the Minister but he made no attempt to provide a solution, although he has the full research facilities of his Department under his control.  He has made no attempt to try to enforce the law relating to the sale of drinks to juveniles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3698" /> I shall now turn to the Minister for Finance.  The kindest thing one can say is that he reads his brief well but I do not think he contributes an awful lot to it.  The tax exemptions which he has introduced here for literary people are commendable but it is tragic that certain books which have been written in this country and which are nothing short of pornography should qualify for tax exemption. I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The attitude the Minister for Finance has taken to the nursing profession, particularly married nurses, is deplorable.  When there is such a shortage of nurses, and when wards are closed down because of that shortage, the least the Minister for Finance should do is to give some tax concession to married nurses.  They must pay someone to look after their children if they go back to nursing and, instead of getting some concession, they are penalised for their dedication to the sick.  The Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Health, should get together to find some solution to this problem.  There is at the moment grave discontent.  These dedicated women will go on bridging the gap until such time as young nurses are trained to replace them, but these young nurses will only be trained to replace them if conditions are improved considerably.  There is still a Victorian system of administration in some of our hospitals.  There are no recreational facilities in some of our hospitals.  The food is not of a very high standard.  The accommodation is not of the desired standard.  Living quarters in some hospitals are very bad.  If a nurse wishes to live outside the hospital she must pay up to £4 or £5 a week for a bedsitter.  She gets no tax relief.  Trade unions will not allow young girls to work in factories on night shifts, but nurses must do night shifts.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the activities and powers of the National Council for Sport which he set up recently.  Approximately a year ago I asked if he would consider establishing a Ministry of Sport and Recreation and his response was to establish a National Council for Sport.  We should have a full Ministry, having canvassed the Civil Service to get the views of those who are interested in sport, and not do as was done by Fianna Fáil when they just happened to pick so many men from the Department of Education and put them under the Parliamentary Secretary.  Some attempt should be made to co-ordinate the work of the Department of Transport and Power, the Board of Works, the Departments of Education and Local Government, so that we will have sufficient <Col N="3702" /> sporting and recreational facilities for our people.  We must remember that people are living to an ever-increasing age.  It is true to say that 100 years ago people lived to the age of 40 and worked 70 hours a week; now, man lives to the age of 70 and the average working week is 40 hours.  Far more time is now available for leisure and recreation.  We should attempt to keep pace with this.  We should attempt to recognise this fact and do our best within the limits of our resources to provide adequate recreation for people of all ages.</P>
      <P>We have on numerous occasions seen great recreational facilities&mdash;perhaps a lake used for fishing, a hill for rock climbing or for one of the many adventure sports&mdash;being destroyed or demolished to make way, perhaps, for a dam to produce electricity or a quarry for something else.  A Ministry for Sport with sufficient funds to support sporting activity among the youth, create recreational activities for the not-so-young, and attempt to provide larger urban areas with some planned recreational facilities and spaces for sport would be able to accomplish much to eliminate what is occurring in different areas.  I do not want to emphasise Ballymun where we have almost 25,000 people in one small congested area with very few recreational facilities except artificial swings, little concrete pits, one or two football pitches and an abandoned swimming pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort should be made by the Taoiseach to bring about some coordination between local authorities, through the Minister for Local Government, to prevent the pollution which is taking place around Dublin coasts. The greatest offenders are the local authorities because they give planning permission for factories or housing estates without making adequate provision for disposal of sewerage and waste.  This interferes with recreational facilities we have had in the Dublin area for a long time.  We had beaches a short distance away to which children could go by bus and could bathe in safety.  All over Europe the thing is happening.  In the Mediterranean, along the Spanish, French, Italian and Greek coasts there is pollution as a result of <Col N="3703" /> local authorities allowing factories, hotels and apartment blocks to go up, ruining one of their greatest natural facilities and sources of recreation.  It is predicted that within 25 years the Mediterranean itself will be an open sewer.  Some Department should be responsible for dealing with this problem. I suggest we should set up a Department for Sport and Recreational Activities.</P>
    <P>Many things could be done to help our youth.  Deputies opposite know the talent latent in our children.  We had evidence of this in the boxing arena last May or June at the European Championships in Madrid.  This was achieved despite limited facilities. How often have we seen boys begin their boxing careers in converted garages with perhaps no ring and only a punchbag and boxing gloves and a rope to skip with.  Yet, they progressed and became European champions.  I should like to see our youth getting a proper opportunity to develop their full physical capabilities on an international level.  It is not difficult for us to remember the great honour Ronnie Delaney brought to this country when he won the 1,500 metres in the Olympic Games in Melbourne.  At that stage he could not make further progress in this country and had to go abroad to obtain specialist training.  At that time we had about four different athletic associations; competition was not available.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done as regards adventure sports, canoeing on canals and lakes, sailing, prevention of pollution, provision of adequate green belt areas and swimming pools, with concentration initially on low-cost sports, a field in which we seem to be doing best internationally.  Many of these facilities would be of tremendous advantage to our tourist industry.  In that way, amenities would be provided and there would be some return for the money invested.  I merely mention this because I feel that efforts by the Fianna Fáil Party to promote sport have been disappointing.  When the Taoiseach announced in 1969 that he was going to allocate £100,000 to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister <Col N="3704" /> for Education I was very disappointed because this works out at approximately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should like to see this increased I admired the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Molloy, when he was Parliamentary Secretary, for the equitable way in which he administered the fund.

      <P>The same applies to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Kennedy, who did a good job in the equitable distribution of this money in Finglas West in order to stimulate sporting activity in that area.  However, I still do not think that the small allocations which the Department has been offered in the past two years are adequate.  The Taoiseach should announce that he is going to provide more money for the encouragement of sport and to assist the National Council for Sport which was set up following an appeal for a Ministry of Sport.</P>

I should also like to see a draft plan set up in the Department of Education for the implementation of a Ministry of Sports.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the inequitable rating system and its impoverishing effect on many people.  The Taoiseach should introduce some form of relief, not on the lines of the waiver of rates but some real relief&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would like to see an opportunity given in this House of discussing the report which was sent to the Department of Local Government when Deputy Boland was Minister in that Department by ACRA, the so-called Manning Report.  This is a very important issue for people who pay rates on private houses, good, gentle people who are too conservative in their outlook to protest on an organised basis, who will not take to the streets because of the injustices of the rating system but who would rather fade away into humbler dwellings, into substandard dwellings, into single rooms, than be faced with open evictions or the breaking into their home by the city sheriff to take their belongings to cover their rates bill.  We are all agreed&mdash;I do not know what prevents us from taking action&mdash;that the rating system is inequitable. Certain Deputies on the Government side have given vocal support to the abolition of rates but they have not done much more about it.  I would just mention that in passing, because it is not relevant to the Taoiseach's Estimate.  There has been a vast increase in the number of road accidents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a national issue I was attemping to raise.  I was hoping to see the Taoiseach make some effort <Col N="3706" /> with the Department of Local Government, with the Minister for Health and with the other people who provide ambulance services, to establish a national ambulance service.  This is not necessarily the responsibility of the Department of Health or of the Department of Local Government, because when we ask this question one throws it over to the other.  I was hoping that the Taoiseach might accept some responsibility for it.  There have been numerous accidents on the Naas Road in which two or three cars have been involved and where one or two ambulances have been sent down. There is no ambulance network in this country.  I should like to see anti-shock therapy being administered at the scene of an accident and, therefore, to see an intern travelling with each ambulance to the scene of a road traffic accident or to the scene of an accident at home in which a fatality is possible.  The Minister for Health short-changed us on this the other day, and it is of paramount importance that some effort be made to modernise our ambulance service in order to save some of the poor people who are being lost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I represent 43,000 people in this House, but I am forbidden to bring this matter up.  I wish to refer to something which is definitely the responsibility of the Taoiseach, namely, the coastguard service.  We are the only country in Northern Europe that has no coastguard service at all.  I quote from an editorial in this evening's issue of the <i>Evening Herald</i> which relates to the capsizing of a boat recently in Dublin Bay:</P>
      <P>We stress again the lesson of the near disaster in Dublin Bay, when ten people came near to losing their lives when their boat capsized.</P>
      <P>Although the boat was only two miles off Howth, and although they used all their flares and, as a last resort, set fire to the deck of their sinking boat to attract attention, it was only by accident their plight was seen when a Garda Angling Club boat shifted position and spotted the distressed boat.</P>
      <P>It is another case which strengthens the appeal for the institution in the Republic of a proper coast watching service.</P>
      <P>We have the extraordinary position that detection of distress at sea depends on the chance observation of those who have other business to attend to, and on amateurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3708" /> Even a voluntary service in areas where there is heavy sea activity, such as Dublin Bay, would be an advance on the present position.</P>
    <P>On August Monday last I happened to be in Skerries when a small yacht turned over at Rockabill lighthouse just five miles from the shore.  The telephone line from the lighthouse to the shore has been broken for the past month but of course we are informed that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are out of funds and, consequently, lines cannot be fixed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put questions down on different occasions to the Taoiseach, to the Minister for Defence and to the Minister for Transport and Power but on each occasion it has been shifted from one to the other.  My question was to ask if the least we could do would be to have some sort of weekend coastguard service because it is at weekends that most amateur yachting takes place.  Even if we were to initiate such a service on the east and south coasts, it would be a start. The boat I am talking about got into difficulties within 100 yards of the Rockabill lighthouse.  There were four people on board but a tragedy was averted.  The Howth lifeboat was sent for, as also was a helicopter, and the rescue launch set out from Skerries Sailing Club.  Weather conditions were bad and unless somebody was watching through a telescope he would not be able to see what was happening so far <Col N="3709" /> out.  In the other case it was only by chance that a boat from the Garda Angling Club happened to be in the vicinity, the occupants of which spotted those people who were in difficulty. The fact that these people had made such efforts to attract attention to their plight but were not noticed by anybody on shore strengthens my argument of the need for a coastguard service.</P>

We have witnessed a period <Col N="3711" /> during which, every time the Government took an initiative, after the passage of a short time they seemed to draw back.  I refer to the Prices and Incomes Bill last autumn, to the dole situation and to the community schools, to mention a few.

We have had the recent display of false strength on the part of a person who is afraid of being accused of weakness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been through a period in which members of the Government party have been saying things about other members of the Government party which transcend anything the Opposition could possibly think up in malice and in hatred.  At the same time, we have seen the people who utter these extraordinary and savage statements in private nonetheless voting to uphold a Government about which they obviously have the most profound reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To finish this section of characterisation of the recent past, I must say that what I find shocking is that nobody <Col N="3712" /> is shocked and what I find shameful is that nobody is ashamed. We have reached a stage, it seems to me, where the judgment of the people, a contemptuous judgment, of this Parliament is regrettably an accurate judgment.  I think this Parliament is at an extraordinarily low ebb in public esteem.  I say with regret that much of this is merited.</P>
    <P>I shall leave that and turn to the three matters I am principally concerned to comment on.  Firstly, the matter of the North of Ireland.  I go to the North of Ireland less frequently than many people in this House and more often than others.  I do not claim any special expertise but I am acutely aware of how easy it is, at this distance, to strike various sorts of attitudes which are either unhelpful or irrelevant.  It is easy at this distance to exort everyone up there to love one another.  There is the savage remark of Tom Lehren.  He says: &ldquo;There are people in this world who do not love one another and I hate people like that.&rdquo;  It does not really help to exort trust and love, to urge that people who obviously hate and distrust each other should suddenly by a stroke of the pen or the utterance of a word begin to love and trust one another.</P>
    <P>I must say, and here I am speaking for myself, that it is easy and unhelpful to spray what I might call blanket condemnations without differentiation of situation, of person, against all violence. I can think of an occasion&mdash;I believe from memory the man's name was Gallagher&mdash;in August 1969 when a man was shot by B Specials in Armagh in most extraordinarily shocking circumstances.  I can think of British soldiers being shot in different sorts of situations and I can think of young men accused of carrying arms which nobody now, I think, believes they were also being shot.  I think it unhelpful to bracket all these things as being capable of being equated one with another.  I do not so equate them myself and I do not think it advances any sort of clarity on the situation to bracket them all together either as presumably the UVF would do by calling the soldiers who shot stone-throwing youths heroes or, on the other hand, to <Col N="3713" /> equate all of those whose actions produced death as being murderers.  I do not think either of these clarifies or improves the situation.</P>
    <P>Speaking both for the Labour Party and for myself, our position on violence in the whole life of this State, in the whole life of our party, has been a fairly clear one.  I do not suppose there is anybody who says that there are no circumstances conceivable in which violence should be used.  I do not suppose there is anyone except the strict, formal, total pacifist who rules out all violence.  Our position is that the resort to violence that we have seen on the part of what has come to be known as the minority in the north or, at least on the part of a section of that minority, has produced a result opposite to what they themselves wish.  I say a section of that minority because I personally differentiate between actions in defence of a particular street, of a particular ghetto area, on the one hand, and actions of a more general offensive nature on the other.  I think that is a valid distinction and I make that distinction in regard to what members of that minority do in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>By and large, I think all of those who would term themselves republican in the north say that they want a united country.  They say they want a country in which all the religious and ethnic strands in the country can live together.  I am convinced, without any possibility of error, that this is the true and essential position of Irish republicanism for a very long time.  Yet the net result of what we have seen is that of hatred, distrust, the width of the gap between the two populations in the North is deeper than it has been for a long time and all of those people who had come to occupy middle ground between what one might call on the one hand a provisional position and on the other hand a Paisleyite position have been forced back, all the bridge building has been wrecked, all those who were moving on to central ground, building joint unified communities, have been driven back to attitudes of the past, to attitudes of hatred, of deep distrust.</P>
    <P>We condemn the use of violence because this is the end result it has <Col N="3714" /> produced.  The extraordinary thing is that there is now a coincidence of interest between certain strands of unionism on the one hand and certain strands among those who call themselves republican on the other.  Their interests coincide in trying to make relations between both communities as bad as possible and trying to provoke a situation where there is a danger of civil war, a situation where the whole possibility of any normal sort of life for the two communities together in the future ceases to exist.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the arguments made by the Taoiseach that the quarrel is an Irish quarrel because I think this is patently not so.  It is important for clarity and for the evolution of the situation that it is seen to be untrue.  Partition was an action of a Westminster Parliament.  The Six Counties or whatever name one chooses to call it&mdash;there is a real difficulty about the name&mdash;the Northern Ireland state is part of the United Kingdom. It is governed from London.  It is, in theory, subject to the rule of law which extends over the whole of the United Kingdom but which does not, in fact, extend over this particular area.  In theory it does.  This is one reason for its not being simply an Irish quarrel. Another reason is the profound economic interpenetration between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, or to put it another way, between the two islands.  When I say economic interpenetration that would suggest equality but, in fact, there never has been, there is not now. equality.  There is a profound inequality. In general, economically, both in regard to the ownership of assets in this island and the obtaining of raw materials in an especially favoured way for the obtainer in this island by Britain, by the neighbouring island, there is a circumstance of oppression and exploitation by Britain of this island.  The oppression and exploitation apply both to the North and to the South.  To me this is inescapably true on the simplest economic grounds.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the assertion which has been made that there are, in fact, in this island two nations.  Perhaps, the most extreme example of what I am referring to is <Col N="3715" /> in the United States which is referred to in a cliché as a melting pot.  It contains very many distinct ethnic groups, some European in origin, some African in origin, some Asian in origin.  There is, of course, the scandal of racism towards Blacks in America but, inside major ethnic groups, while there is a little bit of the sort of gentle hostility that involves calling names and occasional punch-ups, there is nothing comparable, apart from the oppression of the Blacks and Puerto Ricans and the Mexican farm workers on the west coast, among various ethnic groups to the mistrust and the hatred that exist between two populations in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>One could make the same comparison with many other countries.  One could look at Bavarians and north Germans who have a religious difference. One could look at Belgium, disturbed as it is with Flemings and Walloons.  One could look at many countries where, in fact, people of different religions, sometimes different languages and different cultures and, for what it is worth in European circumstances, different ethnic origins, live together in some sort of trust and harmony, recognising their differences but not hating each other.  It seems to me that the key to the hatred that exists in the north is not to be found simply in the difference of religion, ethnic origin, culture, or what have you, but in the fact that there is exploitation of one group by another.  It is to be found in inequality and in injustice.</P>
    <P>It is to be found in the fact that, if we use the euphemism of majority and minority, the majority in Northern Ireland have enjoyed certain advantages socially and economically in regard to housing, job opportunities, even wages on average, and in regard to opportunities for access to education and the whole matter of a general place in the sun.  The minority is exploited and does not enjoy equal civil rights.  Proportionately it generates more of the wealth than it receives. The majority, per capita, man for man, exploits the minority.</P>
    <P>Behind the exploitation of one section of the community by another, <Col N="3716" /> there is the exploitation of the whole island by Britain.  These are inescapable truths.  Britain had an interest in the establishment of Partition and has an interest in the maintenance of it.  In the often quoted phrase of Mr. Randolf Churchill a long time ago about playing the Orange card, Britain has also been the cause of generating and perpetuating a great deal of the mistrust and hatred and the civil strife that now exist in Northern Ireland. These things are inescapably true to me.</P>
    <P>I do not think we advance the situation one little bit by saying: &ldquo;Oh, are they not all equally awful because they are all violent?&rdquo; and: &ldquo;Oh, it is an Irish problem which we Irishmen must settle together.&rdquo;  I make value judgments between certain sorts of violence in defence and certain sorts of violence in offence.  I make value judgments between the rights of those who are exploited and the rights of those who exploit.  We cannot possibly have peace in Northern Ireland or unity of the whole country if it is not on a basis of equality and justice and if it is not a peace which guarantees the rule of law and equality of opportunity to every citizen of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that many of the initiatives from here, laudable though they may be in general intention, are valueless.  I believe we have to recognise the interest of Britain and the purpose of Britain in establishing and perpetuating not just the division of a country but the division of a people inside part of that country. We have to describe and explain that action by Britain and we have to struggle against it in company with people in Northern Ireland but also in company with the very many people inside Britain who are ashamed of Britain's past actions and exploitations. Therefore, there is the matter of justice and there is the matter of exploitation to be referred to.  No possible solution exists without the unmasking of these things and a struggle against them.</P>
    <P>This is how I see the situation. These may seem to be rather harsh thoughts at a time when everyone is <Col N="3717" /> saying to the communities as a whole in the north: &ldquo;Please stop killing each other.  Please stop hating each other.  Please love one another.  Please settle down and live together in peace.&rdquo;  I do not think that such exhortations are much good at this time.  From our end of things we have to explain the ownership of our economy and of the Northern economy by the biggest companies inside the UK, whether they be banks or industrial companies.  We have to explain the exploitation particularly of this part of the country in regard to agricultural produce, which is now ending because of the Tory policy on prices but which has been a terrible mill stone around the neck of this Republic during the whole of its life. We have to explain the exploitation of fisheries and mineral rights.</P>
    <P>It seems to me also that we have to explain the involvement of the Fianna Fáil Government in permitting this exploitation of mineral rights and fisheries and of our economy by opening it up to big British capital.  Therefore, we have to explain the inability of the Fianna Fáil Government to carry on a resolute struggle against the source of injustice to which I have been referring.  This seems to me to be the origin of the two-faced attitude&mdash; I do not think it springs from natural hypocrisy&mdash;that I see in Fianna Fáil all the time, the effort to face both ways, the effort to be republican on the one hand and to have good relations with the biggest sources of British capital on the other hand.  It cannot be done.  It produces the sort of contortions we have seen with such disedification in the past year or so.</P>
    <P>From Dublin, from this Parliament, one is not permitted to behave in a sectarian way if one wants any sort of advance.  It seems to me that we have a sectarian republic.  It is written into our Constitution.  It is written into our laws.  It is written into the structure of our education.  It is written into the whole fabric of the country.  If we are serious about unification, if we are serious about wiping out the fear deeply held in the north&mdash;and it has been held there since before 1641, since the first quarter of the 17th century&mdash; of Rome rule, the Taoiseach will have <Col N="3718" /> to honour his promises about changing the law on contraception.  He will have to honour his promises about changing the Constitution.  We will have to have an educational system which has community schools not just as a dishonest phrase but in actual reality&mdash;schools that are schools for communities where people of different religions can learn to live together in a community.</P>
    <P>From this end it is not permitted to have sectarian legislation or to build a sectarian republic, as we have done, and at the same time to urge nonsectarian attitudes on the North.  It is impossible to stop people behaving in this two-faced way: behaving in a sectarian way themselves and urging non-sectarian behaviour on the people on the other side of the table.  If not much notice is taken of their exhortations we need not be surprised. If we are serious we should set about a rectification of the situation in this part of the country and the dismantling of the sectarian structures we have built up if we want our words to be listened to.</P>
    <P>The other thing it is not permitted to do if you want to be listened to is to speak with two voices or to try to play two sides of the road.  It is not permitted on the one hand to urge peace, love and the absence of violence and on the other hand to connive at the smuggling of arms.  That undermines the credibility of the persons who urge these two contradictory things simultaneously and it makes them ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it unhelpful, in view of the impending meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Premier, to go more deeply into the matters that have been raised by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I am simply deferring the matter and I am aware, as you are, Sir, that this House will have the opportunity of going into it, in some considerable detail, an opportunity which we await and will relish when the day comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I wanted to talk about was the matter of the economy, the matter of the cost of living, of inflation and of the national wage agreement.  I listened to what the Taoiseach had to say about Congress <Col N="3720" /> and the national wage agreement this morning with some interest and I listened to my colleague for North County Dublin, Deputy Burke, with even more interest on this subject, but before coming in to speak here in regard to the national wage agreement, I had occasion to look up the debates we had last November on the Prices and Incomes Bill.  We made it clear then that we were in favour of an orderly relationship between prices and incomes.  We raised, from experience in many countries, lists of objections and difficulties but of course the principle of an orderly relationship is one to which we as socialists subscribe. But when that Bill, before it was abandoned, was being debated, I made it clear that the basic premise was, in my view, a false premise and I should like very briefly to quote one or two sentences from my own contribution on 17th November, 1970&mdash; Volume 249, column 1516.  I said then:</P>
    <P>The assumption was that the source of the inflation in Ireland at this moment was the intransigence of the workers who were looking for higher wages.</P>
    <P>I said a little further down the same column:</P>
    <P>If this premise were true, the assumption that you could cure the present inflation just by a wages policy would be true also.</P>
    <P>That Bill was withdrawn and the national wage agreement was negotiated. When we come back after the summer recess, it will have been in operation for very nearly a year.  We made it clear at that time that while we were in favour, as I say, of an orderly relationship between wages and prices, we would not permit the rescue of the economy from the mess which the Government had contributed to making, although they had not been entirely responsible, to be borne in its cost entirely by wage workers.  What was implicit in the national wages agreement was that if there were orderly wage rises&mdash;that was agreed and is being implemented honourably&mdash;there would be also a significant effort to regulate prices.  We do not have recent or accurate figures for the rate of price increases in this island at this moment, <Col N="3721" /> but we are an open economy, doing two-thirds of our business with Britain, and we are absolutely subject to price changes in Britain, and the current situation in Britain is that price inflation at this moment is running at a rate of well over 10 per cent and, by certain methods of computation, at a rate of 12 per cent and that it has accelerated in the past three months.</P>
    <P>Here is the situation: there is a national wage agreement.  The Taoiseach and others from those benches are full of praise for Congress and for the discipline of the workers in carrying it out, but while it is being carried out from the workers' side, absolutely no effort is being made from the Government side in regard to the control of prices, and the reality therefore is that while the problem is being solved for the Government by a restricted and agreed rate of wage increases, inflation of prices is soaring away faster than has ever been the case. Therefore, the problem is being pushed off on to the wage earning section of the population because profits are rising, because incomes of various other sectors which can adjust them, are rising, but the workers' income is being eroded in real terms by this accelerating rate of wage inflation.</P>
    <P>I want to say clearly now, before this session of the Dáil concludes, that as far as I am concerned, and I know that I am not the only person in the labour movement of this opinion, this is an intolerable situation and by the autumn of this year, there will either be a significant control of price increases, or else there will be a very serious effort by major sections of employed people in this country to overturn the national wage agreement. I am not saying at this moment that I am calling for its abandonment, but I am saying that by the time Parliament reassembles either a serious effort to protect workers' incomes from the erosion of this galloping inflation is made, or else that agreement will be out of date, will be irrelevant.  People on the Government side have got the 12 month pause and they can face this dilemma themselves and do something about it.  We repeat that we will not permit this crisis to be put on the <Col N="3722" /> backs of the weaker sections of the community.</P>

      <P>The Government have made no significant effort to control inflation.  They will be faced with the need for resolute action on this front or the inevitable overturning of the national wage agreement.  They will then scream about the irresponsibility of the Labour Party.  They will have been given 12 months breathing space and if they do not act in the next quarter of the year nothing will have been done about the inflation, and the overturning of the agreement will be on their heads and not on the heads of the workers who have behaved with restraint and discipline over the last nine months.</P>
      <P>We have had the extraordinary &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; of the new penny.  People looking at shop windows say &ldquo;Those prices look reasonable&rdquo; for something like a piece of fruit or a pot of jam, but they do not remember that they are marked in new pence and not in old pence.  That &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo; takes a certain time to sink into the people's minds.  After the holidays this year when prices are very high, there will be growing indignation before this House reassembles, which promises that unless there is resolute Government action we will certainly have sharp statements about wages and house prices and the erosion of real living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC negotiations, if one could grace them with so exalted a name, are now substantially completed.  In my opinion they have been inadequate <Col N="3723" /> and have also been dishonestly reported. There is an effort not to explain all the matters which will involve the Irish people by this bundling us in after a superficial examination and before consideration has been given to the whole matter. These are some of the last hours available to us before the long recess.  I want to make it clear somewhere on the Official Report that we are more convinced than ever of the correctness of our stand on the Common Market and of the inadequacy of the negotiations and that the true facts must be brought home to the Irish people so that a valid judgment can be arrived at when the referendum takes place.  We are performing an important national duty in leading the struggle for a full understanding of the issues involved and of informing people of the terms which have been negotiated for us.  We will be continuing our struggle for deeper knowledge and for valid judgement, and trying to do the work which the Government have not done.  We are shocked at the use of public moneys on propaganda materials put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs. This propaganda is extraordinarily misleading and inaccurate and was put out by use of public money for the purposes of party propaganda.  We are looking forward to the referendum confident that a very significant number of the Irish people will record their profound dissatisfaction with the actions of the Government and the terms of negotiations.</P>

Deputy Keating is not the only member of the Labour Party who appeared on television and told the people one story while expressing a different view here.  Other members had programmes of longer than 26 weeks duration.  They were brainwashed also when they entered the Labour Party.  We have seen the hypocrisy of Deputy Keating telling us he is against entry to the EEC.  He is only against it when he is a member of the Labour Party and when they go down the country people like Deputy M. Murphy are not opposed to the EEC.  The Labour Party oppose the EEC inside the House and are in favour of it when speaking elsewhere. These Deputies from the Labour Party say one thing in Cork and other areas to their constituents and other things here.  The EEC is just a talking point for Deputy Keating, who has been commissioned to put the Labour Party point of view to the House, but, of course, he does not agree with every member of the Labour Party because there are members of the Labour Party who have said they believe this is the right thing to do.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach dealt with the EEC in some detail during the course of his speech, and, as I have said, the majority of Members inside the House are in favour of our entry to the EEC and so are members of the Labour Party outside it.  It is difficult to understand how they can have different opinions inside and outside this House but, of course, that is not an impossible situation for people who have no conscience.  We would like to know if the Labour Party are for or against entry into the EEC because members of the Labour Party have indicated in their own constituencies that they are in favour of our entering the EEC.  We have established the fact that this two-timer, Deputy Keating, either misled the farmers in the 26-week programme &ldquo;Into Europe&rdquo; or is attempting to mislead the farmers at this stage.  Deputy keating can only ride one horse.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach in his speech today dealt with the EEC, Ireland's membership of the EEC, the advantages that would flow from our entry into the EEC and the substantial progress we have made to date in relation to our application which is approaching a successful conclusion. This may have been a reason for Deputy Keating's short speech because things are now coming to a conclusion and he is now withdrawing and saying very little.  When he was dealing with the EEC in the early days, when there was not much hope of getting in at an early period, he used to spend three or four hours telling the House all the problems in relation to our entry; but having codded the farmers on television he is now trying to cod the House into believing that the Labour Party are against entry.</P>
      <P>The farmers can now be aware of the hypocrisy that Deputy Keating and his colleagues have participated in and they can see the ever-changing winds towards support for membership, which I have no doubt we shall see in the future.  It will be interesting to hear the concluding Labour speaker give us some indication of whether Keating on tape or on the screens is the same as Deputy Keating in the House.  He looks a little more vicious here, he must have a problem on his mind.  Deputy Keating is on the withdrawal period and I am quite sure he will get plenty of treatment from the boys in the Labour Party, there are plenty of people capable of treating him for his kind of disease.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's speech today indicated that negotiations in connection with EEC entry has been the subject of recent debates in this House.  He stated it was not necessary, therefore, for him to discuss this topic in detail before the House adjourns.  However, the Taoiseach stated that, since the last debate, satisfactory proposals have been agreed for the motor assembly industry and that there had been a sympathetic response from the Community and from the United Kingdom in connection with our proposals regarding fisheries.</P>
      <P>In the last few months members of the Opposition have been terrorising Irish workers in the motor industry and they have encouraged the fishermen to take violent action.  The people have been misled about the motor industry and the fishing industry.  There is no doubt that Fine Gael and Labour will try to use their usual tactics to disturb Irish workers, but they will do nothing to ensure that the problems will be solved or to give an indication of their proposals for solving the problems. I suggest the Opposition parties adopt a constructive approach to the EEC.  Having listened to Deputy Keating tonight and the few words he devoted to this subject, I am sure there is a change within the Labour Party.  The leader of the Labour Party, has said he does not mind my references to the policy of the Labour Party, which is an indication that what I have said is correct.</P>

It is regrettable, however, that when we seek money to do these things Members of the Labour Party vote against the Financial Resolutions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; Ballyfermot. All over the country houses are going up.  The Labour Party are opposed to house purchase.  We have provided a land bank and a variety of grants to enable people to purchase their own homes.  However, some politicians are afraid they will lose support if people become house owners and this is what determined their opposition to these commendable purchase schemes and progressive developments in housing. I would be ashamed to be a member of a party which treated people as the Labour Party treated them in the not too distant past.  I am very familiar with housing in this city and with the manner in which the problem has been tackled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell might be in agreement with them on this score&mdash;apparently he is; he said some time ago they should not purchase their homes.  It is regrettable to have at least one party in this country with this point of view but it is easy to understand it because they know the losses occur when people become owners of their own homes.  They want people to remain in houses so that they can create situations in relation to rent and in relation to a system to which they agreed and other matters to which they agreed in the local authorities throughout the country where the matter was adequately discussed. They gave their support but as soon as the programmes were put into operation they were completely opposed to them.</P>
      <P>This relates to differential rents in this city.  Differential rents have been one of the factors which enabled the weaker section of the community to be housed.  It is right that a person with even no income should be housed if he is entitled to a house.  This system ensures that they can obtain the best houses available.  The system itself had been presented by the Labour Party to Dublin Corporation but as soon as it was implemented they were concerned about all the other problems arising from it.</P>

      <P>I have not received from Dublin Corporation an estimate of the total number of dwellings which they expect to complete in 1971.  801 new dwellings were completed by them in the first six months of 1971.  At the 30th June, 1971, the corporation's housing programme comprised a total of 21,005 dwellings to be built, or sites to be developed.  In their weekly tenancy programme at that date they had work in progress on 1,606 dwellings; 6,031 dwellings were at planning stage; and sites had been or were being acquired for a further 9,198 dwellings.  In their purchase houses/private sites programme 317 dwellings were in course of construction or ready to be started, plans were being prepared for 1,133 dwellings on private sites, and 2,720 sites had been or were being acquired.</P>
      <P>On the above basis and taking into account normal vacancies in the corporation's existing housing estate it may reasonably be anticipated that the total of dwellings becoming available to Dublin Corporation for letting during 1971 will enable them to rehouse in the current year considerably more than half of the families on the approved waiting list as revised in November, 1970.</P>

      <P>Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, makes it an offence to drive or attempt to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of drink or drugs.  Section 49 of the 1961 Act was extended by Section 29 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, to include the offence of driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level in excess of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</P>
      <P>Apart from any other penalties which the court may impose on conviction for an offence under Section 49, the offence carries mandatory disqualification from driving for a minimum period of one year in the case of a first offence, and three years in a case of a second or subsequent offence.</P>
      <P>Provision is made in the 1968 Act (section 20) whereby the operation of a disqualification order may be postponed for a period not exceeding six months, provided the court is satisfied that a special reason&mdash;which it shall specify when postponing the operation of the order&mdash;relating to the personal circumstances of the convicted person, including the nature of his employment, has been proved by him to exist in his particular case.  This provision applies to all disqualification orders, mandatory or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The ever increasing number of persons killed and injured on the roads is a matter of grave concern, not only to me as Minister for Local Government, but to the community as a whole. In June last a total of 47 people were killed, an increase of 50 per cent over the figure for June, 1970.  The overwhelming conclusion of research carried out in many countries is that drunken driving is a major cause of road accidents. The law dealing with drinking and driving in this country was only recently strengthened by the introduction of the breathanalyser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3590" /> In the face of this serious evil I could not consider any relaxation of the law related to drinking and driving. Even if the amendment suggested in the question were desirable&mdash;and I think it is not&mdash;it would be virtually impossible to enforce it.  The mandatory disqualification is an important deterrent which, with the full operation of the breathanalyser, has come increasingly into the fight against the rising toll of road accidents.  In the words of the Report of the Commission on Driving while under the Influence of Drink or a Drug, &ldquo;a disqualification order helps to protect the public by removing, at least temporarily, a possible menace from the roads&rdquo;.  If a person whose livelihood depends on driving chooses to commit the offence of driving while under the influence of drink at any time, whether in the course of his livelihood or not, then he must be prepared to take the consequence of his irresponsible behaviour.</P>

I have drawn the council's attention to the serious consequences, including the further disemployment of staff, which failure to comply with their statutory duty would have and I have made it clear that the remedy provided by law to deal with the present situation would involve the removal of members from office under section 44 of the Local Government Act, 1941, as amended by section 64 of the Local Government Act, 1946. Action under these provisions would not involve the holding of a local inquiry.

      <P>I have already publicly expressed my concern over the increased number of road deaths in recent weeks. As far as the general public is concerned, everything possible is being done to remind road users of their responsibilities and the urgent need for greater care on the roads.  The most recent measure has been the erection of special temporary warning signs on major traffic routes to remind road users of the special hazards facing us in the months of August, September and October, which last year proved to be the worst on record.</P>
      <P>As far as visiting drivers are concerned, a special leaflet containing basic information on our rules of the road, including the requirement to drive on the left has been issued by my Department since 1966.  This leaflet is printed in French, German and English.  It is distributed through Bord Fáilte Éireann's regional and overseas tourist offices, travel agencies, car hire firms and motor organisations in such a way that non-resident drivers intending to bring their own cars or hire cars in this country can readily brief themselves on the legal requirements.</P>
      <P>At Rosslare Harbour, where drivers arrive direct from right-hand drive countries, a special sign warning drivers to drive on the left has been provided.

      <P>As indicated in reply to previous questions on this subject, I have no power to reinstate the members of Dublin Corporation who were removed from office under section 44 of the Local Government Act, 1941. The law requires me to fix a date for a new election which, in the case of Dublin Corporation, must be within the period of five years after the date of removal of the members from office.  No decision has been taken on the date for such new election.</P>
