      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not one of the matters of discrimination that perhaps could be removed and by its removal would give some evidence in the Six Counties that there is a real intention of bringing about any reforms of which we have heard so much in the last two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that the Act, as I said in this House before, was a nasty bit of business and its origin was suspect and discriminatory. Everybody knows that this has been raised several times at Question Time. Discrimination, as the term is used by the European Communities, means discrimination against or in favour of any one nation and not in relation to the other nations of the Communities.  I agree that this is suspect, that it was a discriminatory Act.  It is disappearing because of membership of EEC and this is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is it fully appreciated that in more recent times quite a number of workers from the Six Counties find lucrative employment on this side of the Border and are quite free to do so.  Long may it remain so, if there is a Border.  But, the other side of that is that employment is not available, and this Act was not brought in for, and has nothing to do with the protection of workers in the Six Counties, but rather as discrimination against certain workers there and workers coming from here and not from other European countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that there is freedom of movement for workers here.  They are welcome and there should be no question in our minds but that they should be free to take up employment here.  I think it is also true <Col N="3216" /> to say that it is almost farcical to speak of people going into the Six County area for employment and the purpose of the Safeguarding of Employment Act at this time could not be to protect employment in that way.  It is an Act which was suspect in its origin; it was discriminatory and political.  Nobody likes it here and we are glad that it will be going.  I do not think we should do anything against giving employment to people from the North in our part of the country just because they are implementing this Act there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suggestion of that.  I think I made that quite clear. What I am seeking is, as in the question asked, whether between now and the end of any transitional period that may be agreed on, if we all enter the Common Market, the Minister will pursue the idea of having the Act set aside in so far as Irish nationals and citizens are concerned, regardless of whether they live in the North or the South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be clear&mdash;the House certainly seemed to be clear when we talked of this here before&mdash;that the whole purpose of the Act was directed against people in this part of Ireland.  If you are asking them to remove that discrimination it is the same as asking them to remove the Act altogether.  We do not like the Act. We see that it is going after the transitional period.  It may happen during the transitional period that the Act may be used in a way which we would consider would require some action and certainly that action will be taken.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that by reason of the ESB's action in lowering the level, the CIE boat has not been able to operate from Athlone and that large cruisers have had to face Lough Ree with some danger?  The Minister gave me to understand here that the reason why the ESB maintained <Col N="3218" /> the low level this year was to facilitate dredging.  If they were not asked to do that, why did they maintain such a low level?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB do not have to be asked.  The Office of Public Works do the dredging at the behest of the ESB, and the dredging has been undertaken following a meeting which I organised in September, 1969, in Athlone, where all the cruiser interests were present and where it was agreed that the carrying out of this dredging on the length of the Shannon between Lanesboro and Tarmonbarry would make the navigation effective.  This dredging is now being done and the navigation will be effective in future years by reason of the representations made by me and the decisions reached arising out of that meeting.</P>

      <P>Might I put it to the Minister that the dredging can go ahead quite effectively with the level at Athlone weir at 123 feet OD, that there is no need to have it below that level for dredging purposes and that this is only spoof on the Minister's part?</P>

      <P>I am informed by Irish Shipping Ltd. that the British and French companies, the General Steam Navigation Company and Société Anonyme de Gérance et d'Armement&mdash;SAGA&mdash; who, in association with Irish Shipping Ltd., operated the Rosslare-Le Havre car ferry service of Normandy Ferries, have decided to withdraw their ships from this service at the end of the present season.  These companies have indicated that they wish to concentrate their ships on the routes which they operate from Southampton to the Continent.</P>

In some areas special co-ordination committees have been established and these meet regularly to ensure maximum co-ordination of programmes.

      <P>The EEC regulation dealing with the harmonisation of certain social provisions in the field of road transport includes a provision governing the permitted maximum period of daily driving on certain public service vehicles and on goods vehicles over 3½ metric tons.  As from the 1st October, 1971, the daily maximum will be eight hours.  The regulation will apply to Ireland on accession to the EEC subject to any transitional arrangements that might be negotiated.</P>
      <P>There is also an EEC regulation providing for the fitting of a tachograph to commercial road vehicles.  This regulation, to which Ireland will be subject on accession to the EEC, applies to new commercial vehicles from the 1st January, 1975, and to all commercial vehicles from the 1st January, 1978, again subject to whatever transitional arrangements may be negotiated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures available relate to payments to widows and children of civil servants who retired or died prior to 23rd July, 1968. Details are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Amount provided, 1970-71, £392,500; 1971-72, £379,500.</P>
      <P>(b) Amount spent in 1970-71, £420,000.  The excess of expenditure over the provision was met by savings on other provisions for superannuation.</P>
      <P>(c) The number of widows in receipt of pensions was 2,048 in 1970-71 and is 2,040 in 1971-72.</P>
      <P>(d) Tax is not deducted under PAYE from civil service widows' <i>ex gratia</i> pensions.  The tax is assessed under Schedule E and tax is deducted in quarterly instalments.  The total income tax deducted in 1970-71 was approximately £37,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) There are no savings in respect of the Social Insurance Fund as contributory pensions are not subject to a means test.  As regards widows and old age non-contributory pensions, the records of the Department of Social Welfare are not kept in such a way <Col N="3234" /> as to show readily the savings in question. Compilation of the information would entail disproportionate expenditure of time and labour.</P>
    <P>(f) A deduction of 1½ per cent per annum is made from current salaries and in addition a 1 per cent deduction is made from lump sums for each year not covered by periodic contributions. These payments relate to the Civil Service contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>(g) The additional cost of extending the benefits of the contributory pensions scheme to the widows and children of civil servants in receipt of payments under the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme would at present cost around £380,000 for a full year.</P>
    <P>(h) Rule 2 of the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, provides that if it appears that a person deprives himself or herself of any income or property for the purpose of qualifying for pension, or for pension at a higher rate than that to which he or she would otherwise be entitled, that income or property should be taken to be part of his or her means. It is not proposed to alter this provision.</P>

I do not think that is the right approach.  I am examining with the Minister for Social Welfare the possibility of widows in the categories mentioned here, who are over 70 and who would otherwise be entitled to the fringe benefits and who are close to the margin, being entitled to get the fringe benefits.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 20 of 10th February, 1971&mdash;Volume 251, columns 1002-1005 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>A foreign controlled company can only purchase non-urban land in this country if it has obtained:</P>
      <P>(1) A certificate from the Land Commission that it has shown to the Land Commission's satisfaction that it is acquiring not more than five acres for private residential purposes.</P>
      <P>(2) A certificate from the Department of Industry and Commerce that it has shown to the Minister's satisfaction that it is purchasing land exclusively for industrial purposes.</P>
      <P>(3) Land Commission consent under section 45 (2) (a) Land Act, 1965.  Where arable land is involved, such consent would be granted only in exceptional circumstances. The grant of consent is an &ldquo;excepted matter&rdquo; reserved to the Lay Commissioners.</P>
      <P>An Irish controlled company must also get consent under section 45, Land Act, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer of control of a company by means of a transfer of shares is governed by subsection (5) of section 45 of the Land Act, 1965. This provides, broadly, that if a company passes into the control of a <Col N="3237" /> non-qualified person, this fact must be reported to the Land Commission. The subsection further provides that should the Land Commission then institute acquisition proceedings for the land owned by the company the ordinary defences against acquisition would not apply.</P>
    <P>Due to the complexity of Company law and structure this was the only practicable measure of control that could be devised.  This provision was brought specially to the notice of the Dáil by the Minister for Lands in the course of the debate on the Committee Stage of the Land Bill, 1963; columns 1168 and 1169 of the Official Report of 19th November, 1964, are relevant.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that the Land Commission did in fact interpret that as meaning that they had the right to allow anybody to acquire any size of a farm, which was never the intention of this House when the Bill was passing through?</P>

During this period trade in agricultural products within the enlarged Community will be subject to a system of levies on imports and refunds on exports to compensate for the differences in the prices prevailing in the applicant countries and in the present Community.  These compensatory amounts will, of course, be gradually phased out according as prices in the applicant countries are brought into line with the common Community price levels.</P>
      <P>These arrangements will apply to all our main agricultural exports except lamb for which there is as yet no common organisation of the market in the Community.  In this case the Community's common customs tariff will be gradually phased out over the transition period.</P>

According to my information, Sir, the motion which the Parliamentary Secretary now proposes to move has not been signed by a Member, merely printed in the name of Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh.

It is not for me to suggest to the Chair how it could be put in order but it is a very important motion. It is a motion that seeks to take away from this House the liberties and privileges of the House.  It is a motion that should be moved only if it is strictly in order.  It is a fact that under the same Standing Order the Chair has power to abridge the time but it would be a decent thing to abridge the time and to let the Parliamentary Secertary come down to your desk, Sir, and sign his name to this document.  At least that would have the dignity of being in accordance with the Standing Orders of this House, even though we would not agree with it.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I rise to oppose this motion on behalf of Fine Gael.  The Chair has accepted the motion standing in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and I do not propose to quarrel with the ruling of the Chair.  Nevertheless, I do not think it is any harm <Col N="3255" /> to point out at this stage that in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in the last week in the case involving the Department of Posts and Telegraphs we are moving into an era when the State and each officer of the State, including the Ceann Comhairle, may find that the State and its officers may have to answer to the Courts for failing to carry out the laws of the country.</P>
      <P>The guillotine motion which has been proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary on instructions from the Government is a rare Parliamentary procedure. It is a good thing it is rare because the object and the effect of the guillotine motion is to restrict Parliament in its deliberations on legislative proposals of the Government. This is the second time in the last ten years that such a motion has been proposed in this House&mdash;the previous occasion was on the Marts Bill, and I believe such a resolution has only been proposed to the House on a few occasions since the foundation of the State.  As I say, this is a procedure which takes away from Parliament the function of Parliament to examine, discuss and scrutinise legislation, particularly legislation of a controversial nature affecting the rights of ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P>One would expect, therefore, that when a resolution like this is introduced in the name of the Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary, it would be justified on the grounds of urgency at least.  I want to submit to the House that this resolution cannot be justified on the grounds of urgency.  It proposes to steamroll the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970, through this House not later than 10.30 tonight.  It is relevant, therefore, to have a brief look at the history of this controversial piece of legislation. There is nothing urgent about it.  It was introduced ostensibly to deal with a practice which many of us do not condone, the practice of illegal entry and occupation of premises or property. I want to put on the record of the House that there has been none of this in either this city or in the country generally since long before the Bill was introduced.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> How, then, can the Minister, or the Taoiseach, or the Government, because they are responsible, justify depriving Parliament of its rights on the ground of urgency in respect of a Bill they introduced on 1st July, 1970, and then allowed to drag on for over 12 months?  There is no urgency about this Bill.  It is a try-on on the part of the Minister who wants to steamroll the Bill through the House and who is not prepared to give in.</P>
      <P>I said that on the last occasion on which this procedure of the guillotine was introduced was in respect of the Livestock Marts Bill.  In fairness to the Government at that time, it must be said that, although we disagreed violently with the Bill and although we have been since vindicated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash; because the Supreme Court rejected the Bill as unconstitutional, the Government of the day were treating that measure as urgent; it was introduced in Dáil Éireann on 31st May, <Col N="3257" /> 1967, and the guillotine was imposed on 20th July, 1967, less than two months later.  Contrast that with the procedure here: we had this Bill dragging on for well over a year and then being rushed through in the dying days of the session just before the long vacation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There is no urgency about this measure.  There are many measures on the Order Paper which are much more urgent, measures which have been disgracefully neglected by this Government, measures which are not of a controversial nature.  For example, the Fine Gael Party put down a Bill to amend the Planning and Development Act, 1963, a Bill designed to take planning appeals out of the hands of the political head of the Department and his political friends.  We debated that Bill for a considerable time and the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland, said that he accepted our Bill in principle and that he would introduce his own Bill to bring about the desired change.  The Local Government Planning and Development (No. 2) Bill, 1969, to deal with an abuse which is agitating the mind of every citizen, the deciding of planning appeals on a political basis, was introduced here on 16th July, 1969, and it has not yet got a Second Reading.  Now it is proposed to guillotine this piece of repressive legislation, repressive certainly in respect of section 4 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Again, we have a section of the law directly within the sphere of the Minister for Justice; I refer to the landlord and tenant law.  A Bill was introduced here by the Minister for Justice to deal with this problem.  Review and amendment in many respects is required. The Bill was introduced as far back as 9th December last.  The Bill has not yet got a Second Reading.  Why is it not regarded as an urgent matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no urgency whatever&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent&mdash;in respect of this Bill.  Any Deputy who cherishes Parliamentary democracy must be deeply concerned by the introduction of the guillotine at any time and on any measure, but we are particularly concerned <Col N="3258" /> about it when we find it being applied to a highly controversial piece of legislation like the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970.  Rarely has a more controversial piece of legislation come before this House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Never has a more controversial section than section 4 of this Bill come before this House.  This Bill is not only a controversial piece of legislation in the sense that the House is seriously divided on it.  It is not only a controversial piece of legislation in that only the Government Party, and we know not all of the Government Party, favour it and everybody else is against it, but it is a highly controversial piece of legislation in that the entire national Press, despite a possible interpretation put on the <i>Southern Star</i> by the Minister for Justice, are very concerned about it.  As time goes on, day after day, we have more responsible and, indeed, conservative thought coming into print against the Bill.  An article from RGDATA appears in one of today's papers saying they are concerned about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that the Minister for Justice or the Government are not entitled to enact controversial legislation. I am saying no such thing.  What I am saying is that, unless for the gravest reason and in the most exceptional circumstances, they are not entitled to impose the guillotine on controversial legislation of this sort.  It will probably be said that the Report Stage of this measure has set up a record in the length of time it has taken.  The Second Stage of the Bill got a reasonable discussion.  On behalf of Fine Gael I accepted the Principles behind sections 2 and 3 but I pointed out certain defects that should be eradicated such as in respect of the definition of owner and this obnoxious section 4.  We hoped that on the Committee Stage the Minister would have acceded to the points made on the Second Stage and would have dealt reasonably with our amendments.  It is true that on the Committee Stage the Minister did hold out hope to me in <Col N="3259" /> respect of the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; with which I was so much concerned. He promised to consider it and deal with it on the Fourth Stage.  We dealt very seriously with section 4 on the Committee Stage and we hoped that the Minister would have seen fit to introduce amendments on the Report Stage which would have met our objections and ensure the right of editorial comment in the national and provincial Press at least, but he did not do it.</P>
    <P>It was clear that he came into the House on the Report Stage determined not to give an inch, in the words of famous men in the northern part of this country.  He was determined to steamroll this Bill through.  It was only then that we on this side determined that if he was determined to push the Bill through the House he would do so only in the full light of public opinion and after we had been satisfied that the public would know what was in the Bill and if they did not, it would not be our fault.</P>
    <P>A Report Stage is not a complete rehash of a Bill when every line can be reinvestigated and criticised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I was saying that the guillotine is being imposed on the Fourth Stage of this Bill because the Opposition saw fit to point out clearly that the Minister had refused to meet their legitimate objections to the Bill on the Second and Committee Stages.  I want to go on record as putting to the House and the country what the Report Stage is about.  It is a Stage on which one can only speak on a section to which one has an amendment tabled.  Unlike the Committee Stage a Member may speak only once; he can speak as often as he likes on the Committee Stage. Therefore, what is being denied to Members of the House is the right to speak once on the Report Stage or the Final Stage of the Bill.  It is not a case of a Member standing up and repeating himself or obstructing; he may speak only once.  The Minister and the <Col N="3260" /> Government are seeking this motion to deprive the Members of the House of the right to speak once on the Report Stage or on the Fifth Stage.</P>
      <P>On the Fifth Stage we are confined to talking about what is in the Bill, the most limited type of discussion we could have.  Admittedly, one could say much about what is in this Bill but we are entitled to do that; Standing Orders and legislation give that right.  But that is what is being denied here.</P>
      <P>It is most objectionable that the guillotine should be imposed on the Report Stage of a controversial Bill such as this.  But the Government's performance does not end there.  They are imposing the guillotine during the discussion of section 4, which creates guilt by association, a section which creates the new offence of encouraging or advocating a crime.  They are stifling the Members of this House from speaking on section 4 which introduces for the first time the offence of encouraging or advocating a crime.  The matter does not end there.  The House is being invited to impose the guillotine during a discussion on amendment No. 9 in the names of Deputy Cooney and myself, an amendment which proposes to declare that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or book shall not constitute an offence under this section.</P>
      <P>That is the extraordinary situation we have.  During the passage of this Bill through Dáil Éireann the Government have seen fit to say: &ldquo;You will stop talking.  We are going to steamroll it through.&rdquo; That is the most disgraceful performance that any free Parliament must ever have experienced. What a time this Government seek to throttle free discussion here, to muzzle the Deputies, when we are complaining, as the newspapers are complaining, that the section, if un-amended, will muzzle freedom of expression of opinion in these papers. I wonder have the Government really thought what they are doing.  I wonder do they realise the proposal they are putting before this House, because a more outrageous proposal has never come before this Parliament or indeed before any other Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3261" /> The Minister is on record within the last few days as saying that there is no new crime here.  He is on record as saying that reasonable comment in a newspaper or magazine, <i>et cetera</i> on a matter of public interest cannot constitute an offence.  His colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, who treated the whole thing rather lightly, is on record as saying that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in a newspaper, magazine, <i>et cetera</i> could not be an offence. That is what we want to debate here. That is the debate that is going on throughout the length and breadth of this country.  Every newspaper is afraid reasonable comment will be made an offence under this section.  Not alone the papers that are free and unfettered but the papers that are normally tied to the strings of the Government Party have come out with editorials expressing their fear about this section and calling, in the words of the editorial of the <i>Irish Press</i>, for the matter to be put beyond doubt and for a few extra words to be added to ensure the liberty of the Press.</P>
    <P>That is what we are advocating here, and it is at this juncture in this debate that the Minister thinks fit to say: &ldquo;You have done enough talking about it.  I am going to trot it through the lobbies of this House with the feet of Deputies who during the Report Stage here showed by their contributions that they did not even know what section or what amendment was being dealt with.  That is no way to deal with Parliament and that is no way to protect the freedom of public opinion or freedom of expression in the national newspapers.</P>

He will go into the Seanad determined to waste public money in discussing this Bill for two or three weeks, as the Seanad are perfectly entitled to discuss it.  However, the Minister will go in predetermined not to accept an amendment, not even to change one word, even the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  He knows that if he did that he would have to do what the Government will not do, that is, recall Dáil Éireann to submit the Seanad amendments to it.</P>
      <P>How farcical can you get?  How low can one go in an attempt to steamroll one's way through the Oireachtas and at the same time reduce the second House of this Parliament to a farce. Some of the best brains in this country are in Seanad Éireann, but no matter what they say about this Bill, however they dissect it and even if they convince the Minister or the Government that this Bill should be amended, it will not be amended for the reason I have given.  That is a great abuse of Oireachtas Éireann.  It is a great abuse of the time of Seanad Éireann.  It is a great waste of public money and it is reducing one of the Houses of this Oireachtas to a farce and giving support to the people who say the Seanad should be abolished and that it is only there to house the Minister's cronies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is dangerous running controversial legislation through this House at this time of year.  You do not have to take my word for that.  We had the Livestock Marts Bill introduced and given a First Reading on 31st May, 1967 and guillotined, one would normally say to death, but in this case into existence, guillotined into birth on 20th July, 1967, after at least a score of divisions were taken on it.  What was the result <Col N="3263" /> of that exercise?  The result was that we passed bad legislation, and every time we try to steamroll our way through here or try to do something in a hurry, we do the same thing.  The Bill that was passed here last Christmas to get people to go and give evidence before a Committee of this House, which they are not doing today, was held to be unconstitutional. As in the case of the Livestock Marts Bill, that Bill was rushed through on the eve of the Christmas vacation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Bill that myself and the Minister for Justice are talking about was offered to the House by the Taoiseach when he was riding high, a lot higher than he is riding today, offered to us gratuitously as a way of cleaning up the mess created by the Minister's predecessor. It was held to be unconstitutional. It was brought in just after the Livestock Marts Act became an issue, an Act on which the Minister was not prepared to give in and he used every extreme, including the guillotine, to get it through the House.  It was unconstitutional just as section 4 of this Bill is unconstitutional.  The Minister will live to regret it.  The Minister is creating a bad precedent by using the the guillotine on a discussion on the freedom of the Press and on an amendment to preserve the freedom of editorial comment in the Press.  That is what the <Col N="3264" /> Minister is doing.  There is no doubt about it.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite have said: &ldquo;We are prepared to sit here in August and September and you will be eating your Christmas dinners here if you do not give in.&rdquo; We were threatened with having our Christmas dinners here and told we could go to Switzerland for the winter sports, if we could afford it.  The Minister's bluff was called.  The bluff of the Government was called.  They were the people who had to &ldquo;get out of the kitchen&rdquo; because the Minister could not stand the heat.  The Minister for Justice and the Government could not stand the heat.  It was not the Opposition who started to squeak.  It was not the Opposition, who are in receipt of salaries a lot smaller than the ministerial salaries, who cried and whined and said they wanted to go on their holidays.  It was the Taoiseach and the Cabinet who decided that the heat in the Chamber was too much for them and that they would have to get out. Heat scalded them&mdash;the heat imposed on them by the editors of the newspapers and public opinion.  They did not want to have it any longer because instead of this controversy easing off it was snowballing.  Why did the Government not give us another week here? Many of us have other things to do. Few of us are fulltime politicians. Many of us could spend a few weeks tidying up affairs which have got into arrears because we have taken on the duty of doing our job in the Dáil. When we offered ourselves to the electorate for election to this Assembly we took on that duty.  We are not abusing the processes of this House.  Public opinion has not yet got tired of listening to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one gives further consideration to the position one notices how sordid it is.  One is inclined to ask: do the Government wish to get this measure through Dáil Éireann to avoid further embarrassing questions from Deputy Blaney at Question Time?  He is a Deputy who was a former member of the Government.  He has been embarrassing the Taoiseach and the Government from many angles.  There has been opposition here to this Bill, and from newspapers throughout the <Col N="3265" /> country.  Deputy Blaney is a man who knows the inner workings of the Government on a variety of topics.  That is why the heat is too much and why the Government want to get out of it.  That is not the decent thing to do on a Bill of this nature or on a section of a Bill of this type.  We are dealing with an amendment about the freedom of the Press.  The decent thing to do would have been to sit on here and take the medicine served and steamroll it through when single speeches have been heard, because nobody can speak more than once on this Stage.  Why did the Minister not let the discussion on section 4 be finished?  It would not have taken very much longer.  If section 4 of the Bill were disposed of the rest would not take much longer.  Why did the Minister not allow a free discussion on the freedom of the Press?</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 35, after &ldquo;offence&rdquo; where it secondly appears to add &ldquo;provided always and it is hereby declared that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or book shall not constitute an offence under this subsection&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Three or four Deputies have spoken on that amendment and have all made reasonably short speeches.  Why did the Government not give a couple of days on that?  If they thought they should impose a guillotine on other Stages&mdash;while I would not agree&mdash;it would not have been as reprehensible as this.</P>

We are doing a bad day's work for this country as a whole and for this island of ours by this sort of a performance in Parliament at a time when we are deprecating the happenings in Northern Ireland.

      <P>I invite the Minister now to amend this motion which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has put before the House, as the Minister can do.  An amendment proposed by a member of the Government can be accepted.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inviting the Minister to have second thoughts about it.  Have full and free discussion on section 4 of this Bill and see what happens afterwards. He can renew his thinking and have another Cabinet meeting on the rest of the Bill.  No self-respecting Taoiseach presiding over any self-respecting Government could or should introduce a guillotine motion to deny Parliament the right to discuss a section which proposes to muzzle the Press and to amend that section by making it clear beyond yea or nay that the Press shall not be muzzled as long as it behaves in a reasonable manner.  That is the danger in this Bill and in this section.  The Press could be behaving absolutely reasonably in discussing a matter of public interest and yet the effect of their activities could be to encourage in the words of the section people to be guilty of breaches of sections 2 and 3.  I am honestly convinced that it has not yet sunk into this Cabinet what to do.  Even at this stage, if we can bring home to the Government the <Col N="3268" /> enormity of this disgraceful and shameful proposal, it will have done good. We shall oppose this tooth and nail.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from fair and reasonable comment.  This Bill introduces a new word into the law of the land.  It is a Bill which, in keeping with the guillotine, makes our law akin to French law whereby one is obliged to prove oneself innocent.  The responsibility on the part of the State to prove one's guilt is being taken away.  It is a Bill which would make me, and many like me, a criminal by reason of an act or statement made by another.  I am proud of my life-long membership of the Workers Union of Ireland&mdash;a union with some 30,000 members.  Were any individual or small group within that union to make a statement which could be interpreted by the Minister as contravening this proposed legislation, I, too, would be guilty equally unless I were to dissociate myself publicly from it.  My union is not the largest union in the country and, apart from unions, there are many other associations in the country.  That, then, is the type of legislation we have been discussing and in respect of which we are being guillotined.</P>
      <P>As the Whip of my party, it was necessary for me to consider and endeavour to anticipate what the Government might do during the course of this debate.  The question of a guillotine was mentioned by various members but I said to these members that not even Fianna Fáil would strike such a blow against Parliamentary democracy at this particular time.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders what brought the Government to the point where they decided to take this extreme action.  In the first place there was a campaign by Fianna Fáil within the House which lead to the Minister for Justice, two weeks ago, threatening the Opposition that they would not get their holidays <Col N="3271" /> until September if the Bill did not go through before then.  They threatened us as if we were little boys waiting to be released from boarding school. When we made it clear that we intended acting as an Opposition and intended doing what we were sent here to do by the electorate&mdash;oppose&mdash;and were not concerned unduly with our holidays, there was a campaign in the corridors of the House whereby Fianna Fáil Deputies brought ushers and other members of the staff into corners to tell them what bad boys the Opposition were, particularly the Labour Party, and that this was a tremendous blow against workers.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that as far as my party are concerned we regret genuinely any inconvenience caused to the staff of the House or to journalists or anybody else who is committed to the House.  At the same time, I must make it clear that this Parliament is not for the benefit of the staff, the Press, or the Opposition but is for the benefit of the people.  We shall continue to do what we regard is our duty to the electorate who sent us here.</P>
    <P>This piece of legislation that is being steamrolled through the House will have the most serious consequences not only for the Government but for the country as a whole.  At this point no less than six amendments have been discussed but not a word has been uttered either for or against them by the Government.  No Member of the House will be allowed to utter a word on the Fifth Stage of the Bill.  It has been said here that if this Bill goes through and is signed by the President, it will be challenged in the courts and declared unconstitutional.  I do not know whether that is correct.  I have no legal training but it is my opinion that the Bill will be declared unconstitutional but whether or not it is so declared it cannot be enforced.  We know that there have been previous cases where this Government have applied the jackboot to ordinary people with total disregard for the rights of those people.  When we tell them from these benches that even if the Bill is passed, the legislation cannot be enforced they laugh at us.  Their laughter was cut <Col N="3272" /> short when ESB workers whom they had committed to Mountjoy were released after the Government had paid their fines and sent them home in taxis provided by the Government.  That happened when it was found that that particular legislation could not be enforced.  Here again they are steam-rolling through the House what is an even more oppressive piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Last week there were some violent clashes in the House not only between the Government and the Opposition Parties but between members of the Opposition and the Ceann Comhairle. I am still of the opinion that had Standing Orders been complied with, we could not now be discussing this motion.  I am referring to Standing Order No. 53 and not Standing Order 27 which I agree has been violated by the Ceann Comhairle.  Standing Order 53 states:</P>
    <P>...and unless it shall appear to the Ceann Comhairle that such a motion is an infringement of the rights of a minority...</P>
    <P>Surely there is no other way of interpreting this proposed legislation than as an infringement of the rights of a minority?  It continues:</P>
    <P>or that the question has not been adequately discussed.</P>
    <P>At the time to which I am referring we were discussing amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputies Fitzpatrick and Cooney.  This amendment to the most controversial section of the Bill was debated by Deputy Fitzpatrick for approximately one-and-a-half hours. The next speaker to the amendment was Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien who spoke for four hours and 20 minutes&mdash; a total of five hours and 50 minutes. This section sought to introduce into the law the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, that it would be an infringement of the law to encourage a person to do a certain thing.  This is a completely new departure from our existing law and from any law that has existed in this country to my knowledge.  We were allowed a total of five hours and 50 minutes, with the second speaker not having concluded his case when the closure motion was introduced.</P>

      <P>Not one word, not only from the Minister&mdash;there are 75 Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; but from the Government Party was uttered to justify this change which would have such far-reaching implications. The guillotine is an extreme measure.  The British Parliament have always been proud of their democratic procedures.  For many years the same rules exactly applied to our own deliberations, whatever value they were. We have inherited many of their traditions, many of their laws and many of their procedures.  The guillotine was well established in Continental Parliaments in the 18th and 19th centuries but the guillotine was introduced for the first time into the British Parliament, and we were then subject to Britain, on the 3rd February, 1881, against Parnell on the Coercion of Ireland Act.  It is ironic that on this legislation the Republican Party, in brackets, should introduce it.</P>

      <P>I want to say something with regard to this motion which I regard as a very serious motion.  It is a motion, as has been pointed out, under which the Government propose to circumscribe and destroy the rights of Deputies in this Parliament to discuss legislation.  A motion of that kind, needless to say, should not be tabled and should not be pressed unless for the most cogent and serious of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing this motion today &mdash;Wednesday of this week.  This day last week the Fianna Fáil Party met, one of their rare meetings I understand. It became common knowledge in the House that they considered whether they would table this motion or not and having considered it they decided &mdash;I do not know by what majority but they certainly decided&mdash;not to do so, The reason which apparently influenced them largely was that public opinion would not stand for this silencing of Parliament.  That was a week ago. What has happened since?  Why, on last Thursday morning, did the Taoiseach suddenly come into this House and inform the House of his intention, <Col N="3274" /> through his Parliamentary Secretary, of tabling this motion?  Something very serious must have happened; or is it the situation that with the Government and within the Fianna Fáil Party there is now no consistent posture in any direction and that the whim or fancy of an excitable Minister can commit the party to a radical change at any particular time?  Certain it is that on Wednesday a responsible decision was taken by the Fianna Fáil Party not to impose the guillotine on this Bill.  Of course they could not have come to any other decision because in the course of the debates various Fianna Fáil speakers, not many of them because not many of them contributed, but those who did contribute banged their chests and said: &ldquo;We will stay here as long as you stay here.  We will not be outdone.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes.  I went along with the sentiments he was expressing. He was quite clear that, so far as he was concerned, so far as the Fianna Fáil Party was concerned&mdash;of course he had just come out from the meeting to announce this decision to the House in effect&mdash;they would stay here; they realised the duty of the Opposition; they realised how serious this measure was; they realised how essential it was that it be discussed carefully and responsibly by Parliament and, therefore, said the Parliamentary Secretary, there will be no curb, no restriction, no limit, no prohibition on the functioning of this Parliament as a responsible, deliberative assembly.  Time quote: I would say about 5.20 this day week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened?  Is it that unbeknownst to his colleagues and unbeknownst to Members of his party, the Minister for Justice blew his top, lost his cool, and committed the Fianna Fáil Party to swallow its own <Col N="3275" /> decision.  If that is so it appears to me that the orderly discussion of measures in this House is being jeopardised.  There is a belief, held by many Deputies and I could number myself among them, that Standing Orders no longer operate as they should, as the shield and the protector of the individual Deputy in this House.  I have seen, too often, Standing Orders being brushed aside at times of heat, at times of temptation as if they did not say what they clearly said, brushed aside to deprive Deputies of their right freely to express their views in this House.  That is the forerunner of absolute anarchy.  If we permit that kind of situation further to deteriorate, I regret it very much but I think we will all have to conclude that this assembly ceases to have any function. If, on top of that, we have a position in which individual Ministers are permitted to run around the place like so many jacksnipes, descending here for one moment and away on another subject in another moment, making decisions and committing their colleagues to a course of action without responsible consideration then a state of anarchy will exist.  This is what has happened now and this is the reason we are confronted with this motion.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to remind the House that these Standing Orders were framed and brought into being in the midst of fire and brimstone.  They were introduced at a time when the people who framed them knew how essential it was to have a free Parliament in which Deputies could speak freely, knowing that in accordance with the right they received from their constituents the Ceann Comhairle, armed with these Standing Orders, would protect them against any aggressive majority.</P>
    <P>Our Standing Orders were framed and tabled 50 years ago and they have stood the test of time.  These were the Standing Orders in operation when threats were made against the functioning of this Parliament.  Many Deputies who were elected freely in general elections boycotted Parliament but when eventually they came into this House in 1927 these were the Standing Orders that were in operation.  Unchanged, <Col N="3276" /> they have been found well capable of ensuring the rights of every section, of every Deputy and of every party.  They were graced and presided over by the finest Ceann Comhairle our Parliament could have had at that time&mdash;I refer to Professor Michael Hayes.</P>
    <P>From 1927, through the turbulent period to 1932, when challenge after challenge came from the Ceann Comhairle's right side against the Government in those days there was never a suggestion that the guillotine be applied.  There was never a suggestion that because it was inconvenient or awkward or politically disadvantageous that Deputies should be prevented from expressing sincerely-held views.  The ordinary rules applied.  There are only two rules in our Standing Orders which are designed to restrict debate; one of these is Order No. 54.  This Standing Order states:</P>
    <P>At any stage of a debate, other than a debate on any stage of a Bill, a Member may move (the assent of the Chair not being withheld) &ldquo;That the Dáil proceed to the next business&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>This Order has been used frequently in this House but it applies only to matters under discussion which do not relate to legislation.  I should imagine that under this Standing Order the Chair would give consent only if the Chair considered that the matter before the House had been fully discussed with particular regard to the rights of the minority.  Incidentally, the minority in this sense means the minority inside the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Order that deals with legislation is Order No. 53 and all Deputies should learn this Standing Order by heart. Standing Order No. 53 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) After a question (except a question already barred from debate under the Standing Orders) has been proposed from the Chair either in the Dáil, or in a Committee of the whole <Col N="3277" /> Dáil, a Member may claim to move, &ldquo;That the question be now put&rdquo;, and unless it shall appear to the Ceann Comhairle that such a motion is an infringement of the rights of a minority, or that the question has not been adequately discussed, or that the motion is otherwise an abuse of these Standing Orders, the question, &ldquo;That the question be now put&rdquo;, shall be put forthwith, and decided without amendment or debate.</P>
    <P>This is used in relation to legislation and Deputies will note that it can operate only when there is a question before the House proposed by the Chair.  It does not, and cannot, operate otherwise.  This was pointed out clearly in relation to a similar Order in the British House of Commons more than 80 years ago and it was then demonstrated clearly that the closure of debate could only apply when a question was proposed by the Chair.</P>
    <P>We know a question is proposed by the Chair only in the special cases where there has already been a full debate in the House.  For instance, it does not arise on the First Reading of a Bill because that is a question proposed by the mover of the Bill.  It does not arise on the Second Stage because this Stage is moved by the mover or proposer of the Bill.  On the Committee Stage it does arise quite frequently.  It arises after amendments have been tabled, moved and debated by the Dáil in Committee.  At the end of the discussion on the amendments and the debate thereon when the amendments have been decided by the Committee of the House, the Ceann Comhairle&mdash; or Chairman, as he is called under Standing Orders&mdash;says: &ldquo;The question is: `That the section stand part of the Bill'.&rdquo; Everyone knows it is common practice for a Deputy to say at this stage &ldquo;On the section...&rdquo; and on the question, &ldquo;That the section stand part of the Bill&rdquo; there may be repetition of a debate which has taken place on the amendments.  It is in those circumstances that Order No. 53 comes into operation because at that stage the Chair may entertain a motion from some other Deputy &ldquo;That the question be now put.&rdquo; The question is that the section under discussion stand part of <Col N="3278" /> the Bill.  As I understand it, and as I believe parliamentarians for over 100 years have understood it, that is the effect of a closure under Standing Order No. 53.</P>
    <P>The next stage at which it arises is on the Fifth Stage of a Bill when the Chair proposes the question: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo; At that stage any Deputy can say: &ldquo;On the passage of the Bill I wish to speak.&rdquo; He can speak then, in accordance with Standing Orders, for as long as he likes on the contents of the Bill.  There may be circumstances in which a short Bill, a one or two section Bill, has been amply discussed and, on the question that the Bill do now pass, the Chair may entertain a motion by some other Deputy that the question be put.  Those are the only circumstances which I have been able to find in accordance with our Standing Orders in which the closure applies.  I am perfectly aware that in error&mdash;and I say grave and profound error&mdash;on two previous occasions the Chair has acted otherwise.  I should not like this to pass without comment at this stage in relation to this motion. What I believe to have been well-intentioned but nevertheless erroneous decisions of the past should not now gather any sanctity by reason of their repetition in breach of Standing Order No. 53.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should be really necessary for a member of the Irish Parliament to emphasise the obvious in this fashion.  It was precisely because closure did not apply as a procedure in all circumstances that, in the British House of Commons in the last century, to deal with the organised, disciplined, responsible action of the Irish Parliamentary Party, some bright genius of a British Government Minister decided on what they dubbed the guillotine immediately because of its associations with France and because it was used in the French Parliament.  It was, of course, an allocation of time motion. The allocation of time motion, the guillotine, was introduced, as Deputy Cluskey has reminded us, in 1881 in the British House of Commons to prevent Irish members from talking about coercion in Ireland.  They could not prevent them under the closure.  They could not do it under Standing Orders, <Col N="3279" /> which were the same then as they are now, and they brought in the guillotine for the particular purpose of preventing Irish members of the British Parliament from acting as they wished as representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>It is really a matter for despair and despondency that at this stage in our Parliament this Government should be using this tactic: using the guillotine and using it under such strange circumstances. A week ago they had decided responsibly not to do this.  That decision was announced at about 5.30 p.m. this day week by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Nevertheless, the following morning the Taoiseach came into the House to announce his intention to table this motion.  This means that, in a fit of anger, in a fit of petulance with some ill-assorted motives, somebody decided to do this.  Why? Was it to punish the Opposition? Was it to quell the mounting opposition outside the House to section 4 of the Bill?  Was it to try to dam and retard the growing unpopularity of the Government in relation to this measure?  There was some such motive behind it because we were told time and time again that time did not matter, that holidays did not matter, that the Government were as committed as we were to sitting here throughout the long hot summer days.  We were told there would be no obstacle in the way of debate.  Nevertheless, suddenly, for some reason, this strange decision was taken on a matter of fundamental importance to Deputies.</P>
    <P>I question that motive.  It will lead to an irresponsible situation in this House if merely because a Bill is hotly contested, merely because it is controversial, merely because it arouses and has aroused indignation inside and outside the House, merely because each day it is becoming more and more embarrassing to the Government, the Government decide to grasp the nettle and to grasp it in such a way that all further discussion is prohibited, and to table a motion of this kind.  I think that is wrong and that it is harming Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this motion before the House shows all the indications of a Government running in panic from a measure of which they are afraid.  The Government fully realise now all the serious implications of this Bill.  They also realised the possible implications early last year when they decided to introduce it.</P>
      <P>The Bill was introduced into this House on 1st July, 1970.  I feel at any rate that the Government deliberately prolonged the taking of the Second Stage until January of this year.  The other Stages were deliberately delayed in order to create a situation coming up to the time of the Recess in which the Bill would have to be rushed through the House and the various sections of the Bill would not get the discussion and the examination which they merit.  This was a well-worked out plan by the Government.  This is not the first occasion on which they tried this type of manoeuvre.  Of course, the plan went wrong somewhere so far as the Government were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They discovered that the measure was getting very minute examination by the Opposition, that all the bad aspects of the Bill were being highlighted, and that the news media were awake to the serious implications of the Bill.  When it became obvious that the Opposition would pursue their opposition to each section very diligently, and when the Government discovered that we were not bluffing on this side of the House&mdash;the Government were engaging in a bluff&mdash;and when they discovered how seriously the ordinary man in the street was taking this measure as well as Deputies on this side of the House they suddenly decided to cut short the debate and in that way tried to save their faces because they felt, and they knew, that a guillotine motion such as this would have an adverse affect on themselves. Nevertheless they balanced it up and judged, and I think judged rightly, that a continuation of the debate on the Bill, and particularly on the amendment before the House at the time of <Col N="3281" /> this guillotine, and further consideration of these amendments would have a far worse effect on the Government than the guillotine motion.  Because of that, we are here this evening debating this extremely rare type of motion.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate, too, that at this point in time in our history, when we have to say so much, and do say so much, about the rights of minorities, even though the Opposition on this side of the House represent 50 per cent of the electorate we are nevertheless treated in almost the same way as the Unionist Party treat their Opposition in Stormont.  This indeed is the effect which this motion has on the Opposition here, that we are being put into the same position and being treated with the same kind of justice as that with which the Opposition Parties in Stormont have been treated over a long period.</P>
    <P>Another reason for this motion is the fact that the Government have completely failed to justify the necessity for the Bill.  They have failed in spite of their very severe persuasion of their Deputies to get them to come in and speak in favour of the Bill.  They have failed utterly in that also.  Time and time again during the debate we had the threat that speaker after speaker would be put in and that Government speaker would follow Opposition speaker, but in this again they have failed miserably simply because they were not able to justify the proposals in the Bill.  Their best weapon, therefore, when they had not got arguments to put forward in favour of the Bill, and particularly section 4, was this motion.  I think it is very relevant and important to note the stage at which this guillotine motion was introduced.  It has been introduced on the most crucial section of the Bill, the most important section, and because the Government were themselves embarrassed, and very embarrassed on this section, and because they found it so difficult to get their own members to come in and speak in favour of it, they decided that the best way out for them was to introduce this guillotine motion.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government <Col N="3282" /> has left, because I was in the House this night last week when he was speaking, and I spoke after him, and Deputy Cunningham on that occasion, 28th July, 1971, at column 2759 of volume 255, said:</P>
    <P>All of us will agree that a Government should stay here until legislation is fully discussed and debated and until laws which are necessary in the eyes of the Government are enacted, especially when you have a democratically-elected Government and a Government who have been in office for quite a number of years and who have put through this House during their long term of office all kinds of legislation.  Admittedly, some of it was challenged as being unconstitutional&mdash;this is fair enough.  I agree that this has happened and can happen again.  I do not think that any Government, having made provision in a Bill to legislate for certain offences, should be panicked by the threat&mdash;that is probably a rather strong word; I admit it is&mdash;by the statement of Deputy Tully, for whom I have the highest regard.  I do not regard as a threat his statement that he will stay here while we will stay here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham's view on last Wednesday night was that the Government should not be panicked by the threat of having to stay here for a few weeks debating this measure, and of course how right he was, but a short time after that, a short few hours after, we saw the Minister for Justice fleeing in full panic and introducing a closure motion on amendment No. 9, and then we had the Taoiseach coming in last Friday morning and intimating that he was going to introduce this motion here today.  I have a number of amendments still to be discussed on this Bill. It is obvious that if this motion goes through these amendments will not be discussed, that we will not get an opportunity of making a case for them and of course the Government will not get an opportunity of making a case against them.</P>
    <P>Here again we can only assume that they are unable and unwilling to make any case against these amendments that they are unable or unwilling to continue <Col N="3283" /> the debate on section 4 and the amendment, a very important amendment, still to come on section 4.  The other amendments already disposed of have been dealt with fairly adequately, but there are many aspects of the Bill which should be debated and discussed on the Fifth Stage.  To have a measure of this kind, a measure which contains the provisions which this Forcible Entry Bill contains, pass through this House without all the amendments on Report Stage and all the discussion on the Fifth Stage fully gone into is extremely bad.  This is a Bill to which, on Committee Stage, there were relatively few amendments, and even on Report Stage, the amendments were relatively few, but they were amendments which, as far as the Government were concerned, showed up the weaknesses of the Bill, and because of that full consideration of the Bill would not be in the Government's best interest.</P>
    <P>I do not know who or what prompted the Government to bring in this closure motion because even the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, who is the Chief Whip, said he was prepared to stay, and I would imagine that he is in touch with his Deputies many times every day and he knows how they feel.  On a number of occasions he also said in this House that they were all prepared to stay here to have this Bill fully discussed and he said they were going to put in speaker for speaker.  I do not think he was chancing his arm when he said that.  I believe he had good reason to say it.  What has happened to all these brave men who will now march through the Division Lobby some time this evening to end any further debate in this House on this measure?</P>
    <P>When debate has to be limited in this House, when it has to be cut short and when it appears to the people outside this House that it is not possible to have a full debate in this House it leads to all types of activity on the streets, whether it be protest marches, and their after-effects, or other street activities.  The Government are allowing things to go in this direction because they are preventing the democratically <Col N="3284" /> elected representatives from discussing the legislation which the Government have introduced here.  The only alternative which will appear to a lot of people will be that they will have to become street politicians and hope to pressure the Government and public opinion by taking action on the streets.</P>
    <P>We do not want this to happen and that is why we are concerned about this guillotine motion.  We are concerned that legislation should be fully discussed and not alone that it should be fully discussed but that it should appear to be fully discussed in this House and that the Government should not attempt, no matter how pressing the holidays might be to some of them, or what commitment they might have, to limit debate in any way.  When the Government sought election they put themselves at the complete service of the people and they should be prepared to remain in this House until this legislation has been fully examined.</P>
    <P>We do not want to see the functions of this Parliament taken out of this House.  We want to do the job which has to be done here.  There is no urgency attaching to the Forcible Entry Bill.  This Bill has created a good deal of public concern and public opinion has been totally against it.  A guillotine motion on such a Bill can be interpreted in only one way, that the Government are in a state of panic, that they realise the weakness of this proposed legislation and they have failed utterly to justify the provisions of this Bill, particularly those of section 4.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Ceann Comhairle has upheld the right of Independent Deputies to speak in this House.  We have people here talking about freedom of the Press, freedom of this, that and the other thing. I am ten years in this House and the first time I ever saw an attempt being made to prevent an Independent Deputy from speaking was some weeks ago.  This attempt, which was not successful, to prevent an Independent Deputy from speaking was made by one of those gentlemen who has sought to make political propaganda out of this Bill.  However, on that occasion, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle took my side.  Now we find this Deputy talking <Col N="3285" /> about freedom of this and freedom of that.</P>
      <P>Freedom is where you find it.  We hear talk about freedom of the Press. African monkeys have not any great respect for papers, no matter what type they are, and if anyone tries to do anything to them they make the greatest amount of noise known in any part of the world.  I believe that is democracy but I have never heard so many allegedly democratically minded people being so long-winded trying to uphold democracy.  They speak insincerely because they know that what they say is in the Bill and what is actually in the Bill are two entirely different matters.  They know, as well as I do, that the Government would never, by any stretch of imagination, be undemocratic towards anything.  I am not the strongest supporter of the Government but after seeing the type of Government which went before this Government and during the interval when they were not in power I have no option in the interests of my own people but to support the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Government on this Bill and I want to say that 99 per cent of the people from the constituency I represent unhesitatingly support the Government on this Bill.  Do those pseudo-aesthetes, masquerading as Labour Deputies, own any property? Would they like to see their property taken over by squatters or by anybody else?  Of course they would not, but where cheap political publicity comes into the matter they are delighted to take any advantage they can of an opportunity like this to try to get that type of cheap publicity for themselves and for their 17 parties because they are not all one party.  These are the very same people who are today, and who have been for the last few weeks, talking about democracy, about political repression and the effects of this Bill.  These are the very same people who only a very short time ago tried to prevent newspaper reporters from attending a rugby match.  These are the famous over-night democrats, the instantaneous democrats of today. They are so crazy that they believe the public are gullible and that they forget what they have read, seen or heard, <Col N="3286" /> but the public are not gullible.  If there are such gullible people in the country today they must be very close to this House, if they are not inside it.</P>
    <P>That is my candid opinion.  I know those people well and if they think the kind of thing they have been trying to put across will carry any weight they have another think coming.  There is very little truth in most of the statements made by Opposition Deputies. They have come here to filibuster the Bill and that is all.  They did the same on the Land Bill and they tried to get the people in the Midlands to believe that if Deputy Moran got the Bill through he would lead the people of Mayo into the promised land of the Midlands.  Of course he had no such intention.  That Bill was probably the most innocuous ever to be put through the House, just as this Bill will be and as the people who have been debating it and demonstrating against it will find out.</P>
    <P>These Bills when they become Acts are never enforced.  For instance, supposing someone went now to enforce the Intoxicating Liquor Acts in the way they should be enforced, the Government would be bankrupt in three weeks.  That is true.  No Government in any democratic country have ever enforced Acts of this kind.  Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;I am not referring to my friend over there&mdash;have a mania for producing all the paper work they can, perhaps with the idea of getting themselves into history by the volumes of books in the Library and in the various offices here.</P>
    <P>I should be surprised if many Deputies here know a word of what is in this Bill.  How many Deputies know a single section of the Companies Act which went through here in a few hours.  As I have said, I doubt if most Deputies know one word of what is in this Bill.  The Companies Bill went through the House and it left here as one of the biggest Acts ever to go through.  I should like to know how many Deputies read even one page.</P>

      <P>I was giving a few reasoned examples.  I remember reading a subsection of the Finance Act <Col N="3287" /> and my good friend, Dr. Ryan, was Minister at the time.  I asked him and I asked every Deputy in the House to explain the subsection and they admitted they could not.  They said that was what the draftsman had decided should be written.  All the High Court judges in Europe could not interpret it.  It will be the same with this Bill.  If it goes into the High Court, for the sake of all the lawyers on this side of the House some judge will turn it one way and another fellow will turn it the other way.</P>
      <P>We are reaching the end of the filibuster and it is about time.  Any of us who have homes to go to should go home.  We should get out of here for a while, anyway.  This has been going on continuously and most of the Deputies who have been arguing have been here a very short time.  They certainly will not be here long enough to earn their pensions.  They are the Deputies who have made the most noise.</P>
      <P>I read this Bill to make sure that there is nothing wrong with it.  I read it a second time to make doubly sure. Nobody in my constituency barring three Deputies and a Senator&mdash;less than 1 per cent of the people&mdash;could find anything wrong with it and they did so for the sake of talking.  My opinion is that it is not now this Bill should have been brought in.  However, I believe there was ample legislation already to deal with a lot of the blackguardism that is going on but that legislation was not enforced in the way it should have been.  If it had been enforced there would not have been any need for this Bill.  Although it is urgently needed it will have very little effect in the long run.</P>

    <P>Any Deputy who cannot get a laugh without a monkey puzzle has not very much to do.  When he is in the House as long as I am he will not be laughing. He is like the pseudo-aesthete chancers of Dublin city.  He should go to the people and see what they have to say and he will not laugh half as loudly.  Opposition to this Bill is only a racket.  Of course there has been no Opposition since 1957.  Any time they have brought the Government close to <Col N="3288" /> defeat has been accidental.  Most of the amendments for this Bill have been either childish or senile and no Government would seriously consider them.</P>
    <P>We have had references to the French Revolution and we have had other codology during the past few weeks.  They are the people who will come back here in October and talk about France and the guillotine as the greatest example of republicanism in the world.  There has been all this ballyhoo about the guillotine.  We know that politicians throughout the world have to exploit the moment.  They cannot afford to think of the future and some of them do not wish to think of the past.  I do not blame people because of this but I think the attitude displayed towards this Bill should be thrown overboard.  It has been a waste of the time of this House when the House could be usefully engaged otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputies have been discussing a few words in a Bill which is unlikely ever to be enforced.  However, the political gimmick had to go on.  It has gone on for a long time now.  I do not think any property owner would be anxious to see a position obtaining in which anybody could walk in and take over that property without any reference to him, good, bad, or indifferent.  I cannot imagine that there is anybody who would not object to any infringement of his rights as a property owner. Even the unfortunate tinkers are put out of sandpits and quarries, very often by people who do not own the quarries and the sandpits.  The tinkers were burned out in Galway.</P>
    <P>Are these people here trying to convince us that they believe what they say?  I do not believe a word of what they say.  I know it would be unparliamentary to call a Deputy a liar but I do not believe the statements which have been made.  I do not believe these people believe that any action that could have dire results will be taken against newspaper men or anybody else, not even the squatters.  If the tinkers cannot go into sandpits and quarries I cannot see why certain people should be allowed to go in and take over the Georgian houses in this <Col N="3289" /> city.  I believe the Georgian houses should have been blown up long ago. There are gentlemen who preach democracy; they are the people who claim that eastern European countries are democratic.  They claim that Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania and even Russia are democratic countries and we are not a democracy.  Whom do they think they are codding?  An earlier Land Bill showed how farcical this attitude was.  Possibly the Government were a little lax in not insisting that the Bill should be a little bit more realistic than it was.</P>
    <P>I have one final point.  I will not spend five hours talking here.  Any man who cannot say what he has to say in 15 minutes has nothing to say and is not worth listening to.  I am not one of those.  There is one thing to which I want to draw attention.  I would be inclined to support most people where an effort is made to take over fisheries. These fisheries were stolen from us in days gone by.  Foreigners made fortunes out of them and left our own people in a state akin to slavery along the banks of those fisheries.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I understood Dáil Éireann was discussing the motion proposed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach which you ruled was on the Order Paper this morning standing in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  That ruling was questioned but you ruled it to be in order and to have been on the Order Paper in his name.  I do not understand how under Standing Order No. 53 you propose to accept a closure motion because there is no question before this House now proposed from the Chair. It seems clear that acceptance of a <Col N="3291" /> closure motion in relation to a motion proposed by a Member of this House other than the Chair is contrary to Standing Order No. 53.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I indicate to you that could not be so because under Standing Order 41 it is provided that if a Member does not move the motion which stands in his name such motion lapses unless moved by some other Member.  The position then was that if the Parliamentary Secretary did not move his motion and no other Member moved it on his behalf it would have lapsed so that the question before the House arose from a motion by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Andrews.  There is no question proposed by the Chair and, accordingly, I question how Standing Order No.53 can be operated to permit a closure.  It is in my view quite inappropriate and I raise it in the best interests of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>This particular amendment, if accepted, would add some touch of justice to this Bill.  In dealing with this amendment I shall have to deal with section 4 (1) as a whole because it would be impossible to discuss the amendment <i>in vacuo.</i> This amendment is very important to the whole section.  The words of the subsection are:</P>
      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 4 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>We can see the relevance of every word of this except the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;. The Minister for Transport and Power referred the last day to the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; and pointed out that this word had been used in a previous Act.  Deputy Thomas Fitzpatrick pointed out too that the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; was used in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  I do not know whether this has been mentioned but the word also appeared in the Treason Act, 1939.  I hope, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will bear with me while I am on this point because to discuss this amendment I submit one must also discuss the subsection and the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is qualifying the whole section.  In regard to the Offences Against the State Act I shall point out briefly the cases where the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is used.  The word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is used, first of all, in the case of a person encouraging or engaging in treason.  In subsection (b) of section 18 of that Act the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; is used in regard to any act of violence which will lead to the alteration of the Constitution of this State.  In subsection (c) the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; refers to raising or maintaining a military or armed force in contravention of the Constitution.  The fourth one is in relation to encouraging criminal offences or obstruction or interference with the administration of justice.  The other two are in regard to criminal or unlawful activities and payment of funds.  These are emergency powers which were brought in at a time of great emergency.</P>

      <P>The Treason Act, 1939, was also entirely different from the Bill before the House.  The Minister for Transport and Power stated that the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; had been used before.  I should like to tell the House where the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; has been used before.  It was in an Act of Victoria&mdash;the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  The word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; was used in that Act in regard to anybody conspiring or soliciting to commit murder.  I shall read the section:</P>
      <P>All persons who shall conspire, confederate, and agree to murder any Person, whether he be a Subject of Her Majesty or not, and whether he be within the Queen's Dominions or not, and whosoever shall solicit, encourage, persuade, or endeavour to persuade, or shall propose to any Person, to murder any other Person, whether he be a Subject of Her Majesty or not, or whether he be within the Queen's Dominions or not, shall be guilty of a Misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the Discretion of the Court, to be kept in Penal Servitude for any Term not more than Ten and not less than Three years or to be imprisoned for any Term not exceeding Two years, with or without Hard Labour.</P>
      <P>With all the Acts of Parliament that are on the Statute Book the only Act the Minister could find was this Act of Queen Victoria brought in in 1861. There are thousands of Acts and this is the one he had to refer to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that if this amendment is not accepted this section will prevent newspapers from making reasonable comment on matters of public current interest.  How can a newspaper report on events whether relating to the demolition of a building, to persons in possession of a dwelling house, to some natural view or to a very big farm without being considered to be &ldquo;encouraging and advocating&rdquo; the commission of an offence under sections 2 or 3 of this Bill?  If this amendment is not accepted it will be impossible for newspapers to comment on matters of public interest.  Fine Gael have always maintained the right to private property but we realise if this amendment is not accepted any newspaper editor who publishes a report about squatting could be considered as encouraging and advocating the commission of an offence.  This amendment is fair and reasonable and if it is accepted it will ensure that editors and reporters will be able to make reasonable comment.  It would be dangerous to allow a situation to exist where they would be deprived of this right.</P>
      <P>In the interpretation section of the Bill an effort was not made to define the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;.  Section 1 (4) states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall affect the law relating to acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute within the meaning of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.</P>
      <P>I submit it would have been quite easy to insert this amendment in this exceptions clause&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; should have been defined adequately and an effort should have been made, in defining the word &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;, to ensure free Press comment.  It is important that the public be informed of events throughout the country.  If we curtail the Press in the reporting of such events we are whittling away the rights of the individual, as the rights of Opposition Deputies have been whittled away today in this House.  The amendment is fair and would allow reasonable comment in newspapers, magazines and books.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister for Transport and Power stated that the section will not be brought in or used.  However, if a newspaper editor publishes a report on a matter relating to squatting or to the taking over of land he will be liable to prosecution.  We must ask ourselves whether newspaper editors or reporters should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to print such items.  It appears the Government have no faith in the editors of the national or provincial newspapers to decide what they should or should not print.  It will be a mistake to interfere with the basic right of editors to decide what to publish in newspapers.  When we whittle away this right, shortly afterwards a further list of offences will be introduced that will prevent newspaper editors from printing reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Once a precedent is set it is easy to follow such a precedent. It can be stated in future that the amendment was not accepted in this instance and the same procedure can be followed in other Bills.  However, I <Col N="3311" /> shall not continue on that point.  The Minister has stated there is no likelihood of interference with the Press. However, once legislation is put on the Statute Book it may or may not be used, but it is hanging there.</P>
      <P>Some time ago there was the matter of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, in relation to a case in Cork. The three morning and evening newspapers printed reports of this case in the High Court.  I personally at the time felt that the newspaper editors were wrong in printing the subject matter of this particular case and I felt they were certainly in breach of normal journalistic standards, leaving it at that.  The State subsequently brought the three morning and evening newspapers to court and they were all convicted and fined.  The Act had been on the Statute Book since 1929; no case had been brought under it but it was nevertheless on the Statute Book. The case dragged on from 2nd December to 10th December, and in that time no approach was made by the State to the newspapers to inform them that they were wrong and they went ahead. I make this point to show that once an Act goes on the Statute Book, even though it is never used, it can still be brought into operation later.  I am quite certain that if the newspaper editors involved had been approached, they would not have gone ahead any further with that story, but they were convicted and fined.  This is one particular area in which newspapers are liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They also come under the laws of libel and, if they print certain articles, can be attached for contempt, as in the case of the article in <i>Hibernia</i> and Mr. MacAonghusa, who was the author. They are specific limits and specific curtailments of the freedom of newspapers and I believe that each of these is necessary.  I believe that the Censorship of Publications Act is necessary and that in this particular instance, as an offence had been committed, it was right that a prosecution should have been brought.  Newspapers come under the laws of libel and are wide open to libel actions.  I believe that there is a minimum of one to two libel actions <Col N="3312" /> every year against newspapers.  Again, this is a necessary and desirable curtailment of Press reporting and comment. In the case of the action against <i>Hibernia,</i> the matter is pending in the courts and I do not intend to comment any further than to say that these cases can be brought against newspapers.  The Minister may feel that I am providing him with ammunition and reasons as to why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that the Press is already limited in its freedom by many laws and regulations and is well governed, and that already there are sufficient guarantees and safeguards, both for the State and the general public, in regard to Press comment.  I have pointed out the different ways in which newspapers can become liable for what they print and I believe that the curtailments on them are sufficient.  Any further curtailment of these rights would be a danger to everybody in the country because, as I stated earlier, a well-informed public opinion is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen a tendency on the part of Government Minister to be very sensitive in their attitude towards the Press.  At different times, many Government Ministers, and in fact many men who were not Ministers but who later reached the position of Ministers, have been very sensitive to newspaper comment.  Everybody in politics realises that no matter what article is published about one and no matter what speech is reported, one is never 100 per cent satisfied with it.  Going back a number of years, I believe the attitude of the then Minister for Agriculture in regard to the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> was completely unreasonable. At that time the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> was commenting reasonably on farming affairs.  I believe that what they were stating was correct and in order, but a Minister deemed that it was not reasonable comment on a matter of public interest, and in view of this, he decided, in his desire to hit at this journal, that the only way he could affect the newspaper was by withdrawing <Col N="3313" /> advertisements from it.  Advertising is an important factor in the running of a newspaper.  The Minister at that time decided he did not like what the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> were saying about him and his Department so he withdrew the Department of Agriculture advertisements from the newspaper. In fact, if he could have managed it, he would have closed down the <i>Farmers' Journal.</i> He not alone stopped advertisements to the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> but he endeavoured to start a newspaper of his own.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we are <Col N="3314" /> dealing with amendment No. 9, which deals with reasonable comment in regard to section 4 of the Forcible Entry Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> were commenting reasonably at the time in what they were saying.  The Minister, in what he did, curtailed in some way what they were saying.  It was an effort made by the then Minister for Agriculture to curtail the comments made by the <i>Farmers' Journal.</i> I believe what they had to say was relevant and reasonable. Some time ago a motion was brought in by a Fianna Fáil TD, who is now a Minister, to ban reporters from Galway County Council.  This matter was raised at a meeting of the West of Ireland branch of the National Union of Journalists.  This was reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 30th November, 1968.  The proposal was from the present Minister for Local Government, who was then Mayor of Galway.  It took the form of an ultimatum that the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> either apologised for a referendum report, which he claimed was inaccurate, or be banned from all meetings of Galway County Council from December, 1968.  The <i>Connacht Tribune</i> had commented on a meeting of Galway County Council.  I do not know what took place at the meeting but the members of the Press, who were there commented reasonably on the meeting.  The Mayor of Galway apparently was not satisfied with what they stated and he wanted to prevent them from attending future meetings of Galway County Council if they did not apologise for their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government had any hand in the framing of the particular Bill before the House, but it shows that Ministers and Deputies from the Government side of the House are very sensitive to Press reporting.  In view of the attitude of the Minister for Agriculture to the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> some years ago and in view of the attitude of the then Mayor of Galway to the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> we see the Government approach to the Press.  If newspaper reporters in a county are prevented from attending <Col N="3315" /> county council meetings and are not able to report on them this would have a very serious effect on the circulation of their newspaper.  A Fianna Fáil member at the Galway County Council meeting stated that they expected a fair deal from a newspaper which got an £18,000 grant.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House want a fair coverage from newspapers but I believe it is very hard to satisfy people in politics in regard to newspaper reporting.  So long as a newspaper are making a fair effort with regard to reasonable comment in what they are reporting I do not believe there should be any curtailment put on them. In the debate on the Department of Local Government Estimate Deputy de Valera made a very important contribution in regard to legislation which was brought before the House. He felt it is bad to have laws on the Statute Book which are not in fact enforced.  He stated that by bringing such statutes before the House and later on not enforcing them it brought the law into contempt.</P>

      <P>I will look after myself. After the next election the Deputy will not be here to worry about me.  I will be here but he will not.  If Fianna Fáil and, by Fianna Fáil, I mean the disjointed group that now represent the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, want to force this Bill through, and a section in this Bill which the country at large does not want, and prevent a debate on an amendment introduced for the purpose of maintaining the freedom of the Press, presumably they will succeed because of their numbers.  Over the past few years these gentlemen have done everything that should not be done by any Government; they have created a situation where, all over the world, if anyone mentions Ireland, people think of what has happened, with the Government turning a blind eye.  Because the Press criticised them and did what Fianna Fáil now want to prevent in this Bill, they decided they would put a stop to that and so they introduced this section in the Forcible Entry Bill.</P>
      <P>One of the remarkable things about this debate is that we have here an attempt&mdash;I am not blaming you, Sir, because you are just carrying on the arrangement and, as one who had the honour to occupy the Chair on occasion, I know what the score is&mdash; to prevent adequate discussion.  Certain set limits have been laid down and these are set in such a way that an attempt is being made to try to conduct a debate in support of an amendment to a certain section without referring to the section or to any other part of the Bill affected by that section. It is impossible to debate properly in those circumstances and that is why so many on this side of the House have appeared from time to time to be out of order.  We have on the Government benches tonight people who are prepared to offer, from their seats, comments on the Bill.  A chosen few were allowed to stand up and say certain things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What has the closure on is the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party were afraid they would not get this Bill through before the end of the session.  They know we will have a general election before we come back and they know perfectly well we will not put anything like this on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>It is right at this point that I should place on the record for the benefit of those Deputies who do not seem to know what it is about, as was proved abundantly by speakers on the Government benches, the purpose of the amendment.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 35, after &ldquo;offence&rdquo; where it secondly appears to add &ldquo;provided always and it is hereby declared that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or book shall not constitute an offence under this subsection&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do the Government think, if some action takes place, some action which is unfair and which is seen to be unfair, and anybody who sees it or knows about it considers it unfair, that it is right that they should have power to penalise by way of fine and imprisonment any newspaper, book or periodical which says that the action <Col N="3322" /> was unfair?  Is that the Government's intention?  Maybe those who drafted the Bill did not give this the thought it should have got but do they not now realise that this would not be accepted in any western European country?  We are talking about going into the EEC. This is the sort of legislation which will have to be changed if we ever do go into the EEC because no civilised country will give the right to the Government, and not alone to the Government but to any member of a police force, to arrest and imprison people for publishing what they consider to be fair comment.  It is as simple as that. Mark you, there are some in the Fianna Fáil Party with memories long enough in politics to carry them back to the early days when it was difficult to get a press for what they thought was right.  Now we have these same people trying to put it across to the country that what they are putting into this Bill, a Bill they hope to have passed into law in a very short time, is the right to allow them to penalise fair comment on any matter with which they disagree.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary who is a very able debater and who, despite our political differences, I would claim is a friend of mine will I am sure, before the night is out, be making his comment on this matter.  I ask him to try to explain to the House for my benefit and the benefit of the other Members if he thinks it is right that this restriction should be put on the Press.  Suppose, for instance, my neighbour has been living in a house all his life and his father before him lived there all his life, if, under the previous section of the Bill the owner of the house is not content with the rent or for any other reason decides to get rid of that tenant and goes to the Garda and gets them to go to the house and arrest the tenant and get him sent to jail, does the Parliamentary Secretary consider it is unfair that the Press should be prevented from commenting on that matter?  Does he consider that the person who makes a fair comment on matters of this kind should be declared to be in breach of the law?</P>
    <P>Somebody asked what was the rush <Col N="3323" /> with this Bill.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain the rush. Why was it that a Bill introduced in July, 1970, and revitalised in January or February this year should suddenly become terribly urgent towards the end of July and why must we get the Bill through without the amendments suggested here before the House goes into Recess?  I should like to know what circumstances have created the situation in which this must be done.  If the Government consider the situation is so bad that comment of this kind is likely to do some harm, would the Parliamentary Secretary explain what he thinks the harm is?  What harm does he think can be done by for instance the editorial which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> last Monday?  What harm does he think can be done by editorials that have appeared in the past couple of weeks in various newspapers? What harm does he think was done by editorials and informed comment which appeared when the trouble took place in regard to Hume Street and other places in this city last year and the year before?  This is the sort of thing which apparently this section is intended to prevent.  These things must not happen again if the section is passed as it is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Parliamentary Secretary has expressed the opinion that the Press is not mentioned in the Bill at all and that there is no necessity for the amendments because there is no reference to the Press, radio or television. The Parliamentary Secretary is not so innocent as to imagine that if one reads the Bill, including section 4, one cannot read into it what can be done.  A writer in one newspaper did say that perhaps it would be better to leave it to the courts to decide.  I believe legislation leaving this House should be watertight so as to stand up to the interpretation put upon it by the legislators.  I do not believe we should have a situation in which, when an Act is passed through this House, somebody who dislikes it should spend their own, somebody else's or the State's money having the validity of that Act tested in the courts.  That should not be necessary.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is not being fair in suggesting that I am saying that right should be taken away.  I do not believe it should but I do not think it should be necessary. If the Fianna Fáil Party think it is a good idea to pass a Bill through this House and then have it tested in the courts, they have a very wrong idea of the purpose of this House.  The Minister for Justice in his rare visits to the House commented on what he thought the Opposition wanted in this Bill.  Either he was not being quite fair with the House or did not understand what the sections of the Bill he was putting through the House meant.  If anybody in Fianna Fáil considers they are entitled to put through this House a Bill which will result in, not civil action which can be taken at present, but in criminal action being taken against a newspaper or periodical for making what they consider to be fair comment, they have another &ldquo;think&rdquo; coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody knows when the next general election will take place: my personal opinion is that it will come very quickly.  I think a date in September will probably see it.  I shall be very interested to hear Fianna Fáil candidates at the general election trying to defend this Bill, particularly sections 2, 3 and 4.  While section 4 is the one we are trying to amend our reason for doing so is that it relates directly to sections 2 and 3.  Not only the Parliamentary Secretary but quite a number of other&mdash;shall I say&mdash;eminent legal people have been putting across the view that the Bill is innocuous, that there is really nothing in it and that they cannot see what all the fuss is about.  If that is so why are the Government trying to get it through the House so quickly in this session?  Why are <Col N="3325" /> they attempting to put on the Statute Book a law which they claim&mdash;outside the House; they will not say it here&mdash; does not matter very much; it really is not altering existing law very much; it is just a little thing they want put in.</P>
    <P>I deal with as many members of the general public as anybody else and I meet people from time to time who are tenants and have been given notice to quit.  In most cases these people cannot find a house the next day.  Usually, they look for time if they are giving up possession.  If they are a long time in the house and are paying a fair rent they feel they should not have to give up possession.  At present the law deals with the matter fairly well.  The owner can go to a solicitor and have a civil bill issued.  Eventually, the case comes to court and the judge will decide whether or not the person is entitled to retain possession.  Usually, on humanitarian considerations the judge will decide that it takes time to get rehoused and therefore he allows time. Usually, the legal people will deal with this matter very well.  But I now say to the Parliamentary Secretary directly, because I am aware that he does not agree with this and I want to hear his argument against it, that if this Bill passes through the House there will be no onus on the owner to go to a solicitor.  He need only go to the nearest Garda barracks and say: &ldquo;That man is in illegal possession of my property.&rdquo; If the man in possession of the property locks the door it will be considered an additional offence.</P>

      <P>I have read the Bill backwards and forwards, and I shall be very glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's comments in his reply.  If the person locks the door the guard then does not have to get a warrant.  He can forcibly take possession of that house. He can arrest the tenant, bring him to court and have him fined £50, three months in jail, £100, six months in jail, £500, three years in jail; and if the local newspaper reports it they are then breaking the law in the same way. <Col N="3326" /> This is what we are trying to prevent. It is as simple as that.</P>

      <P>This is the joke about the whole thing.  As far as the Fianna Fáil people who are prepared to discuss this Bill at all outside are concerned, all of them apparently have accepted a line which has been handed down from the hierarchy of the party to the effect that this is not so.  If it is not so, may be we could hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to whom I shall give way in a few minutes, as to what exactly is meant by the section of the Bill which deals with (2) and (3). Do not forget (2) and (3) deal with lands and also deal with a vehicle.  I am dealing specifically with the house because this is where the most difficulty will be created.</P>
      <P>I honestly believe that the Fianna Fáil front bench have sold a pup to their back benchers.  They have succeeded in getting not alone the people who normally support them but even those who have sworn outside they would not support them to walk through the lobby here with them on the various amendments.  When the final vote is taken on this Bill I shall be very interested to see who walks through that lobby tonight.  I would advise the Parliamentary Secretary, who is the party whip, to count his votes before they go through there, because he might be in for a rude shock.  No matter what anybody says, this section which we are attempting to amend very definitely proposes to have the effect which I have just described.  It is all right to say: &ldquo;That is a misinterpretation of the Bill.  That is not what it is intended to do at all.&rdquo; What is it intended to do?  If it is not intended to do that, is the Parliamentary Secretary going to tell me that it deals only with a fellow who breaks into an unoccupied house and takes possession of it?  It does not say that in the section.  It says nothing whatever about the property being occupied or unoccupied.  It simply refers to the house or lands or vehicle being the property of somebody else. He is not the owner of that house.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary reading it, because I have heard of his interpretation of it.  It is very satisfactory when one is talking to the faithful to be able to trot out a nice little story which they are prepared to swallow; they may have some doubts, and they are not quite sure whether they will accept the word of the great white chief.  That is what has happened in this case, and that is why I am deliberately challenging the Parliamentary Secretary and giving him an opportunity of explaining here what exactly is meant if my interpretation is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said here the other day that the reason why the Government take such a dim view of their activities, and why they are deciding to clamp down on them is the unfavourable Press they have been getting.  It has not dawned on them yet that the unfavourable Press they have been getting is due to their being a bad Government.  They have got an unfavourable Press because what they are doing is not only unpopular but also bad for the country. When you find responsible newspaper reporters, responsible newspaper editors and, indeed, editors of some periodicals who cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as supporters of the Opposition in this House, making comment that the Bill is a bad one, then it is very easy to understand why the Government would like to be in a position to clamp down on these people and tell them: &ldquo;This you can print and that you cannot print.&rdquo; The Parliamentary Secretary, I am quite sure, will say this is not written down in black and white in the Bill.  However, on Sunday in the church we are asked to look for forgiveness for the sins which we commit, including the sins of omission, and simply by omitting certain words from this Bill which allow an interpretation such as I have given shows that it can be and will be used in that manner if the <Col N="3328" /> Government get their way.  I want to repeat before I sit down what Deputy Corish said on another section of this Bill.  It may be long or it may be short until the Labour Party have anything to do with a Government of this country, but if they ever do that section of that Bill will come out.</P>

      <P>I have not noticed the Deputy while I have been sitting here, but I would hope the contribution I make would be relevant.  I shall endeavour to confine myself strictly to the amendment, but I fear that in answering Deputy Tully, as he has asked me to do, I may be straying from the amendment.  I suppose, therefore, I become irrelevant in answering what Deputy Tully has raised in connection with the purpose of this section and how it is that this tenant of his would, according to him, be guilty of an offence under this and would, according to me and according to the Bill, not be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully rightly said that the Bill makes no distinction between occupied and unoccupied land.  That is quite properly so.  It would have been ludicrous if it did make any such distinction.  Deputy Tully either forgot to mention or omitted on <Col N="3329" /> purpose to mention that the function and purpose of this Bill is to prevent forcible entry.  The notional case that Deputy Tully referred to on a number of occasions was that of an existing tenant who for one reason or another refused to leave the tenancy.  He then suggested that the existing tenant, who, I would presume, had not initially forcibly entered, had no right available to him under the law except to go for a policeman to ensure that that right could be protected.</P>

If that is the kind of notion that is being conveyed, and if the public really believe that kind of thing, no wonder some of the public are afraid of the Bill and the Press afraid of what may be the consequences of it.</P>

    <P>provided always and it is hereby declared that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or <Col N="3330" /> book shall not constitute an offence under this subsection.</P>
    <P>That particular amendment creates a number of impressions.  It creates unjustifiable fears in the public mind. Any lawyer or reasonable member of the public or Press must be aware of that.  By implication to request the Minister to include that amendment to guarantee the innocence of comment, whether in the Press or otherwise, seems to state that the law or the Act without it would, in fact, make it an offence to make reasonable comment on a matter of public interest, if it relates to this particular Act.</P>

If any member of the Opposition wants to have it some <Col N="3334" /> other way he had better say so now. If a member of the Opposition wants to say that a journalist writing in the Press or a person like myself writing a letter to the Press should be given more protection because we write in the Press rather than speak on a public platform, he should clearly state it, so that we can tell the public what we have been fighting for for the last few weeks.</P>

The further one specifies the more one must be taken to express the precise nature of the legislative intention and one is excluding unreasonable comment.  I and all Deputies concerned with freedom of expression will not make it an offence to make unreasonable comment on matters which may or may not be themselves an offence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Deputy wishes me to jump from No. 7 to No. 10.  If he so wishes, he can make my speech for me.  Deputy O'Higgins expressed surprise that I referred to the defence of fair comment in the laws of libel.  From the extent of the Deputy's experience, which happens to be much greater than mine, I think he will accept that one of the elements of the defence of fair comment is either that the content of fair comment was a matter of fact or, in so far as it was comment, that it was fair comment.  What cuts across such defence, even in the civil law, is the proof that the words were used maliciously.  In the civil law that defence is open.  A defence that is open in the civil law where it is necessary merely to establish the offence on the balance of probability must certainly be open to any person charged under the criminal law&mdash;that and much more &mdash;and every lawyer knows that it is not only on the balance of probability, that <Col N="3339" /> a prosecution must prove as to which party is right.  The prosecutor must prove his case beyond reasonable doubt and, thereby, even by implication or by any test known to the law, there is no need whatsoever for this particular amendment except, as I have said, a suggestion and the implication which the Opposition are endeavouring to project to the Press and, through them, to the public, that this Bill is all about curtailing the freedom of the Press and that the only people who are prepared to defend them are the Opposition Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>And every newspaper in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, behind the banners of the all-knowing Deputy Desmond who has stood for the defence of civil liberties since coming here. They must consider themselves very protected in their knowledge that somebody who understands the elements of the freedoms of expression, assembly and otherwise as deeply as Deputy Desmond understands them is behind them and that so long as this is the case they will not be devoured by the black wolves of repression of Fianna Fáil.  They must be protected by the sacrificial devotion of Deputy Desmond.  I would hope that if I could do no more even at this late stage than get rid of some of the sham that has been circulating around this House for the past three or four weeks under the guise of concern for the freedom of expression, I might have done a good days work for, first of all, our business here in the House, and, secondly, for the courageous expression of the views that each of us holds without in any way currying the favour of the Press or, through them, of any section of the public.  For that reason I would like to say that if the Press have a special place in our society&mdash;more learned people than I have made this observation&mdash;they represent as much the public right to hear as the citizens right to express.  Of course it is very important that the Press and radio, more than the ordinary individual, represent the public's right to read and to hear, in that they themselves promote what <Col N="3340" /> appears in the Press or what is heard on radio or television.  I will yield to Deputy O'Higgins in that there is no principal of law in any civilised legal system of which I am aware that says that what is an offence for an ordinary member of the public by way, even, of encouraging or advocating, cannot be or should not be an offence for any person writing for the Press.  If that is the kind of law that we are trying to establish we are very confused.  Surely that is precisely what the amendments are intended to do because nowhere in this Bill are the Press, radio or television mentioned.  I wish the public were aware of that.</P>

      <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>

      <P>It does not exclude the Press any more than any individual citizen is excluded.  I speak as one who has no repressive or phoney attitude towards the Press, but I see no reason why the Press should be treated differently with regard to the commission of an offence by encouraging or advocating such commission than would any person who, either at his own fireside or on a public platform, advocated the commission of such an offence.  If we are to tell the Press that they are being exempted from our criminal law then we had better say that honestly because that is what all these amendments are about and it is why all this confusion has been created.  I had better say honestly it is why it has been created too by some sections of the Press as well as by some members of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>One second, Deputy FitzGerald.  I am entitled to offer my view in small proportion to the number of times you have offered your view in the House.  He suggested that a newspaper reporting this fact: &ldquo;can certainly be considered to be encouraging and advocating an offence.&rdquo; He is a Deputy of the Fine Gael Party. He is a lawyer.  Other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party have said the same kind of thing.  I have read many of them.  They speak at various functions in Monaghan, Dún Laoghaire or wherever else.  They have been saying it for the past three months.  Some I remember.  Deputy Luke Belton said it. I think Deputy Cosgrave said it.  I think almost every Deputy on the Fine Gael side has said it.  Then, because I take up Deputy Enright, because I happened to be here when he said it today, I am apparently misquoting him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who has sat through this debate in the Public Gallery and heard the other contributions will wonder why the Deputy suggests to me that I should read the amendment to prove that I am relevant, having listened to what has come from the Opposition.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>provided always and it is hereby declared that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or book shall not constitute an offence under this subsection.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured to stay on that amendment.  If I have made some points which might not be directly related to the verbatim content of the amendment they have all, I presume, a Cheann Comhairle, since you have allowed me to continue, been relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would then in conclusion&mdash;here I am sure there will be sighs of relief&mdash; like to spell out briefly what the position of freedom of expression is in this country and in every other country. Freedom of expression is guaranteed to every individual, subject to public order and morality.  In other words, he is not entitled to freedom of expression to incite, advocate or encourage crime.  That being so, every citizen and every organ which citizens use, whether it is radio, television, the Press or otherwise, enjoy that right and that freedom and are subject in that enjoyment to the same conditions.  If the Opposition are now suggesting that that freedom applies more effectively when you write something in the public Press or say it on radio or television, they are breaching a fundamental principle of freedom of expression and they must know it because there is no reason why it should be any more sacrosanct or exempt or privileged <Col N="3346" /> than what is said by anyone else.  If they are endeavouring to show, by putting down an amendment which asks to state as an addition to the existing law, safeguards which are already contained in the existing law, if they are endeavouring to show that the Bill without their amendment would not have that guarantee, probably they have succeeded.  However, in a year or two years time when the Press and the public look at the situation objectively they can say that the bogeymen behind the dark battalions of repressive Fianna Fáil Ministers were unreal. Then they will realise the suggestion in the newspapers that Hitlerism or any other &ldquo;ism&rdquo; is hiding under the guise of this Bill is unreasonable and unfair comment.  The fact that such comment appears, and will continue to appear, is proof that the law does not need the protection of this amendment to guarantee reasonable, or unreasonable, comment.  For that reason, I hope all reasonable people in this House will come to their senses as they have been suggesting for the last few months that the Minister and Fianna Fáil should do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a pleasure for Deputies who have been in this House for the past week to witness the intervention of the Parliamentary Secretary and to listen to his arguments. Initially I thought he was in favour of the amendment but as he spoke it transpired I was in error and, in fact, the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking against the amendment.  Before the Chair accepts a motion from the Parliamentary Secretary that the question be now put, in which event I shall be deprived of speaking further&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, my speech was much shorter than speeches of the Members of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely talking about what is about to happen.  I am a Member of the Opposition at the moment; the Parliamentary Secretary is a member of the Government at the moment.  I fear I am about to be shot down by a new Parliamentary device which ensures that when an Opposition Member is speaking someone on <Col N="3347" /> the Government benches says something which is inaudible to everyone except the Chair.  The Chair says that is the end and what might possibly have been a matter of reasonable comment is lost forever.</P>
      <P>Therefore, before this happens may I say it was a pleasure to hear the Parliamentary Secretary speak on amendment No. 9 but what a pity he did not speak on amendment No. 8. Amendment No. 8 was proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick; it was discussed logically, cogently and effectively. Deputy Fitzpatrick was followed by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien who spoke at great length but was always relevant&mdash; as the Chair will vouch for&mdash;on what was meant by the words &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourages&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Among the absentees on the Government benches I noticed the Parliamentary Secretary.  Perhaps he had an engagement to open a sports field on that day or perhaps he was running a race himself but at any rate he was not present in the House.  This is a pity because he might have learned what &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; can mean.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien spoke for four hours 20 minutes but while he was in the middle of one sentence the Minister intervened and said that the question should now be put.  Obviously the Minister was able to get time off to visit the Dáil; he came in full of bustling activity and obviously wished to record one of his rare visits to the House.  In that sense one welcomes on amendment No. 9 what I assume is the definitive Government view on how free are the Press.</P>

      <Col N="3348" /> Those of us who have been Members of this House for any length of time can scarcely recall such a situation of musical chairs as we have had in this debate.  There were different gladiators sent in.  The Minister for Transport and Power came in last week to say there was &ldquo;no problem&mdash;no problem at all&rdquo;. The Press were entirely free and he could not understand what people were talking about.  We had various other people intervening, including the Parliamentary Secretary who is now present.  He assured us last week that they were going to sit until Christmas, there would be no guillotine or closure or anything of the kind.</P>

      <P>Nobody knows nowadays what is happening in Fianna Fáil.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has been sent for by someone because something happened in the last hour or so.  One does not know.  What I want to get at is the intervention of the Parliamentary Secretary and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary now present will report carefully what I am going to say.  The Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I am so confused with what the Parliamentary Secretaries are Parliamentary Secretaries for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education came in here waving his little red book. I do not know what thoughts it contained but he is brought in here apparently to silence discussion.  Once the Parliamentary Secretary raises his little red book, we are all supposed to be told &ldquo;Now, will you keep quiet&rdquo;, and what did the little red book tell him? Apparently there is a defence to an action for defamation, called fair comment. This is available, according to the little red book, to an individual or to a newspaper.  It is subject to certain restrictions&mdash;it must be fair, it must be a comment on fact and, if I gather his reading of the little red book correctly, it must be made without malice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised&mdash;but I know how tolerant the Chair is and how the Chair encourages full debate and discussion&mdash;that <Col N="3349" /> the Chair did not intervene and ask the question which I would like to have asked, but I would have been disorderly to ask it, as to what this had to do with the case, with what we are discussing, because we are discussing a Bill which is a Bill creating a criminal offence.  We are changing fundamentally the criminal law of this land.  We are not discussing the might-have-beens or the things that could happen&mdash;actions for defamation; we are not discussing Artemus Jones; we are not discussing any of the civil proceedings that have arisen, will arise and, I hope sincerely, will continue to arise in the future.  We are discussing a fundamental change in the criminal law of this land.</P>
    <P>Of course as the law now stands, any newspaper, any person, any citizen, who writes a comment on a matter of public interest which is fair, which is based on fact and which is uttered without malice is not amenable in damages, but there is here quite a marked distinction.  In section 4&mdash;and would all Parliamentary Secretaries please understand this? &mdash;there is a subsection (1) which says that a person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under sections 2 or 3 shall be guilty of an offence.  That has nothing to do with defamation, nothing to do with comment, fair or unfair; it is a proposal to change our criminal law and for the first time ever to establish as the law of our land a situation in which a newspaper commenting on an occurrence of the day or the week, commenting on a social need or a social problem, commenting on whatever it may be that is arousing public interest and public concern, and following that comment, there is set in motion a chain of events which lead to the commission by people of offences under sections 2 or 3, the writer of that newspaper comment could be charged with encouraging, if not advocating, that offence.</P>
    <P>That is what we believe to be the meaning of subsection (1) of section 4. I do not think it is a belief that is unreasonably held.  I think it is certainly latent, implicit, in subsection (1) that that construction could be placed on it &mdash;nothing to do with fair or unfair <Col N="3350" /> comment or anything else, nothing to do with the law on defamation.  It is, in our view, the creation of a new criminal offence which may make amenable those who write or are concerned with comment in our Press in relation to public happenings.</P>
    <P>What is this amendment about?  We say that that is what we believe is the effect of subsection (1).  A succession of Government front-benchers have come in and said &ldquo;Cod, rubbish&rdquo;, culminating with the Parliamentary Secretary and his little red book.  All right&mdash;if that be the position, what is wrong with the Government accepting, what is in their way to accepting, this amendment which cannot change the effect of the section?  If the section is pointed in some particular direction, it is not going to affect the direction in which the section will operate.  If there is no threat to the Press in section 4, why could we not expressly say so?  The real trouble is that the Government will not agree, will not agree to the express exclusion of the Press, and therefore we say why.  Because fundamentally they think the Press are going to be curbed.  That is precisely the problem we have at this juncture in this debate.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary who had to leave talked about &ldquo;Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean lei&rdquo; and said that what was sent around the circle by a speeding tongue did not add up to proof or conviction one way or another.  That is perfectly true.  The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that it is a fundamental rule in the courts that what the soldier said to the girl is not evidence.  It is also true that what Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers say in relation to the meaning of a section passed here has nothing to do with the eventual construction of that section by a judge or court of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Good intentions pave the way to very bad legislation and we have discovered that to our cost many times. We have had ministerial assurances&mdash;&ldquo;Allow this section to be put into this Bill; the House can be assured that it will not have such and such an effect <Col N="3351" /> and it will not operate in a particular direction&rdquo;.  That is all cod and does not achieve anything.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully was perfectly right.  We have a responsibility here to ensure that it is within our competence to legislate and that the legislation carries in the words used the meaning we all attribute to it.  It would be slovenly, utterly wrong and running away from our obligations to say: &ldquo;Let us pass this&rdquo;. The Parliamentary Secretary says that the courts are there to construe it. They are there to see if it is constitutional or wrong in some respect.  They are there to put it right.  I certainly do not subscribe to that view.  We are a legislative assembly under a rigid Constitution but we have a responsibility to the people of Ireland so to consider and test our legislation here to see to the best of our ability that the legislation carries the intentions we have in mind.  We should not any longer pass sections of Bills or enact legislation on Ministerial undertakings that it will not have an inimical effect.</P>
    <P>We believe subsection (1), which contains the elements of a restriction on the right of free comment and free expression of opinion, is something which we should resist.  It is not novel for Deputies on these benches to speak as I am speaking now.  There have been many points of view of Deputies on your right hand side, Sir, expressed on matters of public concern through the years.  This is the very lifeblood of democracy and will always be cherished by, in particular, parties in opposition.  There is a great temptation on those too long in Government to cloud and confuse the exercise of the freedom of expression of opinion with the tedious repetition of embarrassing views.  That is why we oppose subsection (1) and that is why this amendment seeks to have it clarified that in our legislation we will expressly say that the freedom of expression of opinion by the Press shall not be excluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the proposer of this amendment it now falls to me to conclude the debate <Col N="3352" /> on it.  This amendment sought to add certain words to subsection (1) of section 4 which, as Deputy O'Higgins has told us, proposes to enact that a person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under sections 2 or 3 of this Bill shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Section 2 creates the offence of forcible entry and section 3 creates the offence of forcible occupation.  Both these offences are new offences being written into our criminal law for the first time, but the important thing about it for the purposes of this amendment is to get it clearly into our minds that they are offences which are centred around protest such as protest about social evils and protest about social reform.  They are offences which are centred around protests advocating social reforms, better housing, the preservation of Georgian buildings and the right of the Irish people to fish in Irish waters.  These are matters about which it is the duty of every newspaper to take an active interest and about which it is the duty of every newspaper editor to mould and form public opinion.</P>
      <P>The point about this is that a newspaper in the discharge of its duty in leading public opinion may find itself guilty of an offence of encouraging an illegal squat or an illegal sit-in under sections 2 and 3 of this Bill when that was never the intention of the newspaper. We have only had forcible entry and forcible occupation in this country for a few years and indeed we have not had them at all since this Bill was introduced on 1st July, 1970.  It is difficult, therefore, to see the urgency about this Bill.  Newspapers have been conducting campaigns in this country for years trying to get the Government of the day to live up to their responsibility and house the people of this country in houses fit for human beings.  They have been carrying on campaigns trying to get the Government to preserve the architectural beauty of this city without much avail.  Are these newspapers not to be allowed to continue with these campaigns just because people decide to commit the offence of illegal entry or illegal occupation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of this Bill are <Col N="3353" /> creating new offences and it will be an offence for an editor during a protest about the demolition of houses in Hume Street or some other part of this city to write a leading article on one of those matters.  If a number of people take forcible occupation of any buildings in parts of this city, say some Georgian buildings, and during that occupation one of the newspapers of this city decides to write a leading article and say: &ldquo;It is an absolute disgrace that these Georgian buildings should be pulled down; they are part of our heritage.  We had the buildings in Fitzwilliam Street pulled down to make way for an ESB monstrosity and we told the Government of the day about that.&rdquo; Surely the editor who writes that editorial will be encouraging the people in possession to continue squatting and for that reason the editor and the newspaper will be guilty of an offence.  For that reason they will be guilty of an offence.  I have said that time and again and I am convinced it is true.  I am convinced that will be the law when this Bill becomes an Act and I am not the only one who thinks it.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to repeat that responsible newspaper proprietors and editors share my view.  As I have told the Minister for Justice, they are not only newspapers which from time to time criticise the Government.  The <i>Irish Press</i> group agree with me and in an editorial on 27th July an appeal was made to the Government and the Minister for Justice to have common sense, to have second thoughts, to put this matter beyond doubt and to write the few extra words into the Bill that would ensure it would be lawful for newspaper editors to comment in a reasonable way on matters of public interest.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister what is the objection to that.  He gave us some woolly reasons the other day the effect of which was that if he did that he would have to write defences as well as offences into every Act.  This is an unusual Bill, proposing unusual changes in the law, creating a new type of offence centred around protests which give rise to the expression of public opinion in the newspapers, on television or radio, and that is the <Col N="3354" /> reason it is necessary to write safeguards into this extraordinary section. I know the Minister will not do it and I do not propose to take up the time of the House much further because there is another amendment on similar lines and we are facing the guillotine.</P>
    <P>The guillotine motion has been put down and passed since I moved this amendment.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that this is the amendment on which the Minister thought fit to get the Government to impose the guillotine.  It is an amendment which seeks to preserve the liberty of the Press.  On the Second Reading of this Bill I offered to adopt a reasonable attitude to it, to agree to the principles enshrined in sections 2 and 3, if the Minister on his part were prepared to rid the Bill of its highly objectionable sections, the most objectionable of all being section 4 which we are now seeking to amend but which we will not succeed in amending.</P>
    <P>I wish to avail of this contribution, afraid the guillotine might fall before I get an opportunity of speaking again, to say we are voting against the passing of this Bill because the Minister insists on retaining in it section 4, un-amended. We are voting in favour of every amendment that is down as an expression of our opinion that the Bill as it stands is a dangerous, mischievous piece of legislation which should not go on the Statute Book of this land because it is a weapon with which to curb the Press.</P>
    <P>We are told this will never happen. We have on the records of the House this evening that the Minister for Local Government when he was Mayor of Galway proposed to exclude the Press from meetings of Galway Corporation unless they saw fit to apologise for, as he said, misrepresenting a speech on a referendum.  That is the type of conduct the Press may expect if this Bill becomes law because that is the type of Minister we have in the Government.</P>
    <P>I learned of this episode only this evening, but we had the Minister for Justice cracking Deputy de Valera across the knuckles, rubbing his nose on the ground because he dared to criticise the administration of the Department of Justice.  I am not criticising Deputies O'Malley or Molloy <Col N="3355" /> personally, but they are the type of Minister we have in this Government. Obviously they do not like Press comment, they are sensitive to Press criticism, and that is the reason why I am perturbed about putting on the Statute Book a section like section 4 which puts into the hands of the Minister for Justice a repressive weapon with which to knock the Press.  That is the reason we put down amendment No. 9. Section 4 (1) at the moment reads:</P>
    <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>If the amendment were accepted the subsection would read:</P>
    <P>A person who encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under section 2 or 3 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence provided always and it is hereby declared that reasonable comment on a matter of public interest in any newspaper, magazine, periodical or book shall not constitute an offence under this subsection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3356" /> What is wrong with that as an amendment? It is doing no more than the Minister says he approves of, but it is at least putting it beyond doubt, in the words of the leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 27th July.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had done that in the early stages of this debate there would be no necessity for the guillotine.  It is our duty to expose dangerous, repressive sections of a Bill.  We have done that and I will conclude now so that members of the Labour Party who have tabled amendment No. 10, more or less on the same lines, will have an opportunity of explaining their amendment before the Minister, by his parliamentary device, tells this Parliament in the most insulting terms to shut up.  That is what he will do at 10.30 tonight: he will tell this Parliament: &ldquo;Shut up.  I do not want to hear you any longer.  I am going to take this Bill, its objectionable sections and all by the feet of my Deputies through the Division Lobby to pass it through this House.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 49 and 50, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The publication of reports and statements relating to such advocacy or encouragement and comment thereon by communications media shall not constitute an offence under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement on Second Reading sought suggestions and comments to improve this Bill.  I think he said that he did not put forward the Bill as the last word in perfection. He can certainly say that again. I should make it clear, because it has escaped the memory of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, that we opposed section 4 in its entirely on Committee Stage.  In this amendment we are making a last-ditch stand to improve section 4.  It is not open to us under Standing Orders to oppose the section in its entirely again, having done so already.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when speaking earlier, wanted to know why we wished to exclude the communications media but, like many other speakers, he took absolutely no interest in the Bill on the other Stages and it was only at a late stage of Report Stage that he showed interest.  I want to make it clear that we are totally opposed to section 4 and that the amendment is just a last-ditch stand to try to salvage some freedom for those responsible for reporting and commenting on various activities, namely those in the communications media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no justification that the Minister for Justice can put forward for opposing this amendment.  He may ask why we seek to have the communications media excluded from the provisions of section 4.  It is because they mostly are affected by section 4.  It is true that individuals and organisations, <Col N="3359" /> as we have pointed out on Committee Stage, are also very adversely affected by this section but if we can get the communications media excluded it will improve&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash; this section or, at least salvage something from it.  We shall deal with the complete section in due course when we have put the Government out of office. I strongly recommend the Minister to accept the amendment as a very reasonable one and one that has been called for by all sections of the community in recent weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the amendment in the name of Deputy Pattison and myself.  We should note that, in any event, the Minister's brief does contain the opening five words: &ldquo;I cannot accept this amendment.&rdquo; I am sure the Minister will readily confirm that to us and therefore it should go on record that the Minister proposes to reject the amendment proposed by the Labour Party.  Therefore, it is crystal clear that the formal reporting of the factual situation in relation to an incident affecting advocacy or encouragement, or the publication of reports or statements relating thereto in future, in the opinion of the Attorney General's office, can be construed as coming within the range of a new criminal offence.  That is the fundamental issue at stake right through the whole debate on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel ashamed as a Labour Party Deputy to have to plead with the Government to accept this amendment. I feel ashamed because John Taylor and Ian Paisley have real live ammunition to expect from the Minister in his rejection of this amendment because this is what they would expect from a united Ireland, if we were ever fortunate enough to win a united people over to the concept of a united country. This, indeed, is what the minority in Northern Ireland might expect from Fianna Fáil if we, in fact, have a united Ireland with Fianna Fáil in the saddle.  This brings me to a well-known quotation from Al Capone as I witness Deputy Blaney and Deputy Haughey, the men who were, perhaps, the greatest inciters, the greatest advocates, the men who gave the greatest encouragement to <Col N="3360" /> the breaking of the law in the past 12 months.  When I witness those men marching through the lobbies of Leinster House, then it brings home to me the truth of Al Capone's statement: &ldquo;It is a sweet racket if you can keep the boys in line.&rdquo; That is exactly what Jack Lynch has been doing in the past few years.</P>

      <P>The fundamental right of public expression, of freedom of speech, of the freedom of the Press, is at stake in this amendment and it is rejected by the Minister.

Not once through the whole of this debate has Jack Lynch had the moral courage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Costello did&mdash;when the Minister was making a fool of himself, when the Minister was acting obdurately and vindictively against the concept of protest in this society, when the Minister was out to &ldquo;get at&rdquo;&mdash;to use his own phrase&mdash;the <i>United Irishman</i>, to get at every form of political and social protest in this country.  The Taoiseach once again stood idly by and did not defend his Minister, and not once has he had the courage to do so during that debate.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in desperation is now resorting to the use of the guillotine which was only used in 1967 and which for many decades before was not used in such a flagrant manner by any Government.  How long more do we have to have a Prime Minister disgracing himself, his Cabinet and his party, in attempting to bulldoze repressive legislation through?

It is in No. 10 and I challenge him to define the meaning of &ldquo;communications media&rdquo;, referred to by us, as meaning anything other than that.  At every stage of social and political development in any part of the world freedom has to be conquered, and reconquered, defended and maintained.  In this debate the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party have defended these basic concepts.  We have defended the universal declaration of human rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not one newspaper editor, not one television commentator, not one constitutional lawyer, has come to the rescue of the Minister.  One of the more distinguished constitutional lawyers in this country.  Mr. Seán MacBride, had something to say about the Minister's Bill.  In 1948 Fianna Fáil shivered with fear when Seán MacBride took a political stand, and I can assure them they are in for a hell of a shock in the next general election.  Never before in the history of the State has a Government been so miserably unpopular.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the call by Mr. Seán MacBride to President de Valera to refer the Forcible Entry Bill to the Supreme Court for a full investigation into its constitutionality. He, indeed, is well fitted to make that proposition to the country.  I shall finish with one quotation.  Last March when the debate started Professor David Greene said that Fianna Fáil was once a good party but it had fallen into the hands of gombeen men and hardliners and the slogan on their lips was &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; and they now came to save Ireland.  Certainly we have seen the draft Criminal Justice Bill.  There is <Col N="3362" /> the Explanatory Memorandum and the Bill itself.  Deputy Ó Moráin withdrew it with sweat dripping off his nose at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis three years ago.  He had to withdraw it because it include the words &ldquo;advocacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party will repeal this Bill given the first opportunity in a change of Government.  We submit that the state of public order and public morality and the contingencies affecting the public expression of opinion do not warrant this Bill, and no defence of any consequence has been entered by the Government.  The constitutionality of the Bill is in question and we can say that never in the history of the State has a Minister so young proved to be so obdurate, so vicious and so stupid in bringing forward legislation which is both unconstitutional and undemocratic and which by no stretch of the imagination can be classified as being, God save the word, republican in the finest meaning of the term.  Therefore the Minister should throw it out and guillotine himself in the process.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Desmond speaking with such authority on what was in the Bill and what was not in it, because I could not help casting my mind back to the Second Stage debate in the course of which in his contribution he said the Minister for Justice was trying to widen the concepts of forcible entry and occupation so much in the definition in section 1 of the Bill that if a husband and wife were in bed together they were in danger of committing the offence of forcible entry.  That was Deputy Desmond's contribution to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy deny saying it?  That is the sort of learning that is brought to bear on this Bill by the Labour Party.  In this amendment what they seek to do is to make it a criminal offence for an ordinary citizen to advocate or encourage the commission of indicatable crime but <Col N="3363" /> that it should not be an offence if the same indictable crime were advocated or were encouraged by somebody who was a journalist.  I wonder if those who propose this amendment take into account the provisions of Article 40 of our Constitution.  Do they ever think that the citizens must be held equal before the law, that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander?  Why do they seek to make one group of people exempt from the law?  Why do they seek to make those who are in the best position of all to influence public opinion and to influence the conduct of people free from the obligation not to incite or to advocate or to encourage crime?  I do not think there are any reasonable journalists who wish to have the power to advocate, incite or encourage crime, because they do not have it at the moment.  They will not have it under this Bill.  They will be no better off and they will be no worse off than they are at this very moment.</P>
      <P>As we come to the final moments of this debate it is no harm to accept that there are a very great many people on the benches opposite who are glad that this sham, this fraud and this farce of a Parliamentary debate has been brought to an end&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the growth of motor vehicle repair businesses in backlane garages attached to private houses in Dublin suburbs with consequential serious damage to the residential amenities of such localities and considerable obstruction in and adjoining such laneways by motor vehicles awaiting and in the course of repair and sometimes abandoned as beyond repair; and that existing legislation and procedures appear to be inadequate to prevent or control such developments; if he will take all steps necessary, including introducing legislation, to cope with the problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Use for industrial or commercial purposes of a private domestic garage involves &ldquo;development&rdquo; under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, which came into operation on the 1st October, 1964.  Any such use commenced after that date constitutes unauthorised development unless planning permission has been obtained.  Action in relation to unauthorised development is a matter for the planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3247" /> I understand that all cases of unauthorised development that come to notice in the Dublin area are fully investigated by the corporation, that they have succeeded in having unauthorised uses terminated in a number of cases of the type described by the Deputy, and that they have several other cases of alleged unauthorised development of this kind under active investigation.  Strong enforcement powers were given to planning authorities under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, to deal with development commenced without planning permission on or after 1st October, 1964, when the 1963 Act came into operation, and I am satisfied that Dublin Corporation are prepared to use these powers where the circumstances warrant. The powers cannot, however, be applied retrospectively in relation to uses established before the 1963 Act came into operation and, before they can be invoked, it is necessary for the planning authority to be able to show beyond reasonable doubt that the development or use in question was commenced on or after 1st October, 1964.  In some cases it is not easy to establish the facts with any certainty. This is particularly so in cases where the existing use of land can be claimed to be a continuation or reasonable intensification of an earlier similar use.</P>
    <P>The general position about the effectiveness of the powers under the 1963 Act to deal with developments undertaken without planning permission is being examined at present in my Department in connection with the review of the Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill, 1969, but at this stage I am unable to say what changes, if any, may be considered desirable.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the matter of obstruction in laneways caused by parked or abandoned vehicles in my reply to a previous question on this specific point put down by the Deputy on 29th April last.</P>
