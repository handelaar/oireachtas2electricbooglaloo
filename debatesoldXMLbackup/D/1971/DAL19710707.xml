    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide a definite period each year during which the time for general purposes will be Greenwich mean time.  During the remainder of the year the time will continue to be standard time, i.e. one hour in advance of Greenwich mean time.</P>
      <P>The period provided in the Bill during which the time will be Greenwich mean time is the period from the Sunday following the fourth Saturday in October to the Sunday following the third Saturday in March, or if that is Easter Sunday, the Sunday following the second Saturday in March.  In the present year, however, it is proposed to change to Greenwich mean time on 31st October, which is the Sunday following the fifth Saturday in that month.  Provision is being made to enable the Minister for Justice by order, requiring a resolution of approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas, to vary the period either generally or for a specified year or for specified years or to prescribe that there shall be no period of winter time either generally or in a specified year or specified years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, up to the enactment of the Standard Time Act, 1968, Greenwich mean time was standard time but, under the Summer Time Act, 1925, there was a period each year during which the clock was advanced.  The Standard Time Act, 1968, provided, in effect, &ldquo;summer <Col N="701" /> time all the year round&rdquo;.  What this Bill proposes is, in effect, that we should revert to the position that obtained up to the enactment of the 1968 Act.  The period specified in the Bill during which Greenwich mean time is to be in force corresponds closely to the period during which Greenwich mean time was in force in the year 1961 to 1967, inclusive.</P>
    <P>When the British decision to revert to Greenwich mean time for part of the year had been taken, bodies and organisations that might have an interest in the matter were consulted by my Department as to whether the law should be changed to permit of this country's synchronising with Britain, and the public were invited to express their views also.  The great majority of the bodies and organisations that were consulted, which included the major State-sponsored bodies, were in favour of our preserving parity with Britain.  Slightly more than 300 private persons gave their views on the matter in letters to my Department. There was a fairly even balance as between those in favour of and those against a change to preserve parity with Britain, slightly more than half being in favour.  The Government are satisfied that the weight of representative opinion is in favour of our keeping in line with Britain.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the time system for this country was examined by the Summer Time Committee who submitted their report in 1941.  Their conclusion was that, if factors of purely domestic or internal significance only were taken into account, the period of the year during which the time should be advanced by one hour should run from the first Sunday in April to the first Sunday in November. This corresponds closely with the position that will obtain if the Bill is passed.  The committee went on to stress another factor they considered of great importance, namely, the desirability in the interests of interState transport, postal, telegraph and telephone communications of preserving uniformity of time with Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is of historical interest that three of the five <Col N="702" /> members of the committee were in favour of standard time in this country being half an hour behind Greenwich mean time but this recommendation was never acted on.</P>
    <P>The only novel aspect of the Bill is the proposal that the period of the year during which Greenwich mean time will obtain be designated the period of winter time.  The period in question, as provided in the Bill, is substantially less than the period of the year during which &ldquo;Greenwich mean time plus one hour&rdquo; will obtain and, consequently, the argument is in favour of continuing to maintain &ldquo;Greenwich mean time plus one hour&rdquo; as standard time: it is, incidentally, the standard time in Western Europe generally.  The corresponding British position is different in that they will have Greenwich mean time as standard time and &ldquo;Greenwich mean time plus one hour&rdquo; as summer time.  The change in their law, however, comes about by the automatic revival of the older legislation.  The original period of summer time, as provided in the Summer Time Act, 1925, was of about five months duration. The period of summer time that obtained here in the years 1961 to 1967, on the other hand, extended over more than seven months, while standard time, anomalously, obtained during less than five months.  Unlike the British we have to have fresh legislation and, that being so, the logical thing to do is what is proposed in the Bill, namely, to call the shorter period the period of winter time.</P>
    <P>This is a non-contentious measure which, I am satisfied, has the support of representative public opinion and, on that basis, I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The effect of this Bill is to repeal an Act passed in this House in 1968.  On that occasion we followed the action taken by Great Britain and decided to have standard summer time here all the year round; in other words, we decided to go one hour ahead of Greenwich mean time throughout the winter.  We did that, as the Minister said when introducing the Bill, because, <Col N="703" /> among other reasons, Great Britain was doing it at that time.  All the arguments, or at least a lot of those put forward at the time&mdash;I can quote the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran, speaking in the Seanad &mdash; were that it was desirable we should keep in line with Western European countries.  The former Minister said, and I quote from column 839 of the Seanad debates:</P>
      <P>In view, however, of the great and growing intercourse, commercial and otherwise, between this country and our close neighbours in Europe, the advantages of having a common system of time are obvious.</P>
      <P>On that occasion the emphasis was heavily on not keeping in line with Great Britain but very heavily on keeping in line with Western Europe. We were then told that we were developing a great and increasing volume of trade with Western European countries.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if it were desirable to fall in line with Western European countries in 1968, in view of the move towards the Common Market and our imminent entry thereto, there seems to be a far sounder and more convincing argument for keeping in close touch with Western Europe now than in 1968.  The Minister in introducing the Bill today seemed to lay the emphasis on keeping in touch with Britain.  The fact of the matter is that whatever Britain does we do.  Great Britain introduced this measure in 1968 and we at that time could not even wait to see how the change would operate there, to see whether the people there would be satisfied with it or whether it would have disadvantages. We followed the example straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a great pity at that time that we did not take our time, so to speak, that we did not wait to see how this change to standard time all the year round would operate in Britain.  We decided we would do it immediately to be in line.  There were arguments for and against it in 1968.  Parents of school children feared it was not in the interests of the children that they <Col N="704" /> should be asked to go out in the dark in the morning.  That argument was echoed here in the House and the Minister at the time said that if it turned out there were grave objections by parents we could have a little change in the school hours, but we know that despite efforts to get the school hours changed they were not changed.</P>
    <P>One significant factor is that in so far as accidents are concerned the change over to summer time in the winter did not lead to an increase in the accident rate during the hours of darkness in the mornings.  In an October, 1969 publication, An Foras Forbartha stated:</P>
    <P>The results of the analysis of traffic accidents do not indicate that the change to standard time has had a detrimental effect on traffic accident occurence, at least during the period 1st January to 17th February, 1969.  On the contrary, there is evidence that the changeover has had a beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>On page 15 the publication states:</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the number of child casualties increased as a result of the change to standard time.  Children killed or injured on their way to school would have been reflected in the figures at Table IV for the period 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.  These figures show a decrease in casualties from 19 in the period before to 11 in the period after.</P>
    <P>It is probably fair to say that following the introduction of standard time in winter in 1969 more precautions are taken by parents.  Children were encouraged to be more careful and they wore illuminated arm bands and all that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Before I say a few words in detail on the Bill I should like to say it is a pity we rushed into this change in 1968, that we did not wait, have patience, that we did not let the British act the guinea pig for once. The result is that we followed them slavishly and accepted their opinion on that matter and now we see ourselves in the absurd position of coming back here and following Great Britain <Col N="705" /> again at a time when it would appear there is a stronger argument for synchronising with Western European countries.  Having said that, I believe parents of school children throughout the country will welcome this change back to pre-1968 and I also believe that from the farming point of view the old system is more suitable to agricultural activities throughout the country, though it is strange that many of the arguments and complaints which we heard in 1968-69 have ceased to be made.  People seem to have fallen into line and to have put up with it.  I think the whole thing can be summarised by another quotation from the former Minister in the Seanad on 27th June, 1968, at column 850.  He was asked whether the ICMSA were in favour of the change at that time and he said:</P>
    <P>They are not against it.  I can assure the House this Bill was fully considered by every Government Department and all came down on the side of the Bill.  Indeed the suggestion is that we largely have no choice from the economic point of view except to make the change.</P>
    <P>I think it is obvious from the fact that we introduced the Bill in 1968 and made all the arguments in the world for going ahead of Greenwich mean time in the winter, and saying then that all the arguments were in favour of the change, and that we are coming back here now and undoing all we said and did in 1968 and saying now that all the arguments are in favour of going back, simply means we have no choice, that we are guided here and regulated here by British public opinion.  British public opinion brought about the change here in 1968 and apparently British public opinion is forcing us to change back now.</P>
    <P>One argument&mdash;and I do not think it has been made here&mdash;which is in favour of synchronising our time with that of Great Britain is that if we are to have a different time, if we are to be one hour ahead of them, we will also be one hour ahead of Northern Ireland.  It is undesirable that there should be one more barrier between the two parts of the country.  If we <Col N="706" /> were one hour ahead of the time in Fermanagh that would be another thing which would be highlighting the division in this country and driving us apart and identifying the two parts of the country as being separate and apart from each other.  Whatever we do to remove barriers and differences we should not do anything to establish other barriers.  As I say, it is a tragic bit of comedy, if you like, that we should be changing back so quickly after the 1968 decision.  I do not propose to oppose the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that some unfortunate Minister for Justice may not be in the same position again in three or four years time.  If British public opinion switches back presumably we will have another speech from some poor unfortunate person in that Department after he has racked his brains to get another twist on the well-known theme.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that in his explanation the Minister would at least have given us a breakdown on whatever reaction he had from the public when he was bringing in this Bill to tidy up the position and, as he said, to synchronise with the British position.  He said: &ldquo;Slightly more than 300 private persons gave their views on the matter in letters to my Department.&rdquo;  I would have been pleased if the Minister had obliged the House by letting us know what was the breakdown between city and country in the views expressed in those 300 letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies I have no objection to what the Minister is now proposing but he could have taken this opportunity to let us know at least what kind of reaction there was from the public.  He could have given us more information on whatever contacts he had with the public so that we could have been a little more enlightened as to the feeling of the public on this matter.  I would have liked him <Col N="707" /> to name the trade organisations, the farmers' organisations and the trade unions which gave their points of view on this matter.  Did trade unions contact the Minister to tell him how they considered industrial workers would be affected by the switch back or whether it would have any effect?</P>
    <P>I should also like to have heard from the Minister this morning exactly what it cost us over the past few years in the provision of arm bands and so on.  We had tremendous publicity and propaganda campaigns on the necessity for providing arm bands for the protection of school children who had to go out early in the morning.  It would have been interesting to know if any figure had been arrived at for the expenditure involved in keeping in step with the British on a previous occasion.  If we have a Minister for Justice who must follow in most repects what British legislation suggests in many areas&mdash;and this is the position in relation to much of our legislation&mdash;it is a pity that he must strike out on his own in areas like the Forcible Entry Bill and other pieces of coercive legislation for which he has apparently a unique fondness. However, this does not arise here.</P>
    <P>We accept what the Minister proposes with the reservation that since he had to go to the trouble of coming back to the House for this legislation it is a pity that he did not give us more information on which sections of the public were contacted and what the breakdown was.  Were there any suggestions made or issues arising under this Bill?  It would have been interesting if he had availed of the opportunity here this morning to give the House more information on those matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is nonsense legislation.  We are making fools of ourselves by this process of following slavishly&mdash;and that is the only adverb one can use&mdash;British legislation year in and year out, backwards and forwards.  Regardless of what the British do we follow them in an identical manner.  This is a new phenomenon in this country.  Before we got our independence we did not feel it <Col N="708" /> necessary to follow the British in this way.  Until the end of 1916 this country had its own time which was not a convenient hour of difference from that of the United Kingdom but 25 minutes.  That was the difference in real time, in sun time, for the city of Dublin, the capital of the country.  If before we achieved our independence, when we were an integral part legislatively and administratively of the United Kingdom, we could have our own time different by such an inconvenient amount as 25 minutes from British time, why now that we are allegedly independent must we follow British practice year in year out, backwards and forwards?  Why can we not tolerate any difference?</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us as his predecessor told us when he initiated this shuttlecock movement of our time in sympathy with British time that we have to keep in line with Britain.  In fact, the phrase used was quoted by a previous speaker; we had no choice economically in that matter.  He said that largely we &ldquo;had no choice from the economic point of view except to make the change&rdquo;.  That is the slavish attitude of Fianna Fáil Ministers to anything that has to do with our relationship with Britain.  Why have we no economic choice?  Why had we an economic choice before independence? Why did we have an economic choice during the war when for periods we did not follow Britain in her changes of time?  Why have we now no economic choice?  Is this the result of Fianna Fáil rule?  Why is it that a country like Italy, a member of the Common Market, has an economic choice while we outside the Community with the political independence which we are supposed to enjoy are not free to have our own time, when that time suits our own need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The degree of ignorance on this subject on the part of Ministers was demonstrated abysmally in the Seanad in 1968 when the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Ó Moráin, had the nerve to state quite untruthfully&mdash;he did not intend not to tell the truth; he simply was ignorant&mdash;that all western European countries had the same time. Of course he was misinformed.  I shall <Col N="709" /> quote from column 851 of the Official Report of the Seanad Debates, volume 65.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;When this Bill is passed,&rdquo; said the Minister, as he then was, &ldquo;we will have it also&rdquo;&mdash; that is, Central European Time.  &ldquo;Iceland will be the only odd-man-out in the whole of Western Europe.&rdquo;  I intervened to ask:</P>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that Italy has departed from this and introduced a different time from nearby countries last summer?  In view of that how can he suggest that uniformity is imperative from the point of view of communications?</P>
      <P>Mr. Moran: Italy and all these other countries have the same standard time as that proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There was a long controversy between us ending with the Minister saying with a meekness unusual in that particular Minister:</P>
      <P>I will make inquiries as to that.</P>
      <P>He did not know.  He had not been told by his civil servants and was not well enough informed himself to know that Italy had in the previous year introduced its own summer time.  This was not only a difference of adding a further hour but, for a period, a difference in the period during which the time changed in other countries, running from May to September instead of from March to October.  It is that level of ignorance that informs the legislation coming before this House.</P>
      <P>We are now told we must change back again.  The truth is the Government made fools of themselves in changing in 1968.  They were told it was an experimental period in Britain and the then Minister for Justice was aware of that because he said in the Dáil at column 1628 of volume 235 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> I should point out that a Government amendment to the British Bill proposes that it should run initially for a period of three years only.</P>
    <P>The Government knew it was experimental. Yet, they felt we could not even be different from Britain for a year or two because it would be such a terrible economic tragedy in the state of political dependence into which this Government have got us 50 years after the Treaty.  Of course, what the Government should have done was to wait and see rather than make this change, unless the change was thought to be desirable in its own right.  When one reads the speeches of the Minister in these two debates in the Dáil and Seanad there is no suggestion that this was the right thing to do because it suited the needs of the country.  Oh, no.  This was what Britain was doing.  The Minister argued it was right for this country to go one way in 1968 and it is right now to go the other way in 1971 because Britain is going the other way.  We have no economic choice.  We must do the same as Britain.  Good or bad, we must follow Britain.  That is the policy. Whether it is the right thing or the wrong thing has nothing to do with it. One would have thought that the question of whether it was the right thing or the wrong thing to do would have been the relevant approach to adopt in our own Parliament.</P>
    <P>We are now going to change back again.  In 1968, Deputy Ó Moráin was very concerned about our relations with Europe.  That was a period during which we were not very active about going into the EEC.  The EEC issue was dormant at the time but, even at a period when this was not an active issue, Deputy Ó Moráin, a great European, of course, said at column 839, Volume 65, of the Official Report of the Seanad:</P>
    <P>In view, however, of the great and growing intercourse, commercial and otherwise, between this country and our close neighbours, in Europe, the advantages of having a common system of time are obvious</P>
    <P>Now, that we are going into the EEC, <Col N="711" /> we are going to have a different time from the majority of the countries in Europe with which we had such close intercourse in 1968.  Where is the logic in that?</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Minister for Justice has not referred to the impact of this change on accidents.  I am not quite sure why the Minister for Justice handles this Bill, but I would have thought that his prime concern would have been with the question of accidents. He is the Minister responsible for the Garda Síochána, the men who are involved in the whole business of accident control and prevention.  I would have thought he would have told us the effect this is likely to have on accidents.  There is good reason why he did not tell us because the evidence is that the effect will be adverse.  The Minister has nothing to say about how this adverse situation will be remedied. An Foras Forbartha carried out an investigation after the introduction of the 1968 Bill and provided figures for two comparable periods between January and mid-February, before and after the 1968 Bill.  These figures showed very significant changes in accidents occurring, changes involving a significant reduction in accidents. They were referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>.  I will give the exact figures.</P>
    <P>The two periods chosen were 7 to 10 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m., two periods affected by the change in time.  A comparison was made between the accident rate in these two periods and the accident rate in the other 18 hours. If we take the figures for the morning and evening period there was a reduction from 291 to 215 in the number of fatal and personal injury accidents. In the 18 hours there was virtually no change&mdash;a slight increase from 521 to 530.  This suggests that, as a result of the change in time, there was a reduction in accidents from a figure of about 300 on the basis of what happened in the rest of the day; that figure was reduced to 215, a reduction of 85, or almost 30 per cent, in the number of accidents.  In the morning period there was a reduction from 95 to 81, a 15 per cent reduction.  In the <Col N="712" /> evening period there was a reduction from 196 to 134, a 32 per cent reduction. These figures are significant. The degree of confidence in the figure is 99 per cent upwards, which is a very high confidence limit indeed for any statistical comparison of this kind.</P>
    <P>The figures for child accidents&mdash;these are not figures for children going to school because they are not broken down in that way; the actual number is statistically small, though humanly and tragically large&mdash;cannot be regarded with the same degree of statistical confidence but, nonetheless, I will give them because they confirm the trend indicated.  In the morning period the number of accidents was reduced from 19 to 11, despite the fact that conditions were more hazardous but, because of the effectiveness of the preventive measures taken, children wearing arm bands and so on, there was an actual reduction and the Government are to be congratulated on having taken such effective preventive measures.  In the evening period accidents fell from 49 to 35.  In the other 18 hours there was a small drop of 9 per cent, 80 to 73.  Had that small reduction applied in the morning and evening periods the number of accidents would have been 58.  It was actually 46.  There was a significant reduction here; I should not say &ldquo;significant&rdquo; because that has a statistical meaning.  There was a reduction much greater than that which occurred in the other periods of the day, not big enough to be statistically significant but indicative of the trend and in line with the general trend in accidents over those periods.  It seems to me, therefore, that the legislation introduced, despite the fears mentioned, in 1968, had the effect of reducing the accident rate significantly.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear now from the Minister what he proposes to do to deal with the very serious situation which will be created by this Bill, reverting to conditions involving darkness earlier in the evening when people are tired and more accident prone, to try to ensure that accidents do not rise sharply to the level at which they were before the 1968 Bill was introduced.  If the Minister feels it is economically imperative <Col N="713" /> that we should follow Britain backwards and forwards, then he has a duty to take steps to prevent an increase in accidents which, on the figures involved in a six-week period alone, could result in an increase of something like 85 casualties.  The Minister has a duty to take some action to prevent these.  If, in six weeks, 85 extra casualties could result, then over the whole winter period we would have several hundreds extra killed or injured on the basis of these figures, because that was the reduction in people killed and injured following the introduction of the 1968 legislation.  What steps will the Minister take to prevent the restoration of the pre-1968 basis, leading to restoration as regards time and as regards accidents involving several hundreds more killed and injured?  I emphasise we are talking here of figures which involve such a large change in a figure, which is itself significant, that the figures have a very high confidence limit.  It is well over 100 to 1 that this reduction in accidents was attributable to the change in time.  That is what these figures mean.  Given that kind of situation the Minister has a duty to the House and to the people to say what he will do, if he is going to push this Bill through, to ensure it will not result in the kind of holocaust these figures would indicate.</P>
    <P>One curious feature of the Minister's introductory speech is the way in which the speech follows so closely the previous speech.  I do not recall any precedent for a Minister making two speeches on opposite things and using exactly the same format and language in both cases.  The two speeches are textually the same speech with the figures reversed.  I will show this paragraph by paragraph.  This is an unusual method of writing speeches. The same speech does and one merely substitutes the opposite figures to say the opposite thing.  At column 1628 of volume 235 of the Official Report the Minister for Justice said:</P>
    <P>The views of interested organisations and individuals on this subject were invited several months ago when the British decision was known.</P>
    <P>The wording is played around with a <Col N="714" /> little this time and a certain imagination is shown in the order of the words. The reference to the British decision comes at the beginning of the sentence this time and I quote:</P>
    <P>When the British decision to revert to Greenwich mean time for part of the year had been taken, bodies and organisations...</P>
    <P>It was &ldquo;organisations and individuals&rdquo; last time.</P>
    <P>... that might have an interest in the matter were consulted by my Department as to whether the law should be changed to permit of this country's synchronising with Britain, and the public were invited to express their views also.</P>
    <P>The next sentence in 1968 was:</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the organisations, which included industrial and employers' organisations, chambers of commerce and semi-State bodies, were in favour of the adoption of the same system of time as Britain and Western Europe.</P>
    <P>This time the majority has changed from being &ldquo;vast&rdquo; to being &ldquo;great&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The great majority of the bodies and organisations that were consulted, which included the major State-sponsored bodies...</P>
    <P>They seem to feature in both, they are the most important.</P>
    <P>... were in favour of our preserving parity with Britain.</P>
    <P>In 1968 we were told:</P>
    <P>About 130 letters were received from individuals, of which about 70 were in favour of the European system.</P>
    <P>This time the Minister states:</P>
    <P>Slightly more than 300 private persons gave their views on the matter in letters to my Department. There was a fairly even balance as between those in favour of and those against a change to preserve parity with Britain, slightly more than half being in favour.</P>
    <P>Whatever the proposition there is always slightly more than half in favour if it is a Fianna Fáil proposition <Col N="715" /> except when there is a referendum when it is slightly less than half. In 1968 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it seems fair to deduce that the weight of opinion is in favour of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This time the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the weight of representative opinion...</P>
    <P>It is not just &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; this time, it is &ldquo;representative opinion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>... is in favour of our keeping in line with Britain.</P>
    <P>As one goes through one can see the phraseology is the same throughout. The last sentence in the Minister's Seanad speech last time is almost identical with the Minister's last sentence this time.  The Minister said today:</P>
    <P>This is a non-contentious measure which, I am satisfied, has the support of representative public opinion...</P>
    <P>In the Seanad in 1968 the then Minister said:</P>
    <P>I trust the Seanad will accept this Bill as a progressive and non-controversial measure...</P>
    <P>In the Dáil he said:</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House as a reasonable measure, taken after public opinion has been tested, and as one which has no Party or political significance.</P>
    <P>This is a case of basically the same speech with a variation in language and different figures substituted to mean the opposite.  It is a curious way to legislate but it comes from the mentality of doing precisely what the British do, when they do it, without a moment's delay.  If that is the attitude of the Government I do not know what the point of having a separate Government is.  I understand the purpose of our getting a separate Government in 1921 was to run our own affairs in our own way but in this as in so many other matters such as decimalisation we have to follow Britain slavishly.  The <Col N="716" /> British took a decision to stick to the £ and this was regarded by responsible opinion everywhere as a foolish decision dictated by considerations of national prestige because it was a unit so large that the one-hundredth fraction of it is much too big a unit for pricing purposes.  In fact, most countries in Europe have units one-tenth that size as a unit for pricing purposes and, in fact, prices on the Continent are measured in terms of these units so that they can be fairly priced by the equivalent of one-tenth of the new Irish penny.  This much greater precision in pricing keeps prices down and encourages competition.  The British wanted to stick to their sterling £; we had to follow suit because we could not differ from Britain even one iota. On that occasion we could not even have a different decimal point; we could not even have one thousand milles in the £ instead of the one hundred cents, we could not even have a £ which would be one-tenth of the British £.  A decimal point is even too much for this Government when it comes to differentiating us in any respect from Britain.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know what more one can say about this legislation. This legislation cannot be justified in 1968 and again today.  One is entitled to feel that one Bill or the other was right.  I suppose most of us have a vague preference between the two but to contend that both Bills are right and to contend to that effect by using the same language, the same representations and the same groups of people, always with the bare majority in favour of what the Minister has said, is not the way to legislate in an independent country.</P>

      <P>This enlightenment came from the fathers and mothers. Parents made representations to me about their children having to go to school in the dark mornings and they wanted the time changed back.  The only case that Deputy FitzGerald made was that we were following Britain, but we are not following Britain.  As we are entering the EEC in the near future we should be able to co-operate with friendly countries and countries near to us.  This does not, however, come into it.  As a result of all the representations which the Minister and I have received on behalf of young children, the Minister has changed this legislation.</P>
      <P>Having seen young children in Santry, where I live, trying to cross busy roads on dark mornings I welcome this change.  The Minister should not mind what Deputy FitzGerald said about our following the British. I would not like Ministers to take the view that what they and their predecessors have done cannot be changed. I always feel democracy is working properly when a Minister announces that he is going to amend legislation passed last year or a few years back. Changing one's mind on greater enlightenment is democracy in action. I am deeply concerned with youngsters going to school in the morning. I do not want to see anything happen to any child in the morning.</P>

      <P>I live in Santry. The road there is very busy and there is an effort being made to have it bypassed. There is nothing about that in the Bill, so I shall refer to it only in passing.  Many parents have come to me asking to have the hour changed so that children could go to school in daylight rather than in the dark.  The citizens of tomorrow must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion seems to be that we should build a wall around this country and cut ourselves off from aeroplane traffic and everything else and go back to the Middle Ages.  We are living in an enlightened age.  We are only doing what every other country in the world is trying to do, that is, co-operating in certain matters.  I shall not go into the international implications of this matter.  I am just dealing with the case as I see it.  I welcome the Bill because it will help school-going children.  It is up to us to co-operate internationally in matters like this.  It is about an hour's journey by <Col N="719" /> plane from here to London.  It would be very inconvenient to have a difference of one hour in the time as between here and Britain.  We are entering the European Economic Community and we expect co-operation from all its members.</P>
    <P>I refute the suggestion that has been made that we are following Britain in this matter.  That is completely untrue. We are doing the sensible thing.  Following and co-operating are two different things.  The Bill will be welcomed by parents and children.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that accidents will occur as a result of this Bill.  Accidents will always occur.  The number of road accidents has been reduced considerably by the provision of crossings for children and wardens to look after children and various other means. We have to move with the times.  I hope that if at any time the Minister feels it necessary to alter the decision he has made he will be big enough to do so.  If he does that, he will go down in history as one of the greatest democrats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I agree a great deal more with what Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan said than I do with what the other two speakers since said.  As it happened, I had a job to do involving a very large group of workers at the time the previous change was made, and on account of the utter impossibility of the situation which was brought about, how the Minister had the nerve at that time and still has the nerve to say that representative bodies at that time agreed with him, is beyond me.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose there are many Deputies in the House who remember but we, in fact, at that time made out what the time was when the dawn rose and under the system that has been in operation in this country, in winter time in the last three years, the dawn came at 23 minutes past nine in the morning.  One great industry, the building industry, changed their time of starting from 8 a.m. to 8.30 a.m.  That was a kind of halfway house.  They start all the year round now at 8.30 a.m.  Certainly in the winter time from now on, with the dawn coming at 8.23 a.m., that will make for increased production compared with starting at 8 a.m., with the workers stumbling over the blocks of wood and the concrete blocks that are around building sites.  So that I welcome this Bill very, very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say something else&mdash;if I had had any say whatever in the last decision it would not have been taken, for a serious reason.  Since I am older than most people in the House, perhaps, they do not remember but, when the base and brutal British were here, as they were called, every post office in this country showed two times&mdash;Irish time and Greenwich time.  Dublin time was 20 minutes behind Greenwich mean time.  For the bulk of the country there is half an hour by the sun difference between their time and Greenwich mean time.  I am talking of this problem for an age since we spent so much effort on it.  During the war years here we had during the winter months two hours summer time.  I used to see the unfortunate children coming out in the grey dawn.  I suppose Deputy Ryan <Col N="721" /> was going to school then.  I wonder does he remember the kind of conditions in which he had to come out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had great sympathy with the small children at the time every time I passed down on the tram from Terenure.  Any suggestion that what was done three years ago made for any saving was just complete nonsense.  It did one thing in connection with the ESB: it made for two peak periods in the day and that was a slight advantage from the point of view of power production but this was the only advantage in it.  There was no daylight saving so to speak, because what you saved in the way of light in the evening you spent in the morning. So, it was all the same.</P>
      <P>The idea that it was significant that we should have the same time as Great Britain is complete nonsense and the same can be said with regard to Northern Ireland.  Let us take, for example, the United States of America where there are at least three different times.  There is eastern standard time, mid-western standard time and western standard time.  What happens there? As you move west when you arrive at a railway station and you see the time is different, you change your watch and forget about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now following the British in this Bill the same as we did in the 1968 Bill.  They had the common sense to really get to grips with the problem. There was great controversy in the British newspapers about this.  We have been told that the change resulted in fewer road deaths over the past few years.  This could be due to entirely <Col N="722" /> different reasons.  It could be due to the fact that there was so much talk about it that drivers were more careful or it could be due to the fact that many people could control the time they came out in the morning and did not come out until later.  Statistical comparisons of that sort are nonsensical and I have had to complain about them time and time again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said that we are now going into the EEC.  What is the great case for going in?  The case is that if Britain goes in what option have we? That is the same thing as saying we must follow Britain.  Men in some industries go to work at 8 o'clock in the morning.  In recent years during winter time in Dublin, to get the time by the sun you had to take one hour 20 minutes from 8 o'clock which meant that workers had to be at work at 6.40 a.m.  If it took them 40 minutes to get to work it meant they had to leave their homes at 6 a.m. in the morning.  Of all the absurd things ever done by the Fianna Fáil Party this was the most absurd and ridiculous.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of school children there is no doubt that this Bill is to be welcomed.  It is also an occasion for us to say what we think about people who change their minds.  It took the Government three years to change their minds with regard to winter time. What about the concession given in income tax last year which is being taken away this year?  That is one form of time manoeuvre that I do not approve of.  The Government cannot make up their minds about anything. They introduce Bills and then withdraw them.  They shuffle things backwards and forwards.  The trouble about this is that it brings all politicians into disrepute.  I do not like people who bring me into disrepute.  However, I welcome this Bill very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech in defence of this pathetic Bill is both contemptible and inaccurate.  It is contemptible in that the considerations which apparently influenced him were those of the convenience of international travel.  The realities of the Irish situation were apparently irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke said he was glad the <Col N="723" /> Minister changed his mind so quickly and he hoped he would be courageous and change his mind as often as he wanted.  I forecast that if the pattern which dictates Irish time is what happens in England or elsewhere he will within the next five years be again asking this House to make a further variation in the time which should operate in Ireland.  If Great Britain becomes a member of the EEC it is inevitable that she will be forced by the weight of opinion within that Community to conform to European standard time so, again, we will find ourselves marching arm in arm, step by step, thinking alike with Great Britain all the time and never having the guts, the courage and the intelligence to use the independence we are supposed to have.</P>
    <P>I assert, without any hesitation, that the economic advantages would lie in favour of our having a different time from that which operates in Great Britain.  Deputy O'Donovan has already referred to the advantages which came to the Electricity Supply Board as a result of the change in 1968 because it spread the peak load of electricity.  That was a very significant advantage even within our own twenty-six county State.  It has a further advantage for all Ireland because it enables the Electricity Supply Board here and the Northern Ireland Electricity Supply Board to exchange supplies of electricity at times of varying peaks and valley requirements in the two jurisdictions.  In fact, we avoid the necessity of considerable capital expenditure for electricity production by having a different time in the two jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with all that has been said about the undesirability of having different times and the social disadvantages it may have but let us not forget the considerable economic advantages which flow by having this difference in time.  The telephone system of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is becoming daily chronically incapable of handling the load of traffic which is presented to it.  A variation in time between ourselves and Britain enables the spread of this load and enables the <Col N="724" /> overcrowded telephone exchanges to operate over a longer period of the day with lower peaks.  Of course, this is something we must not even think about, we must not consider, because Great Britain has decided what needs to be done and we must follow suit without regard to the benefits which may flow to us by having a variation in time.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, correct to allow for the increased awareness on the part of road users in recent years and to give some credit for the improvement in the accident rate to arm bands, the fact that public lighting is now maintained on the streets until daylight and so on.  When we allow for all these things how can we be so callous as to ignore the fact that An Foras Forbartha were engaged to carry out a detailed examination of the consequences of changing our time in 1968? An Foras Forbartha consulted with several bodies to ascertain what change had taken place and if a change had taken place to what it was attributable.  The consequences of all that, as Deputy FitzGerald said this morning, was a reduction of 85 accidents in six weeks.  If the report of An Foras Forbartha is a valid one, &mdash;I assume that the Government accept it as being a valid report&mdash; there is now a real possibility that because of our inability to think for ourselves and to act according to our own requirements, independent of what Westminster may decide, an additional 300 people will be killed or maimed on our roads because we have not the sense to make our own decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke said that we should co-operate with friendly nations.  Did Britain consult with Ireland before deciding to change her legislation?  I am sure she did not.  Was there any consultation on this matter between the British Home Office and ourselves or between the British transport companies and our transport companies? Not at all.  Little Ireland is never thought of when Britain is making up her own mind.  There is no reason why Britain should consult us on such matters.  She is a sovereign and independent nation.  What is the use talking <Col N="725" /> about co-operation when there is no attempt on the part of Britain either to co-operate or to consult with us? That is the reality of the situation. Britain makes decisions in keeping with her own requirements, dictated to a large extent by the desire of the Tories in north-west Scotland to placate people there who were disturbed emotionally but who had not the wit to make a study of the facts of the situation that would have justified the change made in 1968, or justified its continuation.</P>
    <P>In all our urban environments we find that public transport and the movement of traffic generally is hampered considerably in darkness as against daylight.  This is becoming an increasingly serious social problem as well as creating economic disadvantages for our city people and for our industries.  One would think that a Government concerned with this problem would be anxious to ensure that traffic moved in daylight in so far as possible.  Apart from people going to work at peak times in the mornings, the change in 1968 enabled traffic at the time of greatest congestion to move in daylight for a longer period of the year. This is a valid and serious consideration but, like the other considerations that we have mentioned from these benches this morning, they have not been even touched on in the Minister's speech. These are the kind of considerations that should have been debated, which should have been considered and which should have been the determining factor instead of the determining factor being the convenience of Aer Lingus or the shipping companies who, in any event, publish timetables for different times of the year and who would be in no great difficulty in the event of having to print a note on their timetables to the effect that allowances should be made for variations in time.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that it is now more important to keep in step with Britain rather than to keep in step with western Europe.  As Deputy O'Donovan pointed out, this is in conflict with what the Government are urging in connection with our application for EEC membership.  One would have thought that at a time when we wish to indicate <Col N="726" /> how European we are and how much our practices are in keeping with Europe, we would not have followed slavishly the British example.  Like many of my colleagues, I find myself unable to support this Bill because it is not dictated by Irish requirements.  It has been introduced because of a decision taken in an entirely different situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke once again took the baby in his arms this morning.  This is his usual stand.  If he does not do that, he is collecting sixpences in a tin box on O'Connell Bridge.  He is either taking the baby in his arms or he has the widow on his arm.  Some of us can speak here as parents of school-going children who leave home in the darkness to go to school.  The children are none the worse for this. Apparently Deputy O'Donovan was concerned for me and for colleagues of my generation who during the last war went to school for a longer period of the year when there were more hours of darkness than there are under the existing system.  We were none the worse for that although I realise that there was not then as much traffic on the roads as there is now.</P>
    <P>There is much emotion involved in the sight of a child going out to school in the darkness of the morning but there seems to be very little concern for the child coming home in the darkness of the evening when the roads are crowded with vehicles being driven by people who are tired after their day's work.  Neither is there any concern shown for children who, if we are to revert to the old system, will come home from school at the end of a weary day and, after having a meal, are unable to go out to play even for half an hour because of the darkness. The system we have operated during the past three years enabled children to go out to play in the evenings.  We are all aware of the annoyances caused by the change of 1968.  Workers and managers complained about work commencing in the darkness.  Has any effort been made to ascertain what these managers and workers think now? My own experience has been that most of them are glad of the change that was made at that time.  Admittedly in <Col N="727" /> most cases it was decided to begin work at 8 a.m. instead of 8.30 a.m. but the workers can avail of some remaining daylight after they have finished their day's work.  Are these benefits not worth retaining?  I think they are and on that account, too, I find myself unable to support the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan complained that the consequence of the 1968 legislation was that workers were in effect commencing work at 6.40 a.m.  This is not unique.  Workers across the world begin their day much earlier than that by their own sunrise or standard time.  There is nothing wrong with beginning work early.  If we are to meet the challenges that await us in Europe and if we are to avail ourselves of the opportunities that will present themselves to us in Europe, we shall have to be out in the early hours of the morning.  If we want a five-day week or, perhaps, a four-day week, we will have to get up very early and work more hours on the individual working days, but these are not great social disadvantages.  Of course in wintry weather we all like to stay in bed a little later in the mornings but this is only habit and people have adapted well to a new routine under the progressive legislation that was introduced in 1968.  I regard this Bill as a retrograde step.  On every consideration it should not have been introduced.  Having satisfied myself that it is socially, economically and politically undesirable, I will not be supporting the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, both of us were members of a delegation to the British House of Commons in December last when the change back to winter time was being debated.  On that occasion there was general apathy among members of that House towards the change although there was a substantial pressure group from Scotland in favour of the change. This group were representative of the three parties in Britain.  In particular, a former leader of the Liberal Party who represents the Shetlands advocated the change back but there certainly was apathy on the part of Members from the midlands and the industrial <Col N="728" /> areas who were in favour of the new standard time but who were not sufficiently in favour of it to pressure Members from other areas to agree with them and so they allowed the change to take place then.  The Minister said in the second last paragraph of his speech that unlike the British we have to have fresh legislation.  I wonder why the British had to have a debate in December if they were not introducing legislation.  As I recall it, there was a free vote in that House on that occasion.  I do not think that the Minister is suggesting that the same thing should happen here today.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to have standard time retained.  That is a personal view because its retention would suit me.  It would suit me because of our work here in the House and the amount of leisure time available to us.  Nevertheless in the constituency which I represent the change upset many people of all age groups.  I, as a trade unionist, visited many factories and places of business in the Wicklow area in order to arrange changes in work schedules requested as a result of the introduction of standard time in the winter months.  People working on building sites and forestry and road workers were badly affected by the change.  The usual time for starting work in such occupations is 8 a.m. When the change to standard time came there was not much light until after 9 a.m.  This meant that people could not work in safety for the first hour of their working day during December and most of January.  An attempt was made to put back the working day by one hour.  As Deputy O'Donovan said, in many cases a compromise was reached where it was agreed to start half-an-hour later. There is no point in changing standard time if this means that the work has to be changed anyway and in practice the original working time was always put back by an hour so there was absolutely no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change to standard time did not suit the farmers either.  They would prefer light earlier in the morning.  The Fine Gael Deputies mentioned the school children.  City school children do not travel in the dark because most <Col N="729" /> of the streets are illuminated by lamps. Children in rural areas have had to walk on dark mornings in the worst weather.  If children have to go to school in harsh weather it would be preferable to have a little light in the mornings.  It would be preferable to have extra light in the mornings so that people could see the children and the children could see the dangers which exist.  Figures have shown that there have been less accidents in the mornings in recent years.  This has been brought about as a result of a big campaign on road safety in the mornings in winter time.  We should have a better road safety campaign all the year round.  Such a campaign would be advantageous.  Business firms gave out free armbands, stickers for school bags and specially illuminated school bags.  There were contests with prizes of reflectorised items for school children. Everyone became aware of the dangers of travelling in the dark and this caused a drop in the number of accidents in the dark periods of the day.  Children in rural areas suffered unduly because of the change.  Most of these children travel in school buses. They are picked up at a central collection point but many of them have to be on the road an hour before the school opens.  Many children have to walk a mile to the collection point.  In most areas it was suggested that schools should open half an hour later but this was not acceptable to teachers or parents.</P>
    <P>Personally I would like standard time retained but the workers, farmers and school children would prefer the return to the older system.  For that reason I am in favour of the Bill and support the Minister in this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Publicans tend to complain that the 11.30 opening is for <Col N="731" /> such a long part of the year at the moment.  They are opposed, as are the trade unions, to any extension of it.</P>
      <P>While I am on the subject of trade unions, Deputy O'Leary inquired what their views were.  Among those who replied to our advertisement in connection with this proposal were the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who represent the vast bulk of trade unions in the country, the Cork Council of Trade Unions and the Federation of Rural Workers.  Each of those three bodies expressed themselves very strongly in favour of the proposal in this Bill.  In fact, the trade union groups who replied, and I think the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were replying on behalf of almost all of them, expressed themselves probably more strongly than any other group or organisation. Similarly, bodies like the Construction Industry Federation and the Federation of Trade Associations and so on were also strongly in favour of reverting to the pre-1968 position as they found it almost impossible to operate, as Deputy Kavanagh has explained quite clearly, under the system that existed from 1968 up to the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary asked also for some sort of break-down as between city and country with regard to those who wrote in.  We did not, in fact, break it down on those lines but it is correct to say that the rural dwellers are very much more strongly in favour of what is proposed in this Bill than are urban dwellers.  It was enlightening to contrast the approaches in this debate of Deputy Ryan and Deputy Kavanagh. Deputy Ryan said that school children have no trouble and people going to work have no trouble because of the fact that it is not bright at 9 o'clock or 9.30 during some parts of the winter.  The school children and the working people that Deputy Ryan knows have no trouble because they have street lighting and they have buses.  It is all the same to them whether they are travelling in the middle of the night or in the middle of the day from the point of view of safety or visibility which are not greatly affected one way or the other. Deputy Kavanagh brought out very <Col N="732" /> clearly the difference between that and the situation in rural areas.  Certainly school children who have to walk several miles to school or who have to walk quite long distances before they can get a bus to go to school are in a very different position.  They have no lighting of any kind.  They have not got buses to their doors.  Deputy Ryan and people like him who come in here and sneer at the statements that have been made on behalf of rural school children and rural workers should bear in mind that these people have the very same rights as those who travel along the well paved and well lit streets of Dublin and to whom it does not matter whether this is passed or whether it is not passed.</P>
    <P>It was indicative of this debate and of the approach of the Opposition to compare the speeches made by Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Ryan.  These two Deputies were in 100 per cent disagreement. In fact, they constantly referred to one another as holding opposite views and that each did not agree with the other was quite evident.  At the same time both of them, by some remarkable feat of mental gymnastics, sought to put the blame on the Government for the things which they condemned although the two things they condemned were diametrically opposed to one another. How the Government can be to blame for A which is the direct opposite of B and then be to blame for B in the next breath is somewhat beyond me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They are to blame for both Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is not beyond the combined efforts of the Opposition.  I was accused of laying too much stress on synchronisation with Britain or parity with Britain.  It was only Deputy Fitzpatrick who brought out the fact that the most important aspect of synchronisation is synchronisation with our six north eastern counties.  I wonder if the Deputies opposite who are so eloquent in their condemnation of the proposals in this Bill would like to put themselves in the position of somebody in a border village in County Donegal and ask <Col N="733" /> themselves what is to be the position if you live in a village five or six miles from the city of Derry and there is to be a difference of one hour in the time. It simply accentuates in a ridiculous way the ridiculous Border that exists in this country.  If the Government had decided to stay as we were for the last three years they could legitimately be accused of seeking to highlight the partition of our six north-eastern counties and I have no doubt that those who this morning accused us of slavishly following Britain would get up and would just as eloquently and as vehemently accuse us, if we did not make this change, of being proud and arrogant and of refusing to do it simply because Britain did it.</P>
      <P>I was accused of taking the interests of international travel and transport into account to the detriment of the needs of the ordinary people.  I made clear in my opening speech that if difficulties with neighbouring countries and with the partitioned part of our country did not exist, if we as a country existed in a vacuum and could, without causing any complication, choose whatever system of time suited us best, the system which we have now is almost identical with that which was recommended by the Summer Time Committee in 1941.  They recommended what, on the basis of our regarding ourselves in isolation, would be the best system of time to adopt and what they did recommend in those circumstances was almost identically what we have now.  It differed by a week or thereabouts at each end.  Therefore, if none of these outside considerations were to apply and we were to accept the recommendation of this committee as being the system that was most beneficial to the people what we would have is what I am now proposing to the House in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Fitzpatrick, FitzGerald and others made the point that the Government should not have made the change which was made in 1968 but should have waited until now to see how Britain would get on and whether the thing worked out or not.  I have no doubt that if the Government in <Col N="734" /> 1968 had decided to wait for three years it would have caused chaos in the past three years in this country. Everybody who genuinely looks at the thing knows that.  I also know that Deputies Fitzpatrick and FitzGerald and the others who complained about the fact that the Government did not wait for three years in 1968 would have been complaining very constantly during the past three years if that change had not been made and would have been moaning about the problems that would be created by that kind of situation for almost everybody in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald laid a good deal of emphasis on the report prepared by An Foras Forbartha and gave quotations from it but I want to quote a sentence in the first paragraph of the summary on page 14 which I think Deputy FitzGerald neglected, no doubt due to an oversight, to read.  That was:</P>
    <P>However, the reduction</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is the reduction in accidents</P>
    <P>&mdash;can only be ascribed, with some reservation, to the change in Standard Time because of the short before and after periods and because of the inability to verify the suitability of the control group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that the author of this study is making in the sentence I quoted was that no firm or reliable conclusion could be drawn from the study for the reason he gave. He says in effect that the slightly beneficial effect can only with reservations <Col N="735" /> be ascribed to the change to standard time and if one looks at the fact that the period involved was only one of six or seven weeks from 1st January to 17th February it is easy to see why the author had reservations about drawing very sweeping conclusions from it. There is no doubt, as a number of Deputies opposite were honest enough to point out, that in the normal way if no precautions had been taken by the Government at the time and if the major campaign of the kind mounted had not been mounted, the change made in 1968 would and must inevitably have led to a significant increase in traffic accidents, particularly to children on their way to school in the mornings.</P>

      <P>In that short period for which there was a test there was a slight reduction.  That slight reduction was a wonderful thing because it was a slight reduction on the previous year when the problem did not arise and, therefore, it was a very considerable reduction in what would have been the number of accidents if the campaign had not been carried out.  The slight reduction is attributable almost entirely to the fact that this extensive campaign was carried out and that there was wonderful co-operation by school teachers and many commercial firms who assisted in it.  It seems most remarkable that the fact that an otherwise inevitable increase in fatalities was avoided as a result of this should be used as an argument in favour of standard time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is solely due to the fact that this extensive campaign was carried out that there was not what would otherwise be an inevitable large rise in the number of accidents. I hope when this change comes about and when darkness comes an hour earlier in the evenings the same campaign will be carried out by the same people with the same enthusiasm and effectiveness to save lives and limbs.  While the need is not, perhaps, as great because most children would be home before darkness quite a significant number would not, and might otherwise be put in danger.  I hope that all the work done and precautions taken in the past three years will be continued in the future.</P>

Nothing was said in his opening speech about this and the Minister does not clarify it and the speeches made in the Dáil and Seanad on the last occasion appear to be contradictory, so that we were left in some doubt as to what the position was.  We need to consider what amendment, if any, in the licensing hours might be needed.  I ask that Committee Stage be postponed to give us time to consider that.</P>

That is a new development which may or may not be desirable.  We need to consider what, if any, action is required on that.  It emerged only at the beginning of the Minister's closing speech.  We have had no time to consider the matter and would like a little time to consider what action, if any, may be needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is concerned mainly with the extension of the existing social insurance and social assistance schemes to implement the proposals in the Budget <Col N="739" /> for improvements in those schemes and consequential matters.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill is designed to clarify the provisions of the Bill which, because of its technical nature, tends to be difficult to understand in places, and should assist Deputies in their examination of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Budget increases in the field of social assistance will give an extra 40 pence a week to all existing non-contributory old age, blind and widow pensioners and to those in receipt of deserted wife's allowances.  The maximum personal rate of old age, blind and widow's pension and of deserted wife's allowance will then be £4.65 a week.  The increases in the personal rates of pension at the maximum will enable the scale of means and rates of pension to be extended in each case to give an additional rate at the bottom of the scale which will be payable to persons whose means are outside the present limits for pension.</P>
    <P>Orphans' non-contributory pensions will be increased by 25 pence a week and the rates paid to widows and deserted wives in respect of qualified children will be increased by 15 pence in respect of the first and second child and by 40 pence in respect of each other child, thus bringing the payment for each child up to a level 90 pence.</P>
    <P>The improved payments for orphans and for dependent children of widows and deserted wives are intended to assist persons in those classes who have the onerous task of rearing children. The maximum rate payable to a widow or deserted wife with two qualified children will go up from £5.75 a week to £6.45 a week; where there are four children, from £6.75 a week to £8.25 a week and where there are six children the rate will be increased from £7.75 a week to £10.05 a week.  The maximum rate of orphans' non-contributory pension will rise to £2.50 a week in respect of each orphan.</P>
    <P>A modification is being made in the means test for widows and deserted wives who have dependent children and who are employed.  In such a case at present, earnings from personal exertions of up to £39 a year in respect <Col N="740" /> of each qualified child are disregarded in the calculation of means for the purposes of widow's non-contributory pension or deserted wife's allowance. Under the Bill this amount will be increased to £78 a year in respect of each child.  A widow or deserted wife with four children will thus be able to earn £6 a week, instead of £3 a week, without it affecting her title to pension or allowance.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for persons in urban and rural areas are being increased by 35 pence a week for the recipient and by a further 30 pence a week where there is an adult dependent.  The maximum rate will then be £3.95 for a single person and £7.05 for a married couple resident in an urban area.  Outside urban areas the corresponding rates will be £3.65 for a single person and £6.65 for a married couple.  These increases in unemployment assistance will have the effect of automatically extending the means limit for qualification for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>All of the increases and improvements in relation to social assistance will operate from the beginning of August next.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of social insurance benefits and pensions announced in the Budget will come into operation at the beginning of October next.  These will provide an extra 50 pence a week for recipients of old age contributory pension and widow's contributory pension.  Recipients of disability and unemployment benefit, invalidity and retirement pension and maternity allowance will get an extra 45 pence a week.  Orphans will get an extra 30 pence a week in their contributory allowances.  There will also be additional payments for dependants. An extra 35 pence a week will be paid for an adult dependent of an old age, contributory, pensioner and an extra 30 pence for an adult dependant of a retirement or invalidity pensioner or of a recipient of disability or unemployment benefit.  In addition, the amounts paid in respect of dependent children to widows receiving contributory pensions will be increased by 10 pence a week for each of the first two children and by 35 pence for each <Col N="741" /> subsequent child bringing the payments for each child up to £1.</P>
    <P>These increases will make substantial improvements in the payments under the various schemes.</P>
    <P>From October next under the old age, contributory, pension scheme a single pensioner will get £5.50 a week and a married couple £9.35 a week.  A widow without children will get £5.00 a week by way of widow's, contributory, pension.  The personal rates of unemployment and disability benefit, retirement and invalidity pension will then be £4.95 a week and, where there is an adult dependant, the rate will be £8.40 a week.  The increased payments for the qualified children of a widow in receipt of a contributory pension mean that a widow with two children will get £7.00 a week instead of £6.30; a widow with four children, £9.00 a week instead of £7.60 and a widow with six children, £11.00 a week instead of £8.90.</P>
    <P>Certain rates of unemployment benefit which are payable where unemployment continues after 156 days are the same as the maximum rates of unemployment assistance payable in urban areas.  As assistance rates are being increased from the beginning of August next, these particular rates of unemployment benefit are also being increased from then.</P>
    <P>To meet the extra expenditure on the increased rates of benefits and contributory pensions, an increase in the social insurance contributions payable by employers and employees is necessary from the beginning of October next.  The increase proposed in the rates of social insurance contributions which give cover for all benefits, is 19 pence a week, except in the case of agricultural workers where smaller increases are being applied.  Lesser increases are also being applied where some only of the benefits concerned are covered.  The increase of 19 pence in the ordinary rate of men's contribution will be shared by the employer paying ten pence and the employee nine pence and the total contribution will then be £1.72 a week of which 87 pence will be borne by the employer and 85 pence by the employee.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the increases and <Col N="742" /> improvements in the general social insurance system provided for in the Bill, it is proposed also to improve the benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increases proposed are 50 pence in the rates of the main weekly paid benefits and allowances with proportionate increases in other payments.  All benefits under this scheme are met out of the occupational injuries fund which is financed by contributions paid by employers only.  It will not be necessary on this occasion to increase these contributions to meet the cost of the increases.</P>
    <P>The overall weekly employment contribution payable in respect of men in ordinary industrial or commercial employment will, from October, 1971, be £1.88 made up of £1.72 in respect of social insurance, 11 pence in respect of occupational injuries insurance and five pence in respect of redundancy payments. Of this the employer will pay £1.01 and the employee 87 pence.  In the case of women in such employment, the overall weekly contribution will be £1.76 made up of £1.64 for social insurance, eight pence for occupational injuries insurance and four pence for redundancy.  Of this the employer will pay 96 pence and the employee 80 pence.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rate of voluntary contribution covering widows', contributory, pensions only will be five pence making it 37 pence and the increase in the contribution which covers old age and widows', contributory, pensions, retirement pension and death grant will be ten pence making it 91 pence.</P>
    <P>A table showing the present and proposed rates of contribution appears in the explanatory memorandum.  As Deputies will already know, the Health Contributions Bill at present before the House provides for weekly health contributions of 15 pence to be collected by way of the social insurance stamp for those classes of employees to be covered by the provisions of that Bill. This 15 pence will be additional to the rates of contribution I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Apart from dealing with the Budget proposals and matters consequential on those proposals, the Bill proposes to deal with a further matter which has <Col N="743" /> been the cause of some concern in recent years and which has already been the subject of much discussion in the House.  This is the position of the employee who, through no fault of his own, may lose benefit by reason of his employer's failure to pay employment contributions for which he is liable in respect of him.  As I have already indicated in reply to questions in the matter, steps have been taken by way of regulations under existing powers to enable employment contributions to be credited to an insured person where contributions properly payable have not been paid and the failure to pay is shown not to have been with the consent or connivance of, or attributable to any negligence on the part of the insured person.</P>
    <P>These regulations go part of the way towards enabling an insured person to satisfy the contribution conditions for benefit where there has been failure on the part of the employer to pay contributions but they do not solve all the problems.  If, for instance, any of the basic conditions which can only be satisfied by contributions which have been paid are not satisfied, credited contributions are of no avail.  It is proposed in the Bill, therefore, to take power to enable regulations to be made which will allow contributions which have not been paid to be treated as having been paid subject to safeguards to ensure that in cases where there has been collusion between employee and employer in the non-payment of contributions the employee will not benefit. The concession is designed for the protection of employees and it is not proposed that the treatment of unpaid contributions as having been paid should remove any part of the liability of an employer to pay these contributions and to make good any benefit lost as a result of his default. There is provision in the Bill, therefore, to ensure that any employer who fails to pay contributions or who pays contributions late will be liable to pay to the Social Insurance Fund the amount of benefit which would have been lost but for the treatment of unpaid contributions as having been paid or the treatment of late paid contributions as <Col N="744" /> having been paid in time.  Such amounts will then come within the scope of the existing powers to recover amounts due to the fund by legal process. In addition the Bill provides for the imposition, on summary conviction, of heavier fines and, at the discretion of the court, terms of imprisonment or both fines and imprisonment, on employers who fail to comply with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts regarding the payment of contributions.</P>
    <P>As in previous years the position will arise in August next, when non-contributory pensions are increased, where for the period up to the end of September next, when contributory pensions are increased, cases may occur where the non-contributory pension to which a pensioner might be entitled would be temporarily more favourable than the corresponding contributory pension which he holds.  It was never the intention that the option which was given to contributory pensioners by the 1966 Act to switch to non-contributory pensions where it would be to their advantage, should operate for very short periods and there is provision in this Bill as in previous years Bills to prevent such switching where the advantage would only be temporary.  The right of pensioners to switch where the advantage would be permanent will remain.</P>
    <P>To conclude I will summarise the cost of the various proposals in the Bill.  On the social assistance side there is £2,350,000 for old age and blind pensions, £548,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions, £89,000 for deserted wife's allowances and £796,000 for unemployment assistance, the total cost being £3,783,000 in a full year, all of which will fall on the Exchequer.  The gross cost of improvements on the social insurance side will be £6,709,000 in a full year, of which the increases in contribution rates will provide some £5,446,000.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending this Bill to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister has just said, is intended, in <Col N="745" /> the main, to give effect to improvements in the schemes of social assistance and social insurance announced in the Budget statement of 28th April, 1971.  It also provides for consequential matters including increases in social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>My first reaction to this Bill would be that of many social welfare recipients namely asking the question: what does this Bill do for them?  Does it do anything more for them than hold their incomes at the same level they were at before the cost of living rose?  Every miserable increase that has been granted to social welfare recipients since 1957 has been swallowed up by rising prices and in too many cases they are less well off than they were before in real money terms.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that, with the introduction of this Bill, they still have to pinch and scrape to make ends meet.  The increases of 40p and 50p which have been granted are practically eroded by the spiralling cost of living.  My concern and that of everybody on this side of the House is for those deprived sections of our people who, unfortunately, have to depend on social insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me tackle, first of all, the problem of the widows in this country.  The Minister will remember that we in Fine Gael brought in a motion just before Budget day asking that the lot of widows would be considerably improved. We had hoped then, from the reception the Minister gave our motion, that a substantial increase would be given to that deprived section of our people in the Budget.  Not only had we hoped for that but the widows themselves were looking forward to the 8th April and the speech of the Minister for Finance.  They, like us, were sorely disappointed.  It was then my belief, as it is still, having consulted with the widows and the other people in my constituency, that no section of the community would feel in any way aggrieved if in the Minister's Budget there was imposed some taxation that would give some real relief to the widows of Ireland.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Fianna Fáil Government seem <Col N="746" /> to be slack in their social conscience. The widows' case is a just and moral one.  How can the Minister, in these days of spiralling costs, expect them to live on something around 30p per week?</P>
    <P>Under this Bill a contributory widow with two children will be in receipt of £7 per week, that is, £1 per day.  That means, in effect, that each of the three people will have to live on 33p per day.  In the case of a non-contributory widow with two children, she will be entitled to £6.45, or 30p per person per day.  Do we public representatives in 1971 believe and think it right that any adult person should be expected to live on 30p per day? I know that the taxpayers who provide the money for us to distribute are sorely disappointed that something better has not been done.  There is a social conscience here and the entire community are asking themselves the straight question: &ldquo;What are we doing for those people?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking on our motion earlier, Deputy O'Donnell and I said we did not wish to overstate the case of the widows.  Every Deputy here knows that there is a limit to the public purse but we are also convinced that that section are the most deprived and they still have the same complaint as they had when our motion was unanimously accepted.  I appeal to the Minister on their behalf to do some real thinking on this and I press on him and his Cabinet colleagues that a new deal for widows is called for.</P>
    <P>In regard to other sections of social welfare beneficiaries, the 40p to 50p increase is not in keeping with the increase in the cost of living.  When the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement spoke of the good this would do, many social welfare recipients who had read it or heard it or saw it on television thought there was something real in store for them.  Like me, they now believe that their position after August will be just as bad as it was in 1970.  They believe, like we do, that too low a priority is being placed on reforms in the social welfare code. Increases are not being given to compensate for the increases in the cost of living and I appeal to the Minister to <Col N="747" /> give a higher priority to the job of tackling the social problem in an enthusiastic and genuine way.  The wealth of the country should be distributed more equitably.  It should be used for the benefit of the whole community with special regard for the deprived and the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>Previous Ministers as well as the present Minister seem to have taken as their criterion how little rather than how much they would give.  In 1971 we should leave that behind, especially in view of the imminence of EEC entry.  In EEC countries social welfare benefits are much more generous and I appeal to the Minister to make a real change in the code here in preparation for EEC membership.  I have no doubt the social welfare classes have the Minister's sympathy but apparently he is unable to convince the Minister for Finance and his other Cabinet colleagues of the genuineness of their case.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the statement made in the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance that the Government this year decided to improve the lot of widows, deserted wives, orphans and others.  I think that what I have been saying must convince the Minister that the reverse is the case.  While on this subject, there is still this annual complaint that although new taxation is collected almost immediately, about the third week in April, social welfare improvements are not paid until the first week in August in some cases and the first week in October in others.  This causes great annoyance to the recipients and it should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Civil Service to devise some way of paying the improved benefits earlier.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about children's allowances.  Nothing has been done in regard to them this year. In my study of EEC countries in this respect I have found that children's allowances in this country are very far behind those in several European countries.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that section 8 of this Bill provides authority for the making of regulations to enable contributions which an employer has failed <Col N="748" /> to pay, and where the insured person is innocent of any complicity in the failure to pay, to be treated as having been paid in order that the insured person will not suffer loss of benefit. All of us are glad to see this section because many people have suffered in the past in this respect.  During the past 12 months I brought to notice a case in my constituency where a factory went to the wall and where many employees suffered greatly because their cards had not been stamped properly.  One point I should like to make on this is whether there is any degree of retrospection.  During the past 12 or 18 months many factories of one kind or another closed down and left many employees in trouble.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that there will be retrospection to cover such cases.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House further on this Bill.  We will have a chance later in the week of debating the Estimate and I do not think it is fair to the Minister or to the House to delay too long.  All I want to say is that we regard the increased benefits as entirely inadequate and that we suggest the Minister should put on his thinking cap and remember that Ireland is crying out for a change in the social welfare code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Government are adepts at using arithmetic in the pretence that by using it they will improve something. The fact is that there is only one improvement in the Bill and it is to be found in section 8.  The rest of the Bill is a disimprovement because it does not equal the increase in the cost of living in any respect.  So far as section 8 is an improvement I welcome the Bill, but there is no other reason for welcoming it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of legislation here adopted&mdash;legislation by reference&mdash;is extremely objectionable.  The work should be done in a straightforward fashion instead of referring back to various other Acts: Section 52 of the Act of 1952, the Second Schedule to the Act of 1952, and so on.  Section 15 is a lot of mumbo-jumbo, instead of doing the job in a straightforward way, the way it is done in Canada and the <Col N="749" /> United States where the document is a unit, and where any literate person who can understand ordinary English can understand what is being said.</P>
    <P>This method of legislation is a stunt to create experts and it does create experts because any ordinary person has the greatest difficulty in understanding it even where the subject matter is as simple as this.  Lawyers are said to love it but I have never yet met a lawyer who is all that fond of it.  In many cases it makes for a great improvement in their incomes.  The sooner we depart from this method of legislation the better&mdash;this continuous building-up and building-up until eventally you have a mixum-gatherum morass through which no person can go without immense effort, the kind of effort which no person should be asked to make.</P>
    <P>Even the cost of living index which, of course, does not reflect correctly at all the changes in the actual cost of living, showed a 3 per cent increase in the three months from February to May and that is a rate of 12 per cent per year.  All through this Bill there is an increase of 10 per cent in the benefits.  I see that £4.50 becomes £4.95 and £7.65 becomes £8.40, but £3.60 becomes £3.90.  That is for young people.  We always cheat young people if we get a chance at all, particularly in Government Departments.  In the case of certain married women, the £3.60 becomes £3.90, that is, 30p on £3.50, or one-twelfth, or about 8 per cent.  It is only two-thirds of the increase in the cost of living.  Therefore there is the usual dirty cheating where young people are concerned.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances are not mentioned at all.  I will forecast this.  There will be no maintenance of the rate of children's allowances until the next election is looming up, the same as there was no improvement in them for years until the 1969 election was looming up.  Our rate of children's allowances for ordinary families is half the rate in Britain and, as I said before in this House, in Britain it is half the rate in France and in Italy.  Any pretence that we are worse off than the people in France and Italy is just <Col N="750" /> poppycock and mumbo-jumbo&mdash;the kind of nonsense that the Government put across in connection with their campaign to drag us into Europe by the hair of the head.  I suspect that the people will give them a very rough answer to that question when they get the opportunity, judging by the development of the indices on which the Government apparently place so much reliability.</P>
    <P>On the other hand <i>pro rata</i> the contributions are going up a great deal more than 10 per cent.  The contribution is going up by 19p a week and this is apart from the other 15p in the pretence Health Bill that was brought in here the other day and which has not yet gone through the House.  That is a total increase of 34p a week.  What is that on the present rate of contribution? It is much more like 25 per cent than 10 per cent.  Since the Government are wasting money all over the place they have to collect it from the people who cannot defend themselves, while they pander to the legal evaders of ordinary income tax.  We will be dealing with that later on today.  They are pandering all the time to people who have found loopholes in the Income Tax Acts and they will be allowed to continue to evade tax under section 4 of the Finance Bill which will be coming before the House.</P>
    <P>Do the Government not realise that, for example, the overall contribution in the case of women will be £1.76 as compared with, I think, £2.01 in the case of men?  This is an immensely greater contribution <i>pro rata</i> to what they earn than the contribution which is made on behalf of men.  We all know what the ratio of women's incomes is in this country to men's incomes. Women are extremely lucky if they earn two-thirds of what a man earns and yet they are to pay nine-tenths of the contribution for a man in social welfare stamps.  Of course this is intolerable. It is inhuman.  It would not be put up with in any properly civilised country just the same as the rates of children's allowances here would not be put up with in any properly civilised country.</P>
    <P>This proves something that we all <Col N="751" /> know in our hearts, although the Government pretend it does not exist at all.  It proves that the people who are not able to defend themselves will be kicked around.  This is done continuously and then we hear Deputy P.J. Burke talking on the Budget about improvements in social welfare benefits. He repeats that over and over again.  There are no improvements in social welfare benefits this year, none whatever, except in this Bill in section 8 which is an improvement in the machinery of operating the thing but not an improvement in the overall approach at all.  In circumstances in which the Government are wasting money and borrowing in all kinds of territories and getting the country deeper and deeper into the mire every day that passes, they will not even preserve, for people who are already extremely badly treated&mdash;and I refer in particular to the lower paid worker who has a large family&mdash;the value of the children's allowances.</P>
    <P>There has been no increase in children's allowances in this country since 1969 and the cost of living has gone up by about 30 per cent in those 2½ years.  The Minister asked me would I agree to a means test the last time we were discussing this question of children's allowances.  Since I am always, like Deputy Andrews, a reasonable man, I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I do not know.  I am not at all clear about the matter.  I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because, to improve children's allowances, I would be prepared to go to any length the Minister wants me to go, provided he improves them.  In fact, I do not even want him to improve them.  All I want him to do is maintain them at what they were in 1969.  The Minister and his Department know well that they are not being maintained and the reason why they are not is perfectly obvious: it is because the Government have never wanted to give them an increase worth talking about.  The amount is quoted at a rate per month where every other social welfare benefit or allowance is quoted at a rate per week and the reason why it is quoted at a rate per month is because the amount would look so shameful if it <Col N="752" /> were quoted at a rate per week.  It is quoted per month to put a veneer on it.  It is outrageous that small children should be in a state of semi-starvation because parents' wages are inadequate. It is outrageous that they should be inadequately clothed and fed, not to speak of their having not even the smallest amenities.  I used think the Minister for Social Welfare had a heart.  I thought I saw some evidence of it at times but he seems to have got into the hands of some group of roughnecks who have trussed him up so that he is unable to do anything.  He achieves nothing.  He has a rope around his neck and the roughnecks have strung him up.</P>
    <P>Let me put it bluntly: this Bill is just one degree better than leaving the thing as it was and making no effort at all to meet the decline in the value of money. It is just one degree better.  If I had any confidence in the cost of living index produced by the Central Statistics Office I could say this Bill is of some use, but I have no confidence in the cost of living index produced by the Central Statistics Office.  I demonstrated that conclusively in this House, when, in 1968, they showed an increase of 4.5 per cent in the cost of living; wages went up by 9 per cent, import prices by 11 per cent and export prices by 10 per cent and they calculated that the cost of living had gone up by only 4½ per cent.  How could anyone have any confidence in them after that? What cross-checking they attempted to do I do not know, but they showed themselves up as being a lot of fiddlers with figures, fiddlers who did nothing at all to make a proper effort to produce a genuine cost of living index.  The cost of living index from February to May of this year showed an increase of 3 per cent, 1 per cent per month; I am convinced it did not show the real depreciation in the value of money. Ask any woman, as has been done before, what the increase has been. There is a figure here of £1 per week as the cost of keeping a child.  I met a woman the other day, a most abstemious woman, and she told me she never buys a steak, or anything of that sort, for herself and she said it costs her £5 a week for food.  She is living by herself.  Does anybody suggest <Col N="753" /> that a growing child does not want as much food as an adult?  Of course he does.  He wants more food.  Yet, we have in this Bill £1 per week as the amount for keeping a child.</P>
    <P>The Government, by backing inflation, have deliberately brought about the present situation.  I have said that inflation is a good old nag provided you do not take the horse out and race him every week.  It is exactly this the present Government are doing and have been doing; they have been taking the old nag out and they have raced the unfortunate animal to the point at which he is only skin and bone.  The further inflation goes the worse the situation becomes and the more rapidly the value of money decreases.  Not even the efforts of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Employers will save the Government from the consequences of their own foolishness and their own crazy conduct. Nothing can save them now because inflation has got completely out of hand.  This effort here is simply stopping holes in the dike with utterly inadequate means.  It is not an improvement and any suggestion that it is an improvement is entirely false.  I do not know if Deputy Barry was right in sympathising with the Minister and suggesting that he thought the Minister would do better.</P>

One or two old warhorses, like Deputy Paddy Burke, get up here and tell us how good the Government are and what they have done and say that we on this side of the House vote against improvements for the poor people, and so on.  We have all this <Col N="754" /> kind of nonsense.  It is time somebody tackled this cod system we have at the moment.  I believe we had this year so far the highest rate of inflation in the western world.  We are rapidly reaching the stage at which ordinary workers with large families will be unable to feed their children.  If I could commend the Minister for this Bill, I would do so, but I cannot commend him.  This Bill is a cheat.  Everything in the Bill, with the exception of section 8, is a cheat on the people in relation to whom there is a pretence of improvement.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Any measure designed to improve the lot of the grossly underprivileged classes is to be welcomed.  This measure does not really make any serious attempt to improve the standard of living of the social welfare classes, if one can apply the term &ldquo;standard of living&rdquo; to people in the lower income group who are really only existing.</P>
      <P>It is true, as other speakers have said, that the improvements of 40p, 35p and 30p have not caught up with the increase in the cost of living. People who are in a position to make themselves felt and have strong bargaining powers have money to spend on luxuries and semi-luxuries. It is a fact that money is flying around in certain circles.  This, however, only accentuates the position of the unfortunate people who are living on social welfare benefits, non-contributory old age pensions, unemployment assistance, disabled persons allowances and that sort of thing.  We would not be doing our duty if we did not register a protest at the failure of the Government to improve the lot of these people.  It is true that year after year they get what used be shillings and now are pence, but this is not cushioning them against the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In previous years the Government have engaged in the shabby practice of introducing two Budgets and one Social Welfare Bill.  The two Budgets impose taxation.  The Budget in the spring imposes taxation all round and increase the cost of living.  At this <Col N="755" /> time of year we have the Social Welfare Bill which increases social welfare payments by a small amount from August or October on the basis that that will protect the social welfare classes from the spring Budget.  In two years out of three this Bill was followed by another Budget in the autumn and by a post office Budget. This year it has been followed by the Health Contribution Bill.  All these make inroads into the social welfare benefits and yet we shall have no further Social Welfare Bill until this time next year.  That is something to be deplored.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals extensively with social welfare and I think I am in order in referring to the Employment Period Order which took away unemployment assistance from men in rural Ireland from April until November.  I need not go into the history of that order in detail; it has been dealt with fairly fully in this House.  All I would say is that it was not accidental, it was deliberate.  The Book of Estimates provided for a saving of £1½ million under the heading of social welfare and the intention was to deprive unemployed men all over the country of unemployment assistance.  Furthermore the circular that was sent out, which I have already put on the records of this House, from the Department of Social Welfare clearly stated that the Employment Period Order this year was a different sort of order from any other order because it applied, without exception, to all men without dependants whether they were urban or rural dwellers.  That famous circular was sent to every exchange in the country.</P>
    <P>The Government wobbled and waffled and by the first amendment order eliminated urban dwellers and under further pressure eliminated men in rural Ireland who are over 50 years of age.</P>
    <P>But what about the men under 50 years of age?  What about the people who are not capable of working, who were never capable of working, who have to fight their battle between the Department of Social Welfare and the health authority investigation officers who contend that they are able to work <Col N="756" /> and that the employment order applies to them?  During either the discussion on this shameful order or during the Budget, and the Minister can contradict me if I am wrong, an assurance was given that some legislation would be introduced to deal with the problem people I am talking about and, in fact, a special scheme in lieu of social assistance or unemployment assistance would be introduced but we have not heard one word about that legislation yet.</P>
    <P>I put a supplementary question to the Minister about this in the last few weeks and I was told &ldquo;Yes, it is on its way&rdquo;.  A Bill dealing with the health contributions has been brought in.  Its principal object is to collect £7 a year from certain farmers and 15p a week from people who pay social welfare contributions but what about the other legislation which was supposed to be brought in to ease the lot of the people deprived of unemployment assistance by the Employment Period Order?  We can only tell people who write pathetic letters to us saying they have been cut off the dole, that we have recommended them to the health board for a disabled person's allowance or home assistance which is the old poor law assistance and the lowest form of assistance that can be given to anybody. The Minister knows that there are many of these people who have to fight very hard to get home assistance in lieu of unemployment assistance.  We heard about the tatie hokers in Scotland. The Minister was able to tell me in the House a couple of weeks ago, when I was making the case that the employment period order would force these unfortunates to take up this undesirable employment in Scotland, that not as many had gone there this year as in previous years.  I should like to be satisfied that this is so and if it is so it is due to all the publicity that this type of employment got.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister or the Minister for Health or whoever is to be responsible for this promised Bill to deal with persons who have come to the working age, we will call it, and have not reached 50 and who are hit by this employment period order, to introduce legislation to deal with them <Col N="757" /> and with people who are not able to work, who are mentally or semi-mentally retarded, physically unfit for work or mentally unsuited for work, and to give them an allowance by way of right instead of home assistance which they have to fight for and which they very often do not get, who have to queue up at the town hall, courthouse or dispensary and be questioned by the home assistance officer before they can get £1 or a couple of pounds a week.  If such a measure is introduced, as far as this party is concerned it will get a welcome reception and speedy run through this House.</P>
    <P>I, like other Deputies who have spoken, want to welcome section 8 of the Bill which makes provision for payment of insurance benefits to employees of employers who have failed to stamp their cards.  I should like to say that I am glad that this amendment has been brought in and I take some credit for drawing the Minister's attention to the need for this. Over the past couple of years, we had examples of this.  There was one example of it on the Cavan border in County Westmeath, examples of it in Cavan and glaring examples of where firms went out of business in Monaghan during the year and unfortunate persons were deprived of their social welfare unemployment benefit because their cards were not stamped.</P>
    <P>I and other members of this party campaigned in the House in favour of that and I was, therefore, rather surprised to see reference in one of the newspapers that only members of one party had called for this amendment. I should like it to go on record that certainly members of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;Deputy Barry, myself and others&mdash;have been pointing out this abuse and calling for legislation to remedy it and I am glad that section 8 is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Dealing with section 8 the Minister says that regulations will be introduced to avoid collusion between employees and employers.  It is only right that that provision should be made but there are a number of employees in the State who do not realise the importance of insisting that their insurance contributions under the Social Welfare Acts <Col N="758" /> are paid.  When young or middle-aged and healthy they are inclined to collude sometimes with their employers and maybe accept slightly larger wages and avoid paying the stamp but there should be a campaign by way of advertisements in employment exchanges or notices in the papers or notices printed on insurance cards emphasising for employees the necessity of insisting that these contributions be paid regularly and their stamps being in order. It is not now but maybe in ten or 15 years, that these people will be gradually&mdash;and &ldquo;gradually&rdquo; is the operative word&mdash;moving into a sphere in which they will be entitled to better benefits but unless they insist now on their cards being stamped they may be deprived of contributory old age pension in later years or a disablement pension or sickness benefit.  That should be brought home to the employees and they should be encouraged to insist on their rights.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other little things that I want to deal with, matters I have raised with the Minister from time to time both in the House and in correspondence.  One is something that I will continue to campaign for and that is payment of non-contributory old age pension to unfortunate parents who were left here in loneliness and who want to go to reside with their sons and daughters in England.  I shall urge strongly that the Minister should put an amendment into this Bill amending the law so as to enable him to pay non-contributory old age pension to parents who, as I say, are living here, certainly in loneliness, because they do not want to go as paupers to their daughters and sons-in-law in England but who, if they had the £4 or £4 10s a week, would go as independent people.  That is being denied to these people on the basis that it is not possible to enforce the means test in England.  I do not know how some old age pensioner here is suddenly to transform his income from nil to £500 or £600 a year unless he wins the pools or the sweep.  They are beyond earning.</P>
    <P>I quote from a letter I got on 28th June, addressed to myself.  I shall not give the name of the person.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Thank you so much for having <Col N="759" /> taken the trouble to reply so nicely to my letter of earlier in the year re the possibility of non-contributory old age pension being paid to old age pensioners who may be obliged through infirmity to seek the help and love of their families who have emigrated and settled in England.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I heard on TV that some consultations were in progress between Northern Ireland and British officials and our own Department of Social Welfare about reciprocal arrangements on certain subjects but I never heard any follow up to that and so do not know whether anything happened about non-contributory old age pensioners and I am anxious to know as owing to continued infirmity of my wife and myself there is a possibility that we may have to leave here before the winter comes in and the old age pension would be a great help to us if we could have it over there.</P>
    <P>That is typical of the type of letter one gets and the type of representations that are made, I am sure, to every Deputy.  This is something that is peculiar to this country.  This country has been blistered with emigration down the years and there is still a substantial amount of emigration and many children, particularly daughters, go over to England and they marry decent Englishmen and Irishmen over there and many of them would be delighted to take their aged parents to live there with them but the parents do not want to go as paupers, without anything to come in even for pocket money.</P>
    <P>Why cannot there be a bit of original thinking in the Department and with the Minister to amend the legislation in order to deal with this national problem, and a national problem it is?  It flows from the curse of emigration.  The young people go away.  They settle abroad.  The old people, their parents, grow old at home and either remain in isolation and loneliness in out of the way parts of the country or are condemned to institutions for the aged in this country, at public expense, whereas they could be in England.  England is not all that <Col N="760" /> vast a country and the numbers would not run into thousands.  We have enough inspectors of one sort and another at home and it should not be beyond our capabilities to employ another couple of inspectors, if the Minister thought fit, and let them go and visit these people in England if they are prepared to give their address. I have been harping on this matter for years and will continue to do so because I feel strongly about it and I do not believe there is justification, good, bad or indifferent, for refusing to do what I request.</P>
    <P>I realise that the deserted wife allowance has been in operation only for a short time but the Minister should have made an amendment in this Bill following representations recently made by me.  When the deserted wives' allowance came into operation a woman I knew, who was then about 45 years of age, received the allowance because she had one son.  The son is now 18 years of age and has begun work as a trainee.  Now, because this woman has not a qualified child, after having the deserted wives' allowance since it came into operation she finds herself cut off from this allowance. She will have to wait until she is 50 years of age before she can qualify.</P>
    <P>That is not the end of the story. This woman has been hit on the double.  She was employed in a local convent which runs a secondary school and a national school.  She had social welfare stamps fixed on her card while employed there.  She is told now she cannot continue to get the deserted wives' allowance because her son is 18 years of age and she is not 50 years of age.  She is also told from the same Department that the stamps which she received while she was employed in the convent do not qualify for unemployment benefit because apparently the work she was doing is regarded as domestic work.</P>
    <P>How in the name of goodness can work which entails charring in a secondary school and a primary school be regarded as domestic work and not qualify this person for unemployment benefit?  I have first class knowledge of this case.  I ask the Minister why a woman who qualifies for a deserted <Col N="761" /> wives' allowance should have it discontinued when her son reaches 18 years of age and she is not aged 50. In most cases the woman will have reached 50 years of age.  The Minister should amend the legislation to cover those people.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the female relief allowance which is given for a person looking after an old age pensioner. The regulations need to be amended to enable a more liberal interpretation to be put on them.  The Minister knows the case I am talking about.  It is that of an old lady living alone with a girl in her early twenties.  This girl was reared by the old lady from birth.  She never lived in any other house or with any other person.  She was born and reared in this house and regards the old lady as her mother.  Her real mother is dead and her father is institutionalised on a long-term basis.  The old age pensioner is over 80 years of age and is looked after by this young girl but she is not regarded as a female relative within the scope of these regulations. Surely that is a very narrow-minded approach to a social problem.</P>
    <P>I know hard cases make bad law but this is a very hard case.  This girl's father killed her mother and he is in an institution.  The girl has lived with her grandmother all her life but the cold, calculating people in the Department of Social Welfare say she is not a female relative within the meaning of the Act.  Surely she is an adopted child, whether she is legally adopted or not.  This sort of narrow-minded thinking in the Department really annoys people.  If the people in the Department had a heart instead of a stone they would come to the conclusion that this old lady is <i>in loco parentis</i> to the girl and should qualify for the allowance.  I put down a Parliamentary question about this case but, unfortunately, I was not present when the Minister answered it.  I also put down the question in a different way so the Minister knows the case I have in mind.  I join with other speakers who have said that the social thinking in this country is such at the present time that if the Minister were prepared to do the decent thing by the social welfare classes the taxpayers would not begrudge <Col N="762" /> paying extra taxation and this House would certainly be glad to vote the money for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is mainly to improve the present rate of social welfare allowances by 40p for non-contributory old age pensioners and 50p for contributory old age pensioners. Of course, we should not lose sight of the fact that the increases given are outpaced by increases in the cost of living.  Those increases will be implemented next month in the case of the non-contributory pension and in October in the case of the contributory pension but their living standards will not be better than they were 12 months ago because the cost of living has increased by much more than the allowances which those people receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sure by 1971 when a Bill such as this Social Welfare Bill was brought before the House we would have some section in it dealing with the retirement age for old age pensions.  I have been a member of this House for 20 years but during that time the qualifying age for old age pensions has remained the same.  Why not give the pension to people who are excluded from receiving anything at 65 years of age?  Civil servants get pensions at 65 and they do not have to go out in the weather to work like farmers.  They are not like shopkeepers working on the side of the streets who have to keep their businesses going when they are aged over 65 years of age in order to get a living.  They get a pension when they reach the age of 65 and, in many cases, the pension they receive is almost equivalent to the salary they had been earning.  Why should those people who are outside the social welfare code be deprived of a pension until they reach the age of 70?  I am not casting any reflection on those people who enjoy comfortable and sheltered positions in this country. They are very fortunate but we must consider those who are not so fortunate. I am thinking in particular of small shopkeepers.  Everybody knows the problems and difficulties with which these people must contend but when a shopkeeper reaches the age of 70 he will have even more difficulty in obtaining an old-age pension.  First, he must satisfy the Department of Social <Col N="763" /> Welfare that he has transferred his business to a member of his family for a purpose other than qualification for an old age pension.  If he does not so satisfy the Department, he will not get any pension.  Secondly, he must submit to the Department receipts for all his purchases and on the basis of these, his profits are calculated.  If the calculation indicates that his yearly profit is more than £260.75, he will not qualify for a pension.  He is told that he has an income of more than £5 per week and that he can live on that.  He is told that he is not in the group of citizens who enjoy big pensions.  It is time that the law in this regard was changed.</P>
    <P>If it is found that a shopkeeper had an income of less than £260.75 but more than £247.75 he would get a pension.  The Minister has seen to it that such a person would not be deprived but according to this Bill the pension in such a case would be 40p a week.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, the people in the Department of Social Welfare, with a few notable exceptions, have hearts of stone.  They tell us what is the law and that the place for advocating changes is in this House.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to widows and other people depending on social welfare leaves much to be desired but I shall leave those categories aside for a moment and concentrate on the self-employed, whether they be shopkeepers, farmers, carpenters or any other category.  These underprivileged sections of the community should be brought into line with the more privileged ones.  With the exception of Norway where the age is 70, every country in Western Europe has a lower pension qualifying age than ours and Norway is reducing the age to 67 from the beginning of next year.  This is the only country in which a person who is not in the privileged classes must continue to labour until he is 70 before qualifying for a pension and he will qualify then only after intensive investigation on the part of the Department. If the Department are satisfied that the person has no means whatsoever and that he has no say in the house in which he happens to be living, he will, under this Bill, receive a <Col N="764" /> pension of £4.65 a week.  However, this figure is scaled down until the figure of 40p a week is reached.  Because of the increases in the cost of living the increases given each year to social welfare recipients are ineffective.  In fact, the allowances are miserable.  I know that money does not grow on trees but we must provide for those who depend on social welfare.  Organised labour has powerful pressure groups that threaten to hold the country up to ransom if they do not get what they ask but the particular categories about which I am speaking have no such pressure groups and, consequently, they are treated with contempt.  Those who are unorganised, those self-employed people who have no unions, organisations or associations to look after them, will have to wait until they have one leg in the grave before they &ldquo;may&rdquo; qualify for an allowance.</P>
    <P>In talking about the qualifying age for pensions we must remember that many of our people when they attain 70 years are incapacitated.  At 70 every second person suffers from an incapacity. A person labouring under such an incapacity has not got much time to enjoy the £4 or £5 from the Department.  I want to say to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and to the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Geoghegan, the two men in charge of social welfare: &ldquo;Pull up your socks. Your job is to press the Government&mdash; the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet in general&mdash;and get justice and fair play for the people who must labour on until they are 70 years of age before qualifying for an old age pension.&rdquo;  Are they not contributing as much in their own way to the State as any of us here?  As any of our public servants?  As any of our workers in private employment where pensions are available at 65?  I think they are and I hope that when the 1972 Social Welfare Bill is introduced there will be a section in it providing for a lowering of the age limit.  I have tried to make myself as clear as possible and repeated something that I have said here before.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to people in the farming or business community who marry late in life.  On reaching the age of 70 they may have four or five relatively <Col N="765" /> young children.  There is no possibility of assigning the farm or premises to a member of the family because they are too young and hence the applicant must bear the full burden of the means assessed by the Department of Social Welfare.  As this document will show a pensioner with two qualified children, if he is earning £265.75 a year, or £5 a week, is entitled to a pension of only £1.90 a week.  That is wrong and something that should be changed.</P>
    <P>Contributory pensioners are entitled to their pensions at 65.  I am very pleased that that position obtains. They were known as servants in the past.  I am glad to see they are now classified as officers.  I am glad they are getting their pension at 65 and getting it without a means test.</P>
    <P>There are widows' associations growing up around the country and I suppose a share of pressure will be applied.  I do not see any great harm in having such associations for widows because I have had occasion to refer to their position here time and again.  Let us take the case of the widow of a farmer or shopkeeper whose husband dies leaving her, a relatively young woman, with four or five children.  If the farm or shop is any size at all she will not qualify for a pension The position changes completely when the husband dies.  While he is alive he is in almost all cases the person who does the work, who formulates policy.  When he is gone and the wife left with four or five children she cannot carry on as her husband did.  The position is completely different.  I see no justification for having such a rigid means test as obtains in regard to widows.</P>
    <P>The widow in receipt of a non-contributory pension is allowed to earn £39 in respect of each dependent child without having it calculated against her as means.  In 1971 £39 is a very small sum.  If she has three children she is allowed to earn £117 for the year, slightly more than £2 per week. Why not give a widow much more latitude if she has to go out to work to earn money to keep her children?  Why not allow a widow with a non-contributory <Col N="766" /> pension to earn more money? Is not the income tax assessment sufficient, if she would be liable to it, without having this sort of means test?  I want to bring home to the Minister that allowing a widow to earn only £39 in respect of dependent children before having income assessed against her is completely out of line in this day and age.  She is allowed only £100 for herself and anything in excess of a capital value of £100 is assessed against her.  The Minister should address himself to those questions in regard to the position of widows who are left with young families.  The regulations applying to non-contributory pensions are too rigid and should be modified.</P>
    <P>There is a great difference now when all cases are determined behind closed doors.  I was a Member of the House when that was not the case.  I remember when we were able to go to Lord Edward Street and meet some decent men who were then in charge of pensions appeals.  One could meet them face to face and discuss with them any personal factors bearing on the applicant's case.  At least you would come away with the assurance that you had sympathetic consideration and that the scales were weighted in favour of the applicant.  That happens no longer. When Fianna Fáil came back to power in 1957 they changed that.  In fact one of these officials and one of the finest public servants we ever had, had to move to Canada.  He was harassed because he was supposed to be consorting with Opposition Deputies and was possibly too favourably disposed towards answering their correspondence or holding discussions with them.  That is well known; I am sure the Minister knows it.  This man was harassed by the Fianna Fáil administration; he was pushed over to Children's Allowances and finally he left and had to emigrate to Canada.  He was a fine, decent man and if we had this type of person in the Department at present, perhaps, we would not have too much to complain about.</P>
    <P>I am referring to what happened in the past in regard to the system for determining appeals and the great changes that have taken place.  The <Col N="767" /> system was perfect.  If it was necessary, you had no problem in meeting the judge, sitting down with him at the table and going over the case from A to Z and putting all aspects of it before him.  He is now an anonymous person.  According to my subsequent inquiries only a limited number of Deputies had access to the appeals officer.  I am not saying I know the position at present but a limited number of Deputies continued to have this access.  Whether they were Government Deputies who sought that right or not I do not know.  I think I am within my rights in mentioning the big change that has taken place in the system. This was mentioned by a previous speaker.  I had better acquaintance with the personnel of the Social Welfare Department then than I have now.  I found them to be very decent men.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick in regard to some of the officials there at present.</P>

      <P>What the Chair is concerned about is that the Minister is responsible to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am bringing the matter to the notice of the Minister. I am at a big disadvantage here in contributing to this debate.  If I brought in files of correspondence from people who were unfairly treated I could clearly illustrate what I have in mind but it would be unfair to applicants to discuss their private affairs in this House with the attendant danger of publicity and identification.  I am <Col N="768" /> sure the decision will be changed, if not by this Government then by the next, in a couple of these cases where the decision was outrageous.  One was an old age pension case and the other was in respect of a prescribed relative allowance.</P>
      <P>In regard to unemployment assistance regulations and the area to which the order applies in the western counties, I have raised this matter on a few occasions with the Minister. Parts of County Cork have been discriminated against.  I got a map for the Minister to peruse.  It sets out the part of County Cork which is deemed to be within the 12 western counties and that is the part of County Cork to which I think this unemployment assistance order should be extended in so far as it relates to the assessment of farmers' incomes on a land valuation basis.</P>
      <P>I would have sent the map to the Minister a fortnight ago because as soon as I raised the matter here I got the map from the county development team in Cork but when I did send a letter to the Minister a month ago I got no answer and I feared my map would also end up in the wastepaper basket.  You cannot send letters to these fellows.  I do not blame the Minister for that.  I am sure he did not see the letter but the danger is that a letter might never see the light of day. There is no justification for the limits at present operating in County Cork. This farmer's unemployment assistance order extends to 11 of the 12 western counties in full and even extends to a part of Limerick but it is limited in west Cork to less than one-third of the area that is deemed to be within the 12 western counties for other State purposes.  Why this distinction?  Numbers of small farmers in those areas are being deprived of an allowance, unjustly in my opinion, by virtue of this discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wishes I shall present him with this map, or I shall send it to him in an envelope marked &ldquo;personal&rdquo;. I am aware that some Departments are being used merely as propaganda machines by the Government.  They churn out countless letters in the hope <Col N="769" /> of increasing the votes of the Government party.  On the other hand, it is well known that some letters received by Departments are put into the wastepaper basket.  That does not apply to all public officers but it applies to a number.  My reason for referring to it now is because that number is closeted within the Department of Social Welfare.  The wheel will turn and these people should realise that.  The people associated with them think they will remain in office for the rest of their lives.  That is not so.  The Government are limping along on the crutches of the dissidents.  The Government are hobbling along like an old age pensioner of 90 years.  When the Government are removed from office I hope the letters that have been sent to some people will be compared with those sent to others.  Retribution will come to those who have consigned to the wastepaper basket letters received by the Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to the unemployment assistance order and the payment of unemployment assistance on a land valuation basis, while it would be more desirable if the order were not necessary, I suppose that while Fianna Fáil are in office such orders will be required. I am in agreement with the proposal to assess means on a land valuation basis, although the measure has been the subject of much criticism, both inside and outside the House.  I am favourably disposed towards this measure and I wish to compliment those responsible.  While it brings within its scope people who normally would not be entitled to unemployment assistance, I do not see how any legislation can be drawn up without that happening. In many cases farmers have developed their land to a considerable extent since the land was originally subject to valuation in 1852.  In the 119 years that have elapsed the land has changed considerably and the present owners are favoured by this type of legislation.  However, that is in the order of things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be changed now.  According to the Minister for Health they will be assessed on an income basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="770" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When they were assessed on an income basis there was no incentive to extend farming operations; in fact, the reverse was the case. In many cases small farmers have little or no income from October to April because creamery cheques are practically non-existent then.  The few pounds that many farmers are getting is of tremendous help to them and many of them have told me they are pleased about this allowance.  Naturally they would prefer to have work but frequently it is not available and they have no way of supplementing their income except by direct payment from State funds.  I will present the Minister with this map and I trust he will accept it from me.  Of course, if he wrote to the development team in Cork he could get it from them; the secretary&mdash;Mr. Murphy&mdash;would be pleased to supply him with a copy.  I want to see justice done and fair play for all.  I have raised this matter on two occasions in the Dáil and I trust that will be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowance now given to the deserted wife is reasonably generous although there is some difficulty in obtaining it.  I should illustrate one difficulty which, perhaps, could apply on a national basis.  At the time of desertion, in some cases court proceedings were instituted and sums were granted by the court which may have been fair and just at the time.  However, frequently the wife did not apply to have the amount increased despite the fact that the cost of living had increased and also her husband's earnings had increased.  In some cases this was due to the fact that the wife did not wish to cause her family any distress or embarrassment by further court proceedings.  However, the wife is now told by the Department of Social Welfare that although the Department know her means may only be 40s weekly she is not entitled to get an allowance from them but must go to court and take action against her husband.  The wife may not wish to revive a 20-year old quarrel and for this reason may not wish to take court action.  I would ask the Minister for Social Welfare not to enforce that clause.  He may well create trouble if his Department tell the wife that her <Col N="771" /> husband is not giving her enough money and that she should apply to have the original court order amended.</P>
    <P>When old people remain in their homes this means a tremendous saving on public funds.  The economic charge for hospital care for an old age pensioner is more than £20 per week. While reference has been made to the prescribed female relative allowance and to the restrictions in the regulations, at a time when we have Women's Lib, looking for equality and so on, I should like to strike out the word &ldquo;female&rdquo;.  Why should not a male relative get that allowance as well? I have in mind a case in Cork where a man returned from England to mind his father who is more than 80 years of age.  He has little or no money. He cannot get unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit because he is not available for work.  The only allowance he could get was £1 a week from the health board.  Why should he not qualify for an allowance?  Why should his father not get an allowance of £2.55, or £2.60, or whatever it is, since a daughter would get it if she were minding him?  That position should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I find it a most unpleasant task to say unpleasant things.  I would much prefer, in making a contribution here or elsewhere, to have some pleasant things to say about people.  That is an Irish tradition too. Unfortunately, I was unable to do so today so far as some people are concerned&mdash;some, but not all by any means.  It is our job and our duty here when making a contribution as Members of this House to contribute to the discussion on a factual basis and to make a fair appraisal of the position. We would be unfair to ourselves and to the people who sent us here if we did not do so.</P>
    <P>Any comments I made here that reflected on anyone were made in that spirit and I am satisfied that they were correct.  I do not reflect lightly on anyone, particularly having regard to the privilege of the House.  I do not condemn anybody lightly.  I only do so when I think there is full justification for it and when nothing happens after I have made repeated private representations. <Col N="772" /> I never drag anything into this House without first trying out the Department on a private basis.</P>
    <P>The big question I am interested in at the moment is the one I mentioned at the outset, that is, a reduction in the qualifying age limit for old age pensions from 70 to 65 years.  It should be reduced for all.  We should not continue to have four or five different classes of citizens.  We should not continue with that system.  Where will the Minister get the money?  That is the question.  Where is he getting the money to pay all the other pensions at 65 years of age?  I have no doubt that if a measure were brought before this House to reduce that age limit, and to modify the means test for non-contributory pensions, whether they be old age pensions or widows' pensions, it would have the support of the Irish public and that support would be forthcoming in financial terms also.  The Minister should get to work and bring this legislation before us at the earliest possible date and I can assure him of the full co-operation of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I am promised all Stages of the Bill today my winding-up remarks will be as brief as possible. I know the House is aware of the urgency of the Bill, and that the benefits payable have to be in operation by the first week in August and, in the case of old age pensions, by the first Friday in August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much to add to what I have said in my opening statement except to point out that this year, when the budgetary adjustments of the Minister for Finance were entirely based on curbing inflation and taking account of the inflationary situation, was not an easy time to impose new taxes in order to meet the additional social welfare payments.  We never hesitate to do that whenever we think it necessary, and that has been in every single Budget since I came into the House. We never hesitated to impose the necessary taxation to give these increases. I wish that the people who advocate the many good things that could be done, and the better things that could be done, were always prepared <Col N="773" /> to support the imposition of taxes when they are introduced.  Unfortunately, this is not our experience.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to get up in this House and, particularly on the emotional subject of payments to the weaker section of our people, advocate that better provision should be made in every possible respect.  It is quite easy to demonstrate one's social conscience and condemn the other fellow's lack of social conscience by advocating improved payments for all and sundry.  I suppose it is not necessary for me to point out&mdash;nor would it be necessary for any other Member of the House if he were in my position&mdash;that to give extra benefits to all these people would be the nicest and most satisfying thing in the world. The Parliamentary Secretary and I would be more than delighted to give ten times the amount and to cover all the people who are not covered.</P>
    <P>Governments must have their priorities. The Minister for Social Welfare is not the only person looking for millions in the annual Budget.  The Minister for Local Government thinks that the building of houses is the most important thing in the world for people who have not got houses.  The Minister for Education thinks that providing schools and better facilities for children to travel to school are the only things in the world and he could use many more millions.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries thinks that providing the extra millions the farmers want is the only thing that is necessary.  Every Minister around the Cabinet table can produce a demand for extra millions.  During the year Deputies advocate that all these things should be done.  In a country with limited resources one has to consider what is reasonable against that background. We have been doing that reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies made the case that the increases did not measure up to the increase in the cost of living index. That is not true or correct.  To justify that, Deputy O'Donovan said that the cost of living index was wrong and that it was made out by people fiddling with figures.  The cost of living index is wrong and statistics are wrong if they do not prove the Opposition's <Col N="774" /> point, but if they are satisfactory in that they prove something that the Opposition would feel happy to attack they are all right.  The same statistics are being used and the same yardstick to measure those statistics is being used.  Whether the people who work conscientiously to provide these statistics in the Statistics office are to be accused of fiddling with figures or otherwise, they are doing a job in accordance with the standards set, and the same standards and the same yardstick which have always been used down the years are being used.  We have always tried to exceed the increase in the consumer price index when making additional benefits available to social welfare recipients and we have succeeded reasonably well in doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry made a special plea for widows.  This year I tried to lean as heavily as possible in the direction of improving benefits for widows.  I have, I think, considerably improved their position.  As I have said so often here, even before I became Minister for Social Welfare, never will a Minister for Social Welfare be told by the Opposition that he has done enough for these people.  He will always be confronted with the same arguments: it is all right, but it does not go far enough; we welcome it, but it is not as good as it should be.  Playing on the susceptibilities of the weaker sections of the people is the meanest type of propaganda.  Improvements have been made in the case of widows and deserted wives.  Nobody adverted during the debate to the amount a widow may earn without losing some of her pension. The allowance per dependent child was £39; we have increased it to £78.  These things are very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that was a good step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We extended the age limit for dependent children to 18 and then to 21 if the children are still at school or college.  It is very easy to stand up here and make comparisons with the rates paid in Britain. There are many directions in which the comparisons made are unfavourable to Britain.  I am not for one moment <Col N="775" /> arguing that we have better schemes or that we have reached the stage at which these benefits can be regarded as adequate, but the rhythm of improvement and the progress made are reasonably satisfactory.  Looking at the numbers brought under the social welfare umbrella one cannot but be satisfied that we are making definite and satisfactory progress.</P>
      <P>Make no mistake about it, no Minister for Social Welfare will ever find himself in the position of being able to do all that he would like to do.  He is tied to the amount made available to him at any time.  I am as well aware as anybody here of all the lovely things that could be done in order to make better provisions for the weaker sections, but regard must be had to the limitations and those limitations necessarily control the progress made.  Looking down the programme from 1957 to date, and the rate of progress made every year, one can only conclude that the record is a creditable one.</P>
      <P>I do not like attacks being made on the personnel in Government Departments. The Minister is responsible.  The officials working in Departments are human beings; they are at times capable of making mistakes.  They would be inhuman if they were not. I would say that we have the best Civil Service in the world.  I do not think anyone would contradict that.  It is a pity that Deputies should attack officials time and time again.  The officials in my Department whose job it is to assess means are only doing a job in accordance with the regulations this House has statutorily laid down for them to carry out.  They interpret these regulations to the best of their ability.  If they ask too many questions or have the wrong approach, as has been alleged, that is because we have made provisions in our regulations but there must be a means test in relation to the payment of some benefits.  This applies particularly to non-insured persons, old age non-contributory pensions, widows' pensions, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain qualifications and those qualifications must be applied before a decision can be made.  The officers act in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the law.  I do <Col N="776" /> not think complaints should be levelled against them for doing their work. When a person does not succeed in getting some benefit he is naturally disappointed. Deputy Fitzpatrick read out the kind of letter he gets.  The kind of letter I get is one in which the applicant says he worked very hard, that he is a member of the Old IRA, and so on, and yet he did not get the old age pension.  He does not refer to the fact that there are certain regulations with regard to means.  Irrespective of what one does, how hard one works, or how good a national record one has, one must conform to the required statutory means test.</P>

      <P>One of the anomalies is that a man who works very hard all his life and accumulates some wealth will not get a pension while the ne'er-do-well gets a pension. So long as there is a means test this will be the case.  I would hope that the means test would go at some stage but, if I had the £7 million, £8 million or £9 million it would cost to abolish the means test, I would prefer to use that money to increase existing benefits. There are many people who could live comfortably in retirement without a pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to the Deputy.  Deputy Barry referred to people whose insurance contributions had not been paid.  Where a person has defaulted or is not in a position to pay we are taking authority to pay the contributions.  Deputy Barry suggests <Col N="777" /> this should be retrospective.  It would scarcely be possible to make it retrospective. One could hardly justify retrospection.  When the Bill becomes law section 8 will cover what has happened in the past and to that extent one could say it is retrospective.</P>
      <P>There is a certain risk because those who are not particularly careful about having their employees' cards stamped up-to-date could tend to be less so in the knowledge and the hope that one day the Minister will pay them anyhow and the employees will therefore lose nothing.  The employees could become negligent too.  They could say to themselves: &ldquo;Sure, if they are not paid up we will get it fixed up and anyhow the Exchequer will come to the rescue.&rdquo;  The increased penalties provided in the Bill will be rigidly applied in these cases and nobody can blame us for doing so because nothing can excuse an employer for not paying the contributions.  There will have to be much stricter supervision.  The penalties provided are much more severe than they were previously in order to ensure that cards are stamped up-to-date.  The power is there to recover from the people concerned any loss to the fund as a result of having to pay these retrospective&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That power is not being used and the people are not punished.  I had one case before the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy agreed it was not our fault in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers employed in the Department of Social Welfare are comparatively small and if Deputies take the amount of our Vote which is paid out in administration as a percentage of the total Vote they will find that relatively speaking we have a very good record.  This very often indicates to me the need for more staff in many sections.  The Department of Social Welfare carry out a volume of work which is repetitive, which must be done and which deals with thousands.  It must go on daily, weekly, monthly and yearly and <Col N="778" /> every year when the Budget comes around there is a complete set of changes and this involves work the magnitude of which is not fully appreciated by the people who are so ready to criticise the delays and the mistakes which they allege occur in the Department.</P>
      <P>We try to do a volume of work which reaches out to thousands and thousands of people per week with that limited number of staff and in order that the chain of movement is not impeded or breached the work must go on.  The availability of persons for doing what one might call extra-mural work is not as simple a matter as all that.  I do not think that the fact is fully appreciated by those who find a means of playing on the susceptibility of the weaker sections of the people as if we were setting out to make it difficult for them to receive the benefits which are gladly paid so long as that little co-operation is given to show that they qualify.</P>
      <P>Nobody, least of all myself, would assert for one moment that we have brought everybody who should be brought into the social welfare scheme into it.  The schemes have been extended and the rates have been improved each year.  Deputy Murphy referred to the 65 age limit.  We took a first step in this direction when we brought it down for insured persons in a limited way.  The tendency will be to reduce it but we shall do it gradually. The cost involved is fairly high but as a result of better medicine life expectancy has increased and the demand for reducing the age, which existed 30 years ago, does not exist today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago I was at a social welfare conference in Austria and all the advanced welfare States, including the Swedes, were there.  One of the most remarkable things being advocated by those who had reached what might be regarded as the peak of perfection in social welfare was work of some standard for everybody even for disabled persons and old people.  The Swedes advocated that everybody should contribute a measure of work in some way, even by rehabilitation <Col N="779" /> or occupational therapy.  They felt people were much better working. Countries in which pensions were paid at lower age levels were inclined to the view that a case could be made for raising the level so that people would be permitted to work longer and thereby enjoy better mental and bodily health.  That was a most interesting theme to hear as we are one of the few countries that have not dropped the age below 70.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that I want to get all Stages of the Bill today I do not think it is necessary to make a long Second Stage speech.  I want to assure all those who have made points that we admit the relevancy of them all; we admit there are many things we would like to do with regard to social welfare. I do not like people saying that the Minister has his heart in the right place but the Government will not allow him to do more; a Minister can only do as much as the resources available to him permit.  As the main theme of the Budget was to curb inflation this was a difficult year in which to give benefits.  One cannot lay on extra taxes in an unlimited way.  The taxes which were imposed to meet the improvements in the Bill were sorely felt and were not welcomed by the Opposition. It is very easy to say that one would welcome additional taxes being imposed as long as the money went to improve benefits but when extra taxes are imposed they are never welcome. As I have said before, one cannot win and it is hard to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>There is to be a break in business now to allow the Minister for Justice to come in but it may be possible to move the Committee Stage before Question Time.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I should say at this stage.  The Committee Stage should not take long because all the matters in the Bill are merely giving effect to provisions made in the budget for improvements, with the addition of section 8, which makes it possible to pay retrospective contributions for persons who have not had their payments made.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that nobody referred to the explanatory memorandum. <Col N="780" /> The explanatory memorandum makes it remarkably easy to understand the entire provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

The case I refer to is where a man paid his contributions and where the employer pocketed the contributions and where the State solicitor came in and eventually things were settled up between him and the sheriff's office that there were no means for seizure.  Surely the Department should pay in a case like that.  I do not want the Minister to go into a long explanation because I know he has not the time.  The Minister mentioned that everybody should be prosecuted. That is the trouble in Ireland. People get away from prosecutions here.  It would be lovely if everybody who was guilty of a misdemeanour were prosecuted.  It would be better for all of us if no one was immune from the law.  Whether the offence be small or big, let the offender be brought before the court.  We know there are people who have immunity.  It comes through political association, something I oppose.  However, I do not want to delay the Minister. The Minister says there is no retrospection.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I did not make myself clear.  Say the Bill becomes operative from 1st August.  If anybody is found from that day on to have defaulted in the payment of contributions, even though the default may have happened two years ago, the Bill still operates to the benefit of the employees, so that to that extent it is actually retrospective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In the first place I wish to thank the Minister for agreeing to take the Bill at this time to enable us to consider the implications of the amendment on the licensing laws.  I notice that when dealing with the 1968 Bill the then Minister also dealt with the licensing laws and I think it is correct to say that he made special provision for the opening of public houses.  I understand that at the present time public houses open from mid-April to mid-October until 11.30 p.m. and from October to April to 11 p.m.  Of course when we have one time all the year round, no question arises.  That is the position at present.  Under the Bill as drafted at the moment, if we are going to have summer time from mid-March to the end of October and public houses will have late opening from mid-April until early October, the point then is that during the month of October there will be non-synchronisation, if that is the proper way of putting it, between summer time and the opening of pubs. We think the Minister should amend the proposals to put back the clock so as to synchronise it with the licensing laws.  In other words, what I am trying to get across to the Minister is that public houses should close at 11 p.m. on the same date as summer time ceases.  That is the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to make in reply to what Deputy Fitzpatrick says.  One is that the period he mentioned for the longer opening of public houses is correct. There would be a difference of approximately a month at the spring end of the year, and of three weeks in the autumn.  It was implicit in what Deputy Fitzpatrick said that this never happened before.  That is not so.  Under the 1960 Intoxicating Liquor Act, the four months&mdash;June to September, inclusive &mdash;were fixed for the longer opening and at that time the period of summer time was about seven and a half months.  In fact it was the period specified in the 1926 Order.  No difficulty arose in that respect at that time and since only a period of a few weeks is involved now and since there <Col N="783" /> is no demand from the publicans for an extension, I cannot take it on myself to make a change.  However, I think the point would, in any case, be really more appropriate to a Licensing Bill.</P>

      <P>On 1st April, 1971, dispensary residences in all health board areas became vested in health boards under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 36 of the Health Act, 1970.

      <P>The Embassy at London has been in touch with the British authorities concerned.  I understand that the person named had not the minimum requisite number of contributions to enable his widow to qualify for death benefit or widow's benefit under the National Insurance Acts.

      <P>I agree with much of what the Deputy says in that there is an obvious case of injustice.  One decision that has been taken after consultation between the Irish Embassy and the authorities in Scotland and the Insurance Ministry in Britain is that these workers will not be allowed to <Col N="794" /> declare themselves as self-employed in the future and thus avoid the payment of insurance contributions.  That was a loophole in the past.  It has now been decided that this will not be done in the future.

Does the Minister not agree that the British authorities have ways and means of establishing whether a person is self-employed or not and it is quite obvious to all concerned that these people are not self-employed?  Therefore, in support of Deputy Coughlan's question, is it not right to take action against the labour bosses so that money can be collected from them for the non-payment of stamps and that the widow of this unfortunate person will have some means of support in the future?  There is no point in making promises about the future.  The question relates to a specific family.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister know the figures are in fact available? Is he not aware that figures have been produced by CIE in relation to their tour traffic and also by the Great Southern Hotel Company in relation to bed occupancy?  Is the Minister aware that the figures produced in the last 24 hours by the Great Southern Hotel <Col N="799" /> Company in relation to bed occupancy for the month of June show a consistent fall-off for June over the past four years and a 10 per cent reduction in business compared with June of last year?  Is the Minister aware that the figures produced by CIE tours within the past 24 hours show a fall-off of 15 per cent in American tour traffic as compared with last year?  Has the Minister any comment to make, seeing that he is as well aware of that as I am?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said already that the whole pattern of tourism is changing and that much more than in the past we are now developing a type of tourism that does not engage in advance booking where people are coming by car ferry and otherwise.  In that changing situation one cannot make an exact assessment until the actual month is past and the figures are collected and collated.  This is being done by Bord Fáilte at present in regard to June and a report will be available later this month.  Pending that report I think it is unwise to indulge in what is mere speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that figures for bed occupancy and traffic for the month of June produced by a semi-State body with a highly organised sales force in Britain and Northern America&mdash;CIE &mdash;indicate a very alarming situation and a situation which was forecast months ago by everybody in the tourist industry except the Minister and Bord Fáilte?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that we had that situation very much in hand months ago in regard to tour traffic.  This is involved in the change in the pattern of tourism.  You may have fewer people coming on bus tours but many more people coming on car ferries.  The B &amp; I figures for the car ferries are up substantially in April, May and June of this year, up in the region of 8 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware that the subvention to Bord Fáilte for 1971-72 is considered to be grossly inadequate to meet the <Col N="800" /> needs of the tourist industry; if so, whether any steps will be taken to rectify the matter; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant-in-aid for Bord Fáilte in the current financial year amounts to £6,230,000, an increase of £680,000 on the 1970-71 provision. This amount was settled in the light of the overall demands on the limited resources of the Exchequer.  I am aware that some interests regard the 1971-72 provision as inadequate and that Bord Fáilte could utilise additional funds, but the allocation for the development of tourism this year is reasonable, having regard to the general budgetary situation.  I am, however, keeping the finances of the board under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not admit that in view of the serious problem with which the tourist industry had to contend in the past 12 months and in the light of the continuing problem with which the industry will have to contend in the 1972 season, the present subvention for Irish tourism is grossly inadequate, and indeed absolutely ridiculous, and bears no relation to the needs of the industry?  Will the Minister tackle this situation and ensure that the industry will be adequately financed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 4(4) of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, provides for the appointment of members of the Board of Bord Fáilte Éireann by the Minister for Transport and Power with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 6(a) of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1970 increased membership of the board from seven to nine.  The two additional members were appointed on 8th September, 1970.  I am not contemplating any further restructuring of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes in the board's internal organisation and structure are the responsibility of the board.  Following the <Col N="802" /> appointment of a new director general, I understand that the internal structure and organisation is being examined with a view to making any changes that may be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for the fact that the Minister has increased the membership of the board and allowing for other things he says he has done and allowing for the fact that Bord Fáilte are hamstrung by inadequate finance, would the Minister now agree that following a second year of most unsatisfactory results as far as tourist traffic is concerned the present board and organisation of Bord Fáilte clearly have neither the ability nor capacity to meet the adversities and the new challenge facing Irish tourism and that much more drastic reorganisation and restructuring is necessary?</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Dublin Port and Docks Board that their long-term plan for the port will take the form of a report illustrated by a relief model and diagrams.  The relief model was received by the board at the end of May, 1971 and some of the diagrams have also been prepared.  Some of the material to be included in the report has also been submitted to the board but the balance is still awaited. When the entire material has been received and approved for publication by the board it will then be submitted to me and to Dublin Corporation and put on public display.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to be precise as to the date on which the plan will be put on public display but the Deputy can rest assured that there will be no undue delay in so doing as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>As indicated in a reply to a Parliamentary question on this subject on 17th July, 1969, there is no question of the board proceeding with the various stages of development which may be provided in the plan without the agreement of the planning authority in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and an assurance to this effect has been given to me by the board.  When the views of the planning authority and of other interested parties are available they will be considered by me in consultation with the Minister for Local Government. The matter will then be submitted to the Government for any necessary decisions in the context of local regional and national planning consideration.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the question died on 8th September, 1969.  On the investigation of his wife's claim for a widow's pension the social welfare officer wrote to the British Department of Health and Social Security requesting particulars of the deceased's insurance record.  The British authorities replied to the effect that they were unable to trace an insurance record to refer.  The social welfare officer then wrote to the police authorities in Scotland and obtained further particulars of the deceased's employment which he passed on to the British Department with a request that action be taken to secure payment of any contributions due.</P>
      <P>On 17th May, 1971, a complaint was received from the father of the person referred to in the question to the effect that his son had worked in Scotland for six years and no employment contributions had been paid in respect of him.  As any contributions payable would be British contributions the writer was advised to send full particulars to the British Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is considered that insured persons are aware, in a general way, of the benefits for which the social insurance system provides. Should they need information on particular aspects there are a number of sources from which they can inquire, for example, the Department's information section at Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, the local employment exchanges and employment offices, social welfare officers and local agents of the Department. In addition, the Department's information booklet is available for consultation at all post offices.  The booklet is revised annually and distributed free to a large number of personnel officers, trade unions, <i>et cetera,</i> and I think to Deputies too.  Direct periodic notification by the issue of this booklet to individual employees, as is, perhaps, envisaged in the question, <Col N="813" /> would be very costly, involving the printing and distribution of some 800,000 copies, and the need for such action is not apparent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the authorities of University College, Galway, that, by public announcement before the beginning of the session 1969-70, and otherwise during the session, it was made clear to students attending the pre-medical course that in the event of all places in the first year medical course, 1970-71, being filled from the summer pre-medical examination, 1970, no places in the first year medical course would be available to those who would pass in the autumn pre-medical examination 1970; that each student eligible to resit the autumn pre-medical examination, 1970, was notified that admission to the examination carried no implication that candidates successful in the examination would be given a place in the first year medical course, 1970-71; that students who passed that examination and who were not given places were granted concessions by the authorities of the college and the university to facilitate their transfer to other faculties; further, that the college authorities have decided that these students will, in the event of their obtaining the BSc degree in 1972 or 1973, be subsequently admitted to the first medical year on application and that the students concerned have been so informed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the conditions and regulations upon which students may be admitted to particular courses of university study are matters which fall entirely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the appropriate university authorities and that I exercise no function in these matters either generally or in relation to individual cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That where a trade, profession or vocation is permanently discontinued in 1972-73 or any subsequent year of assessment, income tax for the two years of assessment immediately preceding shall in certain cases be charged by reference to the profits or gains of those years, and the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to the charging of tax where there is a discontinuance shall be amended accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution is concerned with the provisions of section 3.  Section 3 has the effect of bringing under review, on the cessation of a trade or profession after 5th April, 1972, not only, as at present, the assessment for the penultimate year but also the assessment for the next previous year.  The section will operate where the aggregate of the actual profits for those two years exceeds the aggregate and the amounts assessable for the two years on the normal preceding year basis.  In this event the assessment for each of the two years will be revised to the amount <Col N="823" /> of the actual profits and that can be a revision up or down.</P>

      <P>The reason I am raising the question is that the Order Paper provides for the discussion of items 7 to 20 on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  All these are resolutions referable to particular sections of the Finance Bill.  I want to be quite clear on what we are doing so that our proceedings may be understood. I take it that the passage of these resolutions will not inhibit or prevent a discussion on the sections involved or preclude or prejudice amendments to the particular sections contained in each resolution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 is a taxing section which alters the Financial Resolution we passed this time last year when relief was given to people in the lower income tax bracket.  It provived that the first £100 of taxable income would bear a lower rate of taxation and 12 months later this is now being removed.  The Minister has said the involvement is in the region of £5 million.  This means that in effect a poll tax of roughly £1 per month is being imposed on every single wage earner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been an aim of taxation, although bureaucracy at times has prevented this, that taxation should have an impact in accordance with the means of the taxpayer to pay.  This is a classic example of a breach of that convention because under section 2 the richest man in the land pays precisely the same amount of additional taxation as the lowest paid worker within the income tax net.  I do not understand the basis for this section.  If it was a fair and proper amendment of our law to introduce this last year why after 12 months experience should the benefit being given in particular to lower paid workers be ended?  Is it indicative of a change of social policy by the Government?  In the 12 months <Col N="831" /> we have had a change of Minister; does the disappearance of the former holder of this office mean that we are going back to a position in which the Revenue Commissioners, having had a concession passed by Dáil Éireann last year, are now back in control?</P>
    <P>We have had in relation to Finance Bills over the last five or six years much evidence that successive Ministers for Finance have been so many puppets on a string, more or less induced to operate and to speak a language which is the operation decreed and the language prescribed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I should like an explanation as to why section 2 is put into this Finance Bill, why a concession given universally to taxpayers last year is now repudiated and ends and why we embark now on the imposition of a capitation tax which applies irrespective of the income, irrespective of the fortune or the property of the taxpayer concerned.  My constituents in St. Maelruan's Park in Tallaght and my constituents who live in Ardilea and Mount Merrion each will be presented with exactly the same tax bill.  I think it is socially unjust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Except, as Deputy O'Higgins said, that it was a different Minister who introduced it, I cannot understand why this change should be made.  We all remember the song and dance made about the concession last year.  We remember that the Taoiseach, who introduced the Budget, felt that it was good social legislation to introduce something like this and if it was good social legislation last year, the reversal of it this year must be bad social legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of figures have been given by the Minister in the House in relation to this and other taxation.  He must remember that yesterday during Question Time he said that the figure which represented the extra amount of money which would be saved would be, if I remember correctly, the same as he said in the Budget&mdash;£6 million. He now says over £5 million.  In regard to the amount of concessions which have been given, which, in fact, was <Col N="832" /> being used as an excuse for taking this away, he corrected me; I said it was £2 million; he said £1 million.  I take his word for that.  So that, if my argument is correct the workers of this country are being fined a net £5 million because the Fianna Fáil Government changed their Minister.  That appears to be what has happened.</P>
    <P>There were a number of other figures given by the Minister, including the number of extra people who would be out of the tax net as a result of certain concessions given but, no matter how we look at that, they represent only £1 million in taxation.  I am sure the Minister knows of all the people who have come into the tax net because of wage increases last year and the year before and this year.  I am sure he will take my word for it that as a trade union official I have negotiated wage increases on the bare amount necessary to keep a family in frugal comfort. It is no comfort to these people to be told that because the Minister for Finance decided so, they will be paying between £11 and £12 extra taxation this year.  It is rather stupid that this sort of proposal should be made and to say that it is to continue, as if it were just an experiment last year, an experiment that failed.  It is entirely wrong.  If the amount coming in in income taxation were dropping or re-remaining static I could see some reason for an effort being made to bring people back into the net or to force those already in to pay more but, again if my figures are correct, last year the figure had risen to £129 million and it is estimated that in the year 1971-72 the amount which will be taken in income tax will be £141 million.  Yet it was decided to take away this minor concession of £11 to £12 per person paying income tax.</P>
    <P>Again at Question Time yesterday, there was a query to the Minister about the impost this was on people who had not been notified for approximately a month about the extra taxation and the Minister asked what have they to complain about, that all they have to pay extra at the end of a month is £2.93, forgetting that this was in addition to the taxation they were already paying.  To my knowledge many people have been paying over <Col N="833" /> £3 per week and £2.93 on top of that brought their income tax deduction for one week to £6 out of a wage of £18 to £20.  Then they could pay their rent and their fares to and from work and pay for their meals out and for replacement of clothing and for the tools they are using.  They certainly would not go to Bermuda with the balance. It is wrong that the Minister should have introduced this section and if at all possible the section should be taken out of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;why this was done. They know very well, as Deputy Tully said, but for the record let me just remind them of what I explained at considerable detail in the Budget Statement, that was, that the reliefs involved in the Budget cost £29¼ million approximately; it was necessary to find the money to pay for these reliefs. For the reasons which I outlined at that time, I was obliged to find the main portion of this additional money from income taxation.  That being so, effectively, the choice with which I was faced was either to do what is involved in this section or to increase the standard rate of income tax.  I&mdash;not the Revenue Commissioners but I&mdash; decided on balance that this was the better course for a number of reasons which I do not think I need detail now. But, although Deputy Tully made a passing reference, Deputy O'Higgins made no reference at all to something that must, of course, be taken into account when considering this matter, that is, the increases which were announced in the Budget and provided for in this Bill for the minimum earned income relief, age relief and small income relief, the effect of which is to benefit the lowest income taxpayers and to take out of the tax net altogether about 20,000 people and to reduce tax liability for 40,000 people, all of whom are in the lowest income bracket.  If one is talking about social policy, one cannot in all honesty talk about it without referring to these facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> Maybe Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Tully would think that rather than do this we should have omitted a number of benefits in the Budget.  Perhaps they would like to tell us what these benefits are that should be omitted or, alternatively, if they think we should have had these benefits, perhaps they would tell us what alternative method they would see by which this sum of money could be raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there was an alternative.  What is the Minister saying?  There was an alternative and that was to put this burden on those best able to bear it and it is a matter for the Minister for Finance and his advisers and the Government to work out that policy.  It is socially wrong to impose on every single person irrespective of his means, his property or his fortune, precisely the same level of taxation.  It is socially wrong.</P>
      <P>This was a concession given last year and there is no other example that I can recall in recent years of a concession given and with the rejoicing scarcely ended the concession being withdrawn by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The fact is that many more people are paying income tax this year than heretofore because, despite the fall in the value of money, there have been no changes in the allowances; on the contrary, the allowances have been reduced this year.  This is a discreditable manoeuvre.  The Minister asks from where he would get the money.  Let me tell him what would be my favourite target&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Without the slightest trouble, this revenue could be got from those big farmers who run racehorses and own Mercedes cars.  I am not keen on taxing people who cannot afford to pay tax and there are many people now paying tax who cannot afford to do so, for instance, women working in laundries or, say, girls working in shops and who are well below the subsistence level.  Let the Minister not fool himself because he and the Revenue Commissioners must be well aware of the fact.  It is outragous that income tax should be levied on people whose incomes are, roughly speaking, equivalent to an income of about £2 before the war.  In 1939 nobody would have dreamt of taxing people with an income of only £2 per week.  The allowance then was £3 per week.  Why cannot the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners be honest and have some decency in this regard?  The concession given last year &mdash;the first for many years&mdash;was introduced with a fanfare of trumpets but this year that has been taken away under the pretence that there is no other source from which the revenue could be collected.  The Government are engaged in such colossal wasteful expenditure that it was not sufficient for them that income tax, as shown in the White Paper, was up from £112 million to £132 million and, according to the Minister, is now up to £140 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister who, in many ways, is an honourable and honest man, knows very well that this imposition of income tax is shameful. Why, then, can he not get his Department to control the expenditure of Departments in the way in which it was controlled when the Department of Finance were only one-third of their present size so that income tax might be levied with some regard to the capacity of people to pay?</P>
      <P>Our income tax situation must give rise not only to inflation but also to demands for increased wages that might not otherwise be made.  The expenditure of extremely affluent people in a community gives rise to disturbances and dissatisfaction within that community.  I am not suggesting that the Minister bring big farmers within the income tax code simply because they are big farmers, but I am suggesting that he tax those big farmers whose incomes are big.  In our party policy statement we said that we would expect farmers, having a valuation on their land of more than £100, to make returns.  We did not say we would tax them.  Was that not reasonable? What would be the income of a good farmer whose holdings were valued at £100?  If he did not make an income of £20 per £1 valuation, he would not be a farmer at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember some years ago giving a lift to a boy from Waterford who told me that he was a veterinary student. I asked him what was the average size of farms in Waterford and he told me that the average was 100 acres.  In reply to my question as to what farmers would make per acre he said that if they could not get a return of £15 an acre, they should give up farming altogether.  Of course, the land around Waterford city would not be nearly as good as the land around Dublin city, for instance.  There is a continual increase in income tax in respect of the person who must work manually, in respect of those who work in shops and in respect of the junior clerk in the Civil Service or elsewhere.  I take it that the compensation they get is in <Col N="837" /> all cases related to the increases in the cost of living and this means that the value of their net incomes is decreasing. The concession given last year was a feeble effort but at least it was something. However, it has been taken away this year.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how this Government think as a group of men. Of course, the Minister has taken into the income tax net this year more people than were in it last year.  He says he has taken 20,000 people from the net but he caught 50,000 more people.  Therefore, there are an extra 30,000 people paying tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Deputy O'Donovan is perhaps the most significant in relation to this matter, namely, that this change will put pressure on that section of the population that are most likely to demand increases in wages to compensate for this new pressure.  Part of the battle against inflation is psychological warfare. To hurt the people who can and will shout the loudest is inept politically and unjust socially.  It was characteristic of this Budget that this lazy way of getting revenue was taken. It is very simple to say &ldquo;cut out this extra allowance; we have £X more&rdquo;. The Minister accepts that income tax is unjust and that if any other way of raising revenue could be found, such would be preferred.  It is implicit in that confession by the Minister that this was a simple way of getting revenue. It was a confession, too, that the Minister was bankrupt of ideas for raising the equivalent in some other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my Budget speech last year, and again this year, I suggested that it was time we considered the introduction of a wealth tax.  This form of taxation is desirable socially because it affects people who are best able to pay.  It is not a novel tax and neither could it be called a radical tax.  It is a form of taxation that is popular in the more extreme capitalist countries of western Europe.  It is applied also in the majority of the American States.  It is a tax that can be assessed and collected easily.  It is a tax that would be difficult to avoid.  It could <Col N="838" /> always be checked at death and if it was found that there had been avoidance during the life of the deceased, the matter could then be rectified.  The returns from it should be calculable in advance from the records available already in the offices of the Revenue Commissioners.  It should be easy for the Minister to assess how much revenue such a tax would bring in.  If this tax is practicable, and I see no reason why it is not, it is definitely to be preferred to a tax which hits the weaker section of the community proportionately the hardest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the confinement surely is the bad nature of the tax imposed by the section.  It is important to realise that this tax is falling most heavily on that section of income tax payers who have the smallest income and who are least in a position to pay.  It falls equally on all taxpayers in relation to the first £100 of their income.  Obviously the first £100 of income will be a much more important matter to a person with a small income than it will be to a person with a large income.  Therefore, effectively when we are taking the same amount from all taxpayers we are proportionally taking more from the smallest taxpayers because the £100 is a much larger proportion of their total tax and of their total income than it is in the case of the larger taxpayer.  This is regressive taxation.  It is taxation which is taking proportionally more from the smaller income.  Therefore, it is bad taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is taxation which is the mark of a Government who are not concerned with social justice.  The Minister I know comes into this House quite <Col N="839" /> frequently wearing the mantle of a social reformer, a crusader for rights for those in poor conditions.  When it comes to practicable proposals we see him in his true light.  This is a proposal which shows up the social conscience of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the muddle in Government thinking which is revealed in this section.  It is a mirror of many aspects of Government policy.  They decide on a measure one year and go back on it the following year.  This is a Government who do not know where they are going and are changing their minds from year to year.  If the concession was worth giving last year surely it is worth retaining this year?  The situation has not changed all that much.  If there are difficulties why were they not foreseen when this was being introduced? Clearly there were no difficulties in administering this concession It is merely because the Government ran out of money through their own fault.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall the Minister lauding this concession in the House last year.  The same Minister comes back this year and withdraws it. The Minister at column 281 of the Official Report of 1st July, 1970, said:</P>
    <P>Others have suggested increasing our income tax but far from wishing to increase income tax, which now falls on a comparatively small section of the community and hits persons with low incomes, the Government were satisfied that the time had come when some relief from income tax should be afforded and it was for this reason that the reliefs by way of minimum earned income relief and reduced rate of tax were provided for in this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>If those reasons were important enough for the Minister to employ them in his speech on 1st July, 1970, surely they have not lost their force by 1st July, 1971?  The Minister again at column 1049 of the Official Report of 14th July, 1970, said:</P>
    <P>The two-third reduction is costing £7 million.  The Deputy mentioned that he did not think much of the release of about 50,000 taxpayers <Col N="840" /> from the net.  He thought hundreds of thousands should be released.  I would like to be able to do this but we must be realistic.  This country has to be run....  We must find money for all these things.  I do not think it is unreasonable.  We have made this improvement.  It is some saving for many people.  It releases 50,000 people from the net altogether.</P>
    <P>There is the Minister trenchantly defending his social conscience and defending his proposal which one year later he comes into this House to withdraw. Surely this is the stamp of a Government who do not know where they are going?</P>
    <P>This is regressive taxation falling on the least well off section of taxpayers. It is the withdrawal of something which was granted last year.  It indicates that the Government do not know where they are going and are foostering&mdash;having a proposal one year and withdrawing it the next year.</P>

      <P>Amended income tax forms were sent out to employers and this resulted in hardship in so far as a relatively large proportion of people's wages were deducted last <Col N="842" /> week.  The Revenue Commissioners took all the back tax since the beginning of the financial year in one fell swoop.  That was very penal.  It should have been spread over a number of weeks so as not to cause workers hardship. The people most affected were single people because it was they who bore the brunt of increased taxation.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I disagree with this section.  It is penal, it is retrogressive and it is a regressive form of taxation with which I do not agree.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in section 54 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 profits or gains arising from market gardening shall be deemed for the purpose of section 18 of the Finance Act, 1969 to arise from farming.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister will be familiar with this type of case.  No doubt he is aware that on several occasions in this House I brought a case to his notice and I was supported by many other Deputies in the matter.  It gave rise to a situation where a small horticultural producer was assessed retrospectively.</P>
      <P>I pointed out to the Minister that in this instance a man by his industry and hard work had saved sufficient money to buy five acres of land.  He had no horticultural qualifications and could be described as a labouring man who had gained experience by working in a part of the country where there was a considerable amount of market gardening carried out.  The man and wife worked very hard for a number of years.  In addition to producing vegetables the man kept a number of pigs.  After much hard work the man found he had sufficient money to buy 32 acres of land and immediately this happened the Revenue Commissioners assessed him retrospectively over a number of years, as they were entitled to do under section 54 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, under section 54 of the Income Tax Act income from market gardening is treated as income earned from a trade and the man to whom I have referred was treated as though he had earned his income from a trade.  In this instance the man achieved everything by his own efforts, he did not receive any grants from the Government or any other source, and this is how he was rewarded.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, a farmer can sell 500 acres of wheat and he is not taxed.  The person to whom I have referred had a quarter of an acre under grass, and the Revenue Commissioners insisted that he must pay up.</P>
      <P>I am asking that provision be made for such people so that they may be encouraged in their efforts to improve their way of life.  They should be encouraged to invest in their land and make it viable.  They are being deliberately prevented from doing this by our Finance Acts.  The Minister may make the case that you can have a very large horticultural concern with large areas under glass and, perhaps, a nursery, but there should be some way to reach the major producer without hitting the small man.  A man should be allowed to earn from this kind of work a decent income on which he can rear his family.  He is denied that possibility by this type of legislation.  I know the Minister is familiar with this case.  I know that it should not be necessary to press him any further on it and that he should see and accept the wisdom of the proposition I am making.  I hope the House generally will support the plea I am making in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 12 or 18 months ago I discussed in this House a somewhat similar case to the case Deputy Clinton was talking about except that in this case the amount of land which the man owned was one acre.  He did not actually own it, his father owned it.  He had been working some distance <Col N="845" /> away from home as a gardener.  His father became ill and he went home to look after him.  He put up a glasshouse and started in a small way to grow fruit and vegetables.  Subsequently he enlarged the glasshouse.  When his father recovered he worked with him. After ten years the Revenue Commissioners sent him a bill for £1,000 arrears of income tax.</P>
      <P>There was no way in which the assessment could have been made except by their deciding what would be a reasonable amount to tax him for growing and selling these vegetables. Personally I think this was mad.  The funny thing was that, since he had worked and been paid as a farm labourer, he could not understand why he should have to pay income tax on what he was earning from the garden. The amount he was earning was roughly the same as what he had been earning when he was working as a gardener and being paid as a farm labourer.  He was maintaining his father and, in my opinion, he was doing a very good job and a job which people should be encouraged to do. Despite all the pleas put forward by me and others, and despite the fact that we had questions on it in this House and it was discussed here, he had to pay a very substantial amount of money as arrears of tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton has said reasonably something which Deputy O'Donovan said in another way earlier on.  If a farmer who can sell the produce of 500 acres of land does not have to pay income tax, does it not seem terribly unreasonable that a man with an acre or a few acres on which he is growing fruit and vegetables should be treated as if he were engaged in a trade and taxed?  Deputy Clinton said that the Minister is aware of this case and that it was not necessary to press it any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is the Minister aware of the actual situation?  If he grasped it he would really understand what we are trying to come at.  There is absolutely no reason why, if the big farmer does not have to pay tax, <Col N="846" /> the small farmer should have to pay it.  This man is a small farmer.  He is a small market gardener.  He has to pay tax on only a fraction of what the big farmer has.  I know that a few other people who were engaged in this work actually had to give it up and start working as builders labourers in Dublin.  They found that it paid them better.  One of them said to me that they were never out of trouble with income tax when they were trying to run their little market gardens.  At least when they were working as builders labourers PAYE took care of the deductions and that was that.</P>
      <P>It is a terrible thing to be paying lip service to the encouragement of industry of this kind and then taxing these people into the ground.  Surely it is ridiculous that grants are being paid to these people to put up glasshouses, to heat the glasshouses, and do all the things necessary to try to give them a start, and then they are treated as operating a trade or a business rather than as agricultural employees or small farmers as they actually are. Would the Minister have a look at this and see if he agrees in any way with the point of view which we have been putting forward.  This is taxation. This is the only type of agriculturist who is taxed and that is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton is right when he says I am familiar with the kind of situation he describes.  The decision was made some years ago that market gardening should be treated as a trade. Generally speaking it will be so regarded for the purposes of income tax if three conditions are fulfilled: first, that it is a defined area; secondly, that it is permanent, that is, that it is cultivated as a market garden from year to year; and thirdly, that the method of cultivation is intensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The description which was given by both Deputy Clinton and Deputy Tully of a man, if you like, pulling himself up by his bootstraps and building up a business of this kind is one which I think is certainly accurate of a number of people involved&mdash;not by any means all, but a number.  People of that kind are fully deserving of any encouragement <Col N="847" /> we can give them.  Deputy Tully referred to the fact that they may get grants which is true, and this is a form of encouragement that is given.  In the same way grants are given to people who start up a small industry.  Anybody who does this&mdash;whether it is the establishment of a shop or a business or a small industry or a market garden or whatever it is&mdash;and who works his way up from scratch is to be commended and is the kind of person we need.  It does not follow that he should be exempt from income tax.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is reasonable that a market gardener should be treated in the same way as somebody who starts a small industry or a shop. That is the way they are treated.  It is true as Deputy Clinton said&mdash;and Deputy Tully made a similar point&mdash; that this man saves money and invests it in this.  This is true and it is to be encouraged.  He is encouraged in so far as he gets the same deductions for income tax purposes from his profit in respect of capital expenditure on machinery and plant as other traders get and, in addition, he enjoys an initial allowance of 10 per cent and an annual allowance of 10 per cent in respect of capital expenditure on market gardening buildings.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is a case for treating him differently from other people of the kind I have described. The argument made that farmers as such do not become liable for tax is another question altogether.  The fact is that market gardening is really a business and, if it should be exempt from tax, other similar kinds of businesses should be exempt from tax. Clearly this could not be contemplated and for that reason I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister still does not comprehend what is involved here.  I should like to ask him what is the difference between growing turnips to feed animals and growing turnips as vegetables for human beings.  The two men have to perform exactly the same work.  They have to be out in the same weather.  The only difference is that the man who supplies vegetables to a town or a city usually has to be up at a very <Col N="848" /> much earlier hour in the morning to load his vegetables and, still out in the weather, get them into town.  Does the Minister not accept that in addition to the fact that it is unfair to tax this man, he is placing an additional burden on the consumer because this must increase the price of vegetables as well as everything else?  Cabbage is grown for feeding to animals too.  It is the same process exactly and the same effort must be put in in order to produce a crop.  One man pays no taxation; the second man pays taxation. The Minister says he gets all the grants.  What grants, I ask the Minister, does a man get who buys five acres and crops that five acres intensively without glass?  What grants does he get?  The Minister says he gets grants in the normal way, the same as the man who sets up an industry. I am not aware of any grant that he gets.  In fact, he gets no grant and it is not fair to compare him with an industrialist.  It is not fair to treat him as if he were getting this money from a trade.  There is a discrimination here which, in my view, makes it almost unconstitutional because you have two people doing exactly the same work being treated differently from the point of view of taxation.</P>
      <P>I am amazed the Minister cannot see it in this light and provide an opportunity for people to find employment for themselves.  That is what these people are doing.  We know what it is costing us to put people into employment in industry.  Here is a man who is asking nothing from the State to provide employment for himself and, in some cases, employment for wives and families as well; there could be five or six jobs in this.  There could be ten jobs provided at no cost to the State.  We know, when we set out to provide employment opportunities in industry, what that costs the State.  I think the Minister is completely unreasonable if he cannot see a good case to be made for this amendment and I will be amazed if he turns it down without any further consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 3, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Income Tax Acts income derived from the export of tomatoes shall not be taken into account for the purpose of assessment to tax.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose the Minister will be inclined to describe this amendment as an old chestnut because I have had it up not once but twice before and while it got a sympathetic hearing from at least one Minister for Finance I know the <Col N="851" /> present Minister rejected the same sort of amendment last year.</P>
    <P>I am not going to dwell at length on this amendment.  I made the case for it before fairly exhaustively.  I explained why I felt it was important that this type of tax exemption should be provided for tomato growers.  I explained that mushrooms have this exemption.  The cultivation and growth of mushrooms is almost exactly the same as the cultivation and growth of tomatoes.  Both crops require houses, one a glasshouse and the other a mushroom house.  Both crops have to be sown and grown and they are packed in almost identical containers when they are being exported.</P>
    <P>The situation is that mushrooms have this exemption and tomatoes do not.  The products of fish farms also have this exemption and here again there is no processing, it is merely a question of growing, packing and sending them out.  Most other industrial products enjoy exemption from income tax on exports and it has always been a puzzle to me why tomatoes were not included in the list.</P>
    <P>When I raised this before I explained that the tomato industry had reached a fairly critical period in its development.  The Government, as the Minister will appreciate, have spent large sums by way of grants to encourage the development of the tomato industry.  We have reached the point where for most months of the year we are able to supply our own requirements and in certain periods we have a quantity in excess of our own requirements.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage where, for further expansion of the industry, it is vital to have organised exportation of tomatoes.  The Minister will be aware that the tomato growers have asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries on many occasions to set up a proper marketing board so that they could get into the export market on a sizeable scale.  It is necessary to get this scale of production if we are to secure an export market because we must be able to supply the large stores in England and must be able to guarantee continuous supply over the years. The small supplier will not do this. <Col N="852" /> We are dependent on the bigger suppliers to develop an export trade in tomatoes.</P>
    <P>I put down the amendment in the hope that the Minister would see the very great importance of it at this time.  We are negotiating entry to the EEC.  We had a long discussion yesterday about hard bargaining and the hard bargaining that is being struck by the various continental applicant countries.  We admire them for making this hard bargain.  We have been assured by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it will be agreed to allow the income tax relief on exports to stand until 1990.  That is one of the things that will be of very great benefit to a country in a situation of under development such as we are in.  The Dutch farmers, particularly in relation to tomato production get many subsidies and advantages that growers in this country do not enjoy.  There is a great case to be made now for giving this exemption to tomato growers so as to encourage production.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that grants for tomato houses have been suspended because, I suppose, of shortage of money and will be suspended until the confidence is created that growers will engage in export trade instead of selling their produce on the Irish market to the point where there is a surplus.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of encouragement that will cost the State nothing.  The State is gaining nothing at the moment. Acceptance of the amendment is the way to develop and encourage production. It will give us a certain advantage that it is to be hoped we will be able to retain until 1990 and will give the producers an opportunity to build up the industry.  There is everything to be said for the amendment.  I do not want to prolong the discussion on it. A man who grows peas and dries them and exports them gets the exemption. If he does any sort of little processing of vegetables and packs them and sends them to England he gets the exemption.  Why should tomato growers be singled out?  Why should they not get the exemption?  It is all wrong. I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>If this were to be conceded there is no reason why it should not be extended to all horticultural produce.  Indeed, a case could be made for agricultural produce generally.  That is the first reason why I must oppose the amendment but there are two other reasons.  One of them is that in the light of Article 13 of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement very careful consideration would have to be given to this as to whether we were entitled to do it.  The other reason is&mdash;and the Deputy referred to it&mdash;the negotiations for entry to the EEC, the importance of retaining the incentives which we have.  There is no doubt about it that at this stage to extend the tax exemption on exports could only complicate and make more difficult, to say the least, our negotiations with the EEC in regard to the retention of the existing tax exemption. So, for all these reasons I find myself unable to agree to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made two statements which I should just like to refer to.  He said that he had serious doubt as to whether we could do this having regard to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  The Minister should know that tomatoes are outside this.  Tomatoes are one of the things that did not come within the scope of the agreement.  That is the first thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not this part of it, which is the exemption from tax.  It would come into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would disagree with the Minister on this.  The second thing is that the Minister talks about its being an embarrassment to bring this in at this time now that we are negotiating terms of entry to the EEC.  This is great nonsense in view of the fact that every day we are negotiating new arrangements for industries that will <Col N="854" /> be given this taxation relief.  The Industrial Development Authority have not stood still.  They are continuing to enter into new contracts.  I am deliberately describing them as contracts because the Minister for Foreign Affairs told us a few days ago that the arrangement for this tax relief until 1990 was being regarded by the Government as a contract that they would honour.</P>
      <P>If we are doing hard bargaining and trying to develop our own industry and to provide employment opportunities for our people and if the future of the horticultural industry is something we are nervous about, in these circumstances we should be trying in every possible way to assist the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that if the amendment is passed there is the same case to be made for all agricultural produce.  I ask the Minister again what agricultural products is he talking about.  Surely he knows that none of the agricultural products are paying taxation.  If there are any that are paying taxation, I do not know them.  I say to the Minister that he has made no case except that he will not agree to any change in existing legislation, whatever the case that is made for it. This is a deplorable stand for a Minister to take, and an irresponsible stand.  Simply and solely because a member of the Opposition brings in an amendment that has immense merit by any calculation, it is something to be rejected.  The Minister has made no case against the amendment.  The same thing happened on the last amendment.  He made no case against it.  In this case he has failed completely to make a case against the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We used to have in the Minister's predecessor's time a phrase used by him very often&mdash;indeed I was expecting the Minister to use that phrase today: &ldquo;I agree that there is great merit in the case being made by the Deputy but...&rdquo;&mdash;either it was too difficult or it would be too expensive. This was a stock phrase used for a number of years by Mr. Haughey when he was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The week before last I had a call from one of the many tomato growers <Col N="855" /> in my area who told me that the price of tomatoes had dropped to 12s a chip, 12s for 12 lbs and that the ones that were substandard&mdash;small and badly shaped ones&mdash;were being sold by him for about 5p a chip.  I do not think they would be bought in the shops at that price.  Because there is supposed to be an embargo on foreign produced tomatoes during a certain period there seems to be the impression that the producers are making a fortune and consequently they are fair game for taxes.  Like Deputy Clinton, I ask why they should be singled out for income tax?  We were defeated in our efforts to have market gardeners exempted.  If we want to tax people, let us tax those whose incomes are big and not tax those who may have a good season, as they had last year but who, this year, will not have a good season.  The case for the amendment is very strong.  The least the Minister might do would be to have another look at it and ascertain whether, on further consideration, it could be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The case put by Deputy Clinton for this amendment is a valid one and the Minister is adopting a wrong stand on the matter.  To say that acceptance of the amendment would lead to complications is puerile even in the context of the EEC.  Our main competitors on the British market are the Dutch and they have good subsidies available to them.  One of the main subsidies is in respect of oil used in the heating of glasshouses.  The Dutch benefit from the low cost oil that they use whereas the oil used here is very expensive.  Profits on exported tomatoes should not be subject to income tax.  We should be doing everything in our power to encourage growers to export.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude in relation to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the employment involved in tomato growing&mdash;in the packing, the grading and in the haulage and export of tomatoes?  The present position is that practically the only export we have of tomatoes is to the North of Ireland. <Col N="856" /> The reason for that is that people from the North of Ireland come with their lorries and collect the tomatoes. This does not involve our growers in any exceptional risk but it would be easy to over-supply that market.  There is an opening on the British market but last year at a conference held here we had a representative of the British supermarkets and he stated emphatically that there were no tomatoes on the British market to compare with Irish grown tomatoes.  He said that they would be extremely anxious to enter into a long-term contract with Irish growers if they could be assured of a constant supply.  Such supply would require organisation.  It would require assistance of a nature that the growers are not getting at present from either the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries or Finance.  Surely it would not cost very much to help the growers to establish themselves in the export trade.  In any case, they would only enjoy this until 1990.  The employment potential in this particular industry is extremely good but the industry must be developed.  The grants given up to a year or two ago towards the building of glasshouses were an indication of the desire to develop the industry but these grants were stopped at a time when we were glutting the Irish market.  However, there has been failure to do anything about an export market.  I have discussed this problem with many growers and they say that it would be an expensive business to establish an export trade and that consequently, the Government should assist them.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude to this amendment and, if necessary, to bring in an amendment in some other form if he does not think that this particular one is drafted in a way that meets the situation.  Personally, I think this amendment, as it stands, could be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I wish to make.  First, I should like to refute the allegation made by Deputy Clinton to the effect that I was not accepting the amendment solely because it was put down by an Opposition member.  I have never adopted that attitude in this House and I hope <Col N="857" /> I never will.  It may be that Deputy Clinton believes all the right is on his side and that I have made no case against his argument.  He is entitled to that view but, of course, I would not agree.  However, I would ask him to accept that my opposition to this is not simply because it was put down by him or by any member of his party. I oppose it for the reasons I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton has swept aside these reasons but that does not eradicate the difficulties involved. Regarding the question of pressure building up for exemption from tax on profits derived from exports of agricultural produce generally, Deputy Clinton seemed to think this was ridiculous because he thinks that tax is not paid.  In fact, companies are still chargeable on profits to corporation profits tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>How many farm companies have we?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number. They certainly qualify for export tax relief.  If this were granted they would be entitled to make the case that they should be exempted from tax on profits from exports.  I imagine it would be impossible to resist it.  In any event, Deputy Clinton has not made any worthwhile answer to the two points I mentioned in regard to the free trade area agreement and, more particularly, to the EEC negotiations.  I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>This is what I complain of.  I accept that the amendment is not being turned down simply because it was put down by an Opposition member but it is being turned down without a case being made for its rejection and without the Minister having figures to substantiate his statements. This is unfortunate.  It is stated specifically that tomatoes are outside the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  That is my answer to that.  If tomatoes present a particular embarrassment as the negotiations are in progress, how is it that every fresh proposal for an industry in this country entering into new contracts is not an embarrassment?</P>

      <P>We had no statute last year and we had not started our negotiations and the Minister advanced exactly the same argument.  That is why I do not accept that it is a sincere argument.  I could not possibly accept <Col N="860" /> that it is a sincere argument.  I fail to see that the Minister has put up a point.  If I could see even one point on which reasonable opposition to an amendment could be hung I would accept it but I do not accept that there has been a case made by the Minister at all.  He had no figures or facts to back his statement.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the section because of subsection (5).  The White Paper issued with the Bill says:</P>
      <P>The section secures, in the case of any such arrangement&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is an arrangement about having a loan outside the State and so on&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the foreign income so applied will be treated as having been remitted to the State, unless that income was applied before 6 April, 1972, in satisfaction of a loan made before 28 April, 1971.</P>
      <P>What the Minister, in fact, is doing is sanctifying what was legal evasion of tax for a further year.  I cannot see, in view of the way he treated company taxation last year, how he can do this logically.  I think this is pandering to certain individuals and I should like to know how many individuals will benefit from subsection (5) of this section.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it all right. I do not think I can give the Deputy details of the numbers who might benefit from this but I can tell him why subsection (5) is there.  It was considered that section 4 ought not operate in a case in which a debt was incurred in 1971-72 before this legislation was announced or foreshadowed in the Budget speech.  If the foreign income is applied during the year 1971-72 in satisfaction of that debt provision is made in subsection (5) in this way to avoid any suggestion that the legislation was retrospective because if we did not include this subsection it would certainly be argued here that it was very unfair to get at people in this way who had incurred this debt that would be in question without having any knowledge that the law was going to be changed.  What they did was perfectly legal at the time they did it. <Col N="862" /> Notice was given in the Budget speech that it was intended to bring in this provision and the object of subsection (5) is to ensure that people who acted lawfully and effected loans abroad, would not be retrospectively caught by the section.</P>

      <P>Yes, in so far as there are many small family businesses, either in partnerships or held by individual families, and it has been <Col N="864" /> my experience that when the person who established or carried on the business died without making a will invariably there is a legal wrangle between the family.  This could be avoided if the business was made a company because it is much easier to deal with a company for the purpose of estate duty.  The Minister should try to encourage this practice rather than legislate on minor points. In this case it appears he is pandering to the Society of Chartered Accountants or some other group who can take care of themselves.  The Minister's time would be better spent in trying to help small business to become incorporated and this would help very many people in regard to the administration of estates.</P>

      <P>The Minister dealt with this matter the other day at Question Time and he quoted figures.  I hope he will forgive me for pointing out to him that they were different figures. If my memory serves me correctly, it was stated first that there were 280,000 single taxpayers but by some peculiar calculation that figure became 440,000 at a later stage in the day.  The Minister always appears to think that I am trying to twist the figures but I assure him I am not.  I should be interested to know how the 280,000 became 440,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister consider that the extensions from £225 to £250 and £125 to £150 are a valuable concession or that they mean very much?  In view of the fact that the Minister said that the £11 per year demanded was not a heavy impost, how can he state that the concessions in section 6 are important? Does the Minister not agree that if any worthwhile concession is to be given to income taxpayers it must be given now?  If money continues to lose its value, as it has been doing in the past few years, the Minister will be able to say that what will cost £4 million or £5 million today will cost three times as much in the next few years.  In a year in which there has been a jump from some £130 million to £141 million, surely this is the time when a decent concession <Col N="866" /> could be given.

      <P>No; 280,000 was the figure given by the Taoiseach in a debate last year as being the number of single persons who would have to pay.  He said that a concession of £10 would amount to £2,800,000 in a year. I assumed that that meant 280,000 single people.  This year in one of the Minister's statements, possibly in his Budget speech&mdash;I will have a look at it tomorrow&mdash;he mentioned 280,000 single persons who were taxpayers. What I am trying to get at is this: everybody including the Minister must admit that we cannot continue to have almost exactly the same tax free allowance for single and married persons, as we had 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>A single person was taxed at £6 5s 15 years ago when the wages of an ordinary rural labourer were not very much more, if they were any more, than £6 5s.  Married persons were then taxed on anything over ten guineas. They are still taxed on that amount but 15 years ago, even with a substantial amount of overtime, they would not have had to pay any income tax and now they have to pay income tax.  The minimum amount laid down for subsistence for an ordinary farm worker is about £16.50 in the poorest area in the country.  The State will tax him on £6 of that if he is married even though it is laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board that it would take £16.50 to keep him in frugal comfort.  I am sure the Minister appreciates what is happening.  As this is so, surely the time has come when something should be done about our tax laws and changing our system of income taxation.  It is all very well to say that would cost a lot of money, or that it cannot be done this year, but, as each year goes by, it will become more and more difficult to give a decent concession.  I suggest, as has been suggested by Deputy O'Higgins earlier, that the Minister should tax the people who can afford to pay and allow those who really need the money in order to exist to earn a decent income without that income being taxed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a relief to which the Minister referred in his Budget statement and which he is now bringing in in this section.  To understand the position in relation to section 9 it is necessary to have a look at section 139 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section provided for a relief in respect of persons taking charge of children of a widower, a widow, or a married man living apart from his wife.  The pivotal provision in section 139 is:</P>
      <P>If the claimant proves that he is a widower and that for the year of assessment a person being a female relative of his or of his deceased wife is resident with him for the purpose of having the charge and care of any child of his, or he proves that he has no female relative of his own or of his deceased wife who is able or willing to take such charge and that he has employed some other female person to undertake the same...</P>
      <P>So, under section 139, it has to be proved that there is a female relative resident with the widower, or that he has no female relative and that he employed a person to take charge of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section adds a new subsection at the end of section 139 providing that the section shall also apply to a claimant being an unmarried woman who throughout the year of assessment is in full-time employment or engaged full-time in some trade, <i>et cetera</i>.  There <Col N="869" /> are consequential amendments.  The Minister is proposing to provide for the unmarried mother but under this section, read together with section 139, he is stipulating that she must have a female relative resident with her, or she must prove that she has no female relative and that she must employ somebody to take charge of the child.</P>
    <P>I believe this is utterly unworkable. The very moment you stipulate the kind of case you are dealing with you find it improbable that there will be a female relative resident with her. When you provide that she must be engaged in full-time employment you must envisage it as being improbable that she will employ anybody to take charge of the child.  I accept that the Minister intends a relief in this respect, but I would suggest that the sensible thing would be to grant the allowance where any person, not necessarily a female, and not necessarily a relative, is called in to take charge of the child.  If you read it into section 139, the restrictions built in already make the proposal impractical from the point of view of giving a worthwhile relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure that I follow Deputy O'Higgins although I think I do.  The intention here is to provide what is commonly known as a housekeeper allowance for an unmarried mother in the same circumstances as it is provided at present for a widower.  The housekeeper allowance would not be available unless the housekeeper was a female relative acting as such.  I am not sure if I understand Deputy O'Higgins correctly.</P>

      <P>Take the unmarried mother with a child.  The mother goes out to work.  It is not realistic to imagine (a) a female relative resident in the house or (b) that unmarried mother being in a position to employ a housekeeper.  What such a person does as often as not is to farm out&mdash; I do not say that in any derisory way &mdash;the child in a neighbour's house and make a payment to the neighbour to look after the child while the mother is working.  That is how this will arise and that, I think, is probably what was <Col N="870" /> in the Minister's mind.  Under the section as drafted that unmarried mother would not qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point now.  I should say, I think, that I am quite certain that both of the situations envisaged in the section&mdash;that is a female relative or a housekeeper employed&mdash;do arise.  I know personally of both categories, but I admit the kind of case to which Deputy O'Higgins refers also arises and on the face of it, it might look as if it is not covered by the section.  I am advised that the case mentioned by the Deputy is, in fact, covered by the section because the person involved does not have to reside with the unmarried mother in order to claim and the kind of situation in which, as the Deputy said, she farms out the child during the day and makes a payment to the person who looks after it would, in fact, be covered by the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an acute shortage of nurses both in Dublin and throughout the country and I believe this would provide an inducement which would bring married nurses back again into the nursing profession. I have been approached by many married nurses who say that, because of the income tax situation, it would not be worth their while to go back into nursing.  Their husbands, of course, are in taxable employment.  This is an effort to provide an inducement to married nurses to come back into nursing. In Dublin we have provided beds in hospitals at an enormous cost to the State and we are simply not able to fill those beds because we have not the nursing personnel.  Most hospitals in Dublin are completely understaffed because they cannot get nurses.  There is no doubt about it, the nurses are there and would come back if they were not faced with this enormous deduction for income tax purposes.  I do not have to paint the picture any more vividly. Every Deputy is aware of the acute shortage of nurses and of the desirability of providing the sort of relief suggested here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am in favour of the idea that people who work hard, particularly people who work at jobs like this, should get a higher income tax remission, I am afraid I cannot agree that this is the answer to the problem.  It would represent about an extra £1 per week in cash to nurses.  I do not think that is the sort of thing that will bring nurses back into hospitals. The responsibility for this falls on another Minister.  The Minister for Health is the man who should do the decent thing about married nurses and, if he does, the problem will be solved pretty easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> There is one objection to this amendment. This would be a selective tax remission and that would not be a very good idea.  It has been said again and again that we cannot single out certain sections and give them tax remissions. A few years ago we did, in fact, single out writers, artists and other people like that.  I do not know what the idea was.  Someone suggested there would be a swarm of these people into the country spending their very big salaries here.  They did not come.  Subsequently I asked that local authority firemen be included in this tax remission and I was told an exception could not be made.  Apparently everybody is equal but some are more equal than others and writers and artists are more equal than local authority firemen.  I believe the same answer will be given with regard to nurses.  While I would like to see these people treated fairly it does not appear to me this amendment is the answer to the problem.  For that reason I could not agree with what Deputy Clinton said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the point raised by Deputy Tully: this amendment would make a certain category of taxpayer more privileged than others.  I would suggest to the Minister that this is a case in which that might be done.  I do not see anything wrong in principle in respect of including differentials in taxation if the end which that seeks to achieve is socially desirable and that is the position here.  I can confirm that in provincial areas as well as in the Dublin region there is a chronic shortage of nurses.  It is a problem of serious proportions in some parts and if a concession of this nature had the effect of enticing married nurses back to working in hospitals&mdash;the amendment might need to be tightened up from that point of view&mdash;I think it should be acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  There are two main reasons for this.  First, there are other categories of people, besides nurses, for whom the same case could be made that they are in short supply and their contribution by way of their work to the community is extremely valuable and desirable.  Clearly, if one <Col N="873" /> accepts the principle in the case of nurses there are other cases in which one would have to accept the same principle.  That is not the full extent of the problem.  The full extent of the problem was illustrated quite clearly by what Deputy Tully said.  He said that not alone was this a form of increase in earnings&mdash;and, perhaps, the right way to deal with the case where earnings should be increased is not by income tax allowance&mdash;but he indicated that in the event of such a concession as is sought here being granted there would be considerable pressure for the same concession to be granted not merely on the basis of people who are in short supply or whose work was particularly valuable but on the basis that there should not be a selective concession of this nature.</P>
      <P>I feel very definitely if this concession were to be granted that there would be very great pressure to grant it to all married women who were earning and whose husbands were earning.  Any such concession would, of course, run into considerable sums, about £3½ million or, perhaps, a little under that and we could not comtemplate that.  The principle involved is one about which I would be extremely doubtful no matter what precedents may exist at the moment for exemption or for a selective application of the income tax code.  It seems to me very important to preserve as far as possible the principle that a person's income determines the amount of tax that person pays irrespective of his occupation and any departure from that is fraught with all sorts of difficulties.  The solution to the problem outlined by Deputy Clinton is not merely to be found in income tax concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Tully says that this does not really meet the problem to any great extent. It is merely a gesture.  It is a step in the right direction.  In the normal way I would not favour selective taxation but we have precedents for it.  All income is not taxed and we would not be departing from precedent in this connection where there is a great need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things I should like to point out is that in most cases married <Col N="874" /> nurses want to get night work, which is very essential work.  The way we are treating married nurses at the moment means that we are depriving patients of proper care because we do not have sufficient nurses to nurse them particularly at night.  It is fair to say that this could be put right if the Minister for Health agreed to a higher salary for married nurses than for single nurses but this would lead to its own difficulties and its own problems.  It is very difficult to know how this is to be solved without grasping a nettle because it is a nettle no matter how one tries to grasp it. It occurred to me to put down this amendment as I thought it an opportunity to try to do something to improve the present situation.</P>

      <P>In page 8, before section 13, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 251 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (4) (c) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1968) of &ldquo;the 1st day of April, 1973&rdquo; for &ldquo;the 1st day of April, 1971&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of free depreciation in respect of machinery or plant which is proposed by section 24 of the Bill provides in effect for accelerated wear and tear.  The provisions relating to wear and tear enable that allowance to be claimed only when the machinery or plant is actually brought into use for the purpose of the trade and this applies also to free depreciation.  For this reason, a trader who incurs capital expenditure on machinery or plant in the two year period over which free depreciation will operate will not be able to claim free depreciation if the machinery or plant is not brought into use in that period.  In this event, under existing law, he could claim only the basic initial allowance of 20 per cent.  In order to avoid worsening the position of such a trader, this amendment proposes the extension for a further two years of the period of operation of the increased initial allowance of 60 per cent which applied to capital expenditure <Col N="877" /> on machinery or plant incurred in the period 1st April, 1968 to the 31st March, 1971.</P>

The purpose of this amendment is to raise the limit from £250 to £350.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 14, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 340 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 is hereby amended <Col N="878" /> by the addition of the following paragraph&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(h) a pension payable under the Army Pensions Acts not exceeding £350 per annum&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that section 340 provides for certain exemptions for Army personnel and I was hoping by this amendment to induce the Minister to exempt pensions up to this figure of £350.  I recommend this to the House because this applies in the main to men who served in the Army over a long period, who got very small pensions and who were in the Army at a time when it was actually dangerous to be in the Army.  They feel they earned this pension and some of them who have left the Army and have since taken up other employment find themselves being very heavily taxed.  I have had considerable representations made to me about this by men who are fortunately now in the position of not being afraid to make representations since they are not breaking any rule or regulation by doing so as they are out of the Army.</P>
    <P>I have a very long correspondence here and I should like to quote a little from it if I may and if I am in order.</P>
    <P>One man writes:</P>
    <P>In your capacity as the shadow Minister for Defence of our party, can I ask you to try and have put right something that has for years been crying out to have justice done, namely, the defence forces pension schemes, and income tax?</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy, I served with the Air Corps at Baldonnel, now Casement Aerodrome, County Dublin, for 24 years, 44 days, 10 hours, 15 minutes and some few seconds.  My discharge book states that I was discharged on the &ldquo;18th July, 1952. Rank, sergeant; grade, technician; classification, fitter and artificer. Cause of discharge: on pension after 21 years service.  Military conduct, exemplary&rdquo;.  The testimonial in the discharge books reads in part: &ldquo;He reached the highest grade in all trades and was promoted on his merits.  His employment is recommended as a first class technician and a loyal worker.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> This, the Minister will agree, is a fairly decent build-up to a man who had served his country.  I quote further from his letter:</P>
    <P>I had succeeded in obtaining employment with Aer Lingus Teo, at Dublin Airport, as an aircraft mechanic, which post I entered upon on the 18th May, 1952.  Oh, yes, we old soldiers were well treated going out the gate.  I got three weeks pay (sergeant's), three weeks ration money and, oh yes, £2 for the &ldquo;Martin Henry&rdquo; suit, a superably cut (with a knife) garment, in best Birmingham tweed.</P>
    <P>I am ashamed to tell you what my daily rate of pay was for my rank and qualifications.  This I can tell you&mdash;I was and am blessed to have married a good wife...</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote the whole letter. The letter, while amusing in parts, describes in some considerable detail the type of service that these men gave to the country and the type of reward they got for it and the fact that now, having served for a long number of years, they come out with a small pension. All of us know the important part NCOs in particular play in the Army and it is an NCO who is making this particular representation to me. They come out with this very small pension and find they are taxed to such an extent when they take up another job that they might as well not have got the pension.  I shall quote a couple of other short paragraphs that I think relevant:</P>
    <P>Deputy, I find myself not a whit the better off for the lousy pension I earned the hard way, for I am forced to return it to the Minister for Finance under the income tax. Why, in God's name, should we old servicemen be put in the position that in the autumn of our years, we are taxed to the hilt on the pension that we earned hard in the Army that was not so popular then as now?</P>
    <P>The final paragraph I should like to quote is:</P>
    <P>Can I request you, please, to do <Col N="880" /> all in your power to see if our &ldquo;unearned payment&rdquo; of a lousy pension can be made tax free for us, so that we can now try to enjoy the good things of life and prepare ourselves for our retirement as senior citizens?  This for all us servicemen that served before 1932 will help to bring us in line with the people who now retire on a much higher rate of pension and are given a gratuity to help them enter civilian life.  I could not even get a bob from the &ldquo;Army Benevolent Fund&rdquo; to assist me to obtain a tool kit for my new employment.</P>

Also, we are in touch with the Post Office and we hope it may be possible to introduce a scheme whereby farmers and other self-employed persons can collect cards to which they can affix stamps.

      <P>Before the change of business I had practically finished making the case for a further exemption under section 340 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to include Army pensions up to the figure of £350.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment as it stands perhaps he could accept it to provide for people who served up to a certain year and not include fairly recent retirements because the people who retired more recently have got considerable advantages over what older people who retired earlier and who served earlier have got.  The Minister will appreciate that Army pensions generally are very poor but when you go back to the period about which I am mainly concerned and if you take the case I was working on before the change of business that man in the course of his correspondence told me that when he joined the Air Corps he was getting 13s 6d per week.  This type of man has been very badly treated by the people.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I find myself also unable to agree to this amendment.  The argument advanced by Deputy Clinton is quite convincing in regard to the case he has made but, of course, a very good case can be made for many other categories.  This gets us back to a point we dealt with on a previous amendment and that is the undesirability of departing from the code of income tax being applied as far as possible on the same basis to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> Perhaps I can illustrate how strongly this line has been taken in similar cases urged in the past when I remind the House that income tax is payable on Old IRA pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would probably agree with me when I say that if exemption were to be given that category perhaps should come before any other.  Deputy Tully mentioned earlier in another connection that representations had been made to exempt from income tax payments made to part-time firemen, for whom a very good case can be made too.  In effect, what this amounts to is an increase in pension and a very strong objection which I would have to this kind of exemption, apart from the one on general principle which I have mentioned, is that it is not an appropriate method of providing an increase in pension because pensioners in the lower income groups who are not liable to tax would not derive any benefit at all from it and it would only be those in the higher income brackets who would obtain an increase.  I have some figures here.  A single man with no other income will not be liable for income tax unless his pension exceeds £399 per annum.  In the case of a married man where neither he nor his wife has any other income there will be no liability unless the pension exceeds £674 per annum.  In cases like that no benefit would accrue to such people from this exemption.  For both the reason of general principle and also for the latter reason, that it would operate more for people with some income above the minimum than those at the bottom of the scale, I am afraid I cannot agree to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister freely admits that these Army pensions are very bad pensions.  I am sure he will appreciate that the only way these can be increased is by the Minister for Finance agreeing that they should be increased.  He objects to this amendment mainly because it is an increase, in fact, in pension.  Is there any way in which the people who have been wronged, and I say wronged deliberately, can be compensated except in <Col N="885" /> some way of this kind?  There is no attempt to bring these people up to parity and no apology from anybody. The facts are known&mdash;that these people gave the service, that they worked for practically nothing, that they retired on very small pensions and that in spite of this they are to have no increase to bring their pensions up or no relief from income tax where they are taxable.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a rather technical matter if I may.  This section, which is an amendment to both sections 443 and 444 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, must be read in relation to the object of these sections. These sections provide that under certain circumstances income settled by a parent on his infant child is deemed to be income of that parent. The explanatory memorandum in relation to section 14 says the section is designed to &ldquo;remove an anomaly in those provisions of the Income Tax Acts which secure that income settled by a parent on his child will, in certain circumstances, be deemed to be the income of the parent&rdquo;.  Because those provisions operate only if the child was under the age of 21 years and unmarried at the commencement of the year of assessment in which the income is paid, they do not apply in the case of a child born later in the year.  The section provides that in future the income will be deemed to be that of the parent if the child was under the age of 21 years and unmarried at the date of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the section does remove this anomaly, I think it is possible that it has an effect outside and beyond what is described as its purpose in the explanatory <Col N="886" /> memorandum.  In the case of a discretionary settlement whose objects include not only infant children of the settlor but also other persons such as adult persons or strangers, section 443 does not apply so long as the income is accumulated and is not paid to or for the benefit of an infant child.  I can understand that the introduction into a discretionary settlement of objects, possible beneficiaries, in addition to infant children defeated the operation of section 443 and defeated the object of that section so long as the income was not, in fact, paid to an infant child.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (1) of this Bill is designed to overcome this defect from a revenue point of view because it amends section 443 by deleting the reference to being &ldquo;payable or accumulated&rdquo; and inserts a proviso whereby any income which may become payable or applicable to or for the benefit of a child of the settlor in the future shall be deemed to be paid to that child or if there is more than one child, to each of the children equally.  This amendment of section 443 I would regard as not unreasonable but I am troubled by the phrase used in the proviso &ldquo;provided that (a) for the purposes of this Chapter, but subject to section 444...&rdquo;  In other words, the amendment proposed must be read subject to section 444 and this, I think, creates a difficulty which I want to raise now with the Minister so that it may be examined.</P>
    <P>This is the difficulty as I see it. Under section 444, section 443 does not apply in respect of income accumulated for the benefit of an infant child where the settlement is an irrevocable instrument, that is, a settlement under which neither the settlor nor his wife can take any benefit.  Section 14 of the Bill now amends paragraph (a) of section 444 by deleting the reference to the child being under age so that section 444 would apply to accumulations for the benefit of a child whether an infant or not.  This seems to be the effect but it seems to me that it does not go far enough because the relief given by section 444 in respect of income accumulated under an irrevocable instrument would not apply where the instrument is a <Col N="887" /> discretionary settlement whose objects include not only children of the settlor but also persons such as his grandchildren or other more remote relatives because in such a case it could not be said that the accumulation was for the benefit of a child or children while at the same time the amendment to section 443 would cause that section to apply to such a settlement.</P>
    <P>This result, I think, is possible.  I doubt that it was intended under section 14 as it is proposed.  The purpose of both these sections in the Income Tax Act, sections 443 and 444 and the other earlier statutory provisions from which they derive, was to treat income under a settlement as still being the settlor's income where it was, in fact, paid to his infant child or where it was accumulated for his infant child under a settlement under which the settlor or his wife could benefit.  If this is the effect, we are creating another quite anomalous situation because, if I am right in suggesting that it is the possible effect, then under a discretionary trust which is an irrevocable instrument whose objects are confined to the children of the settlor and only confined to them, accumulations of income would be entitled to the benefit of section 444.  But if the settlement included objects in addition to the children of the settlor such as his grandchildren or some other more distant relative the accumulation of income would not have the benefit of section 444 but would fall under section 443 under the amendment now proposed.</P>
    <P>It seems that as a result of that a very real ambiguity may be created as to the operation of sections 443 and 444 in relation to accumulations under a discretionary trust and I think we should now endeavour to remove that possible ambiguity by some appropriate provision.  I have not tabled an amendment but I suggest to the Minister for consideration between now and Report Stage that the difficulty I mention might be overcome if paragraph (a) of section 444 were altered to read as follows&mdash;in other words, if we removed the present paragraph (a) of section 444: &ldquo;Section 443 (1) shall <Col N="888" /> not apply in respect of any part of such income which is in the said year of assessment accumulated for the benefit of the child of a settlor or for the benefit of persons who include or may include a child of the settlor nor in respect of income arising in the said year of assessment from accumulations of the income hereinbefore mentioned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think an amendment along those lines&mdash;the words may not be precise although I think they are&mdash;and the substitution of such a paragraph for paragraph (a) of section 444 would meet the possible ambiguity that I believe and am advised may result from the amendments now proposed to section 14.  I appreciate that the Minister may not wish to deal with this matter at this stage but I should like him to consider it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Obviously I must have my amendments mixed up a little, but in relation to this section I had intended to do what is proposed in relation to section 18, namely to deal with the proposed increase in interest rates put forward in the section.  The present rules of interest on overdue tax are contained in sections 550 to 552 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The interest payable by the taxpayer is not allowable for tax purposes under section 550 (3).  The Minister now proposes to increase the interest rate to 9 per cent and this is a most punitive increase.  For a trading company an increase to 9 per cent is equivalent to a tax allowable interest rate of 21 per cent.  It is a penal rate and will cause considerable hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the equivalent?  In Britain the rate is 6 per cent and I think the <Col N="889" /> position is that no interest is payable where the tax assessed is less than £1,000.  Here we are proposing 9 per cent, irrespective of the amount of tax. In addition, under subsection (2) (a) of the proposed section the period of grace is reduced from three months to two months.  Subsection (2) (a) (iii) provides for the insertion of a subsection and there are provisions therein that can operate very harshly in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2A) (b) deals with circumstances wherein there is a dispute initially between the inspector and the taxpayer.  Either there is an agreement or otherwise and there may be a notice of appeal to the appeals commissioners. There may be, and frequently is, the situation in which there is a genuine dispute as to liability in respect of a substantial portion of the assessment.  The inspector may seek a payment on account, approximating to the total eventual liability.  The taxpayer, from his point of view, might reasonably offer to pay the amount which it not in dispute and, in those circumstances, a payment on account may not be agreed.  As things are at the moment, it may be a considerable time before the appeal is listed or decided.  Under this proposal where there is genuine disagreement between the taxpayer and the inspector, unless the taxpayer lodges 80 per cent of the tax as assessed he will not get any interest benefit.</P>
    <P>Where there is a genuine dispute, a provision of this kind will put the disputing taxpayer in a most unenviable position.  He must pay 80 per cent although he genuinely believes his tax liability should be only 10 per cent or 15 per cent of the assessment.  This is rigging the stage far too much against a taxpayer who has a genuine dispute. I suggest the Minister should consider modifying the figure of 80 per cent to make a distinction between the payment of a tax which is not in dispute, to provide for the case where the taxpayer pays what he genuinely believes to be the sum for which he is liable. In fact, he should be encouraged to appeal his liability in respect of the balance and appropriate measures could follow.  If he loses the appeal and <Col N="890" /> is held to be liable he should get benefit at least in relation to the amount of tax he has paid.  It is unduly restrictive on a taxpayer who has a genuine grievance to make it imperative that he lodge 80 per cent of the tax liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the opposition to this section because it is unjustifiably penal.  It increases the rate of interest on unpaid tax and it decreases the time allowance for payment of tax which has been assessed and agreed.  It introduces a novel section in so far as it positively discourages people from appealing and, in effect, it penalises them for appealing. It has always been implicit in the income tax code that the taxpayer has the right of appeal to a special commissioner and thence to a Circuit Court judge.  It is contrary to justice if any measure is introduced that inhibits that right of appeal.  This section is designed specifically to discourage a taxpayer from appealing.  One must assume that the Revenue Commissioners experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nearly a commercial rate on tax which he says is not due.  To that extent I do not think it can be denied that it inhibits his right to appeal.  If the appeal takes some time to determine, the interest is payable all along and the compulsion is on the taxpayer to pay tax so as to save interest on tax which he feels should be the subject of an appeal.  It is unfair to him in his position as a citizen <i>vis-á-vis</i> the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Revenue Commissioners feel that there have been abuses in appeals to the Special Commissioners and to the Circuit Court.  The answer certainly is not to <Col N="891" /> do anything which inhibits this right which has always been a characteristic of our income tax code.  There is already provision in the Income Tax Act 1967, whereby the Special Commissioner on hearing an application, perhaps for an adjournment before he hears an appeal, has power to order the payment of a sum on account of the tax found due in the original assessment. This power is quite adequate to deter frivolous and time-wasting appeals without bringing in this section charging interest on tax which has not been finally adjudicated.</P>
    <P>There is a saver in paragraph (2A) which states that if there is an agreement between the inspector and the appellant on a payment on account no interest is charged.  All I can say to that is: &ldquo;Thanks for nothing.&rdquo;  The Special Commissioner can make that arrangement already.  The other saver says that if the appellant wants to avoid paying interest on tax which might not be found due eventually, and if he has refused for some good reason of his own to come to an agreement with his inspector, he can pay 80 per cent.  He is not the person to say what 80 per cent consists of in £sd because 80 per cent cannot be established until a time <i>in futuro</i> when the appeal has been finally determined.  He is making a guess that if he states a sum and it turns out to be 80 per cent of what is eventually found to be due he is safe, and if it turns out to be less he is not safe.</P>
    <P>I know that there are provisions that if his assessment is reduced and he is found to have overpaid his interest there will be a refund of interest by the Revenue Commissioners to him. Again, thanks for nothing.  This is equivalent to saying: &ldquo;If I mistakenly cut your throat and you lose a pint of blood I will give you back a free transfusion of the same pint of blood.&rdquo;&ldquo;Too smart by half&rdquo; is the note I have opposite the section in question and I think that about summarises my feelings on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the income tax code should be unduly penal and certainly the provisions in <Col N="892" /> this section are penal.  The assessment of income tax itself is a burden which everyone must face up to but an interest rate of 9 per cent is unduly penal.  I object strenuously to the reduction in subsection (2) (ii) reducing the payment from three months to two months.  This is wrong because some people in business may have to liquidate assets in order to pay this income tax.  I do not think that they should be forced to dash off and get funds to pay income tax within two months.  My general objection to the section is quite simple.  Our income tax code should not be unduly penal and this section is unduly penal.</P>

Under section 48 the rate that a company can get back if they get a decision from the judge is maintained at ½ per cent.  There is such a thing as being too smart by half.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I want to say in regard to this matter that I regard this whole question of the charging of interest both under this section and under the other sections, on corporation profits tax and on death duties, as being fundamental.  I should like to suggest to the House that our stance here should be that any taxpayer should be obliged to pay his tax promptly, especially having regard to the very many taxpayers who are obliged to pay on the dot by deductions by way of PAYE.  Both from the point of view of equity as between one citizen and another and also from the point of view of the revenue of the State, we ought to desire that the correct amount of tax should be paid by the taxpayer promptly.  I am putting this forward as a general principle.  I would point out that the payment of tax promptly by taxpayers is of considerable benefit to the Revenue.  As well as that, failure to pay tax promptly can lead to additional taxation having to be imposed.  I suggest, therefore, that the principle I have enunciated is one with which we should all agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises then as to how one deals with the situation in which there is some doubt as to what is the correct amount of tax.  The principle of paying interest on unpaid tax is not new.  The reason for raising it to 9 per cent is a very simple one.  It is quite possible for people to obtain 8 per cent and upwards on deposits.  Indeed, some people deliberately withhold payment of tax as long as they possibly can, investing the money involved, which should go to the Revenue, at a profit.  When they have to pay in the end, and at the lower rate of interest, it is still worth their while.  This represents <Col N="895" /> a considerable loss to the Revenue.  It is a practice we in this House ought not to aid, abet or encourage.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, anxious to ensure that the taxpayer who honestly and in a <i>bona fide</i> manner wants to pay his correct tax within the due time but is in a position in which there is some doubt about what the correct amount is gets a fair deal.  I suggest this section gives him a fair deal because it provides that, where he either makes an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners for payment on account or, alternatively, if he does not or cannot make such an arrangement but ultimately pays 80 per cent of the tax found to be due&mdash;I pointed this out to Deputy O'Higgins who said, perhaps inadvertently, 80 per cent of the tax assessed; it is 80 per cent of the tax found to be due&mdash;in either of these cases he does not become liable to interest and, on determination of the correct amount, he has two months in which to pay.  If he overpays he gets a refund plus interest at 9 per cent. This has been referred to here as being a penal rate, but that is the rate the Revenue Commissioners will pay him. I know what people mean when they say &ldquo;Thank you for nothing&rdquo; in regard to this; they mean there will be very little interest paid by the Revenue Commissioners.  That may be so, but it is still a fair deal.  The Revenue Commissioners pay exactly the same rate on overpayments of tax as they charge on unpaid tax.  I do not think anyone could object to that in principle.  The idea behind this and other sections in the Bill is very important. This is something to which I attach a great deal of importance and I am afraid I cannot, therefore, accept the arguments put forward against this section.</P>

      <P>There is a practice for a taxpayer with a UK income to have tax recovered set off against the Irish liability on the relevant income.

      <P>It appears to me that the Minister's worry is that people against whom an assessment has been raised could, for frivolous reasons, appealing and delaying the appeal, get the benefit of the high rate of interest. The Minister is after these, and properly so.  The point I want to make is that these people can be inhibited from carrying on like that at the moment by the special commissioner to whom their appeal comes in the first instance.  He can order a payment on account and, if it is refused, there are other sections he can apply.  He is an experienced official and he will know very well whether the appeal is frivolous or <i>bona fide</i>.  I think that is a sufficient weapon to prevent delay in the payment of tax.  Since that weapon is there all the section does, I suggest, is inhibit <i>bona fide</i> appeals.</P>

I suggest that the genuine case is covered and is getting fair play under this section.  The people who will really suffer are those who are not genuine, not <i>bona fide</i>, and have, perhaps, got away with it in the past.</P>

      <P>On my reading of this section there seems to me to be an omission here.  This section covers overpayments where payments on account have been agreed with the inspector. That is fair enough.  The overpayment is refunded with interest. There are many cases, I am told, in which in fact there is a payment on account without any agreement with the inspector.  In those circumstances, if it is subsequently determined there is an overpayment, the taxpayer is out on a limb.  If I read the section correctly this is a very dangerous section because in relation to a dispute about an assessment the taxpayer's agent is put in the position of saying, &ldquo;Either you pay, and I suggest you pay, or else you will not get any interest in the event of an overpayment being determined subsequently in relation to the determination of tax liability&rdquo;.

I am afraid the section does not carry out what I had intended, which was in all cases where there is an overpayment, that there would be a refund by the Revenue Commissioners with interest at 9 per cent, however the overpayment arises.  It seems to me that to achieve equity there ought to be precisely the same approach to non-payment by the taxpayer as to repayment by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Deputy's reading of the section is correct and I propose to introduce an amendment to ensure that overpayment <Col N="898" /> arising in any manner will be refunded with interest at 9 per cent.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise one matter on section 17 which deals with the situation in which the taxpayer requires his appeal to be reheard by a judge of the circuit court, as is his right.  Under the proposed section although he appeals to the circuit court judge the interest on his tax liability subsequently found to be due will run from the date of the determination by the appeal commissioners.  Am I right in my reading of the section?</P>

      <P>Under section 428 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 a person <Col N="899" /> who appeals to the High Court from a determination of the appeals commissioners or the circuit court, is obliged to pay the tax charged in the assessment pending the hearing of the appeal.  The purpose of section 17 is to make similar provision for payment of the tax where, on the determination of an appeal by the appeals commissioners, the taxpayer requires his appeal to be heard by the circuit court. It is the same principle as applies in section 428 of the 1967 Act but it is applied not only in the case of an appeal to the High Court but in the case of an appeal to the circuit court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the same principle applies here as we have been discussing earlier.  In the event of a <i>bona fide</i> taxpayer paying tax he is not penalised and if he overpays he gets a refund with interest at 9 per cent but a person who is using this machinery merely to delay payment so that he can earn more interest on his money, will not benefit as a result of these arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the amount of tax which would be subject to an appeal to the circuit court, having regard to the law as it stands with section 15 amended, will not be of any size or consequence and certainly the person who will be going that far will not be the speculator the Minister has in mind.  I would be very much opposed to the principle contained in section 17.  Our income tax code is necessarily administrative. Appeals and decisions are matters of administrative law rather than of common law.  The ordinary principals that we are used to in our legal system cannot necessarily apply.  The tribunals are not judicial tribunals, as we traditionally understand them, and among jurists there is considerable apprehension about administrative law, its <Col N="900" /> effect and how something can work unfairly against a citizen.  One can see that a certain amount of it is unavoidable but there is a happy marriage between the two systems contained in this and that is the right of the citizen to go from the special commissioners to the circuit court judge.  It is unfortunate to see this right being inhibited because that is what this section does; there can be no doubt about that.  It is of the essence of our appellate system that the position of the parties should not be altered pending the determination of the appeal, but this section clearly says that after the special commissioners make their assessment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I take it they are the same persons&mdash;the tax shall be paid and consequently the citizen then going through the circuit court is in a worse position even if the circuit court confirms the tax and that is not altogether the point.  The principle of the thing is that the relevant position of the parties should not be altered pending the appeal.  This section very seriously interferes with that principle. I do not think the abuses which the Minister was apprehensive about in relation to section 15 will arise in relation to section 70 with regard to appeals to the circuit court.  If a taxpayer is of a mind to speculate on unpaid tax in the manner exemplified by the Minister he will now be dealt with by section 15 and that abuse will be ended and the only person who will be interested in going to the circuit court will be a person with a genuine dispute with the tax authorities.  It will not be a speculator because his teeth will have been blunted by section 15. Consequently, there are no speculators to be caught by section 17 and I would suggest to the Minister that the principle of an appeal, that the parties be left in the same circumstances, be honoured and that the taxpayer be not made pay his tax until after the appeal to the circuit court.</P>

      <P>On this section I would ask the Minister to bear in mind <Col N="901" /> the case of the man who has not got the wherewithal to pay it.  Earlier this evening I was making the case of the five-acre market gardener who is assessed in retrospect and who brings his case before the Special Commissioner who says he must pay because he is to be regarded as having income from a trade.  He is an ordinary working man.  He starts this business.  He does not know that he is liable to income tax because he sees the farmers all around him paying no income tax. It is reasonable that he should be in this state of ignorance in those circumstances. The Special Commissioner says that according to section 54 he is liable to pay it.  He has not the money to pay. He has to sell his five acres and his total livelihood is gone because the Special Commissioner says it must be paid before the case goes to the circuit court.  The only course open to him when the Special Commissioner says he must pay is to go to the circuit court.  This type of case should be covered and is certainly not covered here.  It means that the man's assets must be sold and the livelihood of a whole family destroyed in order to meet the requirements of section 17.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Clinton, I would point out that in any case in which a person is paying tax he is paying it on profits which he has already earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have spent it but, if he has, that should not put him in a better position than the people who are paying under PAYE.  It seems to me that in genuine cases of hardship arrangements can be made with the Revenue Commissioners but they have to be genuine cases of hardship and, of course, he will be liable for interest on the deferred payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough but to have to sell his assets is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, the fact that he has already spent the money is rather difficult for him but it should not put him in a privileged position as against other people who have paid before they spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> Furthermore, in regard to the point raised by Deputy Cooney, I would suggest that the procedure which is laid down allows an appeal to the circuit court.  I think the Deputy is mistaken in thinking that only genuine cases would go that far, that the speculators, as he calls them, would not go that far. In fact, our experience is that a number of people do appeal to the circuit court and when the case is coming on for hearing, they then drop their appeal.  Of course, the reason is perfectly obvious: they are making money out of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  May I make it clear?  A taxpayer is assessed by the inspector and, at the moment, if he disagrees with the inspector he goes to <Col N="903" /> the Special Commissioner who may order a payment on account or may not&mdash;that is irrelevant for the purpose of the argument.  The Special Commissioner makes an assessment and the taxpayer may then appeal against that to the circuit court and at the moment there are no restrictions on him to abuse the various steps of appeal.  As proposed by section 15, the first stage, from the inspector to the Commissioner, there is an inhibition on that, in the sense that the inspector's assessment, if not paid, carries interest or if an amount agreed is not paid the assessment carries interest or if an amount which is afterwards found to be 80 per cent of the tax due is not paid, it also carries interest.  If the person in question is a speculator, his wings are now effectively clipped.  He will not even go that far because he will be caught for interest from the time he leaves the inspector.  Consequently, if he is that type of person, his gallop is finished at that stage because he is subject to interest.  But, if you have a person who has a genuine grievance with regard to his assessment, something going to the roots of his case, so to speak, he <i>bona fide</i> makes an agreement with the inspector.  He pays the agreed figure.  There is still an outstanding sum.  He goes to the Commissioner who may confirm the assessment.  He is still not satisfied.  He wants to go to the circuit court. Between going from the inspector to the Commissioner he has paid the agreed figure to save himself interest. He is a genuine taxpayer.  There is still some tax outstanding that he wants to fight to the highest court available to him, which is the circuit court.  I think he should be allowed go to the circuit court without having to pay that tax after being with the Commissioner when prior to being with the Commissioner he has paid an agreed figure with the inspector.  He is being inhibited. The speculator will have been caught by the necessity of the inspector having to agree with him at the early stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy may be a little more optimistic about the effect of the section than I am. Although I am hopeful, I am not that optimistic.  I will look at the point that the Deputy has raised.  I want to be clear that I have the point correctly. The Deputy is visualising a situation in which the taxpayer is appealing to the circuit court having paid either an agreed payment on account or 80 per cent of what ultimately turns out to be his correct assessment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Or possibly even paying 9 per cent interest.  He may even be doing that if he has not agreed with the inspector or has not paid a sum which is afterwards found to be 80 per cent.  If he is not doing either of these things he is paying interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more interested in his tax than in the interest on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few taxpayers, I would suggest to the Minister, who would be prepared to pay 9 per cent over the time it would take possibly to leave the circuit court with the state of circuit court cases, even in income tax matters.  I think he would be perfectly genuine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I come in again just to ask the Minister if he would explain to the House why he is so anxious to insist that the tax is paid before the appeal machinery provided is fully utilised.  If when the final decision is reached by the circuit court the man is liable for interest retrospectively at the rate of 9 per cent, the Minister and the Department are covered and, therefore, it will not cost the State anything to wait this small additional time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this again because I am concerned about the man who may have to sell his assets and may lose his total <Col N="905" /> livelihood and the total livelihood of his family who might be involved in the type of business I have in mind.  Is it not the essence of all civil law that a man is innocent until he is found guilty?  Here we are trying to prove that a man is guilty until he proves himself innocent.  That is revenue law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept that at all.  I have explained earlier&mdash;I am not sure if the Deputy was here&mdash;the basic thinking behind this but in the kind of case he is citing where a man's livelihood would be at stake, that would be the kind of hardship case that I referred to earlier where an arrangement could be made with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, there is in practice.  I must insist on the principle that a taxpayer who owes tax should not, by reason of the fact that he has already spent the money on which he should pay tax, be put in a privileged position as against other taxpayers who pay promptly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that the Minister is asking for money for which liability has not been provided? In effect, this is fulfilling the old approach of the Revenue law.  In the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners a man is guilty as soon as they make an assessment and until such time as an agreement is reached.  Is he to pay a sum of money that may be different <Col N="906" /> entirely from the assessment being made?  Why is it not sufficient to ask him to pay the interest after the final assessment has been made and proved?  Why is he assumed to be guilty and to owe money merely on an assessment of revenue which sometimes may be speculative?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach whereby a taxpayer is required to pay his tax promptly is one that we must all support. We are making provision here that I consider to be fair and reasonable. Not only would a person have the option of making an agreed payment on account with the Revenue Commissioners but if he does not wish to agree with the Revenue Commissioners he can make a payment whereby, if it is only 80 per cent of what he is determined ultimately to owe, he will avoid interest.  Also, he would then have a further two months in which to pay the balance on which no interest would be charged.  If he should overpay he is refunded the appropriate amount plus interest at the same rate.  That is doing justice as between the citizen and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

By equating neglect with fraud there is the proposal to punish a taxpayer who may be guilty of neglect.  This is done by the provision of an obligation to pay a penal rate of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the purpose of the amendments is, first, to remove subsection (1) which defines the term &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; and in the second subsection which, if the first amendment were carried, would become the section itself, to remove the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; and provide that the section should operate only in the case of fraud.  There are a number of matters involved in relation to this section arising from the amendment that I propose.  The section itself represents a complete departure from the present position.  At present, interest cannot be charged from a date prior to the <Col N="908" /> making of an assessment and disposal of any appeal.  As it is proposed, the section provides that &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; shall have the meaning defined in section 186 of the 1967 Act, as amended. That definition is as follows:</P>
    <P>.... &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; means negligence or a failure to give any notice, to make any return, statement or declaration, or to produce or furnish any list, document or other information required by or under the Income Tax Acts:</P>
    <P>Provided that a person shall be deemed not to have failed to do anything required to be done within a limited time if he did it within such further time, if any, as the Revenue Commissioners or officer concerned may have allowed; and where a person had a reasonable excuse for not doing anything required to be done, he should be deemed not to have failed to do it if he did it without unreasonable delay after the excuse had ceased.</P>
    <P>The important element in that definition is that neglect means negligence or a failure to give any notice, to make any return, statement or declaration, or to produce or furnish any list or document or other information required under the Acts.  This section proposes to make such neglect punishable in the sense that a penal rate of interest shall apply and where there is neglect interest is payable from the normal due date up to the date of actual payment. I am informed and believe that most cases of neglect arise from failure to lodge returns within the 21 days that are normally allowed from the due date.  In practice this time limit has been established to be completely unrealistic for taxpayers whose affairs are in any way complicated.  I understand that it is utterly impossible for a taxpayer whose affairs are not even largely complicated to lodge his return of income within 21 days.  I invite the House to consider a return for the tax year, 1971-72, being lodged on, say, 15th January, 1972, no assessment having been made.  In such circumstances if the inspector of taxes overlooks making an assessment on the returns for 12 months, then under the definition of <Col N="909" />&ldquo;neglect&rdquo;, presumably, the taxpayer, since he has not observed the time limit in relation to giving his returns and so on, would be guilty of neglect. Although, in fact, by the 15th January he had rendered his return for income tax, a delay occurred on the inspector's part, an assessment was not, in fact, prepared for another 12 months and then on the assessment being prepared, is that taxpayer to be made liable to pay, from the due date, interest at the rate of 9 per cent on his tax liability? That seems to be the effect of this section if one includes the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are other problems arising from it.  For example, a solicitor or an accountant or a lawyer advised, say, a taxpayer on a particular line of authorities in relation to income tax liability and what he was entitled to do.  If there is a change in the law either by statute or by court decision and the taxpayer, not being alert to the change, operates in a particular way in which he had been advised, is he to be held guilty of neglect because he has not changed what he had been doing or altered his mode of conduct, or does it mean that the solicitor or the accountant must chase back and re-advise in every case in which there is a change in the law?</P>
    <P>This section as it stands is far too punitive, far too wide and it can only be tolerable if the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; is removed.  Nobody on this side of the House will defend or condone a situation in which there has been an attempt &mdash;I use it from an income tax point of view&mdash;to engage in fraud.  It is quite understandable that any such attempt should be dealt with under this kind of legislation but to equate neglect, the failure to take a step, which could happen to a bishop, with fraud and to apply the same penalties is utterly unreasonable. I commend this amendment to the house.</P>

      <P>I agree completely with what Deputy O'Higgins has said. The idea of making fraud and neglect identical could only occur to the Revenue Commissioners.  One of them said to me on one occasion: &ldquo;I think every man is our enemy and we are every man's enemy.&rdquo;  A strange statement <Col N="910" /> from one of the commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a long time ago.  It did not happen yesterday but it is not 20 years ago.  In essence, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, this neglect is a neglect to complete forms, a neglect to comply with the ordinary rules.  There are many circumstances in which people might not complete forms.  Indeed, there have been occasions when the forms have been lost in the office of the Revenue Commissioners, particularly down in O'Connell Street, in that well-known Augean stable which at one stage got into complete disorder.  This kind of thing makes an ordinary person like myself extremely suspicious.  Like Deputy O'Higgins I certainly hold no brief for fraud.  I have to pay every penny I owe the Revenue Commissioners which is all the more reason why I should object to fraud.  Quite apart from that we just do not approve of fraud.  Neglect is a different thing.  A man might be ill.  He might have difficulties with his business.  I agree with the suggestion of the Fine Gael Deputies that &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; should be taken out of this. I do not think the Revenue will suffer anything worth talking about.  Usually when there is neglect it is discovered and I do not see why people should be charged 9 per cent.  If it is not genuine neglect it is obviously fraud.  Therefore I cannot see what objection the Minister can have to accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time that this concept was brought forward in legislation.  Section 4 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, by amendment of section 186 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 secured that in cases of fraud or neglect there would be no time limit on the making of assessments to recover income tax or surtax which would otherwise be lost to the Exchequer.</P>

I confess that when I first had this proposal put before me I reacted in precisely the same way as Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy O'Donovan and said: &ldquo;I will go all the way as far as fraud is concerned but neglect is a different matter.&rdquo; I was thinking in terms of failure to fill in or send in forms and that kind of neglect but then I had a look at the definition of neglect as provided for in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy O'Higgins read it out but may I suggest that he gave a great deal more prominence to the first part than to the proviso which is what really counts.  The proviso added on to the definition is to the effect that a person is to be deemed not to have failed to do anything required to be done within the specified time, in other words not to have been guilty of neglect, if he does it within such further time as may be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me develop this argument.  Where a person had a reasonable excuse for not doing anything <Col N="912" /> required to be done he is deemed not to have failed to do it if he did it without unreasonable delay after the excuse had ceased.  Let us consider a case where the Revenue Commissioners say that there was neglect within the meaning of this section and interest will have to be paid.  Almost certainly in such a case the taxpayer will appeal against that assessment on the grounds that there has not been any neglect and thereupon the onus of proof will be on the inspector of taxes to prove that there was neglect within the meaning of the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To whom will he prove this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To whomever the appeal is made, either the appeal commissioners or the Circuit court.  In that event, if it is a case of an incorrect return the inspector will have to show that this was not the result of an innocent mistake but that the taxpayer was guilty of negligence in making the return.  It may be taken that the appeal commissioners or the circuit court to whom the taxpayer has recourse will not be lightly satisfied on a point like this.  If the case is one of failure to give a notice, to make a return or furnish a list, a document or some other information, the inspector will have to show that the requirement was not complied with within the allowed time.  In either of such cases the advice available to the the Revenue Commissioners is that the proviso to the definition of neglect would operate so that if the taxpayer had any reasonable excuse for making the incorrect return or for his failure to give the required notice or return, it would not be possible to show that he was negligent.  The cases of neglect which will attract interest under this section are only those in which it can be established to the satisfaction of the appeal commissioners or the court that there was neglect which resulted in an undercharge to tax and neglect arising, as I have indicated, in a way that is more than the layman's understanding of neglect when one has regard to the proviso in the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that, again, on the general principle to which I referred earlier <Col N="913" /> there should not be a privileged position for taxpayers who avoid or delay in paying their taxes as against those who do not or cannot.  On the basis of that principle and the proviso to the definition of neglect which is laid down here and the fact that almost invariably any such case will be decided by the appeal commissioners or by the courts having regard to all of this, I do not think this is a dangerous provision. I think it is a worthwhile provision for dealing with cases which, while not amounting to fraud in the legal sense which, as Deputies will know is quite a serious matter and a difficult one to prove, will amount certainly to much more than is understood by the layman as neglect, forgetting to send in a form or omitting to put something on it by pure error.  It does not seem possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the inspector says: &ldquo;You have one month to do this&rdquo; I would submit as a matter of law that it is irrelevant whether one month is reasonable or not because the person hearing the appeal can only look at the section as it is and the section is quite clear in that it creates an absolute liability if he failed within a limited time or &ldquo;within such further time,&rdquo; and if the inspector says: &ldquo;This is the time&rdquo; it is not a matter for the appeals commissioners afterwards to say that that time was unreasonable. That is as the proviso is presently drafted.  A further point is that in the second half of the proviso it says &ldquo;and where a person had a reasonable excuse...&rdquo;  I would have some sympathy with the Minister's argument if &ldquo;or&rdquo; was there instead of &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, in so far as he could say to the person hearing the appeal: &ldquo;I had a reasonable excuse&rdquo; because the section would say: &ldquo;...or had a reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  I think they have to be read, because of the presence of the semicolon, as two separate and distinct provisos.</P>

What I wish to achieve is a situation in which somebody who is not guilty of fraud in the strict legal sense but is guilty of more than neglect in the sense the layman means, will become liable to interest.  That is what I wish to achieve.</P>

      <P>I think in saying that, the Minister has summarised our objections to the section in the sense that he concedes that there are lesser degrees of culpability in the case of the imaginary taxpayer with whom we are dealing in that one is guilty of fraud and the other of neglect.  He concedes that there is this difference in culpability but nevertheless the punishment provided is the same and to that extent there is equation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is understandably concerned with what the definition of neglect appears <i>prima facie</i> to cover and he has already said, I think, that he is willing to have a look at that definition again. I do not want to reject any such offer from the Minister but I should like to make it clear that it does not satisfy me.  No matter how one defines &ldquo;neglect&rdquo;, or how wilful one makes it to be, or how much there is a sin of actual commission, it is wrong to equate it with fraud.  It is the conjunction of fraud and neglect, however defined, to which I have objection.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy agree that in the context here, where we are dealing only with interest and not with the only penalties available for fraud, it is not right to say that we are equating fraud with neglect?  We are only doing it for the purpose of assessing liability to interest on the tax due.  It does not mean that a taxpayer who is guilty of fraud is dealt with in precisely the same way as a taxpayer who is only guilty of neglect.  A taxpayer guilty of fraud may be prosecuted.</P>

      <P>From the way the Minister has been speaking on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners one would think that the income the State gets from income tax was about £10 million.  The State this year will receive £140 million.  It is 10 per cent of the GNP, which some people are so fond of quoting.  It is about one-fifth of the national income, properly calculated. There cannot be much neglect in the collection of income tax when one considers the amount the State receives. The quantum of neglect relative to the total amount of tax must be infinitesimal.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (2), line 21, to delete &ldquo;.75 per cent&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;.58 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>By reason of the decision on the two earlier amendments the section now proposes to deal with an undercharge to income tax or sur-tax attributable to fraud or neglect and it provides that the amount of tax undercharged will carry interest at the rate of .75 per cent for each month which is 9 per cent for the year.  This section, as I have already indicated, is an entirely new section.  At the moment interest cannot be charged from a date prior to the making of the assessment and bringing in now a 9 per cent interest rate seems to me unduly punitive.  I believe the rate of interest in Britain in respect of arrears of tax is 6 per cent.  In view of the suggestion of fraud I am not going to suggest 6 per cent here, but I suggest in place of .75 per cent a rate of .58 per cent, which is near as makes no difference to 7 per cent.  I urge the Minister to accept 7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained in relation to other sections why we propose to charge a rate of 9 per cent.  It is open to people to place money on deposit at 8 per cent, or more, and consequently a rate lower than 9 per cent under this section could well be an inducement to people not to pay their tax promptly; they could then pay the interest rate provided at present and still make it worth their while not to pay tax promptly.  Because of that and because of the introduction of a rate of 9 per cent in the earlier section, it seems to me to be desirable, to say the least of it, that the same rate of interest should apply in all cases of non-payment of tax and in all cases of overpayment of tax and refund by the Revenue Commissioners.  The rate of interest should be uniform and should be related to the rate of interest available currently on deposits.  For that reason I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In so far as it is relevant to the amendment, this subsection may persuade the Minister to accept the amendment because this subsection might create an anomalous situation.  A person assessed can appeal on the ground that interest should not be charged.  We know this assessment may go back a considerable period.  If a person makes an agreed payment is he relieved of paying interest?  Can he be charged twice with interest or could the interest refer back to tax paid?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (6) (c) of this section secures that, where it is established on appeal that there has been no fraud or neglect, the normal provisions relating to interest on unpaid income tax or sur-tax will apply instead of those contained in section 18.  Subsection (6) (c) speaks only of the determination of the appeal by the Appeal Commissioners. It may be, however, that the appeal would be determined by the courts. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that the provision will operate on the determination of the <Col N="922" /> appeal irrespective of whether it is the Appeal Commissioners or the courts who determine the appeal.</P>

      <P>It should be the due date of assessment on the basis of the section I quoted earlier in the 1967 Act.  If it were made before 1st January it would be the following 1st January.  If it were after the 1st January it would be the day following the date of assessment and the normal interest provisions that we have provided for here would apply.</P>

      <P>Could I ask why subsection (1) (b) does not read, &ldquo;This section is deemed to come into operation on the 6th day of April, 1971&rdquo;? It is all right to indulge in this game of juggling around between one year and another but this is section 17 of the <Col N="927" /> Finance Act, 1970, and the words here are &ldquo;shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 6th day of April, 1971.&rdquo;  This does not make commonsense to me.  If it read, &ldquo;This subsection is deemed to have come into operation,&rdquo; or some other words, it might be all right, but you are dealing with the Act of 1970 and you alter it and you say it shall be deemed to have come into operation on the 6th day of April, 1971.  This to me is juggling around with words.  I am sure there is a good reason for it.  I have no doubt about that.  I am talking about the peculiarity of the construction.</P>

      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), line 4, to delete the words &ldquo;and before the 1st day of April, 1973&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments appears clearly.  The proposal is not to restrict the concession and benefit given by section 20 to the projected two year period envisaged in the section. It seems to me that if there is to be an investment allowance for machinery and plant in designated areas, particularly at this juncture in our affairs, if that is good policy, it should not contain a time limit because in the provision of a time limit this provision may have quite a bad effect. It certainly will encourage the purchase of new machinery.  Used and secondhand is excluded.  It will involve a rush to qualify in relation to the period covered by the investment allowance. This, in fact, may be unsound.  It might be much more desirable not to have <Col N="928" /> a time limit, to provide for the allowance and allow industries to plan in relation to their own resources the kind of investment that their plant, in fact, requires.  With the time limit you make it, on the one hand, quite unsuitable investment and, secondly, in the genuine case, where there is investment in new plant and machinery according to a plan there is no reason why it should be restricted to the two year period.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Higgins in this.  I think it should be restricted to the 1st day of April, 1973. I would ask the Minister if he would consider including within the scope of this section transport by vehicle of goods.  I see no valid distinction between plant and machinery and lorries which a firm have to buy for the conveyance of goods, especially in designated areas where it may be far from a suitable harbour for export or far from the markets in Dublin or Cork.  I would suggest that lorries for the conveyance of goods should be allowed this incentive as well as plant and machinery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point made by Deputy Collins, the exclusion of road vehicles is common to all of the similar provisions, initial allowance and so on.  It has always been so.  I have not examined quite why, although I imagine offhand it is because it is very easy to abuse it in the case of easily moveable vehicles of that kind. I am not sure that that is the reason but I would suspect it.  The intention was to apply free depreciation and the investment allowance on the same basis of application as the existing initial allowances and wear and tear allowances apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the length of time for which these concessions should be in operation, there are two main reasons why we should restrict them to the two year period announced in the Budget.  First, because of the question of cost to the Exchequer which, if one takes both together, that is, the free depreciation and the 20 per cent investment allowance in the designated areas, is estimated at £3 million in the first year of operation, which is next <Col N="929" /> year, £3 million for the Exchequer, and £6 million the following year.  That is one important consideration.  The other is&mdash;and I tried to make this clear in the Budget Statement&mdash;having regard to the state of the economy, to the arguments which have been put forward in relation to the taxation of companies, it was argued that we were inhibiting investment, and having regard to the clear requirement of the economy that there should be investment and should be investment in the next couple of years, it seemed to me that this provision would both encourage this kind of investment and ensure more or less that the benefits of these allowances go to firms which are investing and that the companies which are paying the additional tax, who invest in this way, will get back a very great deal of the additional tax they are paying.  Those who do not will not, of course.  But, it should be quite clear to anybody who thinks about it, and it is clear from some analogous experience we have in relation to the IDA and designation of areas for a limited period that there is great psychological importance in having a time limit involved, that people will invest.  I should <Col N="930" /> like to make it clear that there is no intention whatever of extending this beyond the two year period.  I would not like people to think there was. There are many advantages in doing so and I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
