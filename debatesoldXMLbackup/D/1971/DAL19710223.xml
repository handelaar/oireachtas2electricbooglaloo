    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach by how much, on an average, food prices will rise when Ireland joins the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, Sir, to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate precisely the effect of the application of EEC arrangements on retail prices of various food items following Ireland's accession to an enlarged Community as changes in retail prices would be affected by a variety of factors, such as changes in EEC prices and Irish prices in the meantime and the effects of price increases on wholesalers' and retailers' margins.  Changes in the level <Col N="1776" /> of retail prices would also be affected by the length of the transitional period for the applicant countries during which they would gradually adjust their price levels to those of the Community.</P>
    <P>It is tentatively estimated, however, on the basis of the main price differentials for agricultural products for which data are available, that the full application of current EEC agricultural prices here would lead to an increase in the retail price index for food of the order of 12 per cent to 18 per cent on the present level.  The actual increase would, of course, be spread over a number of years depending on the length of the transitional period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider it advisable that the prices of normal food products should be spelled out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there will be various prognostications made available to people interested in this particular aspect of our application to join the EEC, in time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I am at present studying a memorandum which I received a few days ago from the Medical Union indicating various matters, apart from the amount of the fees, which general practitioner members of that body would like to see changed as a condition of participation in the proposed reorganised general medical service.  The Irish Medical Association has sent me a resolution passed by its council urging that, in view of the deferment of the change in the general medical service, those dispensary doctor posts now filled temporarily should be filled on a permanent basis through the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I hope to arrange an early exploratory discussion with the association and the union to examine these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the Minister's reply, would he not agree that the main items of conflict at the present time relate, firstly, to permanent DMOs and, secondly, to temporary DMOs?  Does the Minister think that the resolution calling for temporary posts to be made permanent would be a retrograde step at the present time in view of the fact that we are calling for the abolition of the dispensary system?  Would it not be more logical to consider the suggestions which have come from the general practitioners with regard to what they want in the Minister's offer?  So far as I know, there are very few differences in the returns about what the profession wants and what the Minister offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a discussion on the health scheme on these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the abolition of the dispensary system is such an important matter, would the Minister not think it advisable <Col N="1779" /> to reopen discussions with the profession and not to consider at all the making permanent of the MOs?  This would be a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons the Deputy states, I am not taking any steps at the moment to make permanent the positions which are now temporary.  There are at least 12 matters for discussion with the IMU and the IMA with regard to what they say caused the members to reject the scheme by a majority.  All these things have to be discussed and they will be discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware of many anomalies in the medical card scheme, will he make every effort to ensure that the new legislation will go through satisfactorily in the best interests of the community at large?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what steps he is taking to provide urgently needed accommodation for geriatric cases in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two building projects due to be completed this year which will improve the accommodation situation for geriatric patients in Dublin.  The first is the erection of a two-storey block to accommodate 79 elderly women at the Regina Coeli Hostel.  The second is the provision of a new 50 place day hospital <Col N="1780" /> at St. Kevin's Hospital at a cost of £45,000.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions with the Dublin Health Authority on the future accommodation needs of geriatric patients.  I should point out that institutional requirements depend in the first instance on the level at which community services are available.  Such services include special housing for the aged, home visiting by public health nurses and social workers, and the provision of meals for persons unfit to cater adequately for themselves.  The provision of welfare homes for elderly persons close to the community and to various communal facilities is an important part of the total geriatric service. Approval in principle has been conveyed to the Dublin Health Authority for the erection of three welfare homes for the aged costing approximately £80,000 each.  One of these homes will be located in the grounds of St. Clare's Hospital, Ballymun but the location of the other two has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Accommodation is also provided for geriatric patients in welfare homes run by religious orders and voluntary bodies.  A new home of 150 places has just been completed at Marino and work is almost finished on the building of a 300-bed home at Raheny.  I understand that there is a further home to be built in Chapelizod.  The Dublin Health Authority are endeavouring to make arrangements with the authorities of these homes with a view to securing places for patients for whose care they have a responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if, in view of the great uncertainties and possible hazards to all elements of Irish life which membership of the EEC entails, an adequate study has been made of such possible alternatives to membership as: (i) obtaining provision for continued access to the British market in the same way as Commonwealth sugar producers and New Zealand dairy and sheep farmers, or (ii) obtaining new markets for established and new agricultural exports.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the assumptions on which the Deputy's question is based.  As I stated in reply to questions on 9th February, our application has from the beginning been for membership as this is the course which the Government consider would best serve Ireland's interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me would we get the same arrangements as have been got for New Zealand.  No arrangements have been got for New Zealand yet.  The indications are that the arrangements which will be agreed on for New Zealand and for the sugarproducing Commonwealth countries mentioned by the Deputy would be to have whatever they get phased out. Such arrangements would be only temporary. No arrangement has yet been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No proposals have been made to anybody about financing yet, but the Commission have submitted a paper on transitional arrangements which includes proposals about Britain's contribution, which would be a very big thing in terms of the negotiations because of the size of the British contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs the estimated increased annual financial contributions by Ireland to the European Economic Community as a consequence of each 1 per cent drop in the level of contributions to the Community at present being sought by the Community from Britain in the course of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community has not yet put forward proposals in the negotiations on the level of contributions to be paid by Britain, Ireland and the other applicant countries during the transitional period.  Until we know the Community's proposals for a formula to be applied to the distribution of expenditure among the other member States, it is not possible to make an estimate such as the Deputy is seeking for any one of the applicant countries. In any event, the amount so far as Ireland is concerned would be small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give a reply based on the Commission's suggestions, if not on the Community's proposals because I suggest that the time has come to stop talking in the realm of theory and some indication should be given to the House as to what the costings will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say, Deputy.  It might clarify it for the Deputies to be told that the financing of the Community would be a matter for the ten countries if the four applicants are accepted and that the financing by any one country, with the variation in the financing required of any one country, will be spread, either beneficially or otherwise, among the other nine and not in proportion just to an equal one-ninth but in relation probably to the GNP represented by the particular country concerned as a percentage of the total GNP of the enlarged Community. If the Deputy would like to do exercises, which would have no bearing on the situation at all, but he might like to do it, a 1 per cent change <Col N="1784" /> would represent about 40 million to 45 million dollars and that sum would be spread among the other nine according to a formula which is not a direct fraction but related, as I say, to possibly the percentage of their GNP to the whole enlarged Community GNP. If the Deputy wanted to do a sum on that he could do it without asking me how to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If the negotiations with Britain were to fail, a completely new situation would be created.  In this situation we would have to examine most carefully the economic options open to us.  However, in the present situation, I do not consider that an assessment of the implications of membership on the basis of the Deputy's hypothesis would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister also reads the newspapers and I take it also that he is better informed than he is prepared to inform others and will he not accept that there are now indications that Britain may not join the EEC and on that account it is terribly important that we do not delay any further a thorough investigation of what alternatives are open to this country and, in particular, whether it would be more beneficial or less beneficial for us to join if Britain remains out?  I suggest that now is the time and not after the event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a study of all the possible alternative situations which may present themselves in the future.  In so far as we can be prepared for these we are prepared.  I would not assume a failure in the negotiations but if the negotiations did not go ahead now this would create a new situation, as I said, which would be of considerable political significance to the Six as they exist, because their decision to negotiate for enlargement was linked with their decision to complete the unification of the Community. <Col N="1786" /> While it would be of enormous significance to us, the Deputy may take it that a totally new situation would arise in Europe for the Community, for Britain and for ourselves and the hypothesis on which we would base our preparation against that time would perhaps change completely but in so far as a study can be done we have done it.</P>

      <P>The answer in so far as I can make one is that at that time a totally new situation would be created, not alone for Britain and the other applicants, but for the Six.  I cannot say at this time, if the Community as it exists would continue to have negotiations with other applicants because their decisions to enlarge were based on the prospect of British accession; their decision to enlarge was made in the concept of completing the Community as they called it, so a totally new situation, the different items of which could not be prognosticated, would present itself.</P>

      <P>The particulars sought by the Deputy in the earlier parts of his question are set out in a statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, will be published in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In regard to the final part of the question I understand from the Ceann Comhairle that he proposes to have further competitions held.  He will also consider the introduction of a tape recording system for the Dáil if it can be established to be satisfactory.</P>

      <Col N="1793" /> Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>1 The authorised permanent establishment:</P>
    <P>1  Editor of Debates and Chief Reporter.</P>
    <P>2  Assistant Editors.</P>
    <P>14  Reporters.</P>
    <P>3  Reporters (Grade II).</P>
    <P>2  Current vacancies and their duration:</P>
    <P>1  Assistant Editor (vacant since 1st February, 1971).</P>
    <P>2  Reporters (1 vacant since November 1967 and 1 since June 1970).</P>
    <P>3  Reporters (Grade II) (1 vacant since July 1965, 1 since July 1969, and 1 since September 1970).</P>
    <P>3  Steps taken to fill vacant posts:</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle has informed me that the Assistant Editor post has been offered to all eligible serving officers but none has accepted the post as yet.  At present the post is temporarily blocked by the re-employment of the officer whose retirement on pension on 1st February, 1971 caused the vacancy.</P>
    <P>Open competitions for posts as Reporter were held in 1967, 1968 and 1969; there were no successful candidates in 1967 or 1968, but in 1969 (when the number of vacancies stood at 3) 2 candidates were successful and were appointed.</P>
    <P>With the exception of 1969, open competitions for posts as Reporter (Grade II) were held every year from 1965 to 1970 inclusive.  Two appointments were made in the period as a result of these competitions.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister state whether it is correct that on a number of occasions efforts have been made to recruit staff and that applications were not forthcoming because the terms offered were quite unsatisfactory and not in keeping with what qualified journalists and stenographers can obtain elsewhere?  Would the Minister <Col N="1794" /> now give an assurance that the terms to be offered will be realistic and will be such as will in the future attract into this excellent service, which has been so well equipped with qualified staff, people of similar calibre so that the National Parliament will be enabled to keep its records in proper order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that he could not agree with the points made by Deputy Ryan.  Will he give the House some reason for his non-agreement?  To treat this matter in a casual manner is no solution.</P>

      <P>The drainage programme is proceeding in accordance with the long established priority lists and there is no intention to abandon that programme. Actual expenditure in the past few years has been affected by a number of factors principally the legal actions in the cases of the Boyne and the Maigue, and shortage of engineering staff in the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>When grants were withdrawn from Long Island national school due to declining enrolments, it was decided to allow a grant of £90 per annum towards the maintenance of each of the children concerned to enable them to attend school on the mainland.

One child is of secondary school age but cannot get accommodation in any of the secondary schools; <Col N="1801" /> the other child is nine years and surely there is accommodation for that child in some residential school?  I would appeal to the Minister to get residential school accommodation for the two children.  I have tried this now through private representations for some months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the agricultural commodities which, to date, have not been produced up to the level envisaged in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The figure of 1¾ per cent referred to in Question No.  42 is the average annual equivalent of the growth in gross agricultural product aimed at over the full period of the Third Programme 1969-1972.  This does not mean that progress was envisaged as a series of regular, uniform steps.  Year-to-year fluctuations must be expected in view of the effects on production of such factors as conditions on export markets for agricultural produce, the length of the production cycle and the influence of weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The base year for these projections was 1968=100.  Nineteen hundred and sixty-eight was a year of quite exceptional growth and the gross agricultural product rose by a remarkable 6 per cent&mdash;over three times the annual rate projected in the Third Programme.  It is not surprising that, although 1969 was quite a good agricultural year, the average growth rate envisaged in the Third Programme was not attained in view of the exceptionally high base year that was used in the Programme. <Col N="1804" /> A further factor was the considerable increase in the volume of materials purchased by farmers in that year, which has the effect of reducing the rate of growth of the gross agricultural product.  The position in 1970 was better but detailed figures are not yet available.</P>
    <P>The implications for economic policy of the pattern of growth in the period 1969-70 are being considered as part of the current review of the Third Programme which will be published before the Budget.</P>
    <P>The Third Programme did not set out specific targets for individual agricultural commodities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that 1970 will be up to 1¾ per cent higher than 1969 and also does he not consider that a plan which does not give some measuring stick against which you can gauge the progress of particular commodities is not really of any great use because there is no way of knowing whether you are really progressing in relation to specific commodities? As agricultural production is made up of specific commodities it is essential that you should have targets for them as well.</P>

That publication set out, so far as the position could be assessed, the prospects and market opportunities which would exist for the different agricultural commodities in an enlarged European community.  I do not think that the introduction of a national plan for agriculture on the lines suggested is called for.  Our pattern of agricultural production is, in fact, already such as to enable us to derive considerable advantage from EEC membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing law for the control of dogs imposes severe penalties for allowing a dog to stray and worry livestock, apart from the fact that the dog may legally be shot by the person whose livestock the dog is attacking.  In my opinion, the law as it stands is adequate.  The problem is one of enforcement.  This is a matter for the Garda but the Garda obviously cannot by themselves afford protection to livestock from attacks by marauding dogs in all cases.  They must have the active assistance of the stockowners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, as in previous years, an appeal was addressed by my Department to dog owners to keep their dogs under control.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the matter of food prices and living costs, I would refer the Deputy to the replies to questions given by the Taoiseach today.</P>
      <P>We have no subsidies on exports of manufactured goods and accordingly the question of their elimination on entry to the EEC does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not appropriate for me to deal with the possible effects of EEC membership on our agricultural population except perhaps to refer to the <Col N="1809" /> increased income of the agricultural sector which can be expected as a result of membership and the common agricultural prices.  Some of this increased income of the rural population can reasonably be expected to increase the demand for the products of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the implication of the questions that Irish manufactured products will become less competitive in export markets.  All the efforts over the last decade or so to prepare Irish industry for freer trade have been aimed at improving its competitive position.  The arrangements for a gradual phasing out over a transitional period of our tariff barriers on trade with EEC countries will give further time for the adaptation of our industry before the full impact of competition from these countries will be felt.  What is of particular importance in this connection is that the cost competitiveness of Irish industry should be improved by reducing the unit cost of output. This involves improving the productivity of Irish industry so as to strengthen its ability to compete both in the home market and in export markets.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the European Economic Community will open up to Irish industry much wider markets and greater export opportunities than at present.  The elimination of the duties on Irish products entering the enlarged EEC following our accession will, of course, be of real benefit to our existing industry.  Furthermore, the potential for exports within the enlarged community will greatly enhance our attractiveness as a base for new export-oriented industries.</P>

      <P>In error I mentioned export subsidies.  What I meant was export incentives by way of tax free allowances which will last until 1990.  According to the Rome Treaty, Article 54 I think, such incentives will not be permitted.  Is the Minister aware of that fact, and is he aware of the fact that companies in this country which are merely subsidiaries of major international companies will be adversely affected by Article 54 of the Rome Treaty?  This relates to my first question, &ldquo;whether food prices and living costs will rise on Irish entry to the EEC, and whether, simultaneously, the various existing subsidies on manufactured exports will be removed&rdquo;.  What I meant was whether the tax free concessions will be removed.  They must be removed according to the Rome Treaty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what effect the Teheran agreement between the oilproducing states of the Persian Gulf and the major oil companies will have on the supply and price of petrol and oils to this country and on the balance of payments and cost of industrial production; and the percentage of Irish total oil imports which come from the region in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the supply of petroleum products to this country will be affected by the Teheran agreement.  I have not yet been advised by the oil companies of the effect on their costs and I cannot therefore say what price increases are likely or how the balance of payments and costs of industrial production will be affected.  Direct imports from the countries covered by the agreement represented 55 per cent of all oil imports in 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the Taoiseach is in a position to give us any information in regard to proposals that, I believe, are being considered by the Government, in relation to constitutional changes?  For example, Article 44 of the Constitution and that Article which I think the Taoiseach agrees should be amended so as to give votes at 18.  Perhaps it is the Taoiseach's intention to make these constitutional changes and put them before the people when the EEC negotiations, for good or evil, are negotiated.  He should give consideration also to the introduction of an amendment to provide for votes at 18 before the local elections which are due to be held in 1972.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about any person in this House.  I withdrew what I said but what I am saying is that it is very difficult to get the people of this country to believe anything from anybody in high places. Again, I repeat that I am not referring personally to anybody who is in this House at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1831" /> In so far as Fianna Fáil policy in relation to agriculture is concerned, again, this is a matter of political expediency.  They seem to be standing idly by&mdash;one might say they can be compared to Nero fiddling while Rome burned.  It is no harm to say that, as far as we on this side of the house are concerned, we believe in co-operation, co-ordination and dialogue.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the Dáil last week had brought to his notice the fact that there is a row&mdash;let it be described as a row or a war&mdash; going on between our principal producers in this country and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Minister's own delegates at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis raised a similar question. They pointed out to the Minister that this war is taking place, but the Minister has denied there is any disagreement between himself and the farmers. Words must have lost their meaning if the Minister cannot now make up his mind and realise that there is this war taking place at the present time.  There is one principle which is a bar to all information and proof against all argument: that is, to close your eyes to what is taking place around you.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Government to face up to their responsibilities. This war has gone on far too long.  I do not want to apportion the blame.  It is a well-known fact that the gap between what the farmers are receiving and what the urban dwellers are receiving has now reached a new peak.  The Minister said at the Ard Fheis that he did not want to see this gap widening.  Those are his words, according to the <i>Irish Times</i>.  He can deny them if he likes.  Surely the time has come when he should say to the people that, since the farmers are our principal producers and since the future of the country depends on them, they should be given a better deal. The Minister must realise that farmers represent 32 per cent of the people.  Last year they got only 16.1 per cent of the national income, and yet directly or indirectly they are responsible for 65 per cent to 70 per cent of our total exports.  Surely the Minister will realise that they are getting <Col N="1832" /> only half today of what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The time has come for both the Minister and the Taoiseach to wipe the slate clean.  Remember the sooner the impasse is ended, the better for each and every one of us in this country.  It is time to point out to the Minister that he will not succeed, as some of his predecessors have tried to succeed, by ruthless statements which were made and deliberate efforts to start class warfare between the urban and rural population and also to divide the small farmers from the big farmers.  The farmers are now determined to march forward, to demand their slice of the cake and get it.  Out of the chaos of conflicting ideas and theories, of which the farmers have been for far too long the victims, at last emerges a reasonably unified voice demanding attention.</P>
    <P>It is right to point out to the Minister that there is a limit to the endurance of any section of the people and that limit has been reached at the present time by the farmers of this country.  They are not prepared to be kicked about like a political football any longer.  They are not prepared to remain second-class citizens in this State any longer.  They have a very valuable part to play in the economy of this country to produce a larger national cake.  They can do that because they have done it in the past.  If the call goes out to them again the farmers will respond to it because they have been in the front line trenches in many wars in this country, national, social and economic.  When the call went out in the last war they and their labourers answered that call and did a good day's work for this country.  The Minister should now hold out the hand of friendship, but there is very little use holding out an olive branch in one hand and a cudgel or a mallet in the other hand.  That is what has happened too often in the past as far as the farmers are concerned.  The Government should realise that they will not spilt the farmers or walk on them this time.  Before this tragic affair which is taking place at the present time, escalates, the Government should take action.  They are elected by the people to govern and not to sit idly by.  They <Col N="1833" /> seem to enjoy wars with different sections of the community, let it be the ESB workers, the teachers or the bank officials.  When the bank strike was on recently the Government stood idly by for seven or eight months.  Many farmers are suffering severely at the present time due to the fact that the Government stood idly by then.  The teachers were going on strike recently.</P>

      <P>We are entitled to say in passing that the Government again stood idly by.  Were it not for the fact that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions called those people together we would have chaos today amongst the children of this country.  Let the Government not stand idly by as far as this disagreement between the farmers of the country and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is concerned. The Government should realise that they can build a firm foundation on co-operation, discussion/consultation and in regard to all those problems, finding out what the Government and the farmers have in common instead of the bickering, fighting and wrangling which we have at present.</P>
      <P>The farmers are disillusioned with the present situation.  The Minister is aggravating that situation by claiming here in this House and at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis last week that there is no difference or no war between himself and the farmers.  Respectable farmers were jailed here a few years ago.  I said last week that we had then selective justice in this country.  There are times and circumstances in which it is respectable to go to jail and there are circumstances in which it definitely is not.  I hope the Minister will use his good offices to do something about this disagreement.  He is a farmer himself and he should know the problems concerning the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also entitled to ask where is our preparation at present for entry into the EEC?  What are the Government doing to prepare our farmers for entry into the EEC, which many people believe will be not alone to the benefit <Col N="1834" /> of the farming community but to the benefit of the country as a whole?  We are entitled to ask what the alternative is if we do not go into the EEC. The Minister is quite well aware that the Conservative Government in Britain claimed, prior to the general election, that they would not be bound by the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.  It is also the policy of the Conservative Government in Britain to allow food prices to rise.  The Home Secretary in the former Labour Government was in Ireland recently and, when he was questioned about the Common Market, his reply was: &ldquo;Your real problem will be if Britain does not get into the Common Market. Then you will certainly have a problem.&rdquo; The policy of the Conservative Government is to allow food prices to rise and to put a tariff on food coming in from other countries.  We are large exporters of food.  What does the Minister propose to do?  Has he done anything so far?  Many farmers and farming organisations are perturbed at the statements of the Conservative Government. There may be an alarming future for them.  The Government should now be taking steps to prepare our farmers either for entry into the EEC or for the unfortunate alternative.</P>
    <P>The greatest danger at the moment is the high-priced economy that has been forced on each and every one of us by Fianna Fáil and the folly of Fianna Fáil administrations over the years.  Farmers' costs are increasing. Be it the individual or the nation, when outgoings are greater than income, then bankruptcy is the only answer.  It is vital that the Government should prepare a plan immediately to ensure that our farmers will get that to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>There are people who object to our entering into the EEC.  These people should state publicly what the alternatives are.  They allege that, if we join the EEC, the number of farmers will be reduced from 286,000 to 33,000.  I do not believe that, but it has to be admitted that the Fianna Fáil programme for economic expansion envisages the numbers being reduced by 70,000 over the next few years.  Since 1932 1,200,000 have emigrated and <Col N="1835" /> 1,000,000 have left the land.  The sad thing is that it is the cream, the young and the ambitious, those who are not prepared to accept low standards and limited opportunities, who have left the land.</P>
    <P>Farmers are entitled to a reasonable return for their labour.  They are not getting that at the moment.  The Minister is a farmer.  He has worked the land.  He has been closely associated with farmers' organisations.  There is enough fighting going on in this country. You have it in the North.  We do not want it here, though we had it over the weekend.  Let the Minister go to his colleagues in the Cabinet and say to them: &ldquo;I am a farmer.  I understand the responsibilities of a farmer. I know from my own experience that the farmer's income is dropping.  I want to ensure that our farmers will be promoted from second-class to first-class citizens.  They are entitled to that.&rdquo;  If the Minister does that he will make a name for himself.</P>

      <P>In my opinion agriculture, from the point of view of income and the standard of living, is at the crossroads.  Deputy L'Estrange has referred to the rise in overheads and unavoidable charges.  A car is essential in the case of a farmer who has a certain volume of business to do.  Farmers do not live in villages, in towns or in cities.  They have to look after their cattle.  They have to collect medicines. They have to deliver milk.  They have a hundred and one things to do. All these are unavoidable expenses, expenses the farmer did not have 20 or 30 years ago.  Then he may have had a horse and trap.  For four days of the week the horse would do productive work and earn his keep and on the other two days he might be used for either business or pleasure.  Today the farmer has heavy overheads and these can only be met by a big increase in the farmer's gross income.  My farming friends tell me they need a big grain cheque, a good milk cheque, good cheques for cattle or lambs, for pigs or whatever else it may be.  Their problem is to increase their gross income. They cannot increase it because of unavoidable costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> This problem must be faced.  It is easy to abuse the Government and say that the Minister has done nothing; perhaps that could be proved.  But we must face the fact that there is a grave need for change in the structure of farming.  I cast my mind back to a few years ago when the Department of Lands produced a retirement pension scheme to enable elderly farmers to retire.  As far as I remember this retirement pension would not affect the position if the farmer qualified for a non-contributory old age pension.  This scheme has been a total failure.  Perhaps the pension offered was too meagre.  Perhaps it was because the man who loves the land dearly just does not want to give it up.  Perhaps he is quite wrong in holding on when it should be passed over to younger members of his own family.  But whatever was the result the position was that the particular plan was a failure and that the structure of our farming remains the same.</P>
    <P>We had a visit from Dr. Mansholt not very long ago and last week some of us in the Fine Gael Party were privileged to be in Brussels and were entertained to lunch by that most eminent agriculturalist and heard what he had to say about the structure of agriculture. It is quite clear that the minimum size of a farm that you can have is that which will keep a man and his son, or his workman&mdash;two men&mdash;fully employed.  For the remainder of the family &mdash; because that would be a very small family &mdash; you need industrial employment and his idea was that such industrial employment should exist within three-quarters of an hour's driving from the farm on which the family reside.  One might call that supplemented agriculture.  This has not happened here with, perhaps, the happy exception of my own county, Louth, where industry is spread through the villages from Dundalk to Drogheda and in the Cooley peninsula and where farmers' sons and daughters may supplement the family income and perhaps produce more from their earnings than is produced by the land itself and by the people who stay at home and engage in industrial employment within, perhaps, fifteen minutes drive of their homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> We face the Common Market in a situation in which everybody is saying &ldquo;It will be marvellous for agriculture and disastrous for certain branches of industry&rdquo;.  I do not go along with either approach.  I completely accept the fact that if Britain goes in we must go in because we cannot isolate ourselves economically just because we happen to be an island.  I realise that if 74 per cent of our exports go to Britain, we must go in with them and so preserve our opportunity to export and to pay for the imports we require to feed and clothe our people and preserve the standards of life without which our people will go to Europe or America, allowing the State to become derelict.  While I accept that we must go in if Britain goes in, I do not accept, for instance, the simple mathematical calculation that suggests that if beef is 60 per cent dearer the beef producer will have 60 per cent more to spend.  If beef is 60 per cent dearer, cereals will be 25 per cent dearer &mdash; these are the round figures that are being bandied about.  On this basis, taking into account the cost of feeding cattle, one finds that the real advantage is in better production of grass.  It must be borne in mind that the cost of the raw materials to produce the beef which will be worth 60 per cent more, will also increase.  The cost of labour will have increased.  Everything will have increased in cost.  Therefore as we all live, not on a gross profit but on a net profit and while there will certainly be an improvement for agriculture within the Common Market, we would be following rainbows if we were to accept the gross figures being suggested for increases in prices as the measure of the advantage for the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>This is no criticism of the Government or of the Minister; it is just a fact of life.  It is very necessary that the agricultural structure here should be examined in a more positive way. There is no use in thinking that just because certain prices will rise spectacularly uneconomic holdings will overnight become economic.</P>
    <P>I was working for my party in the Donegal-Leitrim by-election and outside one village&mdash;naturally, I shall not name it was because I do not want to <Col N="1838" /> give people a sense of despair&mdash;I met the local parish priest between Masses and we spoke about the area within which I was working.  He was quite clear in his mind, and so was I when we had discussed it, that in one section of this area things had gone much too far, that in fact over a radius of perhaps ten miles the great preponderance of people living on the land were over 50 or 60 years of age and the young people had gone to England.</P>
    <P>Down a long lane I met one woman who had 14 children, 13 of them working in England and one who had unfortunately been killed while working on a building site in England.  This woman was living alone, keeping a few cows and pigs and trying to eke out an existence supplemented, I presume, by money from the decent sons and daughters.  That area has gone too far for restructuring based on the people who live there.  The only restructuring that could be done would be by the creation of viable holdings from which a decent livelihood could be obtained such as is obtainable in Dublin or in the towns or cities in the British Isles or in Europe or America.</P>
    <P>The parish to which I refer had not, in our opinion, reached that stage.  It was near a rather large town where there was some industrial employment and quite a number of young people were available if restructuring could be done there and if people on very small holdings could be induced to take annuities and pass on their holdings to others.  I am not talking of huge farms.  We could then get to the stage where a farm could be managed by two people, both getting a decent livelihood. There are areas in the West of Ireland and in Leitrim, very bad areas, where things have gone too far and it is incorrect to believe that the Common Market is a Shangri La, where nobody ever grows old and where every wish is gratified.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss some aspects of agriculture that could be improved.  I am involved in the grain trade.  I do not very often criticise the Department and I do not offer this as very strong criticism but I notice that there is a very natural approach by the Department to the various seeds they breed at <Col N="1839" /> their own plant-breeding stations and these are always high-lighted as the best seeds for the Irish farmer to sow. In very many cases that is true but there are also breeding stations on the Continent and in England.  To take wheat, for example, the variety of wheat which was best here for the production of bread for many years was atle and atle originated in Sweden. The most common variety now used is quern, which is bred from atle.  We are not investigating sufficiently at our various breeding stations cereal seeds like oats, barley and wheat, which are available from breeders all over the Continent, some of which may be better suited to our particular requirements than those we are breeding ourselves.</P>
    <P>It stands to reason that, while breeders here have the advantage of seeing the effect of our climate on seeds, they can also see the effect of our climate on seeds taken from abroad.  Farmers would have greater opportunities here if we were more liberal in our approach towards breeders from abroad.  We have always been far too conservative about this. The same thing happened in relation to cattle but there we had the difficulty of foot-and-mouth disease.  For 20 to 30 years the only animal for the Irish farmer and the Irish economy was the Shorthorn cow.  After a long battle and much criticism the Friesian cow appeared on the scene, and it became the most generally used milk cow in the country.  As improvements in breeding went on it was discovered that the Friesian breed was one of the best meat producing animals.  In all better farming areas the Friesian cow has now taken over, although in poorer areas, because a bigger intake of food is necessary for them, Friesians are not suitable.</P>
    <P>Despite the introduction of the Friesian all other breeds of cattle were excluded up until about 12 months ago when it looked as though we were being left behind and it was decided to import Charollais cattle, South Devon cattle, Simmental cattle and Limousin cattle.  With the exception of the South Devon cattle, these breeds are from the <Col N="1840" /> Continent.  It is a highly expensive procedure because they must be imported before they are six months old, because every beast on the Continent must have an injection of live foot-and-mouth vaccine when it is six months old.  This means that, if we are to follow our policy, we should not import those cattle unless they undergo a long period of quarantine.  However, people are getting a conversion rate on these breeds of cattle which is far higher than the conversion rate of any beef breed that we have here.</P>
    <P>The conversion rate of Charollais cattle and some other breeds is said to be as high as 3½ 1bs of meat per day.  I will not go into the details of how much meal, grass, silage and hay is required to put that on, but at home I have a young Friesian bull calf and from his date of birth he has put on almost 4 lbs per day and all he was fed was hay, some calf nuts, turnip and milk: he was suckled.</P>
    <P>The idea of the housewife wanting a small roast has gone.  It looks as if we shall all be buying pieces of meat of different grades and sizes in the supermarket in ten years time.  This will probably mean a disimprovement in quality, but it will also mean that there will be no demand for very small animals, such as the Shorthorn Hereford cross, which could be slaughtered almost as baby beef, because they made a small joint which fitted conveniently into the oven.  In future we are going to have a piece of meat which is cut up in a factory and put into a polythene bag.  This means that large heavy producing breeds are in. As one drives around the country one can see the Charollais cross cattle which have been produced by artificial insemination and farmers boast of their marvellous conversion rate.</P>
    <P>So far as seeds and animals are concerned, we must obtain the very best wherever that may come from.  I commend the Minister for introducing this feature of farming but I must say he is a little late in doing so.  The conservatism which was in the Department of Agriculture for so long seems to be disappearing.  If we are to keep on the land as many people as can get as good a living there as they could get in an <Col N="1841" /> ordinary industrial job, we must be &ldquo;with it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago the Common Market had, if I remember correctly, 300,000 tons of butter stored away.  I was told that, if one could see it all in one place, it would look like a mountain of butter. Apparently it has all disappeared. Many people in this country are leaving milk production because of the degree of slavery attached to it, having to milk cows twice a day, seven days a week, and because the price of our milk in relation to that in the Common Market is unsatisfactory.  At the present time the farming organisations are dissatisfied with the Minister, but I do not intend to refer to that here as I regard agriculture as far too serious a subject to this country to be made the object of advantage-taking across this House.</P>
    <P>Apart from the two reasons I have already mentioned, people have also left milk because of brucellosis, which has had to be cleared.  When we came to clear it we discovered a large number of our herds were suffering from it. Those farmers who used Strain 19 on their herds for the last 25 years, which is the live brucellosis vaccine, created a situation, as I understand it, where their cows reacted.  Even though abortion was not present on the farm, the cows reacted because they have been injected with live brucellosis vaccine. My experience was that out of 40 cows I had 16 reactors on the first occasion, and four on the second.  This means I cannot buy a female animal despite the fact that I have never had an abortion on the farm.  As I understand it if I had used the dead vaccine, known as Vaccine 45/20&mdash;I am not certain that is a correct description but I think it is &mdash; I would have got practically as good a result, not quite as good an insurance, perhaps, but I would not have been in the position whereby reaction to the brucellosis test occurred when there was no abortion present.</P>
    <P>This has meant that some farmers have had a pretty rough time with their herds.  Say a farmer has been breeding a herd of cows for 25 years.  In the first year their milk average was a certain figure, in the second maybe it did not improve, in the third it improved a <Col N="1842" /> little, in the fourth it improved a little and eventually he got to the stage where he had an extremely good milk production average over his herd.  That is something that takes decades to build up.  No normal amount of money per cow, even making some allowance for the fact that breeding up was done, even no over-generous amount of money, could compensate a farmer for the loss of that breeding up policy over a period of 25 years.</P>
    <P>We are now clearing up our various counties.  I have no doubt that, while Louth was waiting to be cleared up, many farmers, who had abortion on their farms, sold cows in sale yards in Louth.  This was the reason why Louth produced a high degree of brucellosis. I have no doubt that, since we started in Meath only about a month ago, the same thing has happened there.  If a farmer knows he has abortion on his farm and the brucellosis test is coming he can sell animals in the counties where the test has not, as yet, been applied.  As a result, the counties that were not dealt with first suffered. Farmers bought cows in the belief that they were absolutely healthy, but in fact they were not healthy because the farmers who sold them knew perfectly well that there had been abortion present on their farms.</P>
    <P>While I have indicated that if we join the Common Market we will not get as much profit as the figures might indicate, I believe without doubt that joining the Common Market will be a great help to agriculture in this country because we have got the best grass producing area in Europe.  We have got the climate that produces grass.  We have probably the cheapest grass in Europe.  Since the time Mr. Holmes from New Zealand came over here&mdash; I suppose 20 years ago&mdash;and described us as growing the least amount of grass that was possible under an Irish sky, great improvements have been made.  I could mention the land reclamation project, the lime scheme, the fertiliser subsidy scheme and many other improvements. The net result of all this is that whether our grass is fed in the form of silage or in the form of grass we have the best grass producing area in Europe.</P>
    <P>This means that for our lamb trade, <Col N="1843" /> for our mutton trade and for our beef trade we must have an advantage.  My suggestion, from this side of the House, as somebody who has always been intensely interested in agriculture, would be to try by every means in our power to produce our beef, our mutton and our lamb from the maximum amount of grass.  Every extra week we can get of a growing season in the autumn and of a growing season in the spring will be cheap feed.  I do not believe there will be any cheap cereal feed.  I understand that a ton of poultry meal in Paris costs £50.  It seems to me that the sources of animal protein such as meat and bone meal and vegetable protein such as soya bean meal, will not become cheaper; they will become dearer.  If that is so, we in Ireland should pin our faith on the introduction of a policy to produce more and more better grass.  If we can do that, and can do it for the winter season by making it into silage, we will have produced a source of wealth that will be of the greatest importance to this country. In the case of an industrial product made here, very often all we have is the labour content because all the raw materials that went into it may have come from abroad.  But if we produce here beef from grass, all that can come from abroad, and have affect on our balance of payments position in the export of that beef, would be the raw materials for the fertiliser industry and perhaps machinery for work on land project drainage.  After that the bullock that leaves here at £100 may be bringing up £90 for the Irish people. We must look on such an operation as one of our most important enterprises, which must not be impeded in any circumstance&mdash;either by delay in our efforts to get down to the job or by just not doing the job.  We cannot have beef without having cows and it does look as though our cow population is not on an upward trend.  We must clear our herds of brucellosis and that means the slaughter of quite a number of breeding cows.  That is a sad thing, something we must face up to.  The Government might be well advised to consider whether they might improve their present scheme relating to people who leave milk production, <Col N="1844" /> whether this scheme is wise at all, whether there should be a complete reappraisal of the situation and whether what we want is single suckling or multiple suckling herds as well as milk producing herds so that the number of steers becoming available for export as beef fed on Irish grass will continue to increase.  We know that cycles occur and that for perhaps a year or two there is a downward trend and then for a year or two there is an upward trend.  It is rather like the businessman who believes implicitly in his balance sheet, when in fact the truth is that in many businesses a balance sheet should be looked at in relation to the previous one and also in relation to what the next one is likely to be.</P>
    <P>We must get down to the maintenance of a very high number of breeding animals on the farm.  Such animals must give us maximum amounts of milk and of beef.  The greatest possible quantity of grass must be produced also.  There is something else we must do.  The old concept of the fellow with the dog and stick minding the cattle is gone.  At one time a farmer could go to the west of Ireland and buy cattle and fatten them up for sale in October. I went with my father to buy cattle from Deputy Donnellan's father when I was 17 years of age.  We bought the cattle outside an hotel in Tuam.  That day is gone.  We must now get down to the scientific production of beef for sale the whole year round.  We must get down to the production of beef for sale at the periods of highest price in the year.  We seem to be reaching a stage where there will be a large quantity of beef for export.  However, there must be a cycle when, if one has a silage unit and grass in it, one will be able to get his price in February and March.  One will get his price at this time of the year just before the grass beef comes on offer.  We should aim at having a cycle the whole year round. We want to have a constant supply of Irish beef reaching the markets.  This would ensure that we were regarded as important producers and exporters and that the quality and constancy of supply of our beef could be relied upon by our customers.  One of the first <Col N="1845" /> tenets of good business is that one should have the quality desired and the constancy of supply.  The old days of buying cattle in the west of Ireland and bringing them to Meath and Louth for fattening and subsequent sale are gone.  We must have grass supplies in either silage or fresh grass on our farms every day of the year.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the source of supply of the animals.  We must ask ourselves whether our farms are big enough to have a dairy farm on one side and to rear all the calves, or whether we will have a dairy herd which exists on milk and then sell all the calves.  We must ask ourselves whether we will have a single-suckle herd or a multiple-suckle the calves whereby we not only suckle the calves which have been born but buy further calves and suckle them.  We must make decisions on these matters.  The Government must set up machinery to support this very important side of agriculture. The farmers must be encouraged to the stage where they will not be able to stay out of this great adventure but will feel compelled to make the effort required to produce the maximum amount possible on the farm.</P>
    <P>Some of Dr. Mansholt's policies work that way.  They work in the way that, if one follows certain railway lines, life becomes easy and remuneration becomes attractive, but if one does not one goes broke.  It is a mixture of encouragement and warning.  There is no evidence of serious thinking on these matters in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries at the present time.  We must face the situation that the Common Market is coming, and we must decide where we can get the biggest money for the Irish farmer and for the nation.</P>
    <P>Moving now to the production of cereals, I must say that, even though the question of the production of grass is probably the most important of all, the production of cereals is extremely important also.  What is the amount of wheat that we ourselves can eat?  It does not appear as if there is much opportunity for exporting wheat from this country.  There is also the question of the production of feed grain for <Col N="1846" /> animals.  If the policy is to increase our cattle and our sheep numbers, and our pig and our poultry numbers, there is a need for the production here of large quantities of feed grain.  These large quantities of such grain can easily substitute for unnecessary imports from abroad.  One must look at our acreage and consider carefully the improvement of our grass production and how many cattle could be supported on it.  We must look at the animals which are born and realise that to some extent our grass must be supplemented with cereals and with vegetable and animal proteins.</P>
    <P>There is a great opportunity here for the production of more grain. Under Common Market conditions it appears that there will be an improvement of about 25 per cent in the price of grain.  The quantity of grain per acre being produced here over the last number of years has improved spectacularly. This is a side of agriculture which has kept pace with increased costs.  Farmers growing feeding barley, malting barely, wheat and oats have been able to get a gross profit per acre which has left them with a reasonable net profit on which to live.  The grain must be grown on a rotational basis. A figure of 30 per cent would appear to be a sensible one in a good grain-growing area, and this would leave 70 per cent under grass.  At present levels, grain production has been able to keep pace with rising costs.  If there is to be an increase of 25 per cent when we enter the Common Market, it appears that there is a good opportunity for the production of cereals.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that the idea that cattle raising and animal husbandry did not produce employment is gone. Conversely, the fact is that the production of grain now does not produce the volume of employment that it did about 20 years ago.  Long ago all grain had to be stooked and the binder and reaper was the only machine for the work.  I remember during the emergency, when the compulsory tillage regulations were enforced, being on a farm where there were 13 carts drawing in barley two and a half miles up a track through several fields.  I remember making ricks of barley, wheat and <Col N="1847" /> oats at the age of 16 or 17 and being severely criticised if they had to be propped.  However, apart from that aspect there was at that time a high volume of employment in the production of grain.  During the war when there was, quite properly, compulsory tillage, I remember seeing, in the dark of the morning, three pairs of horses going out to the fields.  What would a man plough in a day with a pair of horses?  If my memory serves me right he would plough little more than half a statute acre.  That meant that right from the period when the farmer ploughed between the stooks in order to get some ploughing done there were these men out ploughing constantly, and then came the harrowing and then the sowing and all the rest of it, and there was this high degree of employment. There is not that same high degree of employment today and that may be a contributory factor as to why grain growing pays.</P>
    <P>The employment now rests with the production of meat &mdash; lambs, pigs and beef&mdash;if produced properly.  It cannot pay if it is not properly produced.  I have accentuated before, that the fellow with the stick and the dog who buys cattle in May when they are dear, who makes no provision for winter fodder and has to sell them in November when they are cheap, sustains a loss.  In fact, in years past, before you would even look at his unavoidable costs, you would find that he might even sustain a gross loss, so that that type of farming has gone.  We must now look to a mixed farming economy, which was always the right one anyway, with employment on the farm created by the production of beef, milk, lamb and mutton and a high return in arable areas from the production of grain, but employment on grain production has dropped spectacularly in the last few years.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to detain the House I should discuss the position in regard to pigs, poultry and factory farming.  I may be quite wrong but I am afraid that I do not hold out prospects of a very great and splendid future for the production of pork for sale on the Continent &mdash; whether it is <Col N="1848" /> in the form of pork or bacon does not matter very much, except of course that we would like to have the extra benefit of curing the bacon here.  Pigs can be produced by way of factory farming.  Again, they can be produced with a lesser amount of labour than is required for beef.  This is being done on the Continent.  Pork is perhaps the cheapest meat on the Continent and it is the ordinary man's meat.  Last week when Dr. Mansholt was good enough to entertain a Fine Gael delegation to lunch in Brussels he mentioned that in his view too many calves were being slaughtered for veal on the Continent. He thinks that the grass producing areas on the Continent should keep their calves and rear them to the beef stage as we do and so get greater profit.  I do not think that there is for the Irish farmer &mdash; and if I am to stand up here and say my piece I should say what I honestly believe to be true in order not to mislead &mdash; a great future for either the production of pigs, of bacon or pork, or for eggs or for broiler chickens.  This can be done by rich men.  It can be done by highly developed organisations.  It can be done in any part of the Continent just as well as it can be done here.  If that is so then the transport factor from here to the Continent means less profit for us, perhaps not much less but certainly less profit.</P>
    <P>The Irish farmer should concentrate more on the aspect that I have mentioned. At the same time it would be wrong not to do our best to increase or maintain our production of pork, bacon and poultry.  While that is all true we should all go for the easy way out and while we have improved the production of grass for whatever purpose, I do not believe that even 50 per cent of our grass fields this year are producing their optimum.  We have the climate that allows them to produce their optimum and to do it at an economic rate.  I feel that there lies our opportunity, not in the other aspect but in the aspect I have described.</P>
    <P>I should like now to mention the position in relation to agri-business, co-operatives, farm businesses, and their relationship with farmers.  It is striking to find that while you have a row on at the moment &mdash; to which I <Col N="1849" /> will refer only in passing because I do not feel it does any good to refer to it at all &mdash; between two farming organisations and the Government we never seem to have any sort of row between the co-operatives and the agri-businesses, as I will call them, and the farmers.  We have an extremely good organisation whereby the farmer is getting an excellent service.  If you go to the south, from the Dungarvan Co-operative Society to the Mitchelstown Co-operative Society and to all the rest of them you will find in the good farming areas a service available to farmers which is second to none.  You will find fine men making every effort and achieving good results.  It does not matter whether it is a co-operative or a merchant or a country miller, they are doing a good job and it would be churlish of us if we did not mention that.  Of course I am one of them myself but I am not including myself.  I would say I am doing a bad job.  However, we must mention these men, whose names we may not bandy about in the House, who are giving agriculture an extremely good show.  There has arisen in their situation too a crisis in regard to costs.  The Department of Agriculture and the Minister &mdash; and I will not go into detail because I know too much about this as I am involved &mdash;should be made aware of the fact that these agri-businesses have reached, in certain respects, respects which have already been mentioned in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture, a severe crisis in costs.  It is something that must be investigated by the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce, by the flour millers, Bord Bainne, the Pigs and Bacon Commission and various other bodies.  My information is that as a result of wage increases in the last 18 months and the lack of any comparable increase so far as the finished products are concerned a crisis in many of these businesses will occur.  In a time of credit squeeze these people will hardly be carried by banks unless the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and those who have the opportunity to do so indicate their interest in the matter and their intention to set things right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> I do not want to discuss the dispute between the flour millers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding the price of flour&mdash;I have personal reasons for not so doing.  I commend the agreement recently made between the firm of Guinness and the farmers on an increase in the price of barley.  This was accepted by a democratic vote of the farmers; it was a fair increase and will remunerate the farmers for their extra costs.  As a person having some experience in this field I consider there is a crisis in regard to costs in the agricultural sector at the moment.  This matter must be looked at, not from the point of view of how many votes might be lost if increases were given to certain bodies for services rendered, or for goods they produce, but in the light of the excellent work carried out, particularly in the South of Ireland, to take up efficiently and at good prices the farmers' production. This work should not be impeded in any way.</P>
    <P>The co-operative movement and the other groups I have indicated have been of benefit to the farmers in the last 20 years.  We have only to look at our cheese production, the way we have diverted milk into the various lines of chocolate crumb and cheese products, and the manner in which we have provided many advantages to the farmers, to realise that in this regard we are keeping apace with developments on the Continent.  At the same time, it must be stated so far as the structure of our farms is concerned and the opportunities available to young people to get as much out of farming as they would secure if they worked in industry, that in these matters we are lagging behind.</P>
    <P>I am 47 years of age and I remember when the situation existed that wheat, barley and oats in County Louth had to await the availability of dryers.  I remember what happened to grain in bad harvests, such as in 1954; the grain rotted as did the sacks and high costs were charged to farmers because the sacks were of no use to anyone.  Nowadays I see on all sides that farmers have got bulk trailers; that there is an adequate number of dryers and combine harvesters.  Farmers are <Col N="1851" /> now much more skilled in the use of combine harvesters; I remember when they first got them they used to skim malting barley, which was not good for the brewing trade.  Nowadays they come in with the grain always in a perfect condition&mdash;a rejection of the grain rarely occurring.  There are available to them dryers, stores and a quick turn round for their bulk trailers and they have no trouble with sacks.</P>
    <P>The next debate in this House will be about the jute industry.  It is impossible to make omelettes without breaking eggs and we must express our sympathy in that regard.  At the same time, I would say to the Minister&mdash; and I am sure the chairmen of co-operative societies and co-operative managers will agree with me and perhaps will make their views known to the Minister, if they have not done so already&mdash;that in the agricultural business even though there have been increases in wage rates and general costs in the last 18 months increases have not been allowed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the finished product.  Similarly, where services have been provided, remuneration for the services has not been increased.  This could affect adversely the smooth, proper and most efficient production of Irish agricultural goods.</P>
    <P>The horse industry earns a considerable amount of money.  We have the National Stud; we provide stallions in various parts of the country to facilitate farmers who may have a half-bred mare and wish to have the services of a stallion.  This is done in County Cork, in the west of Ireland and in various other parts.  In my part of the country we appear to have gone far too upstage &mdash; we must have a thoroughbred animal or none at all, and mostly it is none at all.  Farmers who have a piece of winterage that may not be very good land should consider seriously the possibility of keeping a couple of Irish draught mares and availing of the service of a stallion provided by the Department at a nominal fee.  They can breed good half-bred hunters for which they can get most attractive prices.  At this <Col N="1852" /> moment farmers can secure very good prices for such hunters.  I am sorry that this is not being done to a greater extent and I would suggest to farmers that this practice might very profitably be reintroduced.  Admittedly, it is necessary to wait for a couple of years before good progeny is available but the feeding costs are not very high. In this instance I would mention west Limerick where, as a result of this sideline, the farmer has a few hundred pounds in his pocket which otherwise he would not have.  The people with the expensive thoroughbred mares can, to a great extent, look after themselves. Of course, the work of the National Stud should not be forgotten; they are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>There are times when the purchase price of a stallion or even a brood mare is such that it is only either a consortium of people or the State itself that can afford it.  In that context the State has done its job.  It has introduced Tulyar, Vemi and various other animals who would have been lost and whose progeny and bloodlines would have been lost to us if it had not been for the policy over the years. While that is true, I would point out to farmers that to have a brood mare around the place will not break them. They may have bad luck, they may have an animal that is unfruitful or they may have a young animal that injures itself or has a blemish of some kind and, unlike a bullock, will be faulted for that blemish and will not get a high price.  At the same time, taking the swings and the roundabouts, there is no doubt at all that there is money in the breeding of horses, whether they be pedigree horses or Irish draught crossed with a pedigree stallion or whether they be half-breds or three-quarter breds.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to some of the difficulties that seem constantly to beset the work of the land project.  I know of a case where five farmers wanted to run a drain down the side of a field in order to free their lands from flooding.  When they started to excavate, a man who had, believe it or not, a well in an outhouse, objected vociferously because, he said, they would dry out his well.  At that stage the whole operation stopped.  I suppose <Col N="1853" /> the decision lies with the farmers as to whether they proceed.  Perhaps common law then comes into it and the land project officer in the case is out of the whole business.</P>
    <P>There appears to me to be too many cases in which the land project work is stultified by the most ridiculous objections by certain people.  At times the land project officers are too conservative as to whether land can be drained.  I know that if your levels are wrong you cannot drain land and you have a bog that will be there when we are all dead.  However, the machinery operations that are available now were not available in such great quantity or efficiency when the land project was first started, and it is possible to do things now that could not be done then.  There could be a more liberal approach to the work of the land project.</P>
    <P>I do not want to keep the House talking all night about agriculture, which is a very easy thing to do if you are particularly interested in it, but let me come to the question of the provision of self-feed silage units.  I do not think there is a great need for very expensive self-feed silage units.  It is possible, without going into secondhand materials, to produce a self-feed silage unit at a capital cost of £2 per annum.  I know this because I have done it myself.  Sometimes I see farmers spending considerably more and it is not necessary.</P>
    <P>The farmer who provides a self-feed silage unit at that cost has a most valuable asset on his farm.  He has something which will obviate the slavery of cutting silage out of a silage pit and carrying it to animals. It will enable him to ensure that his animals are well fed during the winter and that his land is not poached and will be three weeks earlier with the grass in the spring.  If there is a bad summer the good farmer cannot be blamed for having bad hay, but if he makes good silage he will have something as good as the lush grass that the bullock or the heifer was eating out in the field in the month of May or June.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to increase the grants he is giving for self-feed <Col N="1854" /> silage units even if it comes to the point of decreasing grants for other aspects of farming if he has not got the money.  The most important and fundamental thing we can do is to provide this great Irish grass all the year round and to do it we must have self-feed silage units.</P>
    <P>There should be very strict discipline in regard to the manner in which the self-feed silage unit is created.  It is important, for instance, that tractors and trailers can drive straight in on top of the grass that is going to be silaged by making the silage unit on a slope of a field so as to avoid the necessity of man labour or the purchase of a blower to blow the grass in at a cost of £600 or £700.</P>
    <P>There should be grants for farmers' machinery co-operatives.  The trouble with silage is that the small farmer cannot make it because he cannot afford the capital cost of the machinery to do it economically and efficiently. At home four farmers and myself have formed a machinery partnership&mdash;I do not think you could call it a co-operative; you would have to call it partnership&mdash;and I think I should explain to the House how it works: a larger farmer has two tractors, which he does not own; the partnership owns them.  A small farmer has one tractor.  Then we have a complete set of silage-making machinery and of course along with this there are muckspreaders, part of the silage trailers.  We levy upon ourselves a figure per acre of silage cut and a figure per tractor, which we pay into this partnership and lodge in a local commercial bank.  If you have 50 acres of silage and the levy was £4 10s or £5 you must lodge in the partnership £250.  At the annual general meeting the levy per acre, whatever it might be, and the levy per tractor is assessed on the basis of renewing this machinery every five years.</P>
    <P>The machinery was bought with a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. When the time comes to make the half-yearly repayment, there is enough money in the commercial bank in the local town for the partnership to make it.  Money is being saved <Col N="1855" /> and when we feel that the tractors and the muckspreaders and the silage machinery have reached the end of their useful life, we will have enough money to replace them, and we will sell them second-hand if anyone is prepared to buy them.</P>
    <P>So far it has worked extremely well. It has been running for three years.  If we had included hay-making machinery I have no doubt that we would have fallen out long ago because, on the day the sun was shining, my friend Deputy O'Connor and I would both want the machinery if we were in partnership.  It works with regard to the making of silage.  It is practical.  It means that the smaller farmer who has not got a unit big enough to allow him to have a complete set of silage making machinery, has it available to him.  We have our agreement and it works.  In fact, since the agreement was made, one farmer decided that he would leave the partnership.  We had made provision for what happened when he did. His interest was computed on a computation which was included in the agreement.  He got what his interest was worth and the others carried on.</P>
    <P>With the advent of silage-making this is possible.  This should be encouraged by the Department and the committees of agriculture.  It can be compared to an effort to get a group water scheme going.  If farmers can come together voluntarily and do this, they will be able to have a much higher level of production&mdash;even though their units are small &mdash; than they would if they were working on their own.  I mention this to the Minister for consideration when he is deciding on his future policy.</P>
    <P>If he were over here and we were over there I am certain that my good friend Deputy Creed would be asking me to bring up this partnership agreement so that he could have a look at it.  However, while that will not be delayed for very long, it would be wrong if something is working right not to give the Minister the full information and advice on it.  I am now informing the Minister that if he wants all the details on how this small operation works, I will be delighted to provide <Col N="1856" /> them for him.  It could be of great help to the farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>May I end as I began by saying that we all live on a net profit?  When we talk about a 60 per cent increase in the price of beef on entering the Common Market, that does not mean that the farmers' income from beef will go up by 60 per cent.  The calf will want calf nuts.  The cow will want some cereals.  The increase in the price of those commodities is estimated at 25 per cent in the same volume in which the increase in the price of beef is estimated at 60 per cent.  We must also remember that you do not put a pound of beef on a beast for every pound of meal you feed it.  In fact, it is considerably less.  While there will be a pretty good improvement, there will not be the spectacular and lavish improvement that some people seem to think there will be.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the Government's approach to the Common Market in their application for membership. I am more disappointed on the industrial side because they should have asked for special terms to a greater extent than they did.  They asked for special terms for jute but, in my opinion, that was no more than a sop to the Minister for Industry and Commerce because he was in trouble in his own constituency.  I merely mention this in passing.  The details printed the other day about this factory show that jute is in trouble no matter what happens.</P>
    <P>There should have been a more detailed approach in relation to our agricultural problems.  As we move towards the Common Market, within our agricultural economy there are certain aspects about which we might need to ask for special provision.  It is not my job to retail them in the House but it is the job of the Department to watch carefully for pit-falls. At times the Labour Party say things about the Common Market with which I do not agree, but I definitely agree with them on one point, that is, that the Government have not been bargaining hard enough.  If there is one thing on which the Labour Party and this party agree in this regard, it is that bargaining has not been a feature <Col N="1857" /> of our approach to our application to join the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know that if the continentals get a chance, in the vernacular of the countryman, they will take the pants off you.  It is our job to see that they do not do that. We need to bargain as we never bargained before.  Bearing in mind the size of our economy in relation to the size of the economies of Britain and the Common Market, I do not think that, if we ask for special terms where special terms are needed, that will have any effect one way or the other on whether we get in.  If Britain goes in, we go in, but we should go in with our bargains.  The Minister should make quite certain that the Irish farmer, the Irish countryman, does not lose anything that can be gained by hard bargaining as we approach the Common Market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my opening remarks with a word of congratulation for our farmers large and small up and down the country.  They have done a magnificent job in improving their farms, and their herds, and their position generally.  However, in making that statement I do not want it to be thought that I am suggesting that they are getting the full recompense to which they are entitled, particularly in regard to milk.</P>
      <P>I find in my own area that, in spite of the extra subsidies which have been given to milk over the past number of years, the price has not increased in actual fact.  I checked in various areas over the past three weeks and I found that the average milk price throughout Kerry in the big creameries is not more than 2s a gallon, and in many cases less.  This includes the top premium paid for quality milk.  This price almost obtained in that area eight years ago and it is hard to understand why it still obtains throughout the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers have done a good job in the improvement of milk under very trying conditions because, with all due respect to the various Departments concerned, the farmers have not got the help and assistance they should have got to bring about the position <Col N="1858" /> which they have brought about by themselves, by and large, and by their own efforts.  In many cases they are left without water supplies and water schemes which are so necessary to them having regard to their way of life.  In some cases accommodation roads were not brought up to standard. Money was not made available. This is all very necessary having regard to the pattern and way of life of our farmers today.  Of course, there must be good roads to facilitate the haulage of produce by heavy vehicles.  It is a pity that all the Departments have not made a combined effort to help these people in the difficult work they do.</P>
    <P>Our farmers are looking forward to the challenge of the Common Market and have been very progressive in gearing themselves towards membership of that Community so that there is an air of great optimism among them.  From my experience of the Continent, I would say that our farmers have nothing to fear so far as continental farmers are concerned because our farmers are intelligent and industrious and these attributes should receive the rewards they deserve in an enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>A substantial increase in milk prices is necessary.  For the past couple of years I have been encouraging mountain farmers to produce beef rather than milk as being the most suitable for smallholders.  The mountain farmer delivers milk only at the surplus stage, say, from June to mid-September, because he must milk-feed calves for the first two or three months to make them strong enough to survive in the difficult conditions of the harsh winter months.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to re-examine the beef subsidy scheme with a view to seeing if the subsidy could be paid in respect of the first two calves.  This would mean a lot to a person having not more than eight or ten cows.  It is wrong that such a person should be excluded from receiving payment for the first two calves. It should not be of great cost to the Exchequer if payment in respect of the entire herd were made in the case of a smallholder with four or six cows.</P>
    <P>I have never accepted, and I never <Col N="1859" /> shall accept, any statement to the effect that there is no place in Europe for this type of farmer.  It is very seldom that a smallholding is advertised in the daily papers.  It is nearly always the person having a holding of 150 or more acres who is selling out.  A smallholder knows no other way of life than to work the holding on which generations of his people had made a living.  In my own county I see young men who are quite prepared to continue, as their fathers did, to make a living from the land.  Perhaps they are not earning the sort of money that their brothers may be earning in industries or elsewhere but they are happy in this continuous way of life.  It is our duty to help them in any way possible.  These people work very hard, and in many cases farmers in mountainous areas have modernised their homes and farmyards.  In some of the wealthier counties I have found holdings which, instead of having roads leading to them, have tractor tracks and there are houses in a dismal condition.</P>
    <P>The Minister should direct more attention to mountain farmers in particular. In mountainous areas of Kerry, there is a tendency towards an increase in population.  The determination of people in these areas to make a living from their holdings can overcome all the obstacles which people from outside very often say cannot be overcome. I have no hesitation in saying that the dole has helped greatly in my county as it has helped in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I hate the word &ldquo;dole&rdquo;.  I was one of the first people to exert pressure for the introduction of this system and at the time of its introduction I endeavoured to have it paid as an agricultural grant but no method of levying it correctly could be found except through this system. It was given accordingly to help those people to overcome the difficulties of the time.  I am very glad that it is available for them. I have seen young farmers with four and five children who on holdings of 12 to 15 acres are producing per acre, four to six times as much as is obtained from the very rich lands in the midlands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a very interesting article on page five which indicated that this motion was only second thoughts with the Fine Gael Party.  It was not a motion which would have got any priority from them at all.  As usual, there were other gimmicks but the <i>Sunday Independent</i> revealed the truth of the facts within the Fine Gael Party.  The article is headed: &ldquo;Hunt on for Cosgrave's Spy&rdquo;.  This article referred to the fact that another motion was down and <Col N="1861" /> was to be taken but the Fine Gael Leader, who was indisposed at the time, made a hurried telephone call here and asked them for God's sake to put something on the agenda, push Flanagan or someone into the House, get somebody to talk on some motion to keep the job going until such time as he came in to discuss the motion which was already down and which would have got priority.</P>
      <P>The article mentioned the motion in relation to Goodbody's and pointed out that Deputy Oliver Flanagan and Deputy Enright from this particular constituency, where the jute factory closure was imminent, came in to discuss the motion.  They decided that this would be a good one to select as a good debating subject.  Deputy Enright made a recitation about the situation in Clara.  Now we have the full story of the &ldquo;Hunt for Cosgrave's Spy&rdquo;, the man who divulged that this was not the motion to be presented to the House but another motion.  This shows that the Fine Gael Party were not very concerned about the closure of the Clara factory.  At the last moment they decided to put in their good friend Deputy Oliver Flanagan to keep the matter moving until such time as the Committee of Public Accounts had examined one of the people they tried to get at.  It is indicated in the article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that they wanted to get at a certain Minister and for that reason they decided to put down the Goodbody motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned, as I stated before, about the problems which affect the workers of this country.  If I felt that this was not a political gimmick, that an inquiry was essential and that it would disclose something which was not already known, then I would be the first in the interests of the workers to say we should have an inquiry.  However, I recognise this as a political gimmick.  Gimmicks of this type are no substitute for jobs.  The only substitute is a new industry.  That is what Deputy Cowen and Deputy Connolly have been pressing for quite a considerable time.  They have been pressing for new industries to replace industries which are being run down for one reason or another.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has <Col N="1862" /> been assisting in no small way in the replacement of industries and in the establishment of new industries throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The workers of this country are well aware of the Minister's interest in their problems and of his desire to ensure that there will be many more jobs to absorb those who leave the technical and vocational schools and the universities. This cannot be brought about by motions of this kind.  It can only be brought about by a realistic approach to the problem, by a comprehensive examination of the industrial development which is required, which will give long and lasting employment.</P>
    <P>We are well aware of the fact that the jute industry is on the way out and has been for quite a considerable time.  It has been run down in many other countries.  Deputy Connolly produced some very convincing figures last week in relation to this industry.  He gave quite a comprehensive list of the many thousands of redundant workers in Britain and he listed quite a number of industries there which in a short space of time have substantial redundancies. He mentioned that in March, 1969 Alex Henderson &amp; Sons closed down completely, that in July, 1969, Jute Industries Limited had quite a considerable number of redundant workers and in September of that year they had twice as many redundant.  In November, 1969, Spalding &amp; Valentine Limited and Tay Textiles Limited had a considerable number of redundant workers.  In December, 1969, Cairds of Dundee had 200 redundant workers. Those redundancies occurred in this industry and give a clear indication that this is not something which happened only in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is something which has happened all over the world because of the introduction of plastics and other substitutes which are replacing jute. Deputy Connolly went on to explain that in February, 1970, there were further redundancies in Tay Textiles and Jute Industries Ltd. Kennedy &amp; Company in April of that year had 40 redundant workers and Cairds of Dundee ceased jute production altogether in June, 1970.  In July, 1970 Don &amp; Duncan Limited had redundant workers and in September and October <Col N="1863" /> Tay Textiles had additional redundant workers.  Deputy Connolly quoted from the <i>Jute and Synthetic Review</i>&mdash; a London publication&mdash;of November, 1970.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This indicates the general trend in relation to the jute industry.  Not alone does this affect England, Wales and Scotland but it also affects us, because with the intense competition throughout the industry everybody is out to buy as cheaply as possible.  The alternatives to the home produced article of cheaper synthetic fabrics are making their impact on this particular industry. It is not only a question of an industry closing down in Ireland.  It is a broad view of what is happening elsewhere in this industry.  It must be assumed that the same trends in relation to the buying of materials will continue here.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the inside of the houses of some of the Deputies who spoke on this motion to ascertain if they bought the home produced article or the foreign produced article when purchasing their carpets.  I am quite sure that such an examination would reveal that they also seek some alternative if they consider it is cheaper and of comparable quality.  However, this is a situation we have to face. It must be faced in a realistic way. From the workers' point of view that is very important.  Crocodile tears are no use to the unemployed.  What is required is another job.  It is the intention of the Government, of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of Deputy Connolly and Deputy Cowen, who represent the constituency, to ensure that workers displaced will find new and better employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are always concerned when workers are laid off.  I can understand Deputy O.J. Flanagan and Deputy Enright making a case, very properly, because there are redundancies in the area.  I would do the same if workers became redundant in my constituency. However, this motion will not provide a single job for any redundant <Col N="1864" /> worker.  Our task is to find out what must be done to provide employment for those who become redundant. On 18th February, in reply to a question, the Minister indicated that a new factory was being established in Clara which would employ a substantial number of male workers when in full production.  He said that, in addition, the IDA were negotiating for the establishment of a factory of 20,000 sq. ft. in the area.  This is actually under way.  This shows the anxiety to provide new jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the Department of Labour Manpower Training Service and AnCO visited Clara and advised the workers of vacant jobs in other parts of the country and of the retraining facilities available.  A small number of workers have already been placed in other jobs or have been offered retraining.  This is very important. When an industry closes down facilities should be available to enable workers to obtain greater skills.  That did not happen in the past.  Today workers have the benefit of redundancy compensation and retraining facilities. Every worker who requires retraining will be retrained and will have, as a result of that training, a greater potential for the future.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there was enough consultation between the workers and management in this particular industry. I approve wholeheartedly of worker/ management co-operation.  Sometimes workers are aware well in advance that redundancies will occur.  Short notice is something that should be eliminated because it is very unfair to the workers. Workers, after all, have certain financial commitments which they must meet and a month's notice or two months notice is just not good enough.  Indeed, some are laid off with a week's notice.</P>
    <P>An inquiry would not reveal very much.  If an industry is facing closure there should be consultation with the workers 12 months in advance of closure. That would give a better situation from the point of view of resettlement and retraining.  This does not happen at the moment.  Deputy Enright says the workers got short notice.  I sympathise with him in this and I appeal to industrialists generally to ensure consultation <Col N="1865" /> with workers well in advance of closure to enable the workers to establish themselves in some other employment. I am sure the Minister and Deputy Connolly and Deputy Cowen have advised the workers of their rights. I know they have been in touch with AnCO about the retraining of the workers.  Sometimes workers who are laid off are fortunate in that they are enabled to acquire more advanced skills and can then enter the labour market on more advantageous terms to themselves.  That is a progressive step.</P>
    <P>Where industrialisation is concerned, the policy should be to establish a certain number of industries in a particular area and not just one big industry. If a big industry closes down number of workers are affected.  They are removed from other industrial opportunities.  Their skills are limited. All these things create problems. AnCO have indicated that they are prepared to go to Clara to provide <i>ad hoc</i> training there.  A rather gloomy picture was painted of Clara.  It was described as a dead town.  That sort of approach can only injure Clara because industrialists will hesitate to go there.  I believe that the workers in Clara are just as efficient, intelligent and adaptable as workers elsewhere. I work in close proximity to Deputy Cowen and Deputy Connolly and I know that the workers of Clara have been well served by these Deputies and have got all the attention they deserve. I have no doubt that the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is a very effective and efficient Minister will do all he can to see that the general pattern in relation to redundancies and industry as a whole will be comprehensively examined so as to ensure that we shall not have a repetition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine in listening to the previous speaker that this motion was for the purpose of engaging battle between rival Deputies in the constituency.  I should like to knock that idea on the head right away.  In that constituency it has been for very many years the practice for all parties representing the constituency to put their heads together whenever disaster strikes or a vital or important issue arises.  They forget their political affiliations and work as a team in an effort to improve conditions in whatever sphere of activity the need arises.  So it is with this issue.  There is no question of one Deputy endeavouring to score over another or, I am sure, of the Minister endeavouring to score over Deputies.  There is a problem here: we want to talk about it, have an exchange of views on it and we want to come together in an effort to solve it by pooling our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tone of the debate has been very high because of so many issues being introduced which, in my opinion, do not come within the ambit of the motion but I am sure the learned Chair is the best judge of that.  This motion <Col N="1867" /> was tabled some weeks ago and on the Wednesday following the tabling of it, after Questions the Taoiseach was asked by me and by Deputy Enright to give Government time for its discussion in view of the urgency and importance of the motion to 300 workers and approximately 1,500 persons who are, or may be concerned. The Taoiseach suggested that it was not a matter for him but for the Fine Gael Party to give priority to the motion.  I discussed the matter with the leader of the party, Deputy Cosgrave, in relation to other Private Members' motions on the Order Paper and this motion was one that was considered urgent since it dealt with the livelihood of so many persons and, in the event of the Minister agreeing to hold the inquiry sought, it would be an advantage to the management, Messrs. Goodbody, to the trade unions concerned and to the workers who could solicit information they could not otherwise obtain.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I should like to deal with this motion in a very practical and commonsense way.  Too often we have Deputies over-anxious to take advantage of people's misfortunes; too often, perhaps, we have political parties too anxious to take advantage of people's misfortunes but when it comes to work or to the standard of living or the livelihood of people it is too important to be placed second to other issues.  When Deputy Cosgrave recommended that this motion be taken, he based his opinion on the fact that this motion dealt with the livelihood of all the people in a town in the Laois-Offaly constituency. I express my thanks and appreciation to Deputy Cosgrave and to all my colleagues in the party for agreeing to give this motion priority here.</P>
    <P>The motion has been read over time and again and I do not propose to take up the time of the House by reading it but it has been said that it would be unusual for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to conduct an inquiry into the affairs of a privately-owned company.  I agree with that but this motion does not ask for an inquiry into the affairs of Messrs. Goodbody: it asks that the Minister should order <Col N="1868" /> an inquiry into the decision of the firm, a completely different matter, to close jute spinning in their long-established mills at Clara.  The Chair will agree that there is a difference between an inquiry into the affairs of a private industrial concern and an inquiry into one aspect of the firm, their decision to close jute spinning at Clara.</P>
    <P>Further on in the motion we give a reason &ldquo;because of the amount of public money invested in same in recent years&rdquo;.  Again, we can underline in the motion: &ldquo;so that workers involved through their trade union may be in a position to give evidence at such inquiry and to solicit information which cannot be obtained otherwise&rdquo;. I say in all sincerity, as the longest-sitting TD for Laois-Offaly that I have been associated with Messrs. Goodbody for almost 30 years and I have always looked upon that firm as one of the most reputable and progressive firms in the world.  It is a very old and long-established family industry. The reason why so many people in Mountmellick are concerned about the future of Messrs. Goodbody is that Mr. John Goodbody came to Ireland and lived in Mountmellick in the 17th century.  There have always been close and affectionate ties between the two towns.  Mr. John Goodbody died in 1705.  Mr. Mark Goodbody, another member of the firm, was born in 1749 and he owned a shop and a tannery in Mountmellick.  In 1865, Mr. Mark Goodbody settled in Clara and established the jute spinning mills there.  In 1963 the firm became a public company. This must be one of the longest and best known family businesses in Europe.</P>
    <P>Instead of being critical of Messrs. Goodbody I want to salute the firm, its directors and all members of the family for the employment they gave in Clara and for their effort to make Clara the centre of their industrial activities. From 1936 to 1970 the company had their ups and downs but in November, 1970 there was no indication that the mills in Clara were about to be closed.  At that time there were negotiations between the trade unions and the management in connection with the redundancy of 18 female workers.  At no time during the <Col N="1869" /> course of these negotiations was there any question of closing down the jute manufacturing activities in the area.</P>
    <P>Because of the unsteadiness of the world jute market a group of consultants were engaged to investigate and make recommendations on the Clara factory.  These consultants went to Clara and prepared a report.  I presume that in the course of their investigations they also visited the Waterford factory and any other works or businesses connected with the firm of Messrs. Goodbody. The consultants submitted their report to the board of directors in October and the Minister for Industry and Commerce was supplied with a copy of that report for his own information. The management and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are the only people who know the contents of the report.  The report was submitted in October and during negotiations between unions and management about the redundancy of 18 female workers in November there was no question of closing down the factory. How does it come about that on the 7th December it was announced that 250 workers at least were to become redundant in Clara because of the company's decision to close the jute spinning mills there?  There was a shock announcement about the closure of the mills.</P>
    <P>A good deal of suspicion surrounds the contents of the consultants' report. I accept that the consultants' report was for the guidance and information of the firm alone but this firm has been given £150,000 of the taxpayers' money for expansion.  The people of Clara and the surrounding districts are part and parcel of that industry.  The trade unions sought to obtain the relevant section of the report which deals with either a reduction or expansion of employment but they were told they could not have it and this is one reason why an inquiry should be held.  I venture to suggest that if Messrs. Goodbody have no reason to hide the contents of the consultants' report they will readily agree to such an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Why should they agree to such an inquiry?  They should agree to it because of the tradition of loyal service to that firm by workers both male and female in Clara.  The Goodbody family <Col N="1870" /> are an extremely popular, highly respected family who are regarded most affectionately by all sections of the community in the area.  Knowing the directors as I do I suggest that if the Minister asked them they would not have any objection to disclosing to the public the contents of the consultants' report.</P>
    <P>My information is that the consultants' report recommended that Clara was to be the centre of the jute spinning industry in the 26 counties and that if the firm were to spend further money on development it should be spent on development in Clara.  It is very strange that even though the consultants' report recommended expansion should take place in Clara a decision was taken to cease spinning there.  I want to challenge&mdash;challenges are frequently taken up outside this House, although they are not frequently taken up inside it &mdash; Messrs. Goodbody to publish the relevant section of the consultants' report.  If they do this it will be indicated clearly that the report recommended that Clara be the future centre for the manufacture of jute in the 26 counties.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect of this whole affair is that Messrs. Goodbody also have a factory in Waterford and as a result of the decision to cease manufacturing in Clara some of the machinery is to be transferred from Clara to Waterford and there is to be overtime for 100 additional men in Waterford at the expense of 250 fewer workers in the town of Clara.  Surely there is nothing unreasonable in asking for a public inquiry into a firm which has got, we are told, £150,000 of taxpayers' money for developing Clara, when machinery that has been giving employment in an undeveloped area, as it has been described and designated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is being taken out and put into the city of Waterford to give 100 additional jobs in a city in which the construction of an industrial estate is already under way, a city which cannot be compared in prosperity to a country town like Clara?</P>
    <P>Is it the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce then to permit the transfer of industries from undeveloped areas in the midlands to industrial <Col N="1871" /> zones like Shannon, Galway or elsewhere?  This is a very serious matter for those who are depending on industrial work in rural Ireland. This in itself justifies the holding of an inquiry into this decision.  The Minister, if he agrees to conduct such an inquiry, can have the terms of reference designed to safeguard other aspects of the transactions of this company and to confine it to the reasons why the decision was suddenly and unexpectedly made by Messrs.  Goodbody to suspend jute spinning in Clara.</P>
    <P>That is the case we make for this inquiry.  If this inquiry does not take place, for generations to come there will be unnecessary talk, suspicion and discontent.  There will be rumours and dissatisfaction.  There will be allegations made against the firm of Messrs. Goodbody and against the workers and against the Government.  A public inquiry would clear up the whole situation and let the public know why this decision was taken and let the workers know why there are to be 300 less jobs in Clara and 100 more jobs in Waterford.  I wish Waterford the best of luck but I do not like to see any city getting additional employment at the expense of the people of my constituency. I am sure Deputy Cowen, Deputy Connolly and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are as anxious to preserve the rights of workers in that constituency as I am.  If we allow a situation such as this to prevail and do not have an inquiry we can all hang our heads in shame.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling said that Deputy Connolly, Deputy Cowen and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had the right solution for the whole problem.  The right solution is to keep Messrs. Goodbody going as it is now and there is no other.  If it is to be the centre of jute manufacturing for this country let it be but no industry that will ever be got for Clara will replace it.  What type of industry can be put in the town of Clara that will give the same employment?  The last Deputy who spoke said it is only a matter of putting up a factory and putting the displaced workers into it. Did anybody ever hear such lunacy? <Col N="1872" /> Jute spinning is a highly-skilled job and we have no guarantee that workers of 40, 50, 60, 62 or 63 years of age can walk in, without retraining, to work in a new industry.  It just cannot be done.  We are told the Fianna Fáil Party will set up new industries in the area.  More power to them.  That is what we want and that is what we want to help them to do.</P>
    <P>Clara is now an undeveloped area. It is a depressed area.  If something is not done soon the grass will grow on the centre of the streets and will be kept down only by the wheels of the hearses going through on the way to the burial ground with the corpses. That may be a gloomy picture but that is what will happen unless something is done.  I am hopeful that because the Minister for Industry and Commerce represents the constituency something will be done.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has seen a report published in the Westmeath Offaly Independent of 11th December, 1970?  I quote:</P>
    <P>Twelve Possible Industries for Offaly</P>
    <P>Twelve industrialists are ready, willing and anxious to set up factories in County Offaly if they can get suitable and serviced sites.  Mr. G. Connolly, TD, gave this information to the Westmeath Offaly Independent on Wednesday last.</P>
    <P>May I congratulate most wholeheartedly the giver of the good news to Deputy Connolly of these 12 new factories.  We all rejoice that these 12 factories are coming to Offaly but there seems to be no indication as to who these industrialists are, what they will produce, where the factories will be put up.  It is a very poor commentary on County Offaly, which I represent, if there are 12 factories waiting to be established and there are no suitable sites; that if this press report is correct, there are 12 industrialists mad, red hot, geared up and willing to set up 12 important factories in County Offaly but that there is nowhere to put them, no serviced sites. I want to assure the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there are any amount of suitable industrial sites in County Offaly and that they are available in the area immediately convenient to the town of Clara.  All I <Col N="1873" /> would ask is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should, tomorrow morning, if he is not going to hold this inquiry, summon these 12 industrialists who have been in touch with Deputy Connolly and ask them where they want the serviced sites. Since there will be approximately 300 workers affected by the closure of Messrs.  Goodbody and assuming that we will have 12 factories, are we greedy in asking that six of these factories should be put in Clara to replace Messrs. Goodbody?  If six of these factories were established there, employing 100 people each, 600 people would be in useful employment and as there is such a variety of factories perhaps we could have one for younger people, suitable for training, and one for the older people, say, over the age of 55, who will become redundant in the jute mills.  Where there is a selection of 12 factories it will not be a very big job for the Minister and the IDA.  The industrialists will, I am sure, be only too happy to avail of all the Government facilities that are available so that Clara may be suitably compensated for the loss of this industry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a Cheann Comhairle, I recommend this motion to the House. I ask the House to support it wholeheartedly because this motion calls merely for a public inquiry into an important company decision which affects the livelihood of 1,500 people or approximately 300 families in a country town which has for generations depended on the progress and the standard of production of this firm. I appeal to the Minister to accept the motion and to allow the inquiry to be held in order that the trade unions, the management and all concerned will be given an opportunity of expressing their views.  I feel that it would be welcomed by Messrs. Goodbody.  The full report of the consultants should be published in the press and given to the Dáil and to the country.  I understand that the report favours Clara as the centre of the jute-spinning industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, first, in relation to this motion that an inquiry into the affairs of any company <Col N="1874" /> can be ordered by me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, only in certain limited circumstances which do not apply in this case.  The circumstances indicated are that I can order an inquiry on a direction by the High Court, on a request by the company itself, on a request by a certain number or proportion of the shareholders, and on its appearing to the Minister that there are circumstances to suggest fraud, oppression of shareholders or with-holding of information from shareholders. As I see it, none of the above circumstances arises in the case of Messrs. Goodbody.  The amount of State money invested in the company &mdash;a point highlighted in the motion&mdash; does not constitute a reason for holding an inquiry in accordance with this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan indicated that in this particular instance if one were to read the motion carefully one could assume that all the motion demanded was an inquiry into the decision of the firm of Messrs. J. &amp; L. F. Goodbody to close the jute-spinning section of their mills.  The Deputy also goes on&mdash;though he left this out in his elaboration of the request &mdash; to demand that a Senior Inspector of the Department of Industry and Commerce should investigate all aspects of the industry.  I cannot see how one could investigate a decision to close and at the same time investigate all aspects of the industry without having the inquiry set up as I indicated, and that would be under sections 165 and 166 of the Companies Act, 1963. Even if I had wider powers, I would be extremely slow to use them and I would want far stronger reasons than have been adduced in this case.  I would remind the Deputies that Messrs. Goodbody are not closing down their business in Clara, though if I were one of the members of the board of Messrs. Goodbody or one of the Goodbody family and had heard what Deputy Cooney said about them in this House last week, I might be strongly tempted to do so.  The firm is one which has given employment in this area for a very long time.  I do not often find myself in agreement with Deputy O.J. Flanagan, but I must indicate that in my opinion it is wrong <Col N="1875" /> to attack a firm such as this.  The attack on Messrs. Goodbody is totally uncalled for.  This firm will be employing approximately 330 people at Clara.  They were maligned in this House last week.  Deputy Enright demanded an investigation into the amount of money allocated to this firm for the development of the polypropylene works.  This must surely make any company or any proposers of an industry think twice before they come into the constituency which Deputy O'Donovan has described as a neglected constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connolly said last week that the problem of getting industrialists into our country has been caused by the gloom which has been cast by remarks in this way. Here we have a situation where £150,000 was mentioned.  Let me say categorically that this figure underestimates the amount of State investment which has been put into Messrs. Goodbody of Clara.  A State grant of £197,000 has gone to Messrs. Goodbody as a grant towards the polypropylene manufacture in Clara.  The Government and the IDA have been criticised for not giving grants for the encouragement of industries in Offaly. It is disgraceful to criticise the industries in Offaly in such a manner.  I can see no justification for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Donovan subscribes to the idea of an inquiry.  The fact remains that the jute operations at Clara are certainly being reduced.  A substantial part of Messrs.  Goodbody's operations, accounting for 50 per cent of the employment which has been given up to now, is being preserved. The non-jute operations are being expanded. Even if I had the power and adequate reasons for ordering an inquiry, it would make no useful contribution to the future of the Clara industry.  It would have a contrary effect.  Deputy O.J. Flanagan quoted from a newspaper report of December last, and I would like to quote from <i>Irish Times</i> of 8th February.  The speaker was formerly a Deputy in this <Col N="1876" /> House.  He was speaking at a meeting in Portlaoise and one can assume that he was referring to the constituency of Laois/Offaly.  The speaker was Mr. Michael Mullen, General Secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and he mentioned that arrangements for an inquiry under the Companies Act were unsatisfactory and said:</P>
    <P>a formal inquiry with a great deal of publicity, would excite considerable publicity and that, in itself, would cause further damage to the company and therefore to the livelihood of the workers.</P>
    <P>That is from the General Secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  It was a reasonable comment under the circumstances.  I would draw Deputy O.J. Flanagan's attention to the fact that he said that the company, as he saw it, would agree to an inquiry.  I have just indicated that an inquiry can be ordered by the Minister at the request of the company. Naturally I do not think that the company would seek such an inquiry because they are and will be in the future very much involved in Clara provided all the nasty things which have been said about them do not have an effect on their plans for the future expansion of their works in Clara.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan went out of his way to indicate that nobody knew the contents of this report which was prepared by the consultants and submitted to Messrs. Goodbody and of which I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, received a copy.  Having stated that categorically he went on to convey the impression that he had seen a copy of that report, not in so many words, but he did indicate that the contents of the report suggested that the whole works should be moved to Clara rather than to Waterford.  Yet he categorically stated that nobody got a copy of the report, that the trade unions concerned could not get a copy of the report, but he still went out of his way to quote from it.  I presume the Deputy will concede that he did not have the opportunity of reading the copy of the report that the Minister obtained.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy in his remarks about the taking away of machinery and work from Clara and <Col N="1878" /> transferring it to Waterford, irrespective of what would have been in a report, made the greatest possible justification for the transfer because he conveyed the idea that with the transfer of machinery from Clara to Waterford employment would be created in Waterford for 100 extra people to the disemployment of 250 in Clara.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what the Deputy has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that I accept that with the phasing out of the greater portion of the jute industry in Clara it is understandable that machinery is in transit to Waterford.  I fully accept this.  There is no point in saying otherwise. But if 100 people can replace 250 people it seems economically a very justifiable type of operation, although I am not accepting that this is so. Deputy Flanagan went on in this sad, discouraging and depressing way to paint a picture of grass growing in the streets of Clara and indicating that no industry could ever be attracted to Clara which would adequately replace the industry which Clara is losing at present.  I look forward with confidence to proving that Deputy Flanagan is wrong, and not for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with what Deputy Flanagan said I find that I am overlooking quite an amount of what Deputy Enright said.  I have referred to an element of Deputy Cooney's remarks and I hope I have covered it adequately.  He did mention that a company who get money from public funds, especially a public company with a Stock Exchange quotation should not be free to dismiss workers on their own decision and should be subject to a public inquiry.  Let me say positively, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, taking that statement on the broad basis one would have to accept that that type of arrangement would cover most industries in the country, industries which have been developed and improved with the <Col N="1879" /> assistance of adaptation and re-equipment grants and all industries which have been attracted by IDA grants. To have all these subject to the restrictions proposed by Deputy Cooney would, as I see it, be an impossible proposition.  In addition it would be extremely unlikely that firms would accept State aid and open new industries under such conditions and I am afraid that with the type of competition we have from other countries who are trying to attract industries and industrial development such a restriction would lead to a complete elimination of the attractiveness of this country from the point of view of bringing in any foreign industrialist to invest capital here.  The overall result would be that less new employment would be created and there would be further unemployment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright mentioned that the inquiry into the jute industry would be beneficial to the worsted industries in the midland area.  Even if I were anxious to hold an inquiry, which I am not, I could not see any connection at all between the jute industry and the worsted industry as such.  Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy Enright said that my predecessor was not in any way interested in this jute industry. Deputy Enright said that and Deputy O'Donovan said that this was a difficulty which suddenly blew up and caught the Department of Industry and Commerce napping.  Let me say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government were completely aware of the situation, at all stages, with regard to the jute industry.</P>
    <P>In recent years action to safeguard employment in Goodbodys at Clara had been taken at all stages along the line.  In the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement special arrangements were negotiated for the protection of jute products.  Special licences were allocated to Goodbodys in order to allow them to import duty-free certain raw materials in an effort to make them as competitive as possible.  Grants were made available on the jute side by the IDA towards the cost of adaptation and diversification projects carried out <Col N="1880" /> by Goodbodys.  I have indicated already the amount of grants given towards the polypropylene project in Clara.  Financial help under technical assistance schemes was provided and assistance was also given in the marketing field. Provision was made for the protection of jute in relation to our application for membership of the EEC.  All these measures indicate that not alone was my predecessor but also the Government were totally aware of the situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why then was something better not done?  Some 700 men were employed four years ago and this number is reduced to 250 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in this regard is the fact that jute, as such, is in less demand and is becoming a more depressed industry.  I am speaking in terms of trying to make special arrangements under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and we were endeavouring to make special arrangements in connection with the EEC. We had diversification &mdash; the polypropylene project &mdash; and if we had not succeeded in doing that it would not have been possible for the extra people to be kept on and the additional people who will be re-employed in Goodbodys could not have been helped.  Deputy O'Donovan said that he was in the Clara area and I daresay that he had the advantage of seeing the television programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney used the television programme as the basis for some of the points he made during the debate last week.  I am at a disadvantage in not having seen the programme, but from the reports I received I gather there was much criticism of the programme in that it was far from factual.  One of the complaints that came to me indirectly from a colleague of Deputy Enright on the Offaly County Council &mdash; in fact, he was a Fine Gael candidate in the last <Col N="1881" /> general election &mdash; was that it was an atrocious programme and did not reflect the position.  People were depicted as being former employees of Goodbody's &mdash;they gave comments on the programme &mdash; when in fact they were not employees in Goodbodys.</P>

      <P>So far as the team of the 7 Days programme are concerned, they made every effort to speak to a cross-section of the people in the town of Clara and those involved.  They did their best to steer clear of any political motivations or political persons from any side.  The programme was without political bias and the team reported the facts as they saw them.  I consider that the team who carried out this inquiry provided a service to the people in Clara and the surrounding districts in that they highlighted the situation. <Col N="1882" /> They brought the matter to the attention of the Department of Industry and Commerce, of the IDA and of other Government Departments and semi-State bodies.  By directing public notice to this matter they focused attention on the situation existing in Clara.  The people who will get employment in the factory have, in no small measure, reason to thank the 7 Days team. In this matter, as in many other instances, they have highlighted a situation which otherwise would be allowed to pass by unnoticed.  In this instance they brought the attention of fairminded people to the situation in Clara&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about the attack on the firm of Goodbodys by Deputy Cooney.  I should like to quote from the Official Report, Vol. 251, column 1576.  In speaking in the debate Deputy Connolly said:</P>
      <P>If the Labour Party are so interested in Goodbodys of Clara why did they have people working there for £11 a week and did nothing about it for the last ten years?</P>

I was told that 88 workers had become redundant at Clara and that, in addition, 24 younger workers had left to seek employment.  Last November I asked the Taoiseach the number of people drawing unemployment benefit at local employment offices and I was given the following figures at column 1806, Volume 249, of the Official Report of 19th November, 1970:</P>

      <P>This firm which has declared so many workers redundant has made that trading profit.  There is something else which is rather peculiar. The depreciation for this firm, £139,926, seems rather high.  That seems an extraordinary amount for depreciation. I have no axe to grind with Goodbodys. I never met any of them in my life. However, I know many of the workers in Clara.  Some of them support other parties, but that makes no difference to me.  I am interested in the welfare of everyone in the area regardless of their political viewpoint.  I would like to have an investigation into this firm. Any firm that shows a trading profit of £119,000 and at the same time allows 88 people to be declared redundant requires investigation.</P>

He said that unless foreign firms were given such money they would not be willing to come here.  I am quite certain that is the reason why so many firms are prepared to chance their arm.  Any firm that would be able to stand on its own feet and show a profit should not be afraid of an inquiry. Furthermore any firm that gets State money should be subject to inquiry if it closes down.

While Deputy Flanagan and I represent Laois-Offaly we will do our utmost to bring industries to that area and we shall be only too pleased to do everything possible on behalf of the people there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 50, after &ldquo;the State&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;but was not so authorised by virtue of an extension of the operation of the licence granted under section 115 of the Transport Act, 1944, solely to authorise the carriage of livestock throughout the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that the intention of the Committee Stage amendment introduced by me is rendered effective.  As the House is aware, I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage to enable any of the 26 county licensees who obtained such a licence on the 1st January, 1969, to have an extra vehicle attached to the licence.  Deputy O'Donovan expressed concern about the purpose of the amendment and asked that figures be made available as to the transfer of licences since 1933.  Perhaps I can refer to this matter in the course of the discussion of the amendment since both are related under the same section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hundred and six licensees will qualify for the concession.  Ninety-three of these licences have been transferred from the original licensees.  That meets the point made by Deputy O'Donovan.  Fifty-eight of them have been transferred twice and several of them have been transferred as many as four times.  In 71 of the 93 cases there was a commercial type transfer which involved another business as well as the licence itself, so that there was involved, as well as the licence transfer, the purchase of a business. All State licences which had been transferred, changed hands more than 200 times.  Six of these were in the 1930s, 28 in the 1940s, 66 in the 1950s, 75 <Col N="1889" /> in the 1960s and 26 since 1st January, 1969.  Therefore, it all amounts to a situation of consolidation in regard to the haulage industry as well as a movement towards what we are seeking to do here &mdash; achieve a greater professionalism in the road transport business.</P>
    <P>To get back to the amendment, which is related to what I have said, it is designed to ensure there is no further extension of this in any way by any legal interpretation of the section, as amended by me on Committee Stage, other than the 106 licensees who will qualify for the concession.  About 500 or 600 existing carrier merchandise licensees, from 1966 on, were extended to authorise the carriage of livestock throughout the State.  Although they remained restricted in the original licence to their basic area, they got a 26-County extension for livestock&mdash; this was leading up to what we have done here in this legislation.  I am advised by the Attorney General that, as it stands at the moment, this amendment is open to the interpretation by these 500 or 600 carriers that they can come in under this extra vehicle provision.</P>
    <P>It is made clear in the amendment that people who got this concession will not get the bonanza of an extra vehicle.  This, obviously, would be against the whole purpose of the amendment, which is to ensure that there is reasonable equity for those 106 licensees who held 26-County licences &mdash; most of which have changed hands since 1933 &mdash; and who were in the situation where it could be argued that, under the terms of the Bill, every other haulier was getting an extension while these particular people, the best of the professional road hauliers in the country, were not securing anything under the Bill.  They are people who, in the great majority of cases, have paid substantial sums for their 26-County licences.  The thinking behind this amendment is to give to them a concession, in a very limited way, in the form of one extra vehicle for the 106 such licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister, I am satisfied that it was necessary to have this amendment <Col N="1890" /> for the purpose of clarification.  If all those covered under section 115 of the Transport Act of 1944 were to get a 26-County general licence, it would introduce a degree of liberalisation which would not be desirable at this stage.  Therefore, I think the Minister's amendment definitely clarifies the section. I am satisfied this amendment was necessary.  It clears up any doubt there might be about possible future misinterpretation of the section and I have no objection to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister and his advisers picked up this point because we will not now have an amendment Bill brought into the House on a single section.  The workers of CIE around Dublin are rather more concerned than I anticipated.  Would it be possible for the Minister to do something to allay that feeling which they have?  Would it be possible for him to make available to the Transport and General Workers' Union, which has the bulk of those people in their unions, a full list of the people who are licensed hauliers?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as it now stands is reasonably satisfactory. I regret that because of influenza I was unable to be present for the Committee Stage.  The Bill, as amended, certainly meets the case put by the licensed hauliers' organisation to the Minister in respect of the existing 26-County carrier. I sincerely hope that the Bill will achieve the objectives which the Minister set out to achieve in this legislation, that is to reduce the amount of own account haulage which is going on, and that it will lead to the growth of professional transport operators and to greater professionalism in haulage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel in relation to liberalisation that <Col N="1891" /> this Bill has gone as far as we can possibly go at the present time without endangering or jeopardising the employment of the people in the road freight section of CIE.  Any further degree of liberalisation at this stage could have serious repercussions for the road freight section of CIE.  I sincerely hope that the fears which have been expressed, particularly on behalf of the road freight section of CIE, will prove to be groundless when this Bill comes into operation.  I hope the Minister will urge on CIE the absolute necessity of gearing up their road freight section and their sales section to ensure that all the existing employees will be maintained in secure employment.  I hope the Bill will operate successfully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last week I was encouraging the Minister to tell us when he replies what plans he has to ensure we will not have a further bank stoppage in this country.  I want to refer perhaps at some length to bank closures here generally. It is only now we are beginning to realise how extremely detrimental this has been to our economy.  I should like, in relation to the banks, to go back over the history of bank operations for a few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first retrograde step which happened in bank circles here was the disposal of the external assets belonging to the National Bank.  That in itself limited the sphere of the activities of that bank.  It broke the link of banking facilities which were available outside this country for those who were dealing with that particular bank.  I remember at the time opposing it here and saying that I did not think it was good policy then, that in fact it was a restrictive policy.  I can remember the time when their assets were disposed of. The total assets available to the National Bank, then in existence on their own, were considerable, but they were disposed of for £1 million.  One of the <Col N="1892" /> assets held by the bank &mdash; external assets are always very useful in banking circles &mdash; was a branch right in the heart of London in Trafalgar Square which in itself, in my opinion, was worth £1 million; yet those assets were disposed of for that sum.  That meant that the National Bank, which formerly had considerable holdings throughout the United Kingdom, became an Irish bank situated only in this country.</P>
    <P>We progressed from that on to the question of the amalgamation of the banks here.  A very healthy financial situation existed in this country in that we had seven or eight individual operating banks.  The beginning of it was that the National Bank, going still further, amalgamated with the Bank of Ireland and I think there was another bank in that group as well. Very shortly after that, the example having been set by the Bank of Ireland group, the other banks, headed by the Munster and Leinster Bank, amalgamated as well.  So, instead of having seven or eight separately operating financial houses in this country, we are now relegated to two &mdash; the Associated Banks and the Bank of Ireland Group.</P>
    <P>That in itself is a retrograde step. I shall try to show the House why I believe it is a retrograde step.  In a town close to where I live we used to have two banks &mdash; the National Bank and the Bank of Ireland; there was a healthy rivalry between the two.  If a customer asked credit in one bank and was refused he had the alternative of going to the other bank.  That situation no longer exists.  For a time the banks pretended to be a separate identity but they are now one and the same; they are known as the &ldquo;Upper Bank&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Lower Bank&rdquo; and the people in Gorey say that if you cannot get credit in the &ldquo;Lower Bank&rdquo;, it is no good going to the &ldquo;Upper Bank&rdquo; because they are all one.  That is quite true. That is a retrograde step.  Competition is the breath of life.  It no longer exists in banking.  That situation exists throughout the country.  I think this is a bad arrangement.</P>
    <P>It is nothing more or less than an amalgamation of directors and I should like now to say a few words on the subject of directors.  Thirty or 40 years ago <Col N="1893" /> the kind of people who were bank directors were people who inspired confidence; they were big names and they were regarded as people of integrity. There has been a change in the type of bank director.  The bank director today is a rich business tycoon. He is a man of financial standing.  The man of financial standing is not always the person who has communication with the general public and therein lies all the trouble in the Irish banks today.</P>
    <P>Over a period of three or four years we have had two bank closures.  I believe these were due to a total lack of communication between the directors and the staff.  Prior to the last closure there was no real discussion because, on the one hand, the directors insisted on one point before they would even meet the staff and, on the other hand, the staff said they would not meet the directors unless they conceded their point.  They would not sit down around a table to talk things over without prior conditions.  That is fatal in any dispute. I do not know what the rights or wrongs were, but I presume it was largely a question of remuneration. The staff decided to go slow and work was getting into arrear.  That was the time obviously when discussions should have taken place.  That was the time when the Government should have intervened. There is not a shred of evidence to show that any member of the Government intervened.</P>
    <P>The banks closed and for eight months the country was left without banking facilities.  All during the closure people expected the Government would intervene and do something. I understand from the Minister that should this kind of situation evolve in the future he has some plan whereby to keep financial business going.  As I say, the banks closed for eight months.  When they reopened we were told, presumably by the directors, on radio and television that the banks would remain closed for a further period and close again for Decimal Day.  In the meantime it would not be possible to produce statements until the 15th January or the 20th January. I know for a fact that there are literally hundreds who have not yet had <Col N="1894" /> statements.  I listened to answers to questions here, questions asking the Minister to clarify the position as to what is going on between the banks and their clients.  It is immoral for a bank to hold the money of a client, to close for eight months, open in November, nearly four months ago, and deny clients statements of account. The banks are interested in producing statements only for those who are overdrawn. They are interested only in getting in the money they are owed.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as credit. The banks are not interested in giving credit.  They can carry on perfectly well by lending all the money they have to the Government and the Government is very predatory in looking for money from the banks.  I am informed that most of the banks have control over the finance houses.  Even the finance houses which were independent of the banks are now auxiliaries of the banks.  It is much easier to get money from the finance houses than it is from the banks.  All businesses run on credit and they have to go to the finance houses for that credit and pay a high rate of interest.  The banks refuse to give loans and the finance houses, which are controlled by the banks, give the loans and the banks, therefore, gain on the double, because they finance the finance houses.</P>
    <P>The only function of the banks at the moment is to get people to pay off their overdrafts.  I do not think the Minister is &ldquo;with it&rdquo; with regard to what is happening.  People who never wrote a dud cheque are now finding their cheques bouncing.  I came across a case of that the other day.  He is a man in a small way of business.  He never had a cheque that bounced.  He is a man of the highest integrity.  During the strike he wrote cheques in order to carry on his business.  When the banks re-opened he got no statement of account.  A week or so ago he was told a number of his cheques had been returned marked RD.  He was faced with a situation that there was a bankruptcy of people who owed him money.  This man was in a small way of business but the bankruptcy cost him about £800 or £900.  Also, he was owed money from people in the <Col N="1895" /> locality.  In rural Ireland you cannot compel people to pay bills as quickly as in Dublin.  Conditions are more personal in the country.  He was down to the extent of about £1,800 of money that he should have been able to pay. The bank bounced all his cheques.  He asked me to see the manager which I did.  The manager said he would not discuss the business with me unless I came back two or three days later and brought the man with me.  I said: &ldquo;I will do nothing of the sort.  I shall go and see your directors and tell them exactly what I think of you and what I think of the attitude of the banks as a whole.  I may then be able to find out the extraordinary secret that nobody can extract: who is responsible for the relations that are being created at the moment between the bank staffs and the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did not have to go because he gave in.  The man got his overdraft and had his cheques honoured.  He was able to convince the people to whom he told his story as he had told it before.  They did not accept it before I went in but they accepted it afterwards. I think it is the duty of the Minister to summon the bank directors before him or whoever is responsible for the administration of the business of the banks and find out what the actual position is.  Until such time as the banks are able to give everybody a statement of account &mdash; I cannot understand why they have not done so to date &mdash; it is immoral for them to bounce cheques particularly on people who have always been of the highest integrity as this individual was. That is only one case; there are dozens of similar cases.  The Minister says when we ask questions we should bring specific cases forward but you cannot bring confidential information that you get to the Minister.  The questions being asked here are general questions aimed at bringing home to the Minister the things I have been telling him now.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Central Bank Bill itself there are one or two things that puzzle me.  All banks must be licensed in future.  I suppose that is necessary but it rather suggests that the Minister does not, perhaps, repose the trust in <Col N="1896" /> the banks that one would expect.  I am unaware that we have any banks likely to go into liquidation as happened in the US and other places.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Every licence holder will have to keep a deposit in the Central Bank equal to 5 per cent of his customers' deposits, subject to a maximum of £500,000 and a minimum of £200,000.&rdquo; Is a licence holder the Associated Banks as one bloc or the Bank of Ireland group as one bloc or is he every individual bank?  If it is every individual bank it seems that the Central Bank will do pretty well out of it.  The Central Bank will have a deposit paid to them by each individual bank and they will be sitting pretty.  I do not know if they will just hold the money or whether they will be in a position to invest it as banks normally do.  Banks exist by investing money at a better rate of interest than they allow themselves.  They also exist by lending money which they do very conveniently to the finance houses.  We have some 70 banks in the country and we have a very high deposit rate, perhaps a higher rate of deposit accounts in Ireland than in most other countries because it has been the habit, over the last century practically, for the majority of people with money to put it on deposit.  It, therefore, seems that the Central Bank will get quite a lot of money.  I think an explanation from the Minister on that subject would be helpful in indicating what the position is generally.</P>
    <P>Before this the Central Bank was just a clearing house or, shall we say, a stabilising influence in regard to foreign exchange and so on.  It is now going to enter into business as a commercial bank.  The Minister mentioned the Exchequer Account.  I think taxation at the moment for current accounts is running at approximately £500 million. This account has previously been held by the Bank of Ireland and the Minister in his speech said it was being transferred from the Bank of Ireland to the Central Bank by mutual agreement.  It must be very easy to agree with the Bank of Ireland when they are dealing with the Government if they are prepared to lose a £500 million account without a word.  Surely that would be a considerable blow to <Col N="1897" /> the bank concerned.  The Bank of Ireland, as the Minister knows, is a trustee security in which there is a considerable investment largely of Irish origin.  Would the Minister not consider in fairness to the Bank of Ireland that any bank losing a £500 million account sustains a serious blow?  Does he not realise that he may be upsetting the profits and dividends which the Bank of Ireland was able to pay to shareholders to a very great extent?  Is it, perhaps, the thin end of the wedge? Shall we find the Central Bank going into general banking business and competing with the other banks?</P>
    <P>I am not very sympathetic to the banks, nor do I think anybody is at the moment, in view of their treatment of the public as a whole but if you have a controlling body such as the Central Bank controlling the finances of the country and licensing bankers &mdash; they can practically decide what the expenditure is, what the banks may do with the money available &mdash; it seems out of place that in those circumstances the Central Bank should compete as an ordinary bank, which is what I understand from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Further, I understood from his speech that if we have a further closure or trouble in banks that the Central Bank has, or is formulating some plan to go into banking business.  Are we to take from that the possibility that the Central Bank may open a new group of branches throughout the country and that you may have a State-sponsored organisation competing with private enterprise?  I should not be surprised; it would mean another nail in the coffin of private enterprise.  It would mean more or less complete bureaucratic control over our finances.  Some people would be glad to know that there was such control but I think people are still entitled, in spite of a tendency to socialise everywhere, to do as they wish with their own money.  If they entrust that money to the banks at least the banks should be allowed free and open competition.  They have closed themselves to competition by amalgamating into two main groups. Is this the thin edge of the wedge?  Is the Central Bank going to compete in open banking business?  During the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> At present the Bank of Ireland, by reason of the charter and the special legislation under which it operates, suffers from some disabilities as compared with the other banks to which the Companies Act applies.  Provision is made in the Bill to remedy this so that, in future, shareholders of the Bank of Ireland may be in the same position as shareholders of the other banks in regard to the management of the business.</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means, but when the Minister is replying perhaps he will tell me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been on the Order Paper since 1969, it was a substitute for the 1968 Bill, and the fact that it was not taken until February, 1971, is a reflection of the lack of business that has been done by this House.  This is a great pity because I think much can be done by having this Bill enacted.  I favour the enactment of the Bill in principle, but I have a number of criticisms to make and I shall make them on the Committee Stage.  I shall confine myself now to matters of policy.</P>
      <P>Our currency system has evolved more or less in line with the British system.  This is a good thing in many respects because we have a well developed and acceptable system of currency operating within our economy.  It is taken for granted that the changeover to a decimal system will upset the circulation of money for a while, but I do not think this is of basic significance.</P>
      <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with currency. I am in favour of an official break in the link with sterling.  This suggestion was embodied in the Just Society policy put forward in 1965.  It is pleasing to note that the Government have taken the bull by the horns, so to speak, and got away from the strict link with sterling.  Of course, there is provision for the issuing of Irish money against English money and <i>vice versa</i> in Dublin and London by mutual agreement.  I wonder if this is necessary and I should like to hear from the Minister the reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first practical criticism I want <Col N="1899" /> to make is a simple one.  I was travelling through London Airport last week and I tendered an Irish coin to purchase a bottle of Guinness.  The barman refused to take the Irish coin.  When I asked why I was told that they had accepted Irish coins up to the time of the bank strike but when they presented Irish coins in bulk the Irish banks charged them for handling the coins. It is a disgrace that Irish coins are refused in Britain because the Irish banks have decided to charge for handling them.  The Government should take immediate steps to ensure that the commercial banks will not charge English banks for handling Irish coins.</P>
    <P>The issue of legal tender is a very important point.  I am against the system whereby Irish currency is issued <i>ad lib</i> against acceptable securities or acceptable negotiable instruments.  This immediately weakens one of the monetary weapons which the Central Bank can use to control the economy.  There has been a fantastic increase in the amount of currency in circulation during the last few years.  In the 1969-70 annual report of the Central Bank it states that the amount of Irish notes and coins outstanding in March, 1954, was over £71 million and in 1969 it was over £140 million.  This means that the amount of notes and coins outstanding in the economy doubled between 1954 and 1970.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be cynical and say that this is a reflection of the affluence of the community.  However, I look at it in a different way and I am backed by a number of authoritative books on the subject.  It is a fact that a surplus amount of notes and coins in the economy can cause inflation.  I attribute some of the inflation we have suffered in the past ten years to the amount of notes and coins outstanding in the economy.  Irish notes should not be issued <i>ad lib</i> in exchange for acceptable securities.  Section 44 of this Bill weakens that monetary weapon.  I am backed up to some extent by a number of comments in the Report of the Committee on the Working of the Monetary System, which is published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank should ensure <Col N="1900" /> that the integrity of our currency is maintained.  It should be the institution through which the Government act.  It should have autonomy in certain respects of action in relation to such matters as inflation.  This, unfortunately, has not been the case.  The reasons are numerous and I should like to discuss some of them.  The link with sterling has caused our currency to be an open currency and money flowed freely through cash and negotiable instruments between Ireland and Britain.  This weakens the effect the Central Bank can have, especially when it does not control such flows. The link with sterling is, of course, the main cause of this.  We have not got a sophisticated system of monetary institutions here in Ireland.  If we had, surplus moneys within the banking system and within the monetary institutional system in Ireland would naturally flow to and from such institutions. Such a position was commented upon in the report of the Central Bank Committee on the Functions, Operations and Development of a Money Market in Ireland.  This was quite a good report and pointed out the weaknesses of the Irish institutional system in this respect.  I wonder if we can ever, within the present system, evolve an efficient system within our country.  I doubt it, even assuming that this legislation goes through because we lack a number of things.  We lack a money market, a market in short-term securities, indeed, to a certain extent, we lack a free market in medium-term security. How we are going to come around this I do not know, but we will not be able to do so even working under this Central Bank Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why our economy is so open is that our foreign transactions are too free-flowing.  It is the practice on the Continent to centralise all such transactions to a large extent.  The Central Bank should be far more active in controlling the outflow of Irish payments abroad and, of course, in controlling the inflow of foreign payments into Ireland.  The banks should be encouraged to agree voluntarily or forced to work through <Col N="1901" /> a foreign department of the Central Bank.  This would lead to greater control, possibly, of the economy.  I am sure this is what the Government would prefer.</P>
    <P>In relation to one of the most important functions of a central bank, the control and administration of the level of the rates of interest within the economy, the Central Bank and, indeed, the Government are open to genuine criticism.  Again, I would refer to the Central Bank Report, 1969-70. Table 9 relating to interest rates shows that the rediscount rate of the Central Bank of Ireland at the end of August, 1968, was 7¼ per cent and in June, 1970, it was 7? per cent, practically 7¼ per cent.  The ordinary overdraft rate on 2nd October, 1968 was 8 per cent and on 20th September, 1969 it was 9½ per cent.  This means in effect, that the relative association between the ordinary overdraft rate and the rediscount rate of the Central Bank has widened by approximately 1½ per cent.  I do not know why this should be allowed to happen.  I do not know why the Central Bank allowed it to happen and I do not know why the Government allowed it to happen. It is very poor form.</P>
    <P>One of the great weapons of expansion within a community is the availability and the cost of money.  At least our exporting industries require the cheapest possible rate in respect of the money they borrow and the absurd floating of the ordinary overdraft rates compared with the rediscount rates is shocking.  I do not know why this is allowed to happen.  I can only conclude that the Minister and the Government are in collusion with the commercial banks in allowing this to happen, this system which allows the profits of commercial banks to be jacked up unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>We must, in this respect, look at the functions of the commercial banks. As far as I am concerned, the commercial banks serve the community.  I am convinced that at present they do not serve the community to the best of their ability.  By this I mean that there is collusion among the banks themselves to destroy the competitive element <Col N="1902" /> of banking.  The evolution of two large groupings among the commercial banks has led definitely to a quasi-monopolistic situation to which I for one object.  The banks do not really compete in the matter of deposits. They have fixed their deposit rates and, worse still, they have fixed at a very low level the interest which they will pay on small deposits.  They surely will discourage ordinary people from saving.  I am satisfied, too, that the other monetary institutions, merchant banks, for instance, are drawing towards them the available money in the community.  If the banks were forced into a proper competitive situation the deposit rates would certainly be higher.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to the lending position there is very little competition among the banks.  Of course, as Deputy Coughlan pointed out, there was quite an amount of severe political canvassing among certain health boards in the western part of the country for accounts of the new regional health boards.</P>

      <P>This is not the kind of competition of which I am speaking. I am speaking of genuine competition in the matter of interest rates payable by the customers of the banks.  I would like the Minister to give his reasons for this disequilibrium in the matter of the rediscount rates and overdraft rates. As far as I can see, the Government have become so dependent on the commercial banks for money that they now are unable or unwilling to force the commercial banks into a truly competitive position.  My view of this is quite simple.  The banks are there to serve the people and I am satisfied they are not serving the people to the best of their ability and the Government who should be able to control <Col N="1903" /> such margins as I have mentioned have not done so and I want to know why. There are many exporters, genuine business people, who are paying an inordinately high rate for the moneys which they need to carry on their businesses and for the moneys which are needed to expand Irish exports.  This is very important.  Perhaps it is overlooked by the Minister.  There should be a system whereby cheap moneys would be available to exporting firms. The Minister will agree with me when I say that the balance of payments position is serious.  In 1970 there was a deficit of £66 million approximately.  In 1971, it is calculated that we will do well if we reduce that to £55 million or £60 million.  We will not be doing well if we reduce it to that figure.  I remember that in 1950 when the Coalition Government had a balance of payments deficit of £35.5 million the Fianna Fáil Party created a furore.  At that time they were prepared to bring down the Government for purely political reasons.  They did not worry that such action might upset the confidence of the people in the monetary system. If today anyone in the Fine Gael Party mentions the balance of payments deficit or devaluation the Minister for Finance is the first man to refute this in a very determined fashion.</P>

      <P>Our reserves are increasing, and I ask why?  What type of money is coming in?  The reasons we are expanding &mdash; and I would say that I am quite right on this &mdash; is that our interest rates are kept higher than those of England and they are forced to be kept high.  We are, in effect, therefore attracting what is commonly known as &ldquo;funk money&rdquo; or &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;.  I will bore the Minister on this subject by saying that if any crack appears in our external account this money will disappear as quickly as it came.  I am satisfied that if we consider having a balance of payments deficit in the region of £60 million, that day is not far away &mdash; and I do not think the Minister can argue with me on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to compare myself to Mr. Dillon.  I have a high regard for whatever Mr. Dillon said.  I respect anything he said. We are in an unfortunate position in regard to the balance of payments.  I do not know what the Government are doing about it.  The rate of inflation continues unchecked.  In 1970, we had a rate of inflation of 10 per cent.  I understand that the average rate of inflation was around 5 per cent in 1970 in the European Community countries. Whither go our exports in that type of situation?  I have noted the unfortunate demise of the Hibernian Transport Group.  Our rate of inflation will force some, if not many, of our exporting firms to close down.  I do not know when this will happen or if we can continue having a rate of increase in our prices of 10 per cent.  That day is not too far away either.  The Government are completely lacking in their responsibility to control the flow of money and the rate of increase in prices.  When are the Government going to come to terms with these problems? In the last seven months the Government <Col N="1905" /> were involved in internal disputes which came to a head to a certain extent over the weekend.  It was a very poor performance to see Ministers on a platform behaving the way they did. It was a poor reflection on the Government as a whole.  The Fianna Fáil Government have done very little in the past two years with regard to the problems facing our economy and our country.  We had the speech of the then Minister for Finance on television in March, 1969, when he told us that the economy was facing trouble and that there were terrible times ahead. Then the Government decided to have an election in June and the same Minister changed his tactics and off we went on another round of inflation.  The Fianna Fáil Party won the election. Did the Fianna Fáil Government do the country any good by winning the general election in that fashion?  I do not think they did.  The quality and the quantity of legislation which has come through this House in the past two years is not very good.  The quality has been poor and the quantity has been very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come now to the monopolistic position of the commercial banks in this country, I must say that I certainly think that the banks should be far more competitive than they are at present. The Government should take immediate action in this regard.  The establishment of a number of American-based banks in the country is something to be welcomed.  They brought a breath of fresh air into the general commercial banking area.  While I accept what the Minister said about being cautious in respect of banks, I think that at this point of time there are neither too many of them nor have they too many branches. The Irish commercial banks have much to learn about competing for accounts and about understanding the way business works.  Many bankers do not understand the real nature of business.  One example of this is the position among firms since the bank strike.  Normally, if a firm issue a cheque to a customer that customer leaves it for two or three days before cashing it.  People in rural communities might leave a cheque for three weeks before presenting it at a bank.  Now <Col N="1906" /> there is a tremendous crisis of confidence among business people and people dealing with firms.  They have no confidence in a firm no matter what standing the firm has.  Nowadays when a firm issues a cheque that cheque is deposited in the customer's bank on the same day.  This will cause a tremendous squeeze on most firms. This is an ordinary credit facility which is denied to them, apart from bank overdrafts.  I think there was genuinely a dispute between two sides in the banks, and it should never have been allowed to drag on.  I remember asking the Minister for Labour some time ago to accept a 60-day cooling off period in relation to strikes and his reply was: &ldquo;Oh, this would have to be agreed to by our party.  I could not do anything.&rdquo; As far as I am concerned the Minister for Labour has done nothing since he went into that office.  I never see him doing anything.  The Government should never have allowed that strike in this most vital field of our economy. It was not as if the bankers would have been unable to continue.  Anyone who has held bank shares for the past few years will certainly accept that they are doing quite well.  My view is that they are doing far too well and giving the country very little service in return.  I have said that before and I do not mind emphasising it.</P>
    <P>There must have been some way in which the Government could have influenced both sides in that dispute. This was not done and the Government stand condemned for not doing something.  The people were very annoyed that the Government stood idly by.  This must never be allowed happen again.  It is dreadful to find that ordinary innocent traders who accepted cheques from reputable firms had these cheques returned marked RD.  The number of cheques so returned and the amount of money involved is very great.  I should like the Minister to say how much money was involved in those cheques which were returned since the banks opened, say, from October to the end of January. How many cheques marked RD were returned?  I am satisfied that the amount runs into millions.  The House is entitled to know because those <Col N="1907" /> people were genuine traders who kept the country's economy going during that dispute and they now find themselves in a most unfortunate situation. The banks must be very, very careful to ensure that no genuine trader is put out of business on this account.</P>
    <P>The Minister has denied that any firms went out of business because of the bank dispute but I would argue with him about that.  I accept that no one cause can be advanced for any firm closing down; there are always a multitude of causes.  It may be because of bad management, a bad period of trading, a market might have fallen, or it may be just due to plain economic reasons, but I am satisfied that the dispute precipitated an unnecessarily large number of closures. The Government must bear the brunt of the responsibility for allowing that to happen.  The Minister may say what he likes but there is no question about that.  For the future some system must be drawn up whereby the banks will not close.  If they ever close again no cheques will be accepted within the community; no cheques will be cashed by any trader; commerce will come to a stop and you will have lay-offs over a very wide field and on a very large scale.  The reason for this will be that the Government stood idly by during the last dispute.  It is one of the great failures of this Government that they did this.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the special and privileged position enjoyed by the Associated Banks, that is, the nine banks who have the status of being associated, should be allowed to continue.  I am satisfied that it should not.  I am satisfied that if that special position was denied to them those banks would become more competitive.  There must be no doubt about it that the Government and the Central Bank must ensure that the commercial banks are competitive, and very competitive, and then and only then will they be serving the community in the capacity for which they were first envisaged.  They must be the servants of industry but instead of that the banks are the kings of industry, the blue chips of industrial <Col N="1908" /> investment.  I do not think that this position was ever envisaged.</P>
    <P>People must have confidence in the commercial banks and that can be ensured by such provisions as are contained in this Bill.  First of all, the licensed banks will be required to deposit 5 per cent of their deposits with the Central Bank.  This is a good idea and it is on the same lines as the American federal reserve system.  It will ensure confidence in the commercial banks.  Secondly, there is the provision under which the Central Bank may, in certain circumstances in which the banks' liabilities in the State reach a certain proportion, as compared to their assets in the State, require them to deposit certain moneys with the Central Bank.  These are good provisions and they will lead to confidence among the people.  The banks have been allowed by the Government and the Central Bank to develop into a monopolistic position which is bad for the economy and bad for the expansion of trade.  It is costing the country too much in terms of the capital available and the cost of capital.</P>
    <P>One of the privileges which the Associated Banks have been accorded is a cheaper rate in the matter of clearing cheques.  I understand that there is a tremendous and very profitable advantage being given to these Associated Banks in this sphere and that the American banks have had to suffer an unnecessarily high charge in the matter of clearing cheques.  This is wrong and unnecessary.  Why should any few banks in the community have this privilege over other banks? Certainly I do not see any reason why they should.  Under one section cheque clearance will be co-ordinated, so to speak, by the Central Bank.  This, too, is important and I would ask the Minister &mdash; perhaps my party will table an amendment for Committee Stage in this regard &mdash; to ensure that cheque clearing will be done on a competitive basis and a basis which will not favour any one bank or banking group against another commercial bank.  This is rather important and I do not see why they should be granted a privileged position. I am satisfied that the whole concept of commercial banks being associated to <Col N="1909" /> form a monopolistic group is wrong and detrimental to the community.  I would like the Minister to justify the existence of this.  I think this goes back to the Central Bank Act of 1942.  I am not sure if it goes back as far as the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>A sanction against the non-associated banks is that there is a restriction on the deposit gathering ability of the non-associated banks in respect of deposits of less than £25,000.  Why should the associated banks be granted this sanction against American banks?  There is no valid reason for it; it is completely undemocratic and is an anti-trade measure.  I do not know why the Central Bank or the Government allowed this situation to develop.  I understand there are restrictions on the American banks regarding the opening of branches throughout the country.  The American banks have been pioneers in the matter of term loans.  It is an excellent idea and is completely acceptable to commercial firms throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the Central Bank Bill I noticed that the banking directors have been reduced by one and that the Government directors have been increased by the same number.  I do not know why the Government should have greater control of the Central Bank.  I consider that there should be only two experts representing the Government on the board of directors of the Bank.  The directors of the Bank could be drawn from the academic or commercial field.  I do not know why the associated banks should have a monopoly in the appointment of directors.  However, to a certain extent they are losing this monopoly because the Minister appoints the banking directors from a panel.  I do not regard this as the proper procedure as I consider the banks should be allowed to nominate the members of the board.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the trustee status of non-associated banks needs review because it is important that all banks should have the same privileges and standing in the community.  It may be said that it is important to guarantee that control of the banking <Col N="1910" /> system, or deposits and ownership, should be in Irish hands.  I accept this principle but the cost could be unnecessarily high in restricting outside banks.  This would be unfortunate from the long-term point of view of development of the banking system in this country.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to what will happen under the constitution of the EEC, especially in regard to the right of establishment.  I am sure we will be obliged to throw open the entire field of banking.  I am subject to correction on this matter and perhaps the Minister would clarify the point when he replies to the debate.  I should not like to see the situation whereby European banking dynasties would come in here and take over.  This could be detrimental and I should like the Minister to give the House an assurance that this will not happen.  Can he state what is being done in regard to this matter in the negotiations now proceeding?</P>
    <P>I welcome the transfer of Government accounts from the Bank of Ireland to the Central Bank.  I should like the Minister to state if any compensation will be paid to the Bank of Ireland in regard to this transfer. Section 50 of the Bill is in regard to provisions relating to the Bank of Ireland.  I should like the Minister to state in greater detail the purpose of this section.  We have a legal tender note fund, a general fund and a reserve fund.  Another fund must be opened for the Government accounts.  It is important that all these aspects be totally separated so that at any one time we can find out the correct financial position in regard to each account.</P>
    <P>In regard to the assets held in the legal tender note fund, they should be balanced over a wide field.  There should be a certain amount of gold, a certain amount of sterling securities and, in view of our application to join the Common Market, there should be wider availability of European currency, especially a strong currency such as the Deutschmark.  I consider it would be wise to hold a considerable amount of this currency.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has been strengthened, especially in the matter of <Col N="1911" /> enforcing banks to deposit money with the Central Bank in certain circumstances. This is laid down in sections 23 and 24 but I wonder if these sections will be brought into practice from the point of view of monetary application?  I do not think that the present Government are strong enough to tell the Central Bank to take in a certain amount of money or to reduce the base of credit.  The Government should be able to use this weapon when necessary and I consider in certain circumstances it would be a valuable weapon to control inflation.</P>
    <P>The position of the Central Bank as a lender of last resort is not strong because it does not really exist for practical purposes.  What action will be taken to develop a proper money market in this country?  Some steps have been taken such as the clearing of cheques through the Central Bank and the transfer of deposits of commercial banks to the Central Bank.  I wonder if any action will be taken on the committee's report which I have already mentioned?  I should like the Minister to tell the House what he intends to do to develop a money market here and to ensure that the Irish monetary system is isolated from the British system.  This is important from the point of view of control and of practical central banking application.  The approach should not be one of establishing another monopolistic institution whereby rich people will get richer.</P>
    <P>Whatever institutions are established, whatever procedures are laid down, must be competitive.  The institutions should not be in existence to make the rich man richer but to serve the community, and to ensure that money flows freely within the community. Proper control of the commercial banks in such matters as inflation can be exercised by the Central Bank in conjunction with the Minister for Finance and the Government.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of this committee on the functions, operation and development of a money market in Ireland are interesting.  There are certainly some weaknesses but they have been historical rather than functional. They can be corrected if we can protect <Col N="1912" /> our economy better than we have done.  For instance, English currency should not be allowed to circulate in the country.  It should certainly be allowed to circulate, in the first instance, at hotels, shops and so on. Foreign currency is welcome to that extent but once it gets into the banking system it should be withdrawn, because it thwarts the implementation of the monetary policy of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister indicate the amount of English money flowing freely in our community at any one time?  I suspect it would be £1 million or £2 million.  The quantity of this money plus the velocity of its circulation would weaken the effect of any monetary policy laid down in respect of general commercial banking if this money is not withdrawn from the system.  I would like the Minister to comment on that observation.</P>
    <P>Again if we develop a money market or a short-term security market a Government broker will have to be appointed.  I know there is one at the moment and possibly he would be efficient enough to control also the short-term market.  I do not see any problems in this respect.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Central Bank has been an effective weapon in controlling inflation.  Its operation since 1942 has had a relatively small effect on controlling inflation and on controlling the commercial banks.  In general the commercial banks go their own merry way in the matter of credit.  The Minister may issue directives through the Central Bank but I do not think it has any effect.  I should like the Minister to assure the House that it will now be allowed to become more effective in controlling inflation.  In his speech the Minister did not give the impression that the Central Bank would be allowed independent action.  At column 1470, volume 251, of the Official Report of Tuesday, 16th February, 1971, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In our case the relationship between the Government and the Central Bank rests as much on mutual confidence as on statute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> I believe this is forced upon the Government not because of its relationship with the Central Bank but because of its peculiar dependence on the commercial banks from the point of view of getting capital.  This should not be so.  Further on the Minister says:</P>
    <P>I do not regard the provisions of the present Bill as calling for any change in the basis of the present relationship.</P>
    <P>Certainly from the point of view of appointing directors the relationship has not been changed in favour of the Central Bank.  Rather is it being changed in favour of the Government, and I think this is wrong.  The pre-ponderance of the directorships should rest with the banking system; indeed it should not even rest with the banking system but directors should be drawn not only from the academic field but from other fields as well.  I intend to put down an amendment to this effect because it must be admitted by everyone that there are excellent financial brains working within the commercial and industrial fields.</P>
    <P>According to section 47, Part V of the Bill, the Central Bank is now being allowed, if desirable, to engage in activities more associated with commercial banks.  I wonder what is the purpose of allowing this.  Apart from the relationship with Government accounts, I do not see any good reason for allowing it.  The Minister said at column 1471 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>Meantime, the powers proposed in the Bill will put the Central Bank in a strong position in various ways to deal with banking problems, whether arising from a bank closure or otherwise. The bank will, for example, be able to engage in any necessary banking activity, including clearing activities.  It will also, as I have already indicated, hold the Exchequer Account.</P>
    <P>I accept the position in regard to the Exchequer Account.  I do not think it is wise to allow the bank to enter into other commercial banking activities, that is, of course, apart from its ordinary control of the commercial banks or the matter of clearing cheques.  If there was another strike and <Col N="1914" /> if the banks did attempt to engage in the activities which were previously the prerogative of the commercial banks I have no doubt that there would be a picket placed on the Central Bank within 24 hours.  This is an unwise provision and I certainly hope that, if the provision is in, it will never be used.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this at the Committee Stage. If, for instance, the Central Bank attempted to cash cheques or to allow credit to firms during a strike affecting the commercial banks there would undoubtedly be a picket on the Central Bank, and the employees would not pass that picket and, in my opinion, it would be quite wrong for them to pass that picket.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have a Central Bank let us have a proper Central Bank, a Central Bank with powers and functions and a certain amount of autonomy.  Let us not ruin that approach.  Let us not try to achieve something which it would be impossible to achieve.  The Central Bank should never become a commercial bank in any sphere except that of servicing the Government account.  This is important.  I certainly should not like a situation to evolve in which the Central Bank itself would force a close down.  That would be very dangerous from the point of view of our external trading position.  The Central Bank should be above reproach and it should be independent. I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that aspect of the Central Bank Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole relationship between the Central Bank and the Government is very important.  It is important not so much <i>per se</i> but because of the effect that relationship will have on the control of the commercial banking system by the Central Bank and, so far as I am concerned, on the other financial institutions working within the State.  The rate of inflation of 10 per cent is wrong.  It is unnecessarily high.  Because of the nature of politics, and because of the nature of our electoral system, the Central Bank should have quite an amount of independence in the matter of controlling inflation. As a politician I think that politians <Col N="1915" /> would welcome this.  It is unwise to place the burden of taking an unfavourable decision &mdash; such as reducing credit &mdash; on a politician.  I know the Minister has his duties and his responsibilities to the State.  He must be above reproach.  I accept that.  I also accept that the governing party must take account of their responsibilities to society, but I think that a decision to deflate or a decision to stop inflation should rest with the Central Bank, acting in an independent capacity.</P>

      <P>I am trying to understand what exactly the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that fiscal policy must be decided in the House. That is essential and it has a great contribution to make in controlling inflation.  The fiscal aspect of the control of the economy is well brought out in the Radcliffe Committee Report, as no doubt the Minister is aware.  It is admitted that a marginal contraction of credit can lead to a desirable halt in an inflationary spiral in a properly developed monetary economy. We have not got such an economy. We have not got a sophisticated monetary economy.  The fiscal end of controlling the economy arises at Budget time mostly as, for example, the HP restrictions which were brought in, in 1969, I think.  That was an excellent fiscal restraint in an effort to combat inflation.  I do not think it was as successful as the Minister would have liked it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially what I am talking about is the monetary action which can be <Col N="1916" /> taken to control inflation.  That would include unfavourable decisions to control credit within the commercial banking sphere.  It is at this point that I feel the Central Bank should have a fair amount of independence.  I do not think we can give it full autonomy. We should give it the next best thing. It should be able to work without reference to the Minister in this matter. The very life of this country depends on our exports.  There is no question or doubt about that.  Exports are the lifeline of this country.  If we are to expand our exports, it is absolutely vital that we control inflation, and that out rate of inflation is not above that of the countries to which we export. At the moment it is.  It was allowed to be so, and one of the reasons for that was the election of June, 1969. There was a complete reversal of policy as stated in the television speech in March, 1969, by the former Minister, Deputy Haughey.  A month later, because of the election, monetary wisdom was thrown overboard.  They had to win the election.  That is the point I am making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made that point before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise it.  I am not doing so in a political fashion.  I want to emphasise an example where the Central Bank could work independently of any Government. Any Government will react to an election in the same fashion.  A Fine Gael Government or a Labour Goveernment will possibly react to an impending election in the same manner. That is a fact of political life.  That is why I am giving the example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank should have quite an amount of autonomy in the control of the monetary weapons in the fight against inflation.  The Bank of England, for instance, has more control of the economy in respect of monetary weapons.  I do not think the Minister will deny that.  The governor of the Bank of England has more power and a wider discretion in the use of monetary weapons than the governor of the Central Bank.  Perhaps this is because we are a small nation.  Perhaps <Col N="1917" /> it is because we have not got a fully developed economy.  We have a developing economy, and a developing economy in the context of Europe.  I should like the Minister to think about giving the Central Bank more autonomous powers in respect of the monetary weapons in the fight against inflation.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Central Bank was like a cry in the wilderness every year for the past ten years.  Inflation was getting out of hand.  Since I went to the university in 1959, there was not one Central Bank Report I read which did not plead for a reduction in the rate of inflation.  It was the most dismal report I read every year calling for restraint. I do not mind bringing it to the notice of this House and the people of Ireland that this year the Central Bank is pleading for a reduction in the rate of inflation.  The causes of inflation are set out in a general way in the Central Bank Report for 1969-70.  At page 7 it is stated:</P>
    <P>In this Report the causes of the excessive rise in prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The words used are &ldquo;excessive rise in prices&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in the external payments deficit over the past two years are analysed.  Some influence is to be assigned to external factors.  The major direct influences, however, are domestic and proceed from three principal sources: inordinate money income increases; too high a rate of increase in public expenditure and borrowing; and, at least until the latter part of 1969, excessive credit, particularly for consumer purposes. The cost and price inflation is being supported and accelerated by demand (or expenditure) inflation.</P>
    <P>The crux of our inflatiton in the past few years is indicated in this paragraph.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that this would be applicable to an economic debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing it in the context of the control which the Central Bank has or should have or how the controls given under this Bill can be used.  It is a fair comment to make.  Because income increases have <Col N="1918" /> been inordinate &mdash; I apply this to a wide field, to workers, employers and very big farmers &mdash; this has led to increased inflation although the real cause has been too high an increase in public expenditure and borrowing.  I do not want to enter into the political field again.  The Minister no doubt will say that public expenditure and borrowing are for social and economic purposes which are necessary for natitonal progress. Perhaps it can be fairly said that this progress costs more in terms of loss of purchasing power than is achieved.  It is possible to say, and the statement can possibly be justified, that as a result of the Government's refusal or inhibition in the matter of controlling their own level of expenditure we have had increased inflation.  The Central Bank should be able to control the quantity and quality of the credit given by the commercial banks.  Page 20 of the same report states:</P>
      <P>Total expenditure in the year ended 31st March, 1969 was £460.2 million.  In 1971, it was £597 million, an increase of 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is an inordinate increase in relation to the expansion of the economy and it could be said it is an increase which denied industry and commerce a certain amount of capital which it needed for expansion.  If the Central Bank were given adequate autonomous or near autonomous powers it could manage the economy better than the Government.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that this Bill is not a consolidated Bill.  There have been a number of Acts passed since 1927 and if I am not mistaken some of the provisions of an 1854 Act were included in the 1927 Act.  If this were a consolidated Bill everything would be made clear.  There was enough time to make it a consolidated Bill.  I will have more to say on the Committee Stage.  I welcome this Bill in principle.  It falls short in a number of respects and I will deal with what I think are valid criticisms of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be brief at this Stage because I will have something more to say on the Committee <Col N="1919" /> Stage.  One thing I would like to refer to is the increase in the number of financial institutions and financial houses in this country in recent times. I can see the difficulty of the ordinary commercial bank which sees for instance a hire purchase company or a financial house charging larger rates of interest, skimming the cream, and leaving the licenced commercial banks to provide at a fixed interest rate overdraft accommodation for businesses in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got, as Deputy Collins pointed out, two groups largely and those groups have formed finance houses.  It seems to me extraordinary that at times businessmen cannot get for their businesses money from the commercial banks but can be sent to the finance houses where interest rates are much higher and there can get the money.  I wonder what is the licence which the Central Bank will issue worth in this context?  Will the licence of finance houses produce money at higher rates of interest and lessen the power of the ordinary commercial banks to lend money for the ordinary legitimate purposes of overdraft accommodation for trade?  Seven or eight years ago if a bank having a hire purchase company, did not lend money to a customer for a project but sent him to the hire purchase company where he would pay perhaps twice as much for the money that would have been a cause of howls in this House. There would have been questions and supplementary questions asked of the Minister for Finance at the time that would have been difficult to answer. In fact, politicians would not have been very ready to accept the answers. Now, we seem to have gone completely the other way and nobody passes any remarks at all about what finance houses do, what the rate of interest is and what are the real profits. The banks here have done a pretty good job &mdash; in this regard I would not agree with Deputy Collins completely &mdash;bearing in mind that out of the money pool there must come substantial amounts for housing, roads and the infrastructure that must be provided in a developing country. <Col N="1920" /> Whether we like it or not the banks hold a good deal in deposits from our people and, not only deposits, but moneys that arrive in various ways in the banking system and the Government must take some of it away.</P>
    <P>I never agreed with the statement of the then Deputy Seán Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, in 1956, that it was better for the people that the Government should spend more for them and that they should spend less themselves.  The fact is that it would be better if the Government were able to raise directly from the people, through national loans or other saving device, whatever capital moneys were required and left the commercial banks to advance money to those who desired to engage in capital expenditure in their business or who needed money for liquidity in an expanding business.  Normally, no business can expand and maintain liquidity properly on the basis of profits because profits in this country are not high enough in an expanding business and recourse must be had to the banking institutions either by way of ordinary overdraft or by term loans which were mentioned by Deputy Collins and which seem to be on the point of becoming available.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into a general economic debate on this Bill but it seems that in England, on the Continent and here rates of interest for ordinary overdraft or banking accommodation have equated themselves. Who began this and where it will lead I do not know, but I remember, although I am not so long in business, when the overdraft rate was 6½ per cent.  It is now 9¼ per cent.  It might seem to somebody who did not look at business in this way that this was an increase of three per cent In fact, it is an increase as far as payment on overdrafts is concerned, of 50 per cent. The rate of overdraft interest here, in England and in Europe is the same and therefore there is no criticism of the Minister or the Government in the statement that it is crippling so far as expansion of a developing country is concerned.  That is one of our problems. Highly industrialised economies where people operate highly expensive machines which can produce a large <Col N="1921" /> quantity of goods in a week and can therefore provide very large wages, can afford to pay the high prices caused by these high interest rates.  This puts these developed countries in a very advantageous position.</P>
    <P>The Government should ensure that the maximum amount of money from the commercial banking system is made available at the ordinary overdraft rate and that any of the artifices seen to be employed by the creation of other companies or the invitation to firms to place their vehicles or something else on lease or to have their vehicles or other items on hire purchase instead of being carried by ordinary overdraft rate or by a term loan through the normal commercial banks, should be discouraged.</P>
    <P>I agree that hire purchase has its place.  Indeed, the many millions that people are paying for hire purchase as disclosed by replies to Parliamentary Questions and the many millions involved in the production of these hire purchase facilities prove that they have their place.  But when it comes to the employment of a man at a fair wage on which he must keep his wife and family the introduction of an extremely high interest rate into the liquidity situation of a company puts a high price on the goods produced and is one of the factors that make it extremely difficult for that man to live. That is why I feel that we have been perhaps a little bit too easy in our approach to commercial banks and to the matter of whether or not we should have other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister saw fit some time ago to issue a statement through the Government Information Bureau in reply to a speech in which I said there was a provision in this Bill for the devaluation of the Irish £ as distinct from British or other devaluation.  At the time I did not see, through my own fault, the statement reported in the papers but I understand that Deputy O'Donovan of the Labour Party saw it and replied to it.  I do no more now than draw the attention of the House to the Explanatory Memorandum issued with the Bill in which paragraph 3 of the introduction states:</P>
    <P>to remove the anomaly between the existing statutory provisions requiring <Col N="1922" /> parity between Irish currency and sterling and this country's obligations as a member of the International Monetary Fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the opportunity of dealing with that matter when replying but it appears to me that I am correct and that in fact, even though I know the Minister would not desire it, it would be most injurious to the economy of the country that nobody with responsibility would desire it.  It is not something which should be voiced abroad.  It appears possible to devalue the Irish currency as distinct from the British currency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of what is contained in this Bill was the subject of Fine Gael policy at the time of the 1965 general election.  I sometimes wonder whether policies do a party any good. It is interesting to see that it is necessary <Col N="1923" /> to bring in legislation which was suggested by the Opposition six years earlier.  When I pointed out the same situation to the Minister's predecessor in relation to another matter where Fine Gael suggested something which was eventually taken up by the Government, I said that we were governing from this side of the House and the impertinent remarks of the Minister's predecessor was that he was delighted that such was the case and that as long as we were governing from this side of the House that suited him very well. Things have changed somewhat since, but I shall leave that matter aside, because the sordid difficulties of the Fianna Fáil Party at the present time do not require discussion by me.  They are so sordid as to be below the thinking of any decent member of the public.</P>
    <P>We have the situation now where section 11 permits the Central Bank, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to revoke a licence:</P>
    <P>(1)  if the holder so requests or ceases to carry on business;</P>
    <P>(2)  if he becomes unable to meet his obligations, is adjudicated bankrupt or, if being a company, is being wound up;</P>
    <P>(3)  if he fails to maintain the required deposit with the Bank;</P>
    <P>(4)  if he is convicted on indictment of an offence under any provision of the legislation or if he is convicted summarily of an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust;</P>
    <P>(5)  if, since the grant of the licence, the circumstances have changed to such an extent that if the licence holder currently applied for a licence he would not be granted one.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see paragraph (5) is the only case in which the Minister might decide; in the other it should be automatic.  It is a good provision.  A pool should be established so that anybody who invests in a licensed financial institution will be compensated at the full par value of his shares and investments if that financial institution goes bankrupt.  This would attract money into this country and people might <Col N="1924" /> even be prepared to take a lesser rate of interest.  I see this as a perfectly proper provision.  After all, the Minister is taking the right to license somebody. As far as I can see a person can be licensed for £1.  Provided I do not use the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo;, &ldquo;banker&rdquo; or &ldquo;banking&rdquo; I can turn up with £1, say I am going to start taking deposits, and if I am of good standing, which is highly questionable, I should get a licence.  Having got my licence I might start taking deposits of £1 or £5 from people like Deputy Tully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Not from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on the interest rate I offered.  If one of my objects was to further the interests of the Federation of Rural Workers it is quite possible I would get a large deposit from Deputy Tully.  Having done this who would I be?  I would be an individual who was taking deposits and either investing or lending the money on either my own decision or the decision of a board that I appointed.  Boards of companies have made mistakes and companies have gone bankrupt; boards of banks have made mistakes but for a long time banks have not gone bankrupt.</P>
      <P>In the last five years we have seen an enormous increase in the number of financial institutions and there is a danger that one of them might go bankrupt.  For this reason provision should be made in the Bill for a pool. In the insurance world at the present time in relation to a serious claim where a man with a family to support suffers a back injury and has to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair, if his insurance company goes bankrupt this man will be paid out of the pool of insurance companies.  This of course would not happen in the case of a claim for loss of small items such as jewellery or personal effects.</P>

      <P>The question then arises of currency.  Deputy Collins made the point that a charge was being made by the Irish commercial banks for the taking back of coins which people pass in England.  This was a most irritating thing in respect of Scottish notes some years ago.  If one accepted a Scottish bank note here ten or 12 years ago in one's shop it cost one about 3d.  This has been got rid of.  I should like to hear, when the Minister is replying, whether we can get rid of this business in relation to the coins too.  I know it must cost <Col N="1926" /> some money to send bags full of coins back on the mail boat but these are little irritations which do our tourist industry no good at all.  We want to get rid of these little irritations.  I should like to know whether or not there will be a charge on Irish coins that have been used abroad and then have to be &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash;repatriated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One great way of repatriating them is when one goes into a hotel and changes a note if one does not look at one's change half of it is in Irish coins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one way of repatriating it.</P>
      <P>The restriction on advertising for deposits contained in section 27 is something I just do not understand. Why should a bank not advertise and solicit deposits?  The building societies have several advertisements on television.  Banks need deposits. We are all encouraged to save. We have a National Savings Committee and other things to try to encourage us to save.  What is the reason behind this prohibition on banks seeking deposits?  Why should they not solicit deposits?  I think they should, and I do not see the reason, therefore, for section 27.</P>
      <P>The question of the ratio of liabilities to assets is, of course, part of the answer to my suggestion that there should be a pool from which a customer of a defaulting bank could get money which he was owed.  The Central Bank may require a bank to preserve this ratio.  The question arises of whether or not the Central Bank will then send in accountants or inspectors or officers of one kind or another to see if this ratio is being preserved at all times.  I do not know whether this is sufficient safeguard or not but it is a good thing that there is a ratio preserved between assets and liabilities.  It means that, unless the directors of the bank act incorrectly and lend too much money and therefore have too much money on risk, there should be a great degree of safety in the deposit of money with the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what should be the deposit rate does not seem to me to be dealt with in the Bill.  I am aware <Col N="1927" /> that one of the sources from which the Government get money from the banks is from their excellent profits and this means that the Government can probably get more money from them than if they had lesser profits. But one must immediately call to mind the difference between the deposit rate with one of the ordinary commercial banks in this country and the lending rate and then look at the deposit rate of some of the merchant bankers who have opened in this country and their lending rate.  While the lending rate in respect of hire purchase and so on is extremely high, in respect of discount bills, for instance, where people buy goods and discount a bill for 90 days &mdash; to be produced in their bank at 90 days &mdash; the discount bill rate of the merchant bank is very often as little as about one quarter per cent.  At the same time, that merchant bank might be extending to its depositers as high a figure as seven per cent and might be working on a differential between the deposit figure and the lending figure of three per cent whereas the ordinary commercial bank might be operating on a differential between the deposit figure and the lending figure of as high as five and six per cent depending, of course, on the size of the deposit but taking the average.  This seems to be a great discrepancy and the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank should keep an eye on the situation and should see to it that both depositor and borrower get a fair run for their money.  There is this wide discrepancy.  If we are now, under this Bill, to deal with the ratio of deposits to lendings and, therefore, create some great degree of safety all over the banking system, including the merchant banking system, we should, perhaps, look at the question of whether there should be a higher deposit rate for the ordinary commercial banks.  It seems to me to be quite wrong that one bank can work for half as much gross profit as another bank seems to need.</P>
    <P>The restriction on the carrying on of banking business seems to be a rather extraordinary section.  It seems to me that if a body corporate does not use the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo;, &ldquo;banker&rdquo;<Col N="1928" /> or &ldquo;banking&rdquo; or any word which is a variant of the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo;&mdash; I do not like to name firms but &ldquo;Lombank&rdquo; would be an example &mdash; if one has the licence one may proceed and carry on banking even though one has not got permission under the Act to call oneself a banker.  I do not know what that means.  Is one allowed to call oneself: &ldquo;Hire Purchase, Leeson Street, Ltd.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bicycle Hire, Ltd.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Car Hire Ltd.&rdquo; while at the same time one is not entitled to call oneself: &ldquo;Car Hire Bank Ltd.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cycles, Leeson Street, Banking Ltd.&rdquo; or any of these words that seem to carry this connotation of being a bank?  I just do not know why this situation is created whereby there will be great value in being a bank.  This must have been a request made to the Minister to have this distinction and difference and this must be something the Minister acceded to.  The question of the deposits of the banks for the purposes of licences was represented to me as being prejudicial to the interests of the smaller banks. The very large bank would lodge £500,000 with the Central Bank and to a very large bank this might not be proportionately as much as £20,000, the minimum figure, to a very small bank.  It was suggested to me that the figure of £20,000 was too large for a very small bank.  I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  I have not had the opportunity of examining the position.  I would think that this is something that might be looked at on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The restriction on certain words comes in at section 14 where the person who is a building society, an industrial or provident society, a credit union or a trust company may not call himself a bank or may not use the word &ldquo;banking&rdquo; and is, therefore, in the position that he must call himself &ldquo;a building society&rdquo; or any of these different descriptions allowed to him. I do not want to hold up the House any longer.  This is a very detailed Bill which will be discussed at length during the Committee Stage.  It is a Bill which must be examined line by line and section by section.  There seem to be quite a lot of things in it which were put in at the request of various people and institutions.  While that <Col N="1929" /> might be good, one must look at the community as a whole.  On further examination it may be found that some of these things should be deleted.  I always found the Minister most co-operative when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce and I was spokesman for industry and commerce on this side of the House.  We have often co-operated before.  I look forward to a non-political approach to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in principle.  I really want to speak on the bank strike.  I was looking at what the Minister said about appointing three bank directors to the board of the Central Bank.  The Minister may have said two such directors.  Two bank directors might suffice and the Minister could pick another non-bank director. Most directors of banks are in a business or profession.  Some directors may be appointed because of their academic qualifications.  Most bank directors I have met are people who are well-known in business.  They might be well-known in the commercial life of the country as accountants.  They know this business.  Perhaps we should have four such men as directors, even if the Minister increases the number on the other side.  It would be better to have more control over the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a bank strike for seven months.  I really believe that nobody in the Government did anything about the strike because it suited the Government. Nobody could see the state of the economy at the time.  The Government could not care less about the situation.  This was allowed to happen by the Government to the detriment of a tremendous number of businesses, particularly small businesses.  There were many people who wrote cheques during the bank strike to pay their accounts and they collected all the money they could in cash or cheques and moved across the Border or went to England or put the money into the American Bank here on a short-term basis.  They knew that it would take three or four months from the date the banks opened to clear up the accounts and such people had another month before drawing the money out.  They made 6 or 7 per cent on this money <Col N="1930" /> and then they paid their accounts. Against that, there were many retailers in Dublin who kept the economy of the country going by giving money and cashing cheques for various people.  The Minister made a very clearcut statement here to the effect that the banks do not return a cheque unless one overdraws his permission.  We all agree on that.  Some people got dud cheques which were returned to them and these cheques were the cause of bank accounts being overdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I interrupt?  The particular kind of case the Deputy has just described was mentioned by me and all I have said about that was that I have known of no such case in which the man concerned was put out of business and in which the bank did not facilitate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P Belton Mr. P Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that such a man is not as of now out of business, but he is on his way out unless he can get his money.  He cannot get his money if the person is gone to England or if he has cashed cheques for the Hibernian Transport, for instance.  In that case the man might get 18s in the £1 or 2s in the £.  Whether such man is given bank facilities or not, his income from his business would not be able to pay the interest on a large overdraft from the bank, and therefore he has to go out of business.  The people with accounts which were reasonably all right are only now being called in to look at their accounts.  The whole picture will not be seen until March.  It is not sufficient to say in an offhand manner that nothing will happen.  If a man cannot repay the bank and has cashed useless cheques he will be put out of business.  A sum of £6,000 could put a man over his limit and into a category where he would not be able to meet his bank account.  The bank will put such a man out of business.  I know of some people who are going into liquidation because they got dud cheques.  This will happen from now on, over the next two or three months.  In the city of Dublin the big drapery shops and the licensed traders like grocers kept the economy going by giving all their money for cheques to reputable people but some of the so-called reputable people played <Col N="1931" /> on them and they overdid it in the hope that the strike would last a couple of years and they would make a killing. This has happened all over the place. In addition, anybody who cashed any sizeable amounts of money had to keep a person to keep a note of the cheques and it cost him so much a week to pay that person.  He also had to keep the cheques in one place and a note of them in another place and he had to be insured against fire and there were other costs.  Another thing is that if you had an overdraft you were charged on it which was fair enough and if you sold a house or a premises they accepted the date on which the solicitor acting for you made out the cheque as the date on which the money would have been lodged in the normal way, or within two or three days.  However, in the case of a business which would be working on an overdraft and which would lodge say £1,000 a week that cannot come off the overdraft because out of that you will pay a certain percentage and all you are left with eventually is your net profit but there would be a certain period of weeks or months when some of that would be used out of your overdraft before you paid some of your overheads.  Wages would be out of it already but there would be other overheads.</P>
      <P>There are some businesses which make a profit in summer like hotels, and make nothing in the winter.  This strike went on through the summer and hotels, licensed premises and to a small extent drapery shops who, if they lodged £1,000, might in that period make 20, 30 or 40 per cent which should have been allowed.  That would have been net profit for that period before overheads.  A hotel in a tourist area could make up to 40 per cent but they would have to pay overhead bills and keep a nucleus of a staff going for winter and it would come down quite a bit.  Therefore the bank should look at the business and say, &ldquo;For this period of the year you should make 40 per cent&rdquo; and they should allow that 40 per cent, which would be £400, off the overdraft per week or per month or whatever way the lodgment was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banks are still gaining but I <Col N="1932" /> do not think they should gain at all because they made a tremendous amount of money on this.  They should also look at the end of the year and work out the net profit of that firm and allow the average per week, or per day, off the interest.  One thing that must be remembered is that while the banks made their money on overdrafts &mdash; you had to pay your overdraft regardless &mdash; they did not pay any wages during that period.  You might say that the banks paid afterwards, which they did and it cost them quite an amount but they had everybody working without a break whereas normally there would be slack periods and busy periods but for this period they were just working hammer and tongs.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned before, during this strike the economy was kept going by retailers at risk to themselves.  Many of them lost money; some of them a lot of money.  We had the example of the Hibernian Transport and how much people lost there but in the last strike one man was caught for £4,500. He brought the person to court and the man was convicted and sent to jail but the other man was that amount of money out of pocket but the Revenue Commissioners came along and charged him income tax on it so that he was down in the region of £6,000.  He appealed to the Circuit Court and lost and was advised that he would win if he went to a higher court but he had lost so much that if he went to a higher court he would be broke.  I know that on a legal point the Revenue Commissioners were right but surely there must be some moral law as well as the ordinary laws.  I would not mind if the culprit had not been charged in which case the commissioners could have said &ldquo;Charge him and we will think about it&rdquo; but he was charged and sentenced to jail and still the Revenue Commissioners taxed the man.  If the Revenue Commissioners do that to a person I cannot see why the person does not in a barefaced way rob the Revenue Commissioners. If you get that sort of thing from the Revenue Commissioners, why should the people not do the same in return?  This man was ill at the time and it nearly killed him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> In the last strike I cashed a tremendous amount of money for one very big firm and they are still very big but who would not have thought the same of Hibernian Transport?  Cheques were cashed for £120,000, £14,000 and I know of one case of £6,500.  A lot of these were cheques cashed for wages. To my knowledge the person involved can either go to Hibernian Transport from whom he will get nothing or, if he is lucky, he might get 19s in the £ if he is in the right section but if he does not he can go against the worker but nobody is going to go against the worker for something like this.  We saw what happened in the case of Hibernian Transport.  We lost our shipping to a Dutch firm and lost money that we would have saved in our balance of payments but no Irish company moved in to take over, nor did the Government go to Hibernian Transport and say, &ldquo;We will cover for a certain amount.  It may not pay us, but at least we can get another Irish company to do the work&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the former Minister for Finance and a couple of top men in the banks decided that the days of the overdraft were finished, the days when a customer would get a loan for five, six or eight years were over and instead they would get a short term loan for six months, a year or a year and a half, but the people were told to knock next door where there was a merchant bankers where they would pay 2 per cent or 3 per cent extra.  This 2 per cent or 3 per cent extra is basically going into the same kitty.  Straightaway this is putting up costs and is inflationary.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton gave notice of his intention to raise on the adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 30 of 17th February, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to say that I did not ask for this question on the adjournment for any political motive &mdash; I did it because the area concerned is in urgent need of <Col N="1934" /> schools.  The area lies between the Malahide Road, Collins Avenue and the Belfast road.  There are approximately 16,000 houses in the area.  Contrary to a remark made recently by a Fianna Fáil Deputy this was not built-up in the last two years; it has been built during the last ten or 12 years. Therefore the Government had plenty of time to be aware of the position and to take the necessary steps to provide adequate schools.</P>
      <P>This could apply to any newly builtup area.  One could take as an example the Tallaght area which is beginning to give some trouble from the Minister's point of view, as regards schools and the same position will probably obtain eventually in Blanchardstown.  Beside the Kilmore West area is Bonnybrook and the same trouble exists there in that a dual system of schooling is in operation.  This means that children study from 9 a.m. to 12 mid-day; the teacher and the children leave the classroom and another group of children arrive to work from 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.  The children are being half-educated at a time when they should receive a full day's schooling.  This is particularly applicable to children who may not continue their education after the age of 14 years.  In the case of Bonnybrook I attended about ten meetings with Fianna Fáil, Labour and Fine Gael Deputies.  Eventually after much effort by the teachers, the clergy, the residents and the public representatives we managed to get nine rooms from the Minister's Department.  I fault the Government for their total lack of interest in this connexion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a ten-year period the corporation plan an area.  Some parts may be completed more quickly than others but generally they know what will happen in a five- or ten-year period.  This knowledge should be in the hands of all Government Departments.  In the case of the Cromcastle/Kilmore West area I shall give a few examples of what has annoyed residents.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have not provided a post office.  There is only a caravan available; people have to queue for children's allowances and for old age pensions and it is impossible to lodge money.  People lodge money with some society for which <Col N="1935" /> they have to pay a sum of 30s fee which makes a dent in the few pounds they have to lodge.  At the moment if people wish to use the post office facilities they have to queue outside the caravan at 8.40 a.m. and frequently there are 100 people waiting.  There are insufficient police in the area; there is a shortage of library and health services and of many other amenities.  I mention these facts to show that the residents have justification for their annoyance.</P>
    <P>When they wish to send their children to school they find that schools are not available.  At this stage they begin to realise that Corporation tenants are treated like second-class citizens.  In the area to which I have referred there are no secondary schools and there are no plans for their provision to my knowledge.  In 80 per cent of cases parents had to have three or four children before they got houses; therefore the number of children involved was easy to calculate.  I know many children will go to technical schools because their fathers were tradesmen and they may wish to follow the same trade but others will wish to obtain a secondary education in order to become teachers and so on.  The figures I will give to the Minister will show that there will not be sufficient primary schools, never mind secondary schools.</P>
    <P>In Bonnybrook there are 1,500 houses.  New houses are being built on the Oscar Traynor Road; there are some 2,000-3,000 houses between Kilmore and Beaumont.  I was in one of these prefabricated houses in Coolock and I should like the Minister to come and visit there.  The prefab is economical and I can understand the Minister's wish to save money.  In the building I visited there were eight classrooms built round a general purposes room, which is used as two classrooms. It is necessary to pass through the general purposes room, which has one exit.  If a fire should occur on that premises it is impossible to visualise 450 children being able to leave the premises safely.  In a rush for the single door very many would be killed.</P>
    <P>I shall outline briefly the dual-day system.  A mother brings one child to school at 9 a.m. and she collects the <Col N="1936" /> child at 12 o'clock; she must take a second child to school at 12.30 p.m. and return at 3.30 p.m. to collect the child.  It means that the mother's entire day is taken up with travelling to and from the school and she finds it impossible even to prepare meals.  In this area many women work to supplement the family income &mdash; in fact, an American factory has been looking for women employees.  It is impossible for the women to take up employment because their entire day is occupied in taking their children to school.</P>
    <P>Some 1,150 children are attending schools outside the area; they go to the O'Connell Schools, schools in Clontarf and Fairview and at William Street.  I admit that some of these children continue through choice their education in these schools but this does not apply to the total number.  Some of the pupils are attending schools at Inchicore and Rathfarnham, which must be 14 miles away.  A recent survey carried out by the residents shows that there are 4,600 children in Kilmore West area; 3,450 are school-going and 1,150 are coming up for education within the next three years.  Some 1,300 are attending school on Cromcastle Green, Kilmore West; 600 are attending Saint David's and St. John of God's secondary schools&mdash; approximately 300 in each.</P>
    <P>There are 1,150 children attending 21 schools outside this area, and I mean outside this area.  Assuming that 300 boys and 250 girls, giving a total of 550 children, leave the prefabricated buildings in Cromcastle next July, that leaves vacancies for 90 pupils in an area where there are 128 new flats, 200 new houses in Kilmore Park Estate, 800 new houses in the Ardmore Estate, and of that 800 there are at least 200 already occupied.  In the region between there and Beaumont there are another 3,000 houses going up, and there is no school for boys in Beaumont.  The Minister told me that a new school under construction there would be ready by the 1st September.  It will not be ready by then.  It may be ready on the 1st January or some time next Spring, but even if it is, it will be the same type of school as in the other place, a fire hazard.  It is a two-storey building but I assume the design will be the same. <Col N="1937" /> There are 14 classrooms and two general purpose rooms which will be used as classrooms.  That will give accommodation for 640 with 40 pupils per class.  You may squeeze in 45 or 50 as in the case of other schools but the recommended number is 40 and no more than 40.</P>
    <P>Where will all the necessary school accommodation come from?  As regards primary schools there is none for Kilmore West or Bonnybrook. There are 1,500 houses in Bonnybrook; I may be wrong within 100 or 200 because it is a very big scheme. There is no secondary school either. There is no use in the Minister telling me there is a secondary school close by.  There is not.  People living in Raheny must send their children to Sandymount for secondary education. If they live in Harmonstown the children must go across the city, anywhere they can get in.  Saint Joseph's will not take them nor will any of the other schools around take them.  Do I take it from the Minister he intends these children to go to a technical school and that they will have no choice of a proper secondary education?  In any case the technical school in that area would be overloaded.  The accommodation there is not adequate at all. In the immediate vicinity there are 6,000 houses and no provision for a secondary school.  There is no secondary school for boys in Beaumont which contains another 1,600 or 1,700 houses.</P>
    <P>If schools were constructed in these areas they would not go to waste because from Bonnybrook out towards the Airport, along the backroad towards the Coachman's Inn the corporation have bought thousands of acres of land.  Some of it is for industrial or commercial sites but there is 1,000 acres there and at 12 houses per acre there would be 12,000 houses built so that schools would not go to waste. One must remember that over the last ten years this was the sole area in Dublin, except for small pockets, where there was a corporation scheme going on all the time, with the exclusion of that rushed job in Ballymun which is no credit to anyone and people do not want to stay in it.</P>
    <P>I am telling the Minister that schools <Col N="1938" /> are not there.  I do not mind if the Minister says there is no money and that they will be built within a certain time.  I know there is vast expenditure involved.  I do not want to make political capital out of this but I do not want to be told something is going to be done when I know it cannot be done the way the Minister is proceeding at the moment.</P>
    <P>If pupils cannot be accommodated locally surely there should be a free bus service to a group of schools like O'Connell's, St. Canice's, William Street and Fairview, which are practically together and where the majority of the children in the areas I have mentioned go; some of them go to Clontarf.  I can give the Minister an example of a woman who sends two or three children to Fairview School and it costs 40s per week out of her income.  It could save a great deal of industrial strife in regard to the demand for wages if such people could be saved that amount of money by being able to send their children to schools in their own area.</P>
    <P>The Minister may know the area by looking at the map, and I am sure he is well briefed on it by his staff. However, I would like the Minister to visit the area, not necessarily with me or any other politician but with somebody from the area, who would show him the problem from the residents' point of view.  They may exaggerate slightly, but there is no secondary school in that area at the moment and I have heard of no plans for a secondary school.  There are two secondary schools adjoining the area but they cater for the residents of the privately-built houses which were there originally. Pupils must do an examination to get into Chanel College.  It is the same situation in regard to Belcamp, St. Paul's or St. Joseph's, which are the secondary schools in that area of North-east and North-central Dublin in which there must be at least 150,000 people.</P>
    <P>I have brought this matter up not for any political motive and not to attack the Minister personally.  I do not want to blame the Department either.  This area is crying out for education.  What I want is to get some kind of promise from the Minister <Col N="1939" /> to the people of the Kilmore/Bonnybrook Estates that secondary schools will be provided, say, within three or three and a half years.  That would satisfy them to some extent.  At the moment there are no schools and they are being told nothing.  There is no guarantee and the situation will end up, as in the Bonnybrook case, with the priests breathing down the necks of public representatives to approach the Minister to get money from the Minister for Finance for the provision of schools.  The Minister should come in person to see the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the estimation of the situation as made by Deputy Belton.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with primary educcation in the Cromcastle-Kilmore area. I had hoped to have sufficient accommodation available in the new schools for boys and girls which are at present being built in the Cromcastle-Kilmore area by September, 1971, so that the dual day system which entails a shorter school day for infant pupils could be ended.  I might add that this dual day system is a common enough system on the Continent.  In fact, while the infants do not have as long a period as normal in school, nevertheless, it is very little short of the normal.  I recognise, of course, that there is a problem in the fact that parents have to bring some of the children to school in the morning and others in the evening. However, as only portion of the new buildings will be erected by the date on which we had hoped to have had the schools open, arrangements are being made to transfer from a nearby school a number of prefabricated classrooms which will shortly become surplus at that school, so that all the primary school children may be on a full day's schooling as from September, 1971.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to the fire hazards in these prefabricated schools but I am sure he must accept that our schools have to comply with the regulations of Dublin Corporation.  The question of <Col N="1940" /> the schools for the Kilmore area was considered some years ago.  As this and the Bonnybrook area were then in the same parish, the parish priest decided that, because Bonnybrook was developing at a much faster rate than Kilmore, he would build the schools in Bonnybrook first.  An application was received from the present manager of the Kilmore area in 1968 and it was decided to erect new schools there.</P>
      <P>I will now give some particulars of these schools.  First, we have a boys' school to be conducted by the Irish Christian Brothers.  There will be 16 classrooms in that school and later there will be 18 classrooms.  Secondly, we have a girls' school to be conducted by the Sisters of St. John of God with 16 classrooms plus a cookery room. Thirdly, we will have the Kilmore Road boys' school which will be staffed by lay teachers and will have 16 classrooms.  Fourthly, there will be the Kilmore Road girls' school which will be staffed by lay teachers and will have 16 classrooms.  Grants have been sanctioned for the erection of all of these schools.</P>
      <P>The girls' school which will be conducted by the Sisters of St. John of God is nearing completion.  The two schools to be staffed by lay staff are in course of erection and are due for completion by April, 1972.  Four classrooms in each of these schools are expected to be available by next September. Pending the erection of the new permanent buildings, prefabricated buildings were provided in each case.  In this area there is also a prefabricated school for juniors in Ardlea Road.  This was erected in 1967.  The total number of prefabricated classrooms available in the area is 60.</P>

      <P>The dual day situation is in the Cromcastle Green/Kilmore, schools and this is where the problem is.  I understand that by the <Col N="1941" /> end of the school year the new convent school, St. John of God's, will be completed and there will be 12 spare prefabricated classrooms which will then be made available in that area and this will put an end to the dual day system.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Bonnybrook/Kilmore/Cromcastle area I am informed that there is spare accommodation available in national schools in the neighbouring parish.  In the St. Brendan's boys' school there are about 340 places and in St. Catherine's girls' and infants's school there are about 90 places.  These schools are only half a mile away.  The fact that parents send their children to schools outside these areas does not carry with it a right to free transport.  These are very close to the area in question.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy already the post-primary educational needs of these areas are already being met by four secondary schools and one vocational school.  I should like the Deputy to recognise that I am concerned with post-primary education. We never said at any time that there would be sufficient places in all the secondary schools for those who wish to go to secondary schools.  We did say that there would be a place in a post-primary school for every child who wanted post-primary education.</P>

    <P>In Chanel College in Coolock there is accommodation for 400 pupils.  It is intended to increase this to cater for 600 pupils.  The new Christian Brothers school at Kilmore Road is being built. Accommodation has already been provided there for 200 pupils and when the project is completed there will be accommodation for 720 pupils.  A boys' vocational school, a junior cycle, has been built in the Coolock/Kilmore area and it will accommodate 720 pupils. Senior cycle accommodation will be provided there at a later stage.  For girls we have the Virgo Clemens school which was recently completed and will accommodate 450 girls.  A new school to be operated by the Sisters of St. John of God has been sanctioned.  The accommodation will be provided in stages.  In the meantime, the school is being operated in prefabricated classrooms. <Col N="1942" /> A new vocational school for 720 girls is planned and will eventually be built on the same site as the site for the boys' vocational school.</P>

      <P>I met a deputation from the Kilmore Tenants' Association some time ago to discuss primary and post-primary education in the area.  I agreed at that time to ask the Dublin Advisory Council to re-examine the post-primary accommodation needs of the area.  This is an advisory council for post-primary schools in Dublin and it comprises representatives of the school managers of vocational education committees, of teachers' organisations, and the Department.  It makes an assessment of the needs of each area and the Department are guided to a very large extent by the advice of the committee when making provision for postprimary education.</P>
      <P>As I said, I agreed to ask the Dublin Advisory Council to re-examine the situation here in relation to the post-primary accommodation needs.  This was done and at their next meeting the advisory committee examined the whole situation and it was agreed that the plans already prepared for that area met the situation.  In all, about 4,000 places in post-primary schools will be provided within that area.  This number will fully cater for the needs of that area.  I have already told the Deputy the number of schools that are completed, the number of schools that are being built, the number of extensions that are being prepared, and I have explained to him that, on the advice of this Dublin Advisory Council, which advise me in relation to the number of places needed in any area in the city, the accommodation we are making available for post-primary education is sufficient.  The Deputy can be assured that this accommodation will be made available and that it will be sufficient to meet the needs of the area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether a person aged 31 years (name supplied) who was a serving officer of the Garda Síochána was dismissed from the service; whether he had been examined for detection of a disease known as alcoholism prior to dismissal; whether there was a gradual deterioration in the performance of his duties as a man; whether this deterioration would be compatible with a deterioration due to alcoholism; and if the person in question is shown to be <Col N="1825" /> suffering from alcoholism and responding successfully to modern medical treatment which would return him to full efficiency if he will consider reinstatement of this man to his original position, if only for a trial period of six months, on the production of specialist medical evidence indicating conclusively that his deterioration in service was due to a medical disease.</P>

      <P>This man was dismissed by the Commissioner last June with my consent, which was given only after I had examined his record of over nine years service and satisfied myself that he was unsuitable for retention in the Force. None of the medical certificates furnished by him during that period in connection with absences on sick leave suggested that he was suffering from alcoholism.</P>
      <P>The initiative in proposing the reappointment of ex-members of the Force is, under the relevant statutory regulations, vested in the Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if local authority tenants who have received an increase in the old age pension will have to pay an increased amount of weekly rent to the relevant local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The detailed operation of rent schemes is a matter for individual local authorities and I have no information as to the effects of variations in incomes on the rents of individual tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The differential rent schemes operated by the Dublin Corporation in respect of dwellings let on or before 1st November, 1970, provide for a rent including a sum for rates up to 1964-65 within specific ranges equivalent to one-sixth of income after deductions. Increases in rates since 1964-65 are payable in addition to the rent so assessed.  Dwellings provided since 1st November last are let for a rent, exclusive of any sum for rates, within specific ranges equivalent to one-sixth <Col N="1826" /> of income after deductions.  Full rates are payable in addition to the rent so assessed.</P>
    <P>The deductions under each differential scheme operated by the corporation include increases since 1957 in social welfare non-contributory allowances. Increases under social welfare contributory insurance schemes are not, however, deducted from income basically because these benefits are paid to persons without reference to means. In the case of dwellings first let after 1st November, 1970, a deduction of 25 per cent of benefits paid to a tenant by way of old age contributory pension or widows and orphans contributory pension is made where there is no other household income.</P>
