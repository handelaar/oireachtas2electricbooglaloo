    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 2, lines 19 and 20, to delete &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could take amendment No. 2 with No. 1 as they are related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the most important part of this Bill will be its memorandum and articles of association. It is in those documents that the title of the Bill will be defined in some detail.  As this company, which is to be set up, can be a company of prime importance in the industrial life of the country it is essential that this House, which will be providing the finance for the company, should see exactly what type of company it is proposed to be set up.  All that I am asking is that the Minister would let the Parliament see the memorandum and articles of association.  As the Minister <Col N="150" /> knows, it is within these documents that the personality of the company is formed and the details of its <i>modus operandi</i> will be set out, and, in view of the later amendment by the Minister where the borrowings may go to the very substantial sum of £7½ million, it is only proper that the Dáil should see the memorandum and articles of association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 1, Deputy Cooney's proposal is that the memorandum of association should be approved by the House rather than by the Minister.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that it is standard practice that the memorandum of association of a State company should be approved by whichever Minister is directly responsible in each case.  In no case that I am aware of are these memoranda subject to approval by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I would invite the Deputy's attention to section 4 (2) (a) of the Bill which already delimits the contents of the memorandum of association by prescribing what the principal functions of the company will be.  The remaining provisions of the memorandum should only be regarded as being of a subsidiary nature and really governing the general functions of the company under the Companies Act in relation to its day-to-day business. Accordingly, the memorandum cannot contain any provisions of significance which are not already before the House in section 4 (2) (a).  Any change in the substance of the memorandum would require the consent of the House by way of legislation amending section 4 (2) (a).</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 2, which is a similar case but relating to the articles of association of the company, again, it is standard practice to have the articles of association of State companies approved by the Minister responsible for the particular company.  Again, I am not aware of any example in which it is subject to approval by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the articles of association prescribe the regulations for management of the company and, in form and content, they will be consistent with Table A of the Companies <Col N="151" /> Act, 1963.  As the Deputy knows, they do such things as spell out the rules attaching to the appointment and the powers of directors, arrangements for company meetings, transfers of shares, and that kind of thing.  I think it is important to remember that these items are not concerned in any way with company policy and, therefore, I do not think it serves any useful purpose to require the approval of the Dáil for the articles of association.  These are simply rules governing the day-to-day operations of the company and I do not think it would be appropriate for Dáil Éireann to become involved in the running of a company at that level. For these reasons, I am not disposed to accept the amendments proposed by Deputy Cooney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all taken by the argument that I hear so often, relying on precedent, because the precedent might not be sacrosanct.  It could be a bad precedent.  Indeed, I can imagine companies which could come before this House where there would be no point in the memorandum and articles of association coming here. But a company of this nature which, it is proposed, should have borrowing powers of up to £7½ million and which will be of vital importance to the industrial life of the nation, cannot be compared with the precedents the Minister speaks about and the fact that, in the past, the memorandum and articles did not come before the House is no argument why they might not come here on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The other point made by the Minister was that the objects are already set out in section 4 and that section 5, if you like, gives the circumference of the articles of association and that the presence of these two sections renders the detailed memorandum and articles of association unnecessary. Again, as I pointed out on the Second Reading, what is rather unsatisfactory about this whole Bill is that the commercial philosophy behind it is hazy. In what way is it different from the ICC?  How will it operate in relation to the way Taiscí Stáit was operated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought, perhaps, that if the <Col N="152" /> detailed memorandum and articles of association came before the House, where we would have the full objects and the full articles of association and, in particular, its powers to go in to rescue companies and the type of company that is to be rescued in relation to section 4 (2) (b), it might be of assistance to the Minister and informative to the House and the taxpayer to see precisely what sort of company was being set up.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to section 4 and section 5, like my colleague, Deputy Cooney, I fail to see what difference there is between this Bill and Mergers Limited as operated by the Industrial Credit Company. Undoubtedly, section 4 does define the circumstances in which a company might expect to receive assistance.  I am not a great Gaelic scholar but it appears that the translation of Fóir Teoranta is &ldquo;Rescue Limited&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not quarrel with &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; because that is the basic idea behind it but I am informed that the accurate English rendering is &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked some excellent Gaelic scholars on this side of the House who, in my opinion, are a bit better at the language than the Minister. They thought &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; was closer to the meaning than &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I went to my more learned friends, as far as Gaelic is concerned, to get the exact meaning because that might be a clue to the thinking behind it.</P>
      <P>There will be plenty of need for rescue.  Under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and with the freeing of trade in the EEC and, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Imposition of Duties Bill last night and on his Estimate made quite clear, there are various areas, particularly textiles, footwear and joinery, where there will be serious difficulty and need for rescue.</P>
      <P>The question then arises as to whether section 4 is, in fact, doing anything more than could be done and probably would be done if things could move fast enough under the aegis of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Inter alia,</i> the objects of the company shall be under subsection (2) (a) (i):</P>
      <P>to acquire, hold and sell, assign and otherwise deal in shares and debentures issued by concerns satisfying the Company that they are eligible concerns within the meaning of this subsection.</P>
      <P>This subsection has been foreshadowed by statements made by prominent young bankers over the last six months and the thinking by these prominent young bankers is that one of the good things that should happen in businesses which may find themselves in difficulty would be that the bankers, instead of extending normal overdraft accommodation, or, as they announced about a year ago, term loans plus overdraft accommodation, should take shares in the company and place on the board of the particular company a member of the bank.  One has to consider then in relation to this rescue operation, if such a procedure were to occur, what the result would be if a director of the company was also an employee of the bank which provided perhaps all the liquid capital being used in the company.</P>

      <P>We must discuss this seriously.  In the last six to nine months it has been suggested at various management seminars and elsewhere that more positive action by particular State institutions was required and they prophesied the arrival on boards of companies of representatives of banks. I suggest that, if a representative of a bank became a director of a company and that bank was the bank which provided all the liquid capital requirements of the company, an absolutely dictatorial position would be created. The companies could be merged together if, for instance, two banks so decided; they could be merged if one bank happened to be the banker for the same company as the other bank and something could be made viable with, perhaps, a lower employment content. That would be a pity particularly where two companies, if there had been individual help for each company, might have been capable of continuing on their own and becoming viable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney interjected to say that the bank representative on the company would be sacked by the bank.  This might not be the case.  If one reads the balance sheets of companies, the profit and loss and the trading accounts one finds that a number of companies, in order to rationalise and become ready for free trade, have had to spend very large capital sums and these capital sums have impinged on their liquid resources to such an extent that the liquid resources are, as to a great proportion of them, borrowed from the banks. Out of that has grown term loan ideas and, following on that, the idea of placing directors of the banks on the boards of companies.  That might appear to be a very good thing from the point of view of the person outside looking in in the belief that the person who pays the piper should call the tune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here I want to sound an open warning.  One can take this strong Manchester School of Economics line and make something pay but, in the process, one can also destroy employment <Col N="155" /> and the possibility of increased employment in the future.  It is for that reason I want to sound a note of warning.  I agree absolutely that there is need for the service provided in this Bill.  I have grave doubts, however, and I think the Confederation of Irish Industry would join with me in this if I read their weekly circulars correctly, whether this Bill is the answer.  It is introducing yet another agency.  We have at the moment the IDA and the ICC.  There are four different sections of the IDA operating on four different fronts.  The ICC operates on five or six different fronts, including Mergers Limited.  The latter is doing work which would parallel the work of Fóir Teoranta.  Then there is Córas Tráchtála advising on marketing prospects and so on.  One begins to wonder whether or not section 4 should have produced something like the rescue operation devised by the last Labour Government in Britain; one agency did everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has in mind the IRC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  As far as I understand it, the Tory Government is rather sorry that, because of ideological differences, they got rid of the IRC and it is possible within a very short period they may restore something like the IRC.  As I interpret this Bill, this is not something like the IRC.  It is provided in section 4 (2) (b) (vi) that where failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally then Fóir Teoranta would carry out its operations.  I am glad to some extent that this is in the Bill because it is an open secret&mdash;there is no point in denying it though the practice has been to deny it&mdash;that an entity of 500 to 1,000 people working in one company is regarded as a social and political entity and efforts are made to keep such an entity operating, efforts far and beyond the efforts made to keep an entity of ten here, another entity of ten there and another entity of ten somewhere else viable. I have in mind the small joinerv factories in Navan in Deputy Tully's <Col N="156" /> constituency.  A much greater effort is made to preserve employment in large units.  This section seems to me now to say quite openly that if a large company gets into serious trouble it must be helped; even if it can be made viable for some years it must be helped and the employment potential must be preserved.</P>
      <P>It is not proper to give instances where this was done in the past, but there is one instance which can be given because it was so public and there was no denial or disagreement about it, namely the position of Erin Foods before they became Heinz Erin. The disagreement at that time between General Costello and the Government was that he said this particular company had to lose a large sum of money for approximately five to seven years before it became viable and showed a profit.  What happened was that halfway along the line everybody got cold feet and baled him out. That is an example of where help should be extended.</P>
      <P>This section indicates to me that, if a company employing 1,000 people is going to close, one is not going to be able to open the Industrial Development Authority report and see what grant is given to that company.  It would be quite clear to me, as a politician and businessman, that the grant given for the purpose of keeping a large number of people employed in a particular constituency is inordinate. If the same number of people were scattered in different companies in several constituencies they probably would not receive the same degree of help from the Minister and the local politicians.  I welcome this procedure but I would say that this should be done not only as a commercial operation but as a social operation as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My advisers were correct in saying that the word &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; is more appropriate than the word &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; because it means that this Bill will come into operation when the continuance of a company is in doubt because of inability to obtain its financial requirements from commercial sources.  There are very many good <Col N="157" /> companies which have nothing wrong with them at all except a lack of capital to make them viable and modern enough to compete in the vast market into which we are going to enter. As far as the ordinary banking institutions are concerned they are not a commercial risk but, with the claims made on banking institutions by the Government for its Capital Budget&mdash; and nobody is against building houses &mdash;the fact is that the commercial banks do not have enough money to go round.  Where it is clear that a company will not be able to continue because it cannot get an overdraft from a commercial bank, and where it is clear that it is not going to be a constant loser, then subsection (2) (b) (v) of section 4 is a good one.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (b) (iv) of section 4 reads:</P>
    <P>it has reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis, whether as for the time being constituted or after adaptation.</P>
    <P>The forecast from Government agencies such as the Industrial Development Authority is that we shall have double the number of redundancies we had last year.  One cannot go much further than to say that one can go in on a rescue operation when there are reasonable prospects of profitability.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (b) (iii) reads:</P>
    <P>the proportion of the promoters' contribution to its total capital is reasonable,</P>
    <P>I wonder what the definition of this will be?  I wonder whether the position of subsection (2) (b) (vi) which reads:</P>
    <P>its failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally.</P>
    <P>will have an effect on the decision of the board as to what would be a reasonable contribution as a proportion of the capital from the promoters?</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that this board will have a great deal of political pressure put upon it.  An extraordinary amount of pressure will be put on this board to save companies.  In section 5 we find who appoints the members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> Subsection (2) (b) (ii) reads:</P>
    <P>the employment and capital employed in it are significant,</P>
    <P>This means that large companies can look for succour but smaller ones cannot.  I cannot find anywhere in the Bill a rescue operation designed for the small company.  When the effects of the reduction of tariffs and duties in the EEC struck hard in Europe it was amazing how many of the small companies managed to survive, but there was also the sad fact that a number of them did not survive.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with this Bill in that it will only enter a rescue operation if the employment and capital of the company are significant.  I can think of many a small company employing 15 or 20 people who might go to the wall in free trade conditions because it did not have enough liquid capital.  In order to improve production and the quality of the product such a company might have had to use its liquid capital to buy expensive machinery and equipment.  No provision is made for the 15 or so people employed in such a company but those 15 people could be duplicated, triplicated and multiplied all over the country in small units until such time as their removal from employment might have a far more serious but far less spectacular and far less political effect than the effect of the closure of a large company.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) (b) (i) the words, &ldquo;(including any activity ancillary to industry)&rdquo; are included.  I can think of several companies where activities ancillary to the industry should be considered. I suppose the making of component parts would be considered an industry anyway and so no problems arise there.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the question of the holding of shares.  There are two sides to this question and the Minister will have to consider both. One is the change in banking policy over the last year with which I am not enamoured but I might be one of the unfortunates who would have to look for a few pounds from them and I do not know if what I am saying here now would help me.  I am not entirely enamoured of the suggestion <Col N="159" /> by banks that they would have considerable shareholding in Irish companies.</P>
    <P>I regard the banking institutions as institutions to provide a service with wisdom and I regard them as highly paid for that service.  For that reason, this company, which must get its money from somewhere, would be more acceptable to me if it did not go in to hold shares but rather held debentures.  After all, one of the things we have in this country is a high degree of honesty and integrity among chartered accountants and auditors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just said we hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  It is quite unusual to find a case where the certified accounts of a company are, in fact, incorrect unless the auditor was &ldquo;codded&rdquo; or imposed on.  I would prefer if this company did not interfere in the activities of industry but rather that the company would go in to take bulk debentures and make secured loans.  In relation to short term finance, including bill finance, this is a highly important matter.</P>
      <P>The market in discounted bills in this country, in relation to the amount of business done, is ridiculously small by British standards or any other standards.  It is common practice all over the world, as far as I know, that people use discounted bills.  The people who purchase goods very often pay for them by discounted bills, which are countersigned by the sellers.  They are usually three months or six months bills which give the purchaser a period of either three or six months to sell the goods and, having done so, to have the money to meet the bills when that arises in his bank.  The seller of the goods has pledged his faith in the purchaser by countersigning them so that when the bills arrive in the purchaser's bank, if there are no funds there to meet the amount, they will go, as ordinary cheques would go, back to the seller of the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good provision if this company is to provide any volume of bill finance.  I believe that it will further affect the trend that has been occurring <Col N="160" /> in the last year or so, particularly with the commercial banks which came into this country in that, if there are facilities available from this company, even though the rescue operation seems to be in all the time, it will encourage institutions that came from abroad to further extend their excellent facilities on discounted bills.  The provision on guarantees is a good one.  I may have made a disjointed contribution on section 4 but I felt that there were details in it which had to be dealt with in detail and there were things which had to be said.  I hope I have said them as clearly as I could.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring a couple of points to the Minister's notice which he might have an opportunity of clearing up for me.  The Bill has already been dubbed the SOS Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The SOS Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>May day has arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, May day has arrived for a lot of companies and the trouble about it is, as I said on the Second Reading, that companies have a habit of waiting until an SOS is the only thing which can rescue them because they have gone too far.  Does the Minister consider that companies which have already got into trouble before the passing of the Bill can be rescued? Will this Bill have the power to deal with companies that have already got into serious trouble and had to close down within the last few months?  I pointed out to the Minister, with regard to the point made by Deputy Donegan, the apparently contradictory statements in the Minister's brief where he referred in one place to the fact that there would have to be substantial investment and substantial employment and, in the second place, where he said that it was hoped to help smaller concerns.  I would like if the Minister could say what he considers a small concern because in small towns in rural areas this is a very important factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister say, when the Bill is passed, if the company will be able to assist a firm which has closed <Col N="161" /> down and if the workers in that firm feel that they can take over and make the factory work?  Can this Bill assist them if they can produce the necessary evidence to convince the company that they are in a position to make the factory viable again?</P>
    <P>We spoke about worker participation and all the rest of it.  I have in mind, particularly, instances where workers have received a considerable amount of redundancy pay.  They may either emigrate because there is no other employment in the area, have their fare paid from their redundancy fund, or club together the whole lot, invest the money in the factory and feel they can make a go of it.  If that is so will the company be in a position to assist them?</P>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday to the question of footwear and we are all very much under pressure from people who are employed in this industry to see if something can be done to help it.  I have an idea that the footwear industry is one which has been blacklisted by the Department who say that there is very little they can do for it. I would like if the Minister could clear that point for me.  If that is not so I would like if he would state so because this is very important to the people engaged in this industry.</P>
    <P>At the present time the furniture industry is coming under very heavy pressure.  Deputy Donegan referred to the small factories in Navan but big factories are also beginning to suffer. We had the case of a large factory in the town closing after a succession of small ones had closed down.  There are a number of other factories and if any more of them go the position will be very serious.  Could the Minister say whether or not anything can be done to try to prevent the import of cheap furniture from abroad, not necessarily from Common Market countries?</P>
    <P>In the clothing industry the exports of some of the factories are suffering badly because the British firms which formerly took clothing are now no longer taking it as they have made a deal with some of the east European countries.  They have gone in there, taken over a factory and, with the <Col N="162" /> State subsidising the production, they have been able to buy the finished article very much cheaper than it can be produced here.  Is the same thing happening with regard to the furniture industry?  Is the reason the furniture industry is getting knocked down here that countries are, in order to keep their exports, subsidising heavily the export of furniture to places which were within the Irish market and even into this country? I should like to know from the Minister if anything can be done to counterbalance that.  If other countries are doing it something must be done by this country to keep a traditional trade such as furniture-making alive. This Bill was necessary and it will do a good job.  I have not got the business experience of Deputy Donegan but this Bill can do things that the existing legislation cannot do and, for that reason, no matter what happens no harm can be done by having this Bill, provided it does the things we hope it will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of points raised by Deputy Donegan, some of which I dealt with on Second Stage and I do not propose to go into detail on these points again.  I should like to point out that the function of Mergers Limited is different from the function proposed here for Fóir Teoranta.  Mergers Limited are related to facilitating mergers in suitable cases and making provision for the necessary capital from the Industrial Credit Company.  The functions of Fóir Teoranta are in the nature of rescue operations, as I indicated earlier and as Deputy Donegan appreciates. I indicated also that Fóir Teoranta would be lenders of last resort.  This is because there is a provision in this section to the effect that &ldquo;its continuance is in doubt because of inability to obtain its financial requirements from commercial sources&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan spoke at some length about the growing practice of investment by banks in the equity of companies and in the placing of directors on the board of companies, thereby securing virtual control and forcing through mergers or rationalisation programmes that might appear <Col N="163" /> justified economically but would not be justified taking every relevant factor into account.  I would have sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Donegan in this regard but I am not aware of any such cases occurring, although the Deputy might have such knowledge. However, perhaps he is simply expressing a fear of what might happen rather than of what has happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a fear only regarding reports I have read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not our function on this occasion to discuss the role of the banks in that regard but I think the point Deputy Donegan was making was in regard to these fears about what the banks might do and he did not want Fóir Teoranta to do the same thing.  Perhaps I did not get the Deputy's point right but that is what he appeared to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer that Fóir Teoranta had a debenture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most of the problems associated with Fóir Teoranta and the definitions of powers, this presents a number of difficult problems on which there is a great deal to be said on both sides.  One must make a judgment on where to draw the line. On the point raised by Deputy Donegan, there is the danger to which he has referred but it is quite conceivable that an operation of the kind he envisaged could be the only way of securing the viability of two companies and without that operation perhaps both would go to the wall resulting in unemployment.  This is conceivable in certain circumstances.  The opposite is also conceivable and one must try to adopt a flexible approach and deal with each case on its merits.  This is what the board of Fóir Teoranta will have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be correct for us to preclude Fóir Teoranta from taking shares in companies.  I do not envisage they will do this to any great extent because their main activity will be in the field of concessionary loans. However, it is possible that in some cases which will reach them they will <Col N="164" /> find that the amount of borrowing already engaged in by the company is so high that further loans and debentures would make the gearing impossibly high, and the company could not hope to remunerate the borrowing because of existing commitments. In such a case the only way to make a feasible effort at reconstruction may be the taking of shares in the company.</P>
    <P>I visualise this happening in some cases&mdash;certainly not in all cases&mdash;but the most important thing to which we must have regard is to ensure that the legislation is sufficiently flexible to enable Fóir Teoranta to deal with the different cases that can arise.  We must depend on the board of Fóir Teoranta to make the appropriate decisions in each case.  They must approach each case on its merits.  It is not possible for us to lay down hard and fast rules that would cover all cases.  This was the difficulty I referred to earlier in regard to the drafting of section 4 in particular.</P>
    <P>There was a reference by Deputy Cooney to the question of the commercial philosophy behind this as being somewhat vague.  This may be partially true, and if it is it is for the reasons I have indicated, that one is trying to strike a balance between competing requirements, each of which has much to be said in its favour.  I made it clear, and it is made clear in this section, that it is not contemplated that assistance would be made available through Fóir Teoranta to firms that had no hope of viability in the future.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to qualify that to a minor extent, in that I can visualise that in certain circumstances of economic recession or excessive redundancies it could be justifiable to afford assistance to firms for a limited period. I say this with some degree of diffidence because I want to make it clear that this is not intended to be the refuge for all the dud cases in the country.  There must be a number of dud cases at any given time; there will be more during a recession, but there will always be some such cases because of the nature of private enterprise.  It is not intended to rescue every bad <Col N="165" /> case from all its faults or to get it out of all its difficulties.  We have tried in this section to spell out the circumstances in which assistance would be given.  I think we have succeeded in indicating fairly clearly the criteria which should apply, but not indicating them so clearly as to tie down the board in all circumstances.  I think we have done it as well as it can be done by indicating the principles but giving a sufficient degree of flexibility to Fóir Teoranta to enable them to deal with the kinds of cases that we can visualise coming up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised some questions about the furniture industry.  I am not in a position to answer some of them. He will appreciate that it is not directly concerned in this matter.  All I can say is that I know from my past experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce that that particular industry made very considerable efforts to adapt itself for free trade.  It started from a low base where it had quite a large number of small firms.  It had in many cases no design, bad management and so on, and it made a great effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Minister there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is true.  For instance, if the Deputy looks at the CIO Reports on it he will find that it had been virtually written off, but he will also find that the industry itself, or at least sections of it, got together and made a tremendous effort which to a great extent paid off.  The reasons for its difficulties may be as indicated by Deputy Tully; I am not sure offhand what they are and I cannot answer the question he asked about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister try to find out from his colleague if something can be done there, because the quantity of imports of Polish and Czechoslovakian furniture is absolutely ridiculous?  If you go into any of the big stores in the city you will find similar designs to those being made in Navan.  We had full employment in the furniture industry in Navan 15 years ago and we have not got anything like it now; we have factories closing down.  Therefore the management <Col N="166" /> and the workers must not have been too bad at that time.  There might be areas the Minister knows of but certainly not Navan.  It was a boom furniture town until the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue that, because I know it is not in order.  I know why Deputy Tully is raising it and he is quite justified because he is concerned about what is happening. He raised another question as to whether in cases where companies had closed down prior to the passing of this Bill, it would be possible for them to get assistance from Fóir Teoranta. It is certainly theoretically possible, but I would say that in practice it is extremely unlikely, because if they have already closed down the chances of reviving them are virtually nil. Usually the whole procedure has gone so far that it cannot be done, the work force is scattered and so on.  However, in circumstances where it is possible to do so there is nothing in this Bill to exclude such cases from assistance from Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. Would the Minister say if workers in the industry can&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I was coming to that.  I can recall one or two cases of the kind Deputy Tully has in mind where the workers concerned were certainly prepared to make a considerable effort to get the firm going again. Again, there is nothing whatever in this Bill which would prevent such a thing, and the same criteria would apply as are laid down in the section, in other words, reasonable prospects of viability, if there would be serious repercussions nationally or locally, and these other criteria.  If they are satisfied there is no reason on earth why such a proposition should not get assistance from Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say, in response to a question from Deputy Tully, that there is no basis whatever for thinking that the footwear industry has been blacklisted by the Department; he did not say it had been but he questioned whether or not it had been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA and the Industrial Credit Company have said the <Col N="167" /> footwear industry was not one which was entitled to grants or loans because of the conditions.  Maybe the Minister does not know this, but this is so. It is a pity, in view of all the people employed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the position is as indicated by the Deputy, I think he can take it that this is not a blanket position but rather applies where an individual approach is made to the IDA in a particular case for adaptation grants or something like that and it is not possible to show that the proposed allocation would make that firm viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact the firm on whose behalf I was making representations were in the fashion footwear industry and were able to get accommodation, but it was pointed out that the fashion footwear industry&mdash;they did not say it was &ldquo;blacklisted&rdquo; but I assumed from the suggestion made that it was &mdash;was not one that was worthy of grants or loans because it could not make a go of it.  This is the impression I got.  Maybe I misunderstood.</P>

      <P>I am in some difficulty. I can only surmise, because, as the Deputy appreciates, I am no longer dealing with the IDA.  The point was raised again which had been raised on the Second Stage about the small company as against the larger company. I want to make it quite clear that the small companies are not excluded from this.  In fact we visualise the bulk of applications to Fóir Teoranta will come from small and medium-size companies, and the wording of section 4 is designed to enable this to happen.  Certainly there is no question of excluding small or mediumsize companies because of their size.</P>

      <P>I cannot guarantee that the board of Fóir Teoranta will always take the same view as Deputy Tully, but the thinking behind the Bill and as set out in the debate in this House, which will be available to the board of Fóir Teoranta, is that the board have to interpret these criteria in relation to the particular case.  There is nothing in the Bill to suggest and there is no intention of laying down here that a small firm is ineligible for assistance.  Each case must be looked at on its merits.  I think I indicated on the Second Stage that I certainly could visualise relatively small firms being of very considerable significance in their own area and therefore being eligible for assistance.  I would expect the board to interpret that situation in relation to the location and the circumstances of the company. Deputy Tully might be interested to know that one footwear firm has received assistance from Taiscí Stáit which means they could come in under this Bill.</P>

      <P>On the question of footwear, it is true that the injection <Col N="169" /> of capital mentioned was for a fashion footwear firm and we hope it will be a successful operation in the matter of keeping employment there.  The firm had closed, not because of liquid capital trouble, but because of a decision of the main proprietor or, should I say, proprietress.  She was not too young, there had been a fire and she made a decision which put a few hundred people out of jobs.  A very large grant has been given for a new factory on the same site.  Through the agency of somebody I know in America, I have learned that the company are one of the best in America.  All their products will go to America.  That case has a relationship with what the Minister said in regard to firms closing and starting again. This firm had closed down and was reopened because of the colossal grant given.  I believe it was £1.3 million.  It is an indication of how things can turn even when there is little hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some general points on the section.  First, I would be critical of the whole Bill because of its provision in relation to the rescue operation being mounted in time.  The board cannot know if their services are required until they are called in by the company.  In other words, the early warning call must come from the company and I can see difficulties in ensuring that this will occur.  It is no answer to say &ldquo;You did not call our attention to it in time&rdquo;, if the company involved deserve and could use help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word will have to get out strongly through the Confederation of Irish Industries, through the chambers of commerce, through the auditors professional association that this service is there and that the whole point is that it must be availed of in time. It should be stressed that there is no question of loss of face, that when people see warning signs they should come in.  I would go so far as to think it might be made compulsory on the accountants of firms to warn Fóir Teoranta in time.  If the industry is one employing a certain amount of labour and if failure could have national and local repercussions, I think the requirements of professional secrecy would <Col N="170" /> have to take second place to the prospects of the disaster that might ensue because of failure to give early warning.  It will be an urgent matter for the board to devise a system of early warning because if the assistance is to be beneficial the earlier the warning is received the better.  This is a point which is essential to the success of the whole operation and I would put it even to the radical point of compelling information from auditors even against their clients' wishes.  I would go that far.</P>
    <P>The next point relates to how the new company will invest in the company needing assistance.  The Minister said that purely a loan might be hopeless from the point of view that it could not be remunerated and that equity might have to be taken up in the company.  I suggest we should see if the matter could not be taken a step further and that experts could be sent in, people who have expertise in, for instance, the science of management generally, if the problem in the company is one of management.  If the company have technical problems in regard to production there should be provision for Fóir Teoranta to send in such assistance.</P>
    <P>One often meets a situation in country towns where you have people with entrepreneurial instincts.  A person manages to get an operation mounted, perhaps on a shoestring&mdash;his machinery literally might be tied together with shoe laces.  His enthusiasm, and the enthusiasm of his workers, who probably would be neighbours, enable the industry to progress to a certain stage.  Then the question of expansion comes in and the need to purchase proper machinery.  At that stage, if the business becomes that more sophisticated, lack of management knowledge begins to prove fatal and the company find themselves in hot water.  They go to Fóir Teoranta but at that stage more than money is involved.</P>
    <P>My point is, whether Fóir Teoranta have the power to mount a proper rescue operation as distinct from the capital need.  If not, this Bill will not achieve what is intended.  Another point is in relation to who gets the assistance.  The Minister has said that <Col N="171" /> rescue can be arranged for all firms that are going down.  Some of them do not deserve it.  Again, who is to judge?  In the past the fault I found with Taiscí Stáit was that there was an inconsistent pattern of assistance. In some cases, if the industry was large enough and dramatic enough, I felt, perhaps wrongly, that the assistance came in the face of all commercial advice.  If the industry was not of such importance my personal experience was that the criteria applied were conservative and orthodox and completely unsuited for what was involved. It will be very important to decide here who judges the duds and what criteria will be applied.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the board should be made aware that an orthodox approach will be detrimental to the idea behind this Bill and that the simple commercial criteria of profitability will have to take second place to social criteria such as employment and other things which follow from it in a particular area.  Will the ICC be involved or will the board itself set up their own advisory service? What body will make a judgement and decide &ldquo;Yes, this firm has a hope and we will invest in it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty, or lack, in the objects of the company is that the memorandum, as indicated in section 4, deals only with companies which are actually in existence.  I can envisage a situation where a homemade company grew up and had faults and needed help but called for the help too late, so the company &ldquo;went to the wall&rdquo; but where, if the call for help had come earlier and if other difficulties in the way of giving help to management were not present, that company could have been saved.  A firm might be in a situation where it has to go into liquidation. There is nothing that I can see, unless I am reading section 4 wrongly, which would enable Fóir Teoranta to finance a revival of that company or of the company restructured in a different form with a different name.</P>
    <P>I am speaking about a company I know of in Athlone where Taiscí Stáit decided not to invest, or to impose <Col N="172" /> conditions which meant that the investment was not made.  The company have gone into liquidation, but a proposition to set up a smaller type operation in the same premises with careful controls has now been formulated, but the amount of capital that will be raised would be extremely difficult to find in any small town. There is no power that I can see in section 4, under the objects as suggested there, which would enable Fóir Teoranta to come into finance this new, small, restructured company.  It is essentially a rescue operation.  That would be a serious gap in the activities of Fóir Teoranta and I ask the Minister if some arrangement could be made to cover that gap.</P>
    <P>My last point refers to the time for the payment of interest by a firm borrowing from Fóir Teoranta.  This is something which will have to be left to the board of Fóir Teoranta to decide on in any particular case.  It could be a useful sanction in bringing a company back to commercial viability in a reasonable time to have strict repayment terms.  Because of the rescue nature of the operation, this is something that will have to be applied with a considerable degree of clemency.</P>
    <P>These are the points I wanted to make.  I would be particularly interested in a system being devised to compel companies, when they see the warning signs, to alert Fóir Teoranta. Fóir Teoranta should have power to invest in a company which has failed but which has been brought into being again under a different name with a slightly different structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole question of an early warning system is one which we examined in some detail in the discussion on the Second Stage.  At that time I indicated that I regarded this as a very important matter, as Deputy Cooney does.  One of the reasons for the setting up of this company was the experience which we had, with Taiscí Stáit, of urgent requests coming in for assistance at such a late stage that they could not possibly be assessed on any workmanlike basis and hurried decisions had to be made without proper <Col N="173" /> assessment and, therefore, with misgivings. Possibly some wrong decisions were made as a result.  One of the objects of setting up this company is to ensure, so far as we can, that this kind of operation will be dealt with in future on a much more orderly basis. I would regard it as one of the first and major duties of the board of this company to explore fully the practical possibility of an early warning system.  In another connection in another Department I had considered something on the lines of compulsory warnings by accountants as suggested by Deputy Cooney but, frankly, I do not think such a scheme would work or that we could enforce it.  There is some doubt as to whether it would be justifiable.  I am certain that such a plan would be strenuously resisted by accountants and, frankly.  I think they would be right. If I were to suggest something similar in relation to solicitors Deputy Cooney would appreciate that they might be right to resist such a proposal.  There would be a strong case for it but I do not think it would work.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on the Second Stage discussion, the main line of approach has to lie in an educational and propaganda policy as stated by Deputy Cooney.  This must relate not only to industry but also to accountants in particular.  It will be one of the first and major jobs of the board of Fóir Teoranta to devise, so far as possible, a system which will give early warning of difficulties.  Fóir Teoranta will have the power to bring in experts in regard to management, technical or other problems. They will have this power by virtue of the fact that they can impose such conditions before they agree to make assistance available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that. As I indicated before, the company will have to operate in the first instance, for a short time after it is set up, using the Industrial Credit Company as its management team.  They will then have to consider whether they should have their own staff or should use existing staffs.  This will be a matter <Col N="174" /> for judgement by the board.  At the moment this problem has come up with Taiscí Stáit on a number of occasions and they have insisted on not alone nominees on the boards of companies assisted in some cases but also on certain changes in management, accounting procedures and other things.  They have done this by calling in people either from the ICC or IDA or Córas Tráchtála.  There is a certain co-operation between the various State bodies in this regard and if a particular expertise is available in one and not in another it can be called upon and is called upon.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the board of Fóir Teoranta will have to consider whether the facilities available to them are sufficient for their purposes or whether they need to have these facilities within their own staff and under their direct control.  I should not like to anticipate here: I can see various <i>pros</i> and <i>cons.</i>  The board will have to decide this matter in the light of their own experience of operating the company.</P>
      <P>As regards the type of cases that will be assisted, the decision must be made by the board and by nobody else.  As to whether they can assist a company raised from the ashes, as suggested by Deputy Cooney, I understand they can and that the type of case visualised by Deputy Cooney would be an appropriate one in which Fóir Teoranta could give assistance.  I am not sure, although I have an idea, of the basis of the Deputy's doubts but the advice I have received is that it would be possible for Fóir Teoranta to assist, under section 4, the kind of case the Deputy mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I might make in relation to section 4 (2) (b) and the various paragraphs is that it seemed to envisage a company actually in existence.  The restructured company could, of course, be got under way before the old company go into liquidation and to that extent I suppose they could come in, but if the old company had actually gone into liquidation I do not know whether Fóir Teoranta could then come in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooney very wisely mentioned the question of the <i>entrepreneur</i> in small provincial towns who produced, possibly on a shoestring, a viable product which made money.  With the possible exception of people in Dublin we all know such persons.  I am sure the Minister does, since he was Minister for Industry and Commerce and had contact with such people who might not even have a company incorporated but probably would have a private company.  I am sure Deputy Cooney knows, and I know, cases where such a company was never incorporated and where valuable employment was given.  I am not certain that section 4&mdash;at a later stage I think the Minister must consider this&mdash;can in fact legally help such institutions.  There is also the situation where very small private companies with the sort of capital this company is meant to have, £100, are supported entirely by family properties or funds and the company were and are regarded by many of the employees and the proprietors as of little consequence; that it is the people who count. The inflexible approach by people who regard a company as something more related to the idea of a public company, is just &ldquo;not on&rdquo;.  I do not think this Bill can help Deputy Cooney's <i>entrepreneur</i> and I think the Deputy has demonstrated this in his references to section 4 (2) (b) and paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi).  He was wise in generalising and saying that this was a section under which this could not happen.  I think it cannot happen and that this is a pity.  One of the major questions on the Bill and one on which we must decide before the Bill goes through the House, is whether the Bill can help small companies, small businesses. It is clear that the Bill excludes, and must exclude, small retailers who have got into trouble and for whom we are all very sorry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but that is another day's work.  Under this Bill, the small company or the company who are only a nominal company with family capital or, more usually, family <Col N="176" /> security behind them, cannot be helped.  I could recall 50 different cases of which I know over my 16 years here where in fact employment is given by people and where the creation of a company merely had something to do with the giving of a debenture to a bank while in reality the property owned by the proprietors plus the employees' efforts kept the company going.  To take a completely fictitious person it does not matter if Mr. Joseph P. Dowling of Ballyhaunis is running a business employing 50 people or 20 people.  It does not matter because the probability is that Mr. Dowling has had to put into the bank the deeds of his farm outside the town, his house and his property somewhere else.  As a result of this 20, 30 or 40 people are employed and the small company involved were probably incorporated by a local solicitor.  This has no relation to the real fact that the proprietor has pledged his all and was making money and that at this stage he is in trouble because, with the advent of free trade, his product must have a different shape or form and must be saleable abroad because the home market will be taken from him.  This Bill does nothing for him.</P>
      <P>On the question of compulsory warnings by auditors and accountants I shall say something dreadful in the presence of one practising solicitor and the Minister and the other Members present: I think that is unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to bet £5 that I am right.  In a private enterprise economy there must be the situation whereby a person who intends continuing will do so on his own opinion and if there are shareholders in a private company, or if there are <Col N="177" /> directors elected by shareholders, either by proxy or by ordinary vote, what happens is that the majority rules. If one were to take the power of the worker as against the power of the proprietor, the matter would have to be considered in relation to the constitutional situation but it seems clear to me that there could not be a compulsory warning system.  A man and his wife in, say, Ballyhaunis might be considering whether they should continue with their small company which was not doing very well or which had liquid capital problems.  In their consideration, they would have to take into account their family and their workers and then decide what they should do. That course would be defended by our Constitution.  It would not be possible to have a situation whereby they could consult their accountant, their solicitor or anybody else who would tell them that they must discontinue.  That particular proprietor might have knowledge which he did not wish to disclose. Under the Companies Act, 1965, there are some matters which must be disclosed but there are others which need not be disclosed, for instance, personal funds.  If a proprietor of a company decided for any reason that he should continue to employ people at a loss for the coming three years, that is his right and that is why I say that a compulsory warning system would be unconstitutional.</P>

In fact, I have been adverting to it myself, that is, that the present tense is used in (b) of (2) of this section.

That does not relate to whether a company is large or small.  Regarding Deputy Donegan's suggestion, the reason for the particular wording, &ldquo;the employment and capital employed in it are significant&rdquo;, is to ensure that every little tuppenny-halfpenny business will not be brought in, but the last paragraph regarding &ldquo;serious repercussions either nationally or locally&rdquo; will allow in the kind of cases the Deputies have in mind.

      <P>I do not like the word &ldquo;significant&rdquo; in this context. Regarding paragraph (vi), if one were to look for serious repercussions in my local area, for instance, he would have to seek a definition of &ldquo;serious repercussions&rdquo;. Four miles from me there are 1,200 people employed by GEC and four miles in the other direction there are 6,000 or 7,000 industrial workers employed in Drogheda. Therefore, serious repercussions in the context of that particular area would probably be defined by a lawyer as involving 200 or 300 people, but I would be concerned about even ten people who would lose their jobs anywhere within 20 miles of my area. Indeed, I would be interested in ten people who might lose their jobs in any area.  I am not satisfied that the wording of this paragraph is correct. If ten people were to lose their jobs, the repercussions for them would be serious but in terms of the words &ldquo;nationally or locally&rdquo; there would be no repercussions.  Local traders would hardly object because of the decrease in their business and neither would the other factors be involved. Rates would continue to be paid but ten people would take the emigrant ship.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Second Stage I instanced the case of ten people employed which could certainly come within this.  It depends on the circumstances. I would repeat that if you can visualise loosening-up so much that a one-man business which is in trouble and that a number of one-man businesses <Col N="180" /> in trouble could come in under this, this is not what this Bill is about and it is not what this House should be doing.  We have to draw the line and one must exercise one's judgement as to where to draw the line.  A great deal of thought has gone into the wording of this section.  I believe it draws the line where it should be drawn and at the same time leaves sufficient flexibility to the board of Fóir Teoranta to deal with the kind of cases that I think, from the discussion, Deputies on all sides want to see covered.  I could not agree to opening it up so that there would be virtually no criteria at all in regard to significance or importance locally or nationally.</P>

      <P>If I were sitting on the board of Fóir Teoranta and, if I had to make a decision as to whether or not 25 people in my area would create serious repercussions nationally or locally, and if I were very busy on that board and if I were not a politician whose interest is primarily in people, I believe my decision would be that it would not have serious repercussions either nationally or locally. Therefore I would say: &ldquo;Let the little factory with 25 people close.&rdquo;  I do not know whether Deputy Tully would like to put himself in the same position?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 3, lines 23 and 24, to delete paragraph (d) and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) that the auditor of the Company shall be the Comptroller and Auditor General&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>We are all aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General is the constitutional official and he is completely independent in his operations. He is one of the important constitutional checks on the behaviour of the Executive and to a lesser extent the legislature.  The whole point of the creation of that post is that State moneys would be audited by his office and by nobody else.  Consequently, I am moving this amendment to provide that the very substantial finances which are to be handled by this proposed company will be scrutinised by the Comptroller and Auditor General and not by a firm of commercial accountants. There is no criticism implied of the standards of commercial accountants. The standards are of the highest. Nevertheless, it is State money that is involved and the State Auditor is the only person who should deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice has been growing in recent years for some semi-State bodies to have their accounts audited by commercial accountants.  I have no doubt these have worked out satisfactorily but it is an unfortunate trend, in my opinion, and I would not like to see it carried on into the activities of this company.  There might be some justification for the cases in which this <Col N="182" /> happened in that the semi-State bodies concerned are trading enterprises and are in direct commercial competition with private firms from overseas or nationally.  This particular company is set up to perform a State function and a function that can only be carried out by the State and is not in any way a commercial or trading enterprise.  To that extent it is not comparable with the companies which have already got commercial accountants.</P>
    <P>The amount of money which it will handle will be extremely large.  Its borrowings can go to £7½ million under the Minister's proposed estimate and it will be taking over I do not know how many million pounds from Taiscí Stáit.  The volume of taxpayers' money directly got from the Exchequer will be extremely large.  This reinforces my argument that it is the taxpayers' watch-dog, the Comptroller and Auditor General, who should do the books of this company.</P>
    <P>Another point which reinforces my amendment is the nature of the investment of Fóir Teoranta in companies up and down the country.  There is no doubt that some of these investments will be the result of pressures.  There is nothing wrong with political pressure, nothing wrong with pressure coming from a town to save an industry in that town, but some of these investments will be as a result of pressures and some of them will fail.  That is unavoidable and something we must face up to at this stage.  If investments are to be triggered by pressure and some of them are to fail, it is extremely important that the finance involved in those investments should be under the scrutiny of nobody but the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would urge this amendment strongly on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  It is probably the most important amendment that could be put down on this Bill. We are dealing with very large sums. Why did we decide that the Comptroller and Auditor General would not be the man to scrutinise this company? Why did we decide that it would be a firm of commercial accountants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's intentions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing provision in the Bill is that no person shall be nominated as auditor of Fóir Teoranta without the approval of the Minister for Finance.  That leaves it open to be either the Comptroller and Auditor General or a private auditor.  Deputy Cooney's amendment is designed to ensure that it can only be the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The general practice in legislation relating to commercial State-sponsored companies is to leave this question open as we are proposing to do here.  In the case of non-commercial State-sponsored companies, that is where they are engaged in promotion or research or regulatory of some aspect of the economy, it is usual to name the Comptroller and Auditor General in the Bill as the auditor.  Fóir Teoranta will be a commercial State-sponsored body, and at the outset and for some time to come all funds becoming available to it will come from the Exchequer.  It is intended that the Comptroller and Auditor General will act as auditor of this company.  In the Taiscí Stáit Act of 1963, and Taiscí Stáit is largely being replaced by Fóir Teoranta, the same provision was in, that is, that the appointment of auditor shall be subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General acts as auditor to Taiscí Stáit. As I have said, it is intended that the Comptroller and Auditor General will act as auditor in this case also for the reason that I mentioned, that certainly for quite some time to come, all of the money available to this company will be coming from the Exchequer.  Nevertheless, <Col N="184" /> there is something to be said for preserving some degree of flexibility in this.  There could be circumstances &mdash;it is unlikely&mdash;where there would be, say, such pressure on the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General that they could not cope with the audit.</P>
    <P>There should be some flexibility in dealing with that kind of situation but the practice in relation to commercial State sponsored bodies, the practice in relation to Taiscí Stáit and the intention in relation to Fóir Teoranta, all add up to the Comptroller and Auditor general doing this.  All I want to do is to preserve some degree of flexibility for some time in the future for a contingency that may arise.  The intention is to have the Comptroller and Auditor General but, in order to preserve that degree of flexibility, I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister says in relation to all the money coming from the Exchequer.  I have seen situations in which the idea of money being borrowed from abroad would have been frowned upon by this House as something almost sacreligious. Then in the last three to five years there have been constant borrowings from abroad.  Now you have State companies highly involved in work in relation to our advent to the European Economic Community.  You have a State company that is going to spend a lot of money.  The Minister has his Capital Budget to look after. He can do it in two ways.  He can borrow from abroad that which he cannot borrow at home and can lend to this company; or it might suit him, on the basis of the amount of money his Capital Budget requires, to borrow separately either abroad or at home, from, presumably, the commercial banks or any other agency, moneys for this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not imply at all that the Minister is guilty of an untruth when he says it is unlikely that there will be any borrowing except from the Exchequer, that there will be any sums provided except from the Exchequer, but the Minister will accept that in his office he may have the responsibility of making a decision tomorrow that <Col N="185" /> may change a decision made a fortnight ago.  He would be a very stupid man who would say that a decision made a fortnight ago is right for ever.</P>
    <P>There might be borrowing.  That is the first thing I want to say.  The Minister has said it is unlikely that there will be borrowing except from the Exchequer. That is merely an opinion. There might be borrowing from outside sources and I should like to see the Comptroller and Auditor General as the signatory to the accounts at the end of the year.  The Minister might reconsider his decision not to accept Deputy Cooney's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I did not quite get the Deputy's point.  What is the significance of borrowing, or borrowing abroad, in relation to the certificate of the auditor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the significance about it that when you provide money from the Exchequer you provide it in a certain way.  It could be in one of 20 ways.  You could provide it at certain interest rates.  You could provide it at certain repayment rates.  On the other hand, you might decide that a finance agency abroad or at home might provide £3 million or £5 million for this company.  In those circumstances, I would prefer that the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General would be available rather than the comments of a commercial auditor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that I did not want to say but will say now because the Minister came back is that firms of commercial auditors and accountants have an undesirable situation facing them, that is, that funds will be given from this company to companies in this country and they could not act if they were at the same time the auditors of those companies.  It does restrict choice. There is also the fact that firms of auditors, just like ordinary firms in private enterprise, are very often closely associated one with the other.  I would prefer, and Deputy Cooney in putting down his amendment preferred, that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be the person who would sign the accounts and make the comments on the accounts.  It might be valid to make comments on the question of <Col N="186" /> whether or not the moneys provided should have been provided from the Exchequer or should have been borrowed from an external agency.  I would prefer that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be the person to make that comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the Bill does provide for borrowing powers for Fóir Teoranta, but it does not provide powers for borrowing abroad and I would ask the House: who would lend money to Fóir Teoranta except the Exchequer?  It is just not on.  Nobody would lend us money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It gets back to what I said: this company would get no money except from the Exchequer or with the guarantee of the Exchequer. In practice, nobody will give it money otherwise.  I have indicated that it is intended that the Comptroller and Auditor General will be the auditor of this company.  So, the only thing that is between us is the degree of flexibility which might arise at some time in the future, that by legislation we do not absolutely confine the auditorship of this company to the Comptroller and Auditor General. That is the only thing that is between us.  It may never arise.  If it should arise, the kinds of considerations mentioned by Deputy Donegan would have to be borne in mind at the time. Let us be clear that that is all we are disputing because, in fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General is going to be the auditor of this company at the beginning and, I would guess, for a very considerable time.  As of now I cannot visualise a change but such change could occur at some time because of circumstances which would not relate at all to the kinds of things that Deputy Donegan had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that we ought not to tie down either the company or some future Minister for Finance so that they cannot deal with the kind of situation that could arise.  But, it would <Col N="187" /> seem to me that if there were a change, say, from the Comptroller and Auditor General to a private auditor, whenever that would occur there would almost certainly be a question in the House and an explanation would have to be furnished as to why the change was made.  I do not think we ought to rule out the flexibility. We may be covering a possibility which will never arise but I do not think we ought to rule out the flexibility that is implied in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very serious issue involved here.  The Minister has told us&mdash;I know that what he said is true because I have read the Bill&mdash;this company can borrow from anywhere.  Now, if it is a rescue operation, we know that no one will lend it money unless that borrowing is underwritten by the Department of Finance and, if it is underwritten, borrowing will be freely available because it will be then a gilt edged investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is the Exchequer which would borrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a gilt edged investment guaranteed by the Exchequer.  Deputy Crowley might consider, perhaps, the terms on which such a loan would be granted.  It could be granted on more advantageous terms than, say, a National Loan floated on the same day.  It could be extended by agents here who would be the same source as outside agencies lending money.  Money borrowed in Holland, in America&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The best excuse the Minister has given so far for not accepting Deputy Cooney's amendment was a question asked in this House and an explanation.  Question Time may fill the newspapers, but it is not the serious business of this House and never has been.  It is at times invaluable, but it is not the <Col N="188" /> serious business of the House.  Deputy Cooney adverted to what is the serious business of the House, namely, enacting legislation as a result of discussion and debate here and it is conceivable that a Minister for Finance, who wanted to have a capital budget, could borrow from agencies within this State, agencies with commercial companies within the State; that would be the very same source as outside borrowing, which the Minister would do strictly for the Exchequer and, having done that, the position would be that a commercial auditor or firm of accountants, which had been appointed as accountants for the particular company, could find themselves in the position of being tempted. This would be a temptation for them. I have said they have been extremely good in this country all along the line and everybody knows they have.  However, if two or three more State companies were coming up they might, perhaps, become the firm of accountants for these companies too but an adverse comment on the borrowing might, in fact, inhibit the Minister himself from giving them the job in another State company.  I do not want to be difficult about this, but everyone knows in relation to certain companies aligned to the State&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;aligned&rdquo; deliberately&mdash; there have been appointments of firms of commercial auditors with political allegiance to and support for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, Deputy Cooney has made a most valuable contribution in putting down this amendment.  It should be the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If money were borrowed at a higher rate of interest than it should have been borrowed at, or at disadvantageous terms of repayment, just as the auditor of a private company should put a note on the accounts adverting to that, then likewise a similar note should appear on these accounts.  It is not fair to the firm of commercial auditors that they should have to balance against their desire to put such a note on the accounts with regard to bad borrowing the fact that they may not get a further appointment from a Minister for State.  From <Col N="189" /> that point of view Deputy Cooney's amendment is most valuable.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is the person who should sign the accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it difficult to follow Deputy Donegan's argument but I think I got the point in the end. I am not aware of any case in which it has been alleged that borrowing has been undertaken by a State company on terms unnecessarily high or on disadvantageous repayment terms.  There may be such, but I am not aware of it. The argument seems to me to be a very theoretical one in justification of this amendment.  What Deputy Donegan is saying, in effect, is that there should never be any auditor of a State company other than the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That seems to be the logic of what he says because his argument could apply in any case in which there is borrowing power.</P>

      <P>Everyone knows there have been appointments of auditors to companies aligned to the State&mdash;I use &ldquo;aligned&rdquo; deliberately&mdash; and in one case it was even closer than alignment.  In the case of a company calling for a rescue operation I do not think any firm of auditors should be asked to sign the accounts and make the proper comments upon them. Where such a company will receive some hundreds of thousands of pounds it should be the Comptroller and Auditor General who should sign the accounts and comment on them.  That should be written into this Bill.  What is important in this House is not the <Col N="190" /> questions asked and the answers given to them but the legislation we enact here.</P>

If he looks back over the records he will find that when I was a backbencher I put down a question about the auditors of a particular State company because the peculiar situation had developed in which both the Comptroller and Auditor General and a private firm were signing the accounts.  The result of that question was to bring about a change in that situation.  It also brought up what I mentioned here earlier, the general approach as to how auditors of State-sponsored companies should be appointed and the distinction between commercial and non-commercial accounts.</P>

      <P>The only reason the Minister has given for not accepting the amendment is that he wants to preserve flexibility.  The only reason he has given as to why he might want flexibility is that at a future date the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General might be over-stretched.  With respect this is begging the question and should that situation arise the staff should be expanded.  If the principle of engaging and using this particular office is a good one it should be enshrined in the Bill.  The Minister has indicated he is very firm on this and, if I can take what he has said as an assurance that so long as the borrowing is underwritten by the Exchequer the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be employed, then, I shall be satisfied.</P>

Under this arrangement that cannot be done <Col N="192" /> and the Minister is the one who is responsible to the House.  As long as this provision is here any changes made mean that the Minister is responsible to the House for them.  If we did not have this provision the Minister would not be responsible to the House and would not, at the same time, control what was happening in the company.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 15 to 19, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(b) the aggregate at any one time of the borrowings (including borrowings from the Minister and borrowing for any of the purposes of the Company which are consequent upon section 19 of this Act, but excluding borrowing by Taiscí Stáit Teoranta) which have not been repaid shall not exceed £7,500,000. </P>
      <P>I referred to this amendment when introducing the Second Stage.  It is designed to increase the borrowing that was proposed from £3 million to £7½ million.  As I explained to the House before, this is partially to meet outstanding borrowings of Taiscí Stáit including commitments outstanding at approximately £1.3 million.  The actual ceiling on the money which Fóir Teoranta may borrow for its own purposes is just over £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was raised by Deputy Tully on the Second Stage as to whether or not that figure should be higher.  My own feeling is that, even though the higher rate of rescue operation at the moment could mean coming back to the House again in about two years time, nevertheless, since this is a new company we ought not to put the limit any higher.  If, in fact, £6 million is utilised in two years time that means the company has been operating at a <Col N="193" /> substantial rate and it would be desirable for the House to review its operations. I explained in more detail on the other Stage the reason for the increase. I am dealing now with the suggestion made on the Second Stage that the figure ought to be higher still.  In my view it is wiser not to raise it so as to give the House an opportunity of reviewing the operation of the company within reasonable time.  If this money is exhausted sooner than would normally be anticipated that is all the more reason for the House to have an opportunity of reviewing the operation of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, but there is another point which is not clear.  The amendment makes it clear that anything which is brought over by section 19 must be within the limit of £7½ million. <Col N="194" /> I am puzzled by the wording in the amendment, &ldquo;but excluding borrowings by Taiscí Stáit Teoranta&rdquo; because what else is in section 19 other than borrowings by Taiscí Stáit?  Is this to include the interval between now and the winding up of Taiscí Stáit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that Taiscí Stáit Teoranta have certain limits on their borrowings and they are what are intended to be referred to when we talk here about excluding borrowing by Taiscí Stáit Teoranta.  In fact, they have exceeded their limits by the £1.3 million which I mentioned. The intention is that that £1.3 million, plus whatever borrowings would take place by Fóir Teoranta, would have an upward limit of £7½ million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the reason for this is that, officially, the only borrowing which can be done by Taiscí Stáit is up to the limit; that the £1.3 million does not formally constitute borrowings by them because they have not power to do it.  That would probably be the explanation for it.</P>

      <P>All I wish to say is that this seems to be a global exclusion of all members of the Oireachtas from all boards.  I have felt for years that this may be a mistake.  It is true that a member of the Oireachtas is probably a member of a political party and, for that reason, if he is a member of a board, he is in a very invidious position because he may have to take a line, politically, or he may have to discuss within his political party certain matters pertaining to his membership of that board or company.  At the same time the American idea would be entirely different, which is that it is well known when a person speaks exactly where he gets his information from.  As far as our party are concerned we agree with this section but this is something which might be looked at in relation to this company and all the other companies for a while back which have had this particular exclusion of members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many members of the Oireachtas who would grace many boards.  There are members of the Labour Party, of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the Fine Gael Party who <Col N="197" /> could provide very valuable assistance to boards.  The idea here is that if you are a public figure you are excluded from being a member of one of those boards.  The American idea is that you take your place on one of those boards, you do your work, and you come out and say precisely what you feel you should say and you are open to criticism on that basis.  I go for the American idea but we in this country go for the other idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposing this section but we would like to say that it appears as if we are going overboard to try to prove that politicians, instead of being leaders of a community, are in fact people who should be avoided and should not be trusted in certain circumstances.  We have it all over the place.  We have the local schools which cannot be used for meetings of a political party but they can be used for anything at all under the sun.  You have the new Industrial Development Authority which cannot have politicians.  The present one is being held up because of the fact that Congress have put forward a Senator who is a trade union leader and cannot be appointed.  This matter needs another look.  If this House deprives politicians in the way in which the Government are doing it at the present time we can hardly complain if other people tend to join the chorus and say &ldquo;us too&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not think this section is decrying politicians.  I agree entirely with Deputy Donegan that there are members on different sides of this House who could be of considerable advantage and make considerable contributions on many boards of companies, be they State companies or otherwise.  I do not think that is the point at issue.  The point at issue is whether the public interest is seen to be served by such appointments.  A good deal of thought has gone into this and the result has been that a provision, such as the one we have in section 18, has been included in all the more recent legislation dealing with the setting up of State-sponsored bodies.  There is a good deal to be said for the American viewpoint to which <Col N="198" /> Deputy Donegan referred, but it implies a willingness on the part of the politicians concerned to declare their interest.  It may be that one of the difficulties about our present system is that politicians frequently make speeches without declaring their interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were more in clined as politicians to declare an interest when we have it the position might be more satisfactory.  All I want to say on this section is that it is following exactly the same line we have adopted in the more recent legislation dealing with State-sponsored bodies.  A good deal of thought and argument have gone into it; this is the conclusion we have come to, and this is what we are applying to each State-sponsored company as the legislation comes up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the declaration of interest as an important matter. I have been in this House for 16 years and whenever I had an interest in any matter I declared it.  Membership of boards of this kind by Members of the Oireachtas would have to be very selective.  For instance, heads of political parties would need to be very careful of the people they allowed to be members of such boards.  There might be occasions where people might be asked by a Minister to go on the board of a company and they might be there as mischief-makers.  At the same time, it is true that the presence of Members of the Oireachtas could be of great value and in the rescue of any company the unanimous support of all sides of this House could be of help.  It could mean the end of further criticisms here of decisions made if the matter was unanimously decided in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The important part of the Taiscí Stáit Teoranta Act was <Col N="199" /> that any sum expended in excess of £250,000 was a Cabinet decision.  A classic example of a Cabinet decision in this regard was the sum of £940,000 paid to Potez Limited.  This Bill we are discussing is changing this and it is appointing under section 5 a board of up to seven people all appointed by the Minister.  Section 4 (2) (b) (vi) provides that &ldquo;its failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally&rdquo; and this is the reason for the extension of a loan, the taking of shares or the injection of capital.</P>
      <P>Taiscí Stáit Teoranta have done some very worthwhile things; they have also done some bad things.  In the debate on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce recently I mentioned some good work carried out by Taiscí Stáit.  The case I mentioned was where GEC of Britain had deliberately closed a factory in Dundalk&mdash;happily it is open again under another production.  Taiscí Stáit provided assistance in this case and through the aegis of Mr. Martin McCourt, managing director of GEC, and Taiscí Stáit we have got control of retail outlets in respect of production involving 1,200 workers.  Now we are not dependant on any cut-back plans by GEC.  The decision taken in this case was the correct one.  However, the decision taken by the Government with regard to Potez was disastrous.</P>
      <P>This Bill could be more all-enveloping; it could be a Bill that would not mean it will act as a kind of hinterland between the IDA, the ICC, Coras Tráchtála or any other Government agency.  It could be a Bill that could have a more direct relationship to the rescue operations envisaged in it.  It could be a Bill like the IRC Bill in Britain; this Bill was removed by the Tory Government to their subsequent regret and it may be re-instituted by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must impress on the Minister during the Report and Final Stages the necessity for a critical examination of this Bill and the necessity to produce an instrument that will defend <Col N="200" /> the jobs of our people as free trade approaches.  Taiscí Stáit could not have done that; there was need for a more all-enveloping Bill than the one now before the House.  However, the need for such a Bill has been partially filled by the Fóir Teoranta Bill, 1970. It is necessary that this House would consider this Bill in detail because our inevitable movement towards free trade makes it a necessity.  There is no doubt that we shall enter the Common Market.  Britain has made her decision and, having regard to the fact that 70 per cent of our trade is with that country, we have no option but to enter the EEC.  This Bill has deficiencies; it will be our duty to see that they are rectified and that we will have an instrument that will preserve the maximum number of jobs in existing industries.</P>
    <P>I have said before that there is more rejoicing at the sight of a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary opening a petrol filling station that might employ three or four people at minimum wages than there is in the protection of existing jobs.  This Bill deals with the protection of jobs and I welcome it. Let us decide in this House to accept what is put before us and to do our best to ensure that we have an instrument that will defend existing jobs in the inevitable situation of free trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable this country to take part in the current international programme to provide additional funds for the International Development Association.  The funds are required so that the Association may be able to continue and expand its work of promoting the economic development of the less developed countries.  The Government have agreed to contribute four million US dollars for the purpose, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association is a subsidiary of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&mdash;the World Bank. At present it has 107 member countries, including Ireland.  It was set up in 1960 to provide aid on easy terms. This is done by making interest-free or low interest loans repayable over periods up to 50 years.  Usually there is an initial grace period of ten years during which no repayments are required. The need for this type of organisation arose from the fact that many developing countries were finding it increasingly difficult to finance their development programmes by borrowing on normal market terms. Market borrowing was straining their credit-worthiness and was creating a serious debt-servicing problem for them, a problem which has tended to become more acute in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Association shares the same management and offices as the World Bank and much of its staff.  It works closely with the Bank in its operations. Many projects are financed by a combination of Bank and Association loans, the Bank funds being provided <Col N="202" /> on more conventional terms.  The overall effect is to reduce substantially the cost to the borrower.</P>
    <P>At an early stage the Association decided to concentrate its activities on developing countries whose <i>per capita</i> income did not exceed $300, about £120, a year.  From its inception in 1960 to June, 1971, it made available a total of $3,340 million.  This comprised 274 loans to 58 countries.  There has been a steady increase in operations, particularly since 1967 according as the Association has had access to greater financial resources.</P>
    <P>Loans are usually provided to finance specific projects and are normally intended to cover the foreign exchange costs involved.  Sometimes funds are given to assist a general development programme or reconstruction measures.  For example, a loan to assist reconstruction in Nigeria was made earlier this year.  Every project is carefully evaluated and the Association must be satisfied that it will contribute to the economic advancement of the country concerned. A large proportion of lending has been for agriculture purposes but transport and communications, irrigation, power supplies, education and technical assistance have also benefited.  An important feature of the Association's aid is that recipients are not tied to any particular suppliers for the purchase of machinery and equipment needed for their projects but can &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; to get the best value.</P>
    <P>The organisation depends largely on the 19 richer member countries for funds.  In 1960 when it was set up, those countries, which are known as Part I members, subscribed $751 million in convertible currencies.  The other members, called Part II members, comprising the less industrialised countries, like ourselves, and the developing countries, paid $265 million but only 10 per cent of this sum had to be paid in convertible form.  In 1964 the Association found it necessary to replenish its resources and the Part I members contributed a further $741 million.  A second replenishment in 1968 also provided by the Part I members, brought in a further $1,200 million.  Earlier this year agreement <Col N="203" /> was reached on a third replenishment to provide a total of $2,450 million over the next three years.  This replenishment has not yet become effective as the necessary procedures have not been completed by sufficient members.  It is hoped that the formalities will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been a Part II member of the Association since its inception in 1960.  Our initial subscription was $3.03 million.  Although the conditions required that only 10 per cent of this sum be paid in convertible currency, we paid the subscription in full in foreign exchange as an indication of our support for the Association's work. As a Part II member, we did not participate in the replenishments in 1964 or 1968.  On the present occasion, however, approaches were made by the association to the more advanced Part II members, including this country, asking that they share in the latest financing arrangements.  The demand for concessionary aid is almost insatiable, as more and more of the poorer countries find themselves unable to finance their development programmes by conventional means and meet rapidly rising burdens of debt repayment. &ldquo;Soft&rdquo; aid is one of the most important means at present of ensuring a real transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world. The Commission on International Development, set up by the World Bank under the chairmanship of Mr. Lester Pearson, former Prime Minister of Canada, in its report published in September, 1969, called for a massive increase in this type of aid.</P>
    <P>We are committed to increasing our development aid according as our economic circumstances improve.  The Government have decided, therefore, that it would be reasonable to increase our contribution to the International Development Association, subject to the passage of this Bill.  As already mentioned, the additional contribution proposed is $4 million.  I might mention that, Spain, Switzerland, New Zealand and Yugoslavia have also agreed to contribute.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to <Col N="204" /> authorise payment of our further contribution out of the Central Fund.  This is necessary because a firm arrangement must be made at the beginning to commit the sum in three annual instalments, so that the Association will have some assurance that funds will be available to enable it to meet its commitments to developing country borrowers. Actual disbursement may be spread over a longer period and will be a matter for agreement with the Association.</P>
    <P>It has been said that our aid effort is too small and that we are not keeping up with the efforts of other countries. The great bulk of the aid we provide is made available through international bodies, such as the various United Nations agencies, the World Bank and the International Development Association. This helps to ensure that it is applied to the best advantage of the recipient countries.  In the case of other countries a large part of the aid given is of a bilateral character, much of it between the major powers and their former colonial territories, and a high proportion is tied in one way or another to the purchase of goods, perhaps machinery and equipment, from the donor countries.  Thus, the donor countries may be doing little more than extending credits from which they will get valuable benefits in production and exports.</P>
    <P>Our case is quite different.  We do not benefit to any extent in trade and a definite sacrifice of resources is, therefore, involved.  It must be remembered, too, that we have to import capital in sizeable amount to finance our development programmes.  As long as this is so and as long as we have a serious balance of payments problem, our ability to provide capital for overseas countries must necessarily be limited. Nevertheless, the amount of our aid has been increasing.  It has grown from £673,000 in 1964-65 to £1¾ million in 1970-71 and the increase of $4 million now proposed will provide a further boost.  This is an earnest of the Government's wish to do our best by the Third World.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House that for many years we have been making significant contributions to the poorer <Col N="205" /> countries through the missionary effort which includes contributions in such fields as education, medicine and nursing. We have also made personnel available to international agencies for technical assistance missions and we provide educational and training facilities in our universities for students from the less developed countries as well as training facilities in the Army and other public services.  Taking all these contributions into account, our record is not, perhaps, so bad.</P>
    <P>In any case, I am sure that the Bill will find favour with the House as a further step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that our record in this field is not bad.  I welcome the Bill inasmuch as it means that Ireland's commitment to the undeveloped countries, comparable to our gross national product, is quite creditable when compared with the contributions of the US, Britain and the other very wealthy private enterprise economies.</P>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to say that we are doing this freely&mdash;I have no doubt the House will be unanimous about this Bill&mdash;at a time when there has been in the US a Bill which cuts off US aid to those developing countries by 23 billion dollars.  I understand the position there to be that the US President is using all his artifice to see how this can be changed because if the amount of aid that a country like America can provide for those developing countries were cut off it would mean privation such as has not been witnessed before.</P>
      <P>I make these statements not in criticism of America, which is a democracy and in which elected representatives have the right to make their contribution or not to make it and to vote in a certain way, but I find it most creditable that Ireland is providing such a contribution in relation to its GNP and its annual budget which is very fair towards the aid of those countries who need it so badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many features to this question of aid for undeveloped countries. When I attended an FAO congress some years ago the question arose <Col N="206" /> of a surplus of dried milk in Common Market countries and elsewhere and it was suggested that the amount of the surplus would provide protein for a very large number of children in countries where because of tsetse fly and other things the production of fresh milk is impossible.  The answer received at that congress was that it was not proper to provide something that is only a temporary alleviation, that the supply of protein to those people must be regulated <i>vis-à-vis</i> the supply they could themselves provide thereafter, something on the lines of the British ground nut scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not go with that.  There are many criticisms of our existing private enterprise economies.  I am a strong private enterprise man, having been named within my party as a person a bit towards the ring wing.  However, the main criticism is as I have stated it.  My other criticism would be the case not so many years ago of the grain ships lying around the coasts of America with surplus grain which would not be moved to areas where nutrition was at a level inhuman to behold.  The grain was not moved largely for financial reasons, because the movement of such volumes of grain might disturb the international grain market.  These things are inexcusable. The decision of the US Congress or Senate to refuse to provide 23 billion dollars aid was inexcusable.</P>
    <P>Turning to the last page of the Minister's speech we read that we do not benefit.  It is doubtful because of the privation existing in those developing countries if we will benefit in our lifetime by any aid we provide.  Perhaps our children will benefit.  However, there are aspects from which the big powers could benefit.  First, they have the production methods and the capital to send to those countries which have labour forces, and the sustenance and the health of those labour forces, physical and mental, could benefit those powers.  These are things the big powers might exploit with advantage to themselves.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the degree of aid to those countries is far too little and it opens up something that we in Ireland <Col N="207" /> abhor.  The peoples of those countries have not the nutrition or the education necessary to help them to provide normal living standards and there is the danger that this lack will instil into them what used to be described as atheistic communism.  They believe that it is wrong for anybody to have any property or any degree of comfort. Who is to blame them when the great nations of the world are not providing sufficient aid?</P>
    <P>I have no criticism to offer of this Bill except to say that notwithstanding our Capital Budget situation and our commitments on borrowing abroad, all I wish as a Christian is that the amount sought were greater and the amount paid were greater.  It is an irrefutable fact that if at this moment a United Nations force were required for the north-eastern part of this country it would be financially impossible to provide it, not because of any dereliction on our part or because we did not pay our subscription but because subscriptions were not paid by greater nations and these not the private enterprise or capitalist nations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope the programme for aid for deprived countries and people will become an international priority in the years to come.  It certainly has not been a national priority in past years and I am certain this has been a major factor in the unrest in the world today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the Bill but we do so with a sense of our collective inadequacy in this island in relation to the scale of this problem.  The Minister appears to be aware of this from the words which Deputy Donegan quoted: &ldquo;Our record is not, perhaps, so bad&rdquo;. It is not, perhaps, so bad compared with some other countries which have more and have done proportionately less.  But it is not very good.  Towards the end of his speech the Minister said the amount of our aid has increased from £673,000 in 1964-65 to £1,750,000 in 1970-71.  Perhaps the Minister or his advisors could quickly tell me what is the equivalent in today's currency of £673,000 in 1964 money.  I should be <Col N="208" /> glad of that information in his reply, so that we may see the extent of the real growth, if there has been a real growth in our aid contribution.  From what we all know about inflation and what every citizen has been forced to know about it, we must infer that the increase is not great but we should welcome the information since this is presented as an increase here.</P>
      <P>It is also a fact that even if our aid from this almost pathetically low level has grown a little in five years in absolute terms it has still decreased in relative terms because while we have been considering what little we can spare for this problem the problem grows every day of every year.  World population is doubling in less than every 30 years.  The imagination of people in better-off countries&mdash;and in a global sense we are slightly better-off than most or a lot better off&mdash;has not begun to take in what doubling of the world population in less than 30 years means, granting that enormous increase is taking place in the main in areas that are already desperately poor and that we are piling poor on poor &mdash;and by poor in a world sense we mean something we can hardly imagine in our European sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies, myself among them, this year visited one of the world's population disaster areas in the eastern part of India.  I refer to it as a disaster area because it was that even before the refugee problem arose, even before 10,000,000 people without any means of support were added to the poor of the area.  In the city of Calcutta approximately two million people are sleeping in the streets; you pick your way over them as you walk the streets and nobody any longer pays any attention to that.  It is accepted by people in the area as we ourselves are accepting it when we make token contributions of this kind of which the main effect I fear is to salve our own consciences.  I am not making a case against the Government: this applies generally; it affects the very low priority given by the people in the richer countries, of which we are one, to the plight of the poor ones and it is basically the same attitude to other people's problems <Col N="209" /> that we felt bitter about when other people applied it to our problems in the mid-19th century at the time of the famine.  People in other parts of the world are living and dying in conditions comparable to those of that time.</P>
    <P>The build-up of world population is producing strains among categories of people, tribes and communities, leading to war as in the Nigerian Civil War and as in the war which imminently threatens between India and Pakistan of which a main cause is the inflammation of local animosities and hatreds by the extreme scarcity of land and of rewarding jobs and the savagely bitter competition for these among groups of people.  All this is a world problem, of course, and it would be presumptuous and absurd for a little country like ours to claim any determining role in regard to these things: we cannot do it.  Furthermore, doubt has even been cast on the possibility at this stage of the advanced countries collectively preventing the movement towards disaster which is happening through the population explosion in the underdeveloped countries.  It may already be too late to avoid such disaster.</P>
    <P>In the light of the population problem, the urgency of curbing population growth through family planning becomes very real indeed and in terms of the human need and of the additional human need generated to disaster point, nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of family planning.  I would hope that Ireland will not now, as she has done in the past, stand in the way of international planning effort.  Ireland was among the countries which on what I would describe as ecclesiastical rather than religious grounds, did, in the past, hinder the making available in the poorer countries of methods of family planning.  I would regard that as an extremely immoral and wrong thing to do.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the missionary effort and said in a sentence that runs in sequence:</P>
    <P>This is an earnest of the Government's wish to do our best by the Third World.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> I need hardly remind the House that we have for many years been making significant contributions to the poorer countries through the missionary effort....</P>
    <P>By that juxtaposition the Minister appears to be claiming for his Government credit for the missionary effort.  That is a misleading juxtaposition because the people who deserve credit for the missionary effort are those in the churches and religious orders and those who sustain their effort by private contribution.  The effort has almost nothing to do with the Government and it has been Ireland's most serious contribution to aid in these areas.  That may seem to be in partial contradiction to what I said earlier about the necessity for family planning in these areas and the necessity of not standing in the way of such family planning but I think the contradiction is only apparent.  I have met many missionaries in this country and in various other parts of the world and I have never found them to be opposed seriously to the development of family planning in the areas whose immense near-disaster needs they know so well.  Recently I heard two nuns who had returned from India express their concern at the comparative failure of the Indian Government's family planning effort.  They were so impressed by the necessity for family planning that the Indian Government's comparative failure in this area seemed to them to be ominous because if, as these sisters were doing, one was finding himself at his wit's end to support the poor in a given village of 8,000 or so, knowing that before long that population would be about 12,000 and with no more jobs being provided, the reflection carries with it its own message.</P>
    <P>In West Africa, for example, the populations of the coastal cities are increasing by 10 per cent per year whereas the job increase is less than 1 per cent so that each of these cities becomes ringed year after year with another ring of starving or semi-starving jobless, unskilled, hopeless humanity with no outlet but crime.  In Nigeria they are trying to check the tremendous growth in crime by such <Col N="211" /> methods as public execution for theft. Such methods are doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>To ask what we can do in this situation is to ask a question which tends to reduce one to silence because of the scale of what we can do and the sense of the drop in the ocean about it all. The Minister must be concerned&mdash;his statement reflects some concern and an attempt to be more cheerful than is real &mdash;with the inadequacy of occasional arbitrary doles.  How much do we consider we can afford in this particular year?  How much are we being badgered by Lester Pearson or some other international personality who is a good salesman in this field?  Nobody can consider that to be a satisfactory way of proceeding.  It cannot be satisfactory for the Government.  The idea has been mooted of the fixing of contributions at a fixed percentage of national income so that those in need would have to contribute almost nothing and this would have the advantage of fair, even and steady gradation.  There would be no question of belt tightening at particular points for reasons other than objective ones.  I would ask whether the Government would support such a development at the UN and elsewhere, that is to say, the placing of aid to underdeveloped countries on a fixed percentage basis based on national income assessed by an international agency.  I do not think there is any other fair or proper way of doing this and I would ask the Minister to give us some indication when he is replying of whether he favours this or any similar method of putting aid on a less random basis not only for us but for the other countries with which we are associated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as proposed by the Minister. Without blowing our own biblical trumpet and without making protestations of our Christianity, the Bill can be seen as a proper, Christian and multilateral approach to aid to underprivileged countries.  I intend being very brief in my contribution but there is one comment I want to make and which I would consider to be the key to this Bill.  This is that the aid we <Col N="212" /> give has been criticised, not here but generally elsewhere, rather uninformedly, as being too little and that we are not keeping up with the efforts of other countries.  The Minister points out that the great bulk of the aid we provide is made available through international bodies such as the various United Nation agencies, the World Bank and the International Development Association.  Of course, this helps to ensure that the aid is used to the best possible advantage in the countries where it is needed most.  The point here is that in the case of other countries a large part of the aid contributed is contributed on a bilateral basis so that for whatever aid may be given by these countries to underdeveloped countries, they want to ensure that, to be rather crude and naked about it, they get a return for their investment.  Therefore, it is not aid in the sense of the aid given by us.  We give but we do not want any return.</P>
      <P>They give and they want a return on the aid they give.  These other donor countries, unlike ourselves, may be doing little more than extending credits from which they could get valuable benefits in production and exports.  Our case is different.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the aid in our case has grown from £693,000 in 1964-65 to £1¼ million in 1970-71. This is a further four million dollar boost to aid already given.  This is a fair indication of the Government's sincerity in regard to the third world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien mentioned that he was in Pakistan with a deputation. The other two members of that deputation were Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde of Fine Gael and Deputy Dr. Loughnane of the Fianna Fáil Party. We are not unaware of the hardship which exists on the Indian SubContinent. Deputy Loughnane made a very comprehensive report to me in my capacity as Chief Whip.  The report was welcomed.  It was a harrowing report and I should like to record my own appreciation of the courage of these men who went into the conditions and the circumstances of that area.  It was tough going.  It was a good thing that a deputation from this House went to India to examine conditions <Col N="213" /> at first hand.  I hope that in future deputations from this House will go in an all-party sense to other areas of the world where there is hardship, famine, war and so on.  Maybe the Minister for Finance, in his kindness, might consider the possibility of financing all-party deputations from time to time to have a look at areas of hardship.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my praise to the praise already expressed of our missionary effort.  The Minister said that this is a further contribution in terms of hard cash.  In terms of personnel we can hold our heads high because of the missionaries we have sent over the centuries and continue to send to the various countries in the third world.  Their contribution is by way of their physical presence in these areas and their ability in the sciences, in education, medicine and nursing. That is in addition to the contribution being made by Africa Concern and the Irish Red Cross through the International Red Cross and indeed through all the associated bodies under the aegis of United Nations.  These are other areas where we make a contribution. Whereas this might be the Government's financial contribution on behalf of the nation the people themselves are very quick to come forward where financial assistance is needed.  In addition to the Government giving money the people of Ireland give generously when they are asked to do so.  I welcome this Bill and I thank the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this Bill has been welcomed by all sides. There are just a few points I want to make in reply to what has been said, mainly to answer some questions that were asked.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the increase in world prices, our aid of £1¾ million for 1970-71 would be worth about £1¼ million at 1964-65 prices but this is a very rough calculation.  We have, therefore, about doubled our aid in real terms since 1964-65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of adopting a percentage of GNP as target, as far as we are concerned there is no objection <Col N="214" /> to adopting a percentage of GNP as a target for us or for other countries but we do say that any such arrangement will have to be tailored to the national circumstances of each country.  Indeed this target of 1 per cent of GNP which was for development aid and which was adopted by the United Nations in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development requires to be examined just a little further.  That 1 per cent has been refined in the Pearson Report to .7 per cent for official aid and the balance for private assistance, these targets to be reached by 1975, but it has been generally recognised that this 1 per cent international target did not necessarily apply to countries such as Ireland which are still in the process of development and which have to import capital for their own development. When the target of 1 per cent was being discussed a target of .2 per cent or.3 per cent was suggested for countries like us.</P>
    <P>The point has been made, but I think it is worth mentioning again, that there is a difference in kind between our aid effort and the bulk of aid effort of some of the major countries.  This has been underlined by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Our official aid is almost entirely multilateral and it is not tied to any trading arrangements with us. Therefore, it is the most valuable kind of aid that the developing countries can receive and conversely is of least value to us, there is the least self-interest for us involved in it.  This factor must be taken into account in assessing comparative figures of aid.</P>
    <P>I have some figures available, the latest for this purpose.  They relate to 1969 but I do not think the position is likely to have changed very much since then.  They show that our aid via multinational agencies, at .1 per cent of GNP, was well in line with the official multilateral aid of the EEC States and of the other applicant States for EEC membership.  These countries and also the other major aid donors, such as the United States and Canada, give the greater part of their aid directly to developing countries as bilateral aid.  It is important to note that we are pretty well in line as regards official multilateral <Col N="215" /> aid with the countries of the EEC and the applicant countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with the conditions for the grant of a negotiation licence. The concept of a negotiation licence was introduced into our law in the Trade Union Act of 1941.  That Act provides that a trade union is entitled to a negotiation licence if it maintains a certain sum of money on deposit with the High Court.  The minimum deposit required is £1,000.  The rules for the grant of a negotiation licence are, therefore, very simple and can be very easily met.  This Bill sets out to stiffen the conditions for the grant of future negotiation licences.  It will not in any way affect trade unions already holding negotiation licences.</P>
      <P>What is in this Bill had already been contained in the Trade Union Bill, 1966&mdash;a Bill which lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil in 1969. The Bill continues the provision that to get a negotiation licence the union must be registered in this country or be a trade union under the laws of another country.  It increases the minimum deposit to be maintained with the High Court from £1,000 to £5,000 and it adds two new conditions, namely, that the union must have 500 members in the State and it must wait 18 months from the time of fulfilling these two conditions before the licence can be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> It was felt in 1969, when the previous Trade Union Bill was circulated, that it was much too easy for small groups of people to break away from established trade unions and form rival trade unions of their own with all the status and influence that the law of the land and the conventions of the community give to a trade union holding a negotiation licence.  I share the belief, long accepted by employers and trade unions alike, that we have too many trade unions in this country. Over the year there have been talks and some efforts at reducing the number of unions through rationalisation or amalgamations, but little of significance along these lines has happened so far.  The tendency, if anything, has been the reverse way: there is still pressure from groups to break away from their fellow members in well-established trade unions and set up on their own.  This can happen from discontent with their union or dissatisfaction with the way that they feel that their existing trade unions are addressing themselves to the problems of the particular group of members.  If there are areas of discontent or dissatisfaction, I would hope that it would be possible, within the trade union movement, to solve the difficulty by some means short of the group breaking out and forming a new union.  Up to the present dissatisfied groups have been able to do this and sometimes have done it in a flash of annoyance. This Bill is designed to put a brake on that tendency.  At the same time the Bill recognises that, if a sufficiently large body of workers shows a sustained determination to form a new trade union, they must be facilitated by the grant of a negotiation licence.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not be an obstacle to existing trade unions with negotiation licences wishing to amalgamate, for it provides that in such a case the new conditions for the grant of a negotiation licence will not apply.  The new amalgamated union can be formed immediately and there is no waiting or cooling-off period required.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Deputies will agree that the restraints being proposed on the granting of negotiation licences are in the public interest. <Col N="218" /> There may be circumstances in which people will dispute that view and it is being provided, therefore, in the Bill that, if the Minister for Labour refuses to grant a negotiation licence on the ground that the applicant has not met the condition about minimum numbers or the waiting time, the applicant can appeal to the High Court for a declaration that, despite this, the granting of the negotiation licence would not be against the public interest.  If the High Court should so declare, the Minister for Labour must grant the licence.  This ought to be a sufficient safeguard against any danger of genuine applicants being denied a licence.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

The two main points in the Bill are the prevention of unofficial strikes by small groups and to prevent English groups with, say, 12 or 24 members here, causing a strike in this country.</P>
      <P>In the last Dáil Deputy James Dillon &mdash;and I in a smaller way&mdash;asked the then Minister would he not bring in legislation whereby there would be a curb put on English unions.  We were told no; it could not be done.  Now it is being done.  It should have been done a long time ago.  Our case was that a big company, say, a biscuit company in England, could be against a big business company in Ireland.  These companies will be in competition in the EEC and in the Free Trade Area.  A trade union in England with 20,000 to 30,000 members and with six members working in the Irish company could easily cause a strike to upset the industry here and let the English firm win.  I am not saying that it would happen but it could happen and there was no control over it here by the Irish trade union.  We proposed some such measure as this but we were told we were talking nonsense.  Now this Bill is being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this a very small stepping stone to improve industrial relations <Col N="219" /> and to reduce the incidence of unofficial strikes.  I would say&mdash;I am not sure&mdash; that this would have the backing of the trade unions.  It is clearly indicated to the unions that it is the smaller unions that have been causing unofficial strikes.  There is something in the region of 100 trade unions in the Twenty-six Counties and 128 approximately in the Thirty-two Counties.  We have had strikes caused by small unions and these strikes have resulted in hundreds of people being put out of employment, people belonging to much bigger unions.  The only way in which we will prevent small unions behaving in this fashion is by having an industrial union in each factory with one negotiator. That would be a step in the right direction, a tiny step but an important one.</P>
    <P>Much could be added to this Bill. When the Trade Union Bill was being passed I said more teeth should be given to congress so that it would have greater control.  To me, this is vitally important.  At the moment you have unions acting on their own.  They go with congress when it suits them and they go against congress also when it suits them.  Congress must get more teeth and greater control.</P>
    <P>The bigger the union the better.  The Minister said he hoped congress would set up some type of appeal court.  It should be remembered that the bigger the union the less likely it is the individual's voice will be heard.  He becomes just a number, unheard and forgotten about.  I do not blame the officials for this.  They are busy men. A court of appeal, presided over by a member of the judiciary, could serve a useful purpose because cases could be heard quickly.  At the moment it can take anything up to eight or nine months before a conclusion is reached. There should be machinery to ensure quick decisions.  The strike by the maintenance workers in Cadbury's resulted in over 1,000 workers losing their employment because of the 20 maintenance men going on strike.  The union involved is not a small union.  It is a big one.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bring in a consolidating measure and not just a succession of piecemeal legislation. <Col N="220" /> This will have to be done before we enter the EEC.  If it is not done we will be up against it.  I think the most appropriate figure would be 750 and not the 1,000 mentioned by the Minister. This would result in fewer unions and bring us nearer to the point at which we would have just five or six large unions.  Germany is not really a good example, but there they have nine or ten unions.  Where there is a dispute over wages, conditions, or anything else, there should be one industrial union and one negotiator.</P>
    <P>The subscription paid by trade unionists is very low.  Unions today need the assistance of experts and they cannot pay for this expert assistance unless subscriptions are adequate. Members should be able to afford an increase now.  Labour Party Deputies, when speaking about salaries, criticise employers.  Some three years ago on the BBC a man was interviewing a trade unionist who was in charge of 500,000 or 1,000,000 men.  When asked what salary he got he said £2,500.  Most of his men were earning double that.  Trade unions, as employers, should pay their own officials properly.  That will ensure that they will get the best men for the job.</P>
    <P>With regard to cutting down man-hours lost, six years ago the figure was 265,000 man-hours lost as a result of strikes.  It is now over 1,000,000.  The total number of man-hours lost last year was in the region of 4,000,000.  Of this figure 1,000,000 was due to strikes and 3,000,000 to sickness, absenteeism, accidents and so forth.  I do not think this Bill will cut down the 1,000,000 man-hours lost through strikes.  The only thing that will reduce that figure is one industrial union in control in the big companies.  The Minister should have a look at the other 3,000,000 man-hours lost.  This Bill will get rid of a number of small unions.  We seem to be under the impression it will do a great deal for the country, but other things such as employee-employer relations need to be rectified.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems is taxation. The personal allowance should be increased and overtime should not be taxed.  If a man living in a house for which he is paying a differential <Col N="221" /> rent works overtime not only is he taxed on the overtime but he will have to pay more rent as well.  If he is working at a job where the rush comes at the weekend he will do the overtime and earn some extra money but by the time he has paid extra tax, an increase in his rent and his expenses to and from work it is hardly worth his while and he asks himself &ldquo;What is the point of going to work?&rdquo;  So he will probably take a day off.  Any builder in the city will admit that there is 15 to 20 per cent absenteeism on Mondays.  If we want to get rid of absenteeism in industry the Government should have another look at the differential rent system and at our present tax system.  It can be argued: why should a man who works overtime get tax relief when somebody earning the same amount of money without doing overtime will not get that relief?  I am sure the Minister for Finance could find some way of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister and his predecessor promised that more safety-first inspectors would be appointed.  An additional one or two inspectors have been appointed in the past few years but many people are absent as a result of injuries received at work.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest causes of strikes is that employers do not bother to look at union demands for increased wages until the unions threaten to strike and then they rush to fix matters. A time limit should be laid down and if employers do not meet the union for a month and then they spend two months negotiating, whatever final increase is agreed upon should be made retrospective for three months.  At this stage it is not usually money that is involved but anger and temper on both the side of the union and of the employers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a drop in the ocean; it is doing nothing except ensuring that English trade unions do not interfere with Irish business.  Yesterday Deputy Desmond asked a question about industrial democracy.  The Minister would be well advised to pay attention to industrial democracy in decision making, particularly in relation to <Col N="222" /> semi-State bodies.  This Government have a habit of setting up commissions to look into the causes of strikes <i>et cetera.</i>  When these commissions report the Government take what recommendations they like from the report and ignore the remainder.  The Fogarty Report in relation to the ESB stated that employees should be involved in decision making, but the Government have done nothing about it whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The idea that a man is a mere number on the job was all very well in the middle ages but a worker now wants to be considered as a person who is taking an interest in his job. Unless a man is interested in his work his employer will not get the best out of him.  This also causes absenteeism. I know of a man who works for a firm which is very busy around Christmas time.  He had flu and he went to the doctor and asked him to do something for him.  The doctor said he would give him a certificate but the man said, &ldquo;I do not want a certificate, I want an injection so that I can get back to work&rdquo;.  This interest is sadly lacking all too often.</P>
    <P>This Bill is attempting to get rid of a few small unions; it is like trying to kill a giant by cutting off his big toe. While I accept the Bill I should like the Minister to tell us whether this is just one of the many pamphlets he is bringing out or whether he intends to bring in a consolidated trade union Bill later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the Trade Union Bill, 1971. We feel it is in the national interest that it should be introduced.  It will be of advantage to workers particularly trade union members and of course employers whether they be State sponsored employers or private employers.  It will make a positive contribution towards the emergence of a more effective and more rational system of industrial relations and as such we welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that not only will we see the Trade Union Bill, 1971, pass through this House but also during the lifetime of this very uncertain Dáil that <Col N="223" /> we shall see complementary legislation brought in to deal with the question of amalgamations.  I appreciate there is an understanding between the trade union movement and the Department that the Bill will be taken separately but it is essential that we look at this piecemeal legislation, as the Minister has so described it, as part of a better approach.  The current legislation dealing with amalgamations is bound up with the question of break-away unions and the question of fragmentation. There is a need for legislation relating to trade union amalgamation and I would appreciate some assurance from the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, it is not enough that in the public good we merely introduce this legislation to prevent flash break-aways in the trades union movement.  We should introduce more positive legislation on amalgamations to ensure that the current rigid statutory requirements are substantially mitigated.  In some cases precise voting arrangements have to be followed by trade unions in regard to amalgamations, precise majorities are needed and we have had instances of these difficulties in amalgamations in recent years.  The most notorious case in this regard was the attempt by the National Engineering Union to amalgamate with the Irish Engineering, Industrial and Electrical Trade Union. to form the new union as the National Engineering Electrical Trade Union. In that case there was major difficulty and it was considered that the current legislation was not developing and assisting the amalgamation and merging of trade unions.  Complementary legislation came into operation recently in Britain and I should like to see legislation introduced here to facilitate amalgamations.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to see trades union members fragmenting within the trade union movement.  When an attempt is made to amalgamate two unions and to fuse the two executives, legislation which would facilitate this and facilitate payment of some of the costs involved&mdash;particularly in relation to the full-time staff of the unions&mdash;would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> From a superficial reading of the Bill it appears two different scales of deposits will be in operation.  One cannot say much about this; it is a once-and-for-all operation with regard to the placing of deposits.  While I do not think that the operation of the two different scales of deposits will be a grave imposition on the trade union movement, in the interest of an orderly system one would be happier with one general scale but in this instance I am not advocating a levelling up.</P>
    <P>In the amalgamation of two or more authorised trade unions, each of which had been the holder of a negotiating licence before amalgamation, I gather subsection (1) of section 2 shall not apply.  I should like the Minister to state if the situation is more complicated if one of the unions have a negotiating licence and if the other organisation do not have such a licence.  I presume it is covered under section 2 but it is important to bear in mind that amalgamation can take place where only one of the parties have a negotiating licence.  I gather where such amalgamations take place they pay the old scale of deposit for the new licence.</P>
    <P>A matter I would raise with the Minister is that of exemptions being granted.  One could argue it would be self-defeating to have a Bill that would insist on new unions being obliged to take out negotiating licences and simultaneously to find that the Minister may be granting an increasing number of general exemptions.  This could create a difficult situation in the future and I would ask the Minister if he could give us some information about the extent of exemptions in recent years.  I am not entirely familiar with the current situation but I have an impression the Minister has been giving an increasing number of exemptions and this could be self-defeating from the point of view of a rational trade union movement.</P>
    <P>On the broad scope of the Bill, I support the public intent of this measure.  In 1970 there were 95 trades unions operating in the Republic with an aggregate membership of 386,000. Three or four years ago there was the same number of unions.  About 56 per <Col N="225" /> cent of the members are in the six general unions, approximately 216,000 people.  The six unions are: the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union; the Workers' Union of Ireland; the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union; the Federation of Rural Workers; the Marine Port and General Workers' Union; and the Irish Women Workers' Union. Those six unions claim more than half the membership and to that extent the position is better than one might think at first glance.  Nevertheless, there are some alarming indications. For example, there are some 23 different trade unions with fewer than 250 members; there are 11 unions with between 250-500 members; there are 15 unions with between 500-1,000 members.  One of the besetting problems that faced me as a trade union official was how to administer effectively many of the organisation and provide an efficient service to members, having regard to the large number of fragmented unions and the lack of official service for the membership of the unions.  About half of the total number of unions have less than 1,000 members.  If a large undertaking closes down or if there is a major technological change in an industry, and if a certain group are redundant, the future of the union concerned can be called into question.  The aggregate membership of 49 unions was only 17,000 people or approximately 4½ per cent of the total trade union membership in the Republic.</P>
    <P>It can be agreed, I think, that with 95 trade unions in the country we have more than enough.  This is not acting in any repressive sense but in the sense that the trade union movement has grown up over the past half century in a haphazard manner responding to the growth of industry and trade union organisation in different categories and inevitably has had a rather piecemeal development.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to bring about a more rational structure internally in the movement and to encourage and develop mergers, amalgamations and federations and more cohesive arrangements have not proved very successful. <Col N="226" /> It is the best part of ten years now since the Committee on Trade Union Organisation was set up.  Its terms of reference were to consider and report on the organisation of the Irish trade union movement, its structures and the relationship between unions and to make recommendations concerning future policy with reference to the improvement of the organisation of the movement, its structure and relationships between unions.  This has proved an extremely intractable problem which has caused a great deal of anxiety among the responsible persons involved.  We hope to see a growing number of amalgamations and general fusions.  A number of welcome amalgamations have occurred in recent years: the Union of Insurance Staffs for example amalgamated with the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs.  The pace of trade union amalgamation in Britain is far greater than here.  We had the Irish Union of Hairdressers joining with the Amalgamated Transport Union and now we have the NUVB joining with the Amalgamated Transport Union and we have the Draftsmen and Allied Technicians Association amalgamating with the Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers.  There have been some developments but for every amalgamation another new body seems to spring up.  Therefore, as the Minister says, the brakes&mdash;I hope constitutional brakes; I do not want to raise that here&mdash;which the Minister has put into this legislation are very welcome.</P>
    <P>Anybody with experience in the trade union movement would deplore the disruptive influence of break-away organisations within the movement generally.  There have not been so many.  This may come as a surprise to many people who are hypercritical of trade unions and whose ignorance, I suppose, and public comments on the movement tend to grow the farther they are away from the movement. Generally speaking, the trade union movement is reasonably effective, and highly responsive to the legitimate demands of its membership.  It is generally a responsible organisation and the incidence of break-aways has <Col N="227" /> not been very high.  The Congress of Trade Unions have made it clearly understood that there can never be any question of recognising or accepting into affiliation break-away organisations. That is general policy which is strongly supported by the Labour Party.  The formation of such organisations is generally unnecessary, generally disruptive and in the long term directly harmful to the interests of the workers concerned and most injurious to the overall solidarity of the movement.  The introduction of such organisations weakens that solidarity and trade union unity generally.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that there does not exist&mdash;it certainly does exist&mdash; within the trade union movement and within the democratic structure of the unions, machinery whereby membership can elect their own executive, determine their own policies, control their own organisations and run their own ballots in an effective manner generally free from undue interference by the State.  A great deal of machinery has been established to ensure that within Congress and the trade union movement generally this type of machinery is developed with ever-increasing sophistication and responsiveness to the demands of trade union members.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this Bill will act as a major incentive towards rationalising the existing situation.  I have always deplored&mdash;one finds it frequently in major industrial dispute situations &mdash;attempts to create dissident groups and break-away organisations instead of using established trade union machinery for dealing with complaints. The disruptive setting-up of break-away organisations is not very often inspired by any great concern for the workers but rather for individual notoriety in a particular dispute or the settling of old scores in a particular dispute, generally to the detriment of the workers concerned.  Workers should resist strongly through their own organisations the setting up of any disruptive elements.</P>
    <P>This legislation will be of major benefit in that regard.  It does not stop <Col N="228" /> trade unions being set up but in practice it is designed to prevent maverick organisations developing or panic action being taken by trade unions or trade unionists in a dispute and as a result setting up fragmentary, divisive organisations within a particular industry, trade group or category. The legislation is certainly constructive.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with another aspect of this matter.  If trade unionists feel they are being badly treated, they have ample opportunity within well-established trade union procedure to deal with their complaints without setting up another trade union.  Presumably I shall be able to deal with that after Question Time.</P>

      <P>My conversations with Mr. Wilson, in which other members of the Government also participated, were informal and confidential by mutual agreement.

      <P>This is a matter for the board of St. James's Hospital in the first instance.  As the Deputies will be aware, a range of consultant out-patient clinics is at present being held by the hospital staff.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think that the question here is whether later on it will be considered advisable to have this polyclinic in advance of the building of the hospital.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that the difference in assessing the means of a person applying for a non-contributory widow's pension and a non-contributory old age pension results in a widow on reaching the age of 70 having her income reduced; and if he will take steps to rectify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the different methods of calculating the yearly value of capital which have operated since 1963 in the assessment of means in these two types of pensions.  Previously the same method was used for both pensions but provision for the more liberal assessment of means derived from capital in the case of widows was made in that year.  The reason for the change lay broadly in the fact that a high proportion of widows are left with young families and have to face not only a major economic adjustment on the death of the husband but also problems of rearing and educating their children which do not arise in the case of old age pension claimants.</P>
      <P>A reduction in pension rate because of the different methods of assessing capital for old age pension purposes occurs in a few instances only and I am satisfied that no hardship is caused in such cases.</P>

      <P>Up to 1963 widows were assessed on the same basis as those applying for old age pension and, in the interest of improving the situation for widows, we stepped up the amount of capital a widow could have without assessment.  For the benefit of widows alone, we improved the situation in 1963, to come into force on 1st November.  That was an improvement made deliberately by us at that time. Now you are asking that we should continue it on after the age of old age pension.  If we do, every old age pensioner is in the same position at 70 as the widow is.  In other words, what the Deputy is asking is that we should discriminate against widows.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if income tax is payable on (a) widows' pension, (b) old age pension, (c) invalidity pension and (d) retirement pension of the Department of Social Welfare, if the recipient has income from another source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The widows' pension, old age pension, invalidity pension and retirement pension, payable under the Social Welfare Acts, are income for income tax purposes. Income tax is payable, of course, only if the person's total income is in excess of the allowances to which he is entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, liability to tax is normally unlikely to arise in the case of the non-contributory pensions (widows' and old age) since these awards would have been subject to a means test.  In the case of the contributory pensions (widows', old age, invalidity and retirement) liability to tax could only arise where the effective tax exemption <Col N="258" /> limits are exceeded, that is, where total income exceeds £399 a year for a single man, £424 a year for a widow or widower and £674 a year for a married man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that a widow in receipt of a widow's pension should have to pay income tax on her pension.  The Department of Social Welfare has pulled a fast one by persuading people to go from disability benefit and from unemployment benefit at 65 on to an invalidity pension or a retirement pension so that they can proceed to collect income tax on a combined income which they would not otherwise have been able to collect.  Could the Minister for Finance not talk to the Revenue Commissioners and tell them they are scraping the bottom of the barrel where this is being done?</P>

The repeal of the October, 1970, increase in company taxation had been pressed for on the ground that the new level of taxation bore excessively on company profits and thus adversely affected domestic investment.  The company taxation measure was therefore designed to serve as a stimulus to economic activity by permitting of increased investment in the current year in that the tax provisions currently being made by companies can be reduced.  I might add that I expect that increased investment will take place consequent on additional funds becoming available to companies as a result of this measure.</P>

      <P>The latest guideline issued by the Central Bank refers to the year ending April, 1972.  That guideline provides for an increase in bank lending not exceeding £115 million which would allow for aggregate lending of up to £1,123 million by the end of that year.  Up to mid-October lending amounted to £1,037 million which represented an increase to that date of £29 million.  It is, however, too early yet to judge what the outcome for the full year will be.  The demand for credit is expected to increase considerably in the period ahead.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I am having circulated with the Official Report a copy of a circular letter issued to Departments concerning the national pay agreement.  As will be seen from the text, the letter states that the agreement itself provides machinery for determining questions regarding its interpretation.</P>
      <P>The following is the text of the letter:</P>
      <P Just="Right">15 Eanair, 1971</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> 1. I am directed by the Minister for Finance to refer to this Department's minute of 19 Deireadh Fómhair, 1970, regarding controls on prices and incomes.  You will be aware that, in the light of the National Agreement negotiated at the Employer-Labour Conference (copy attached), the Government decided to withdraw the Prices and Incomes <Col N="263" /> Bill in the expectation that the Agreement would in fact contribute not only to greater industrial peace but to bringing about a significant reduction in the rate of inflation. It is essential, therefore, that the State, which is party to the Agreement, should give no grounds for any complaint that, in its capacity as employer, it is departing from the restraint which it would expect other employers, in view of the terms and spirit of the Agreement, to exercise.  This is particularly important in the case of those Clauses under which it would be possible for management and union to effect settlements without recourse to the Labour Court (or other established body such as an arbitration board). It should be borne in mind that the Agreement itself (Clause 11) provides machinery for determining questions of interpretation.</P>
    <P>2.  Clause 1 of the Agreement sets out the general objectives of the Agreement.  Clauses 3 and 4 deal with the making of new agreements when current agreements on pay and conditions expire and set out the upper limits to be observed in new agreements.  There are provisions in Clause 5 to cover cases where 12th round claims have not been settled and in Clause 6 to cover cases where genuine anomalies in pay exist between related groups.  Clause 7 embraces terms and conditions of employment other than basic pay. Procedures in cases of dispute are covered in Clause 10.</P>
    <P>3.  The Minister asks for your cooperation in the achievement of the objectives of the Agreement and, in particular, I am to request that in dealing with <i>all</i> claims for improvements in wages or conditions of employment regard be had to the terms of the Agreement.  In cases where Departments at present have delegated authority to vary pay rates in accordance with movements in outside rates, it will now be necessary for them not only to get sight of the formal settlement under which the outside rates have moved but to satisfy themselves that the settlement <Col N="264" /> is fully within the terms of the Employer-Labour Conference Agreement.</P>
    <P>4.  The Employer-Labour Conference Agreement in no way obviates the necessity for seeking Department of Finance sanction where this is necessary under existing arrangements and, when sanction is being sought, Departments should have particular regard to the considerations set out in the first paragraph of this Circular and, in addition, should indicate the Clause in the Agreement under which they intend to process the claim.</P>
    <P>5.  The Minister will be glad if the contents of this Circular are brought to the notice of all officers in your Department who would be directly concerned and if you would draw the attention of State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of your Department specifically to the considerations outlined in paragraphs 1 and 3 above and seek their cooperation.</P>

As far as my information goes, the legal arrangements concerning the loan should be completed within two weeks at the most and thereafter the mines should reopen.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this piece of legislation for the improvement of industrial relations, I pointed out that its primary effect in practice would be to benefit and advance the interests of ordinary workers in trade unions.  Members of the House become so preoccupied with their own problems of procedure and of trade union law, problems of industrial relations and the implementation of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act and recent trade union legislation that they tend at times to forget that primarily trade unions exist for the benefit and advancement of their members and that there are some 500,000 men and women rightly interested in how the movement works, its organisation and in the way statute law affects it.  In the case of this legislation we can in honesty say to trade union members that it will make the movement more healthy, effective and positive in servicing and benefiting trade union members. This is one of the great virtues of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formation of a single trade union congress in the 1957-59 period and the amalgamations that have taken place are steps in the right direction.  With the prospect of approaching entry to the EEC I should hope to see many trade unions, including some of the larger general unions, taking a very hard look at themselves and their role in the changing phase of Irish industry and consider whether or not the effectiveness of our trade union machinery can be retained on entering the EEC unless the further rationalisation of the movement is now undertaken so as to take into account pressures that will undoubtedly arise in that event.  We have moved forward in trade union and industrial relations legislation.  We have avoided the stupid excesses of the Industrial Relations Act in Britain which caused turmoil and great bitterness in industrial relations there.  It is noteworthy that the legislation introduced here today generally <Col N="274" /> has the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>One of the problems facing the trade union movement is that because it is a fairly large movement&mdash;not by international standards but in this country &mdash;because it has 500,000 members with 386,000 of them in the Republic, inevitably as in any human organisation occasions will arise when members will feel a profound sense of grievance and will allege that the servicing of their claims and problems is not being done as they would wish.  Because of this the Irish Congress of Trade Unions set up appeals machinery which is in operation.  It is not enough to say to workers: &ldquo;This is how new trade unions may be formed.&rdquo;  It is also important to point out that there is effective internal machinery in the movement itself which takes fully into account the democratic aspirations of members.  I want to stress that there is already in existence in section 49 of the constitution of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions very elaborate and detailed provisions to determine the relationship between trade unions in respect of disputes arising over membership or transfer of members from one union to another.</P>
    <P>At one time or another almost every union in the country has been involved with congress through the disputes machinery in regard to membership and the internal democratic system for dealing with such disputes has proved generally effective and has functioned fairly in regard to dissatisfaction arising in particular organisations.  I think it has proved effective in dealing with the rank and file of the movement who may legitimately from time to time feel dissatisfied with the service they are getting or allege they are not getting.  As a trade union official, I have been very much aware of the complaints that can arise in the trade union movement. Therefore, through the medium of the existing constitution of Congress and its disputes machinery, disputes related to membership which in many cases form the basis of break-away organisations, may be settled in a way that has been generally effective.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the machinery on which I do not propose to speak at length at this stage and it <Col N="275" /> is the innovation which came into operation a few years ago in congress, the setting up of an appeals board by congress.  When one wants to contrast trade union democracy&mdash;to use a global term&mdash;here and in, say, Britain or on the Continent it is important to point out that we have the only trade union movement in the world, even including the AFLCIO or the LO in Sweden itself, which has established an appeal board which was, I emphasise, not established by the executive of congress but by the annual conference, the rank and file of the trade union movement. They elected their own appeals board to receive complaints from groups of members of lack of service within the movement.  That appeals board has certainly proved quite effective. There has been a great deal of uninformed and voluble criticism directed against the trade union movement by those who know very little about the movement and who are very little concerned about the health or welfare of the movement.  Down through the years many Deputies have advocated legislation as if such legislation could be the panacea for an effective trade union structure.  What has happened is that there is now the desirable innovation that the trade union movement through their own democratic organisation have set up their own internal appeals machinery which is available to every trade union member and which, therefore, can deal effectively with many of the complaints that arise.  I would urge trade unionists who might be tempted to form break-away organisations, or to set up their own introverted group, to endeavour to resolve these issues within the trade union movement and to retain the essential solidarity of working people in the trade union organisations.  The membership of the appeals board consists of experienced trade unionists whose integrity and public influence have been of the highest order.  These are people who represent the movement as a whole in any appeals hearing and who do not represent only their own individual organisations.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the composition of the appeals board of this organisation made specific provision <Col N="276" /> that no member of a trade union concerned with the appeal should sit on the board hearing of that appeal. Where a group of members submit a complaint to the secretary of the appeals board concerning lack of service, such complaints are referred in the first instance to the union concerned who are asked to indicate whether there is substance in the complaint and whether steps are being taken to remedy it.  If after reference to the union concerned, the action taken by the union is not satisfactory to the complaining members, the appeal goes before the appeals board for a determination. This is one of the greatest internal safety valves of the trade union movement in preventing what one might call flash breakaways of a fragmentary nature within the organisation. It is also a useful method whereby if any officials of the trade unions become too high and mighty within their own trade union organisation, or where they may indulge in abuses, although these would not be tolerated for a moment by the rank and file of the trade union movement, such developments can be remedied.  Therefore, the parallel developments of the appeal board system of congress, of the attempt being made by the ICTU to rationalise and fuse together like-minded trade unions and unions with a common personality of their own, augur well for legislation that is constructive and democratic, for legislation that will not be repressive, that will not dictate to the trade union movement how they should be organised but which in the public interest will prevent a diffusion of effort and that will prevent ineffectiveness; legislation that will be for the common good which, incidentally, is a term that is used rarely those days.  It was always regarded as being a socialist term until it was adopted suddenly by Catholic apologists.  The common good of the trade union organisation demands the introduction of this legislation and I have no doubt that many workers will welcome such legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the final points I would make concerns a group of workers of less than 500 being involved.  I notice that subsection (2) of section 3 reads:  <Col N="277" /> The High Court, after hearing any evidence adduced by the applicant, the Minister, the Congress and any other trade union, may at its discreation declare that the granting of a negotiating licence to the applicant would not be against the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister might elaborate on this. This would prevent some of the more ignorant attacks which will undoubtedly be made on this Bill because here there is the essential &ldquo;out,&rdquo; where, for example, in any group or category there would be less than 500 workers both the existing trade union organisations and congress may well consider it legitimate to grant such a licence although that group or category may not aggregate 500 members.  Therefore, they could be accommodated.  I would ask the Minister to confirm this so that we might be better equipped in interpreting correctly the provisions of the Bill.  These then are my general views on the Bill and I hope that they reflect, too, the views of the Labour Party.  I hope also that the Bill will be given a speedy passage through the House and that the remaining legislation concerning the facilitating of amalgamation will be introduced.  It is my hope, too, that the long-promised legislation relating to the Educational Company of Ireland judgment which was promised by the Minister, shelved by the Taoiseach, then re-activated but shelved again, will be brought in during the lifetime of this Dáil.  These are measures that would merit the support of the trade union movement and of the Labour Party and we look forward to supporting them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill but there are one or two aspects of it with which I am in some disagreement.  Nevertheless, the Bill sets out to tighten the conditions for the granting of further negotiating licences and I am glad that the right of free association and the right under certain circumstances to develop trade unions are being upheld. I agree that in order to get a negotiating licence a union should be registered in this country, but I disagree <Col N="278" /> with the statement &ldquo;or to be a trade union under the laws of another country&rdquo;.  The trade union movement here should be a home-based trade union movement and we should be in absolute control of our own affairs without any dictation whatsoever from outside.  At this stage we surely must be mature enough to conduct our own affairs and to control the destiny of the trade union movement.  The words &ldquo;or to be a trade union under the laws of another country&rdquo; may be a little ambiguous.  The backdoors must be sealed and at this stage we should provide that further negotiating licences would be given only to trade unions registered in this country.  Down through the years we have had plenty of difficulty with trade unions outside the country.</P>
      <P>Any new legislation we bring in should give us the exclusive right to these controls because we are mature enough and we have the necessary organisation to ensure that we can manage our own affairs without outside interference.  There tends to be greater outside interference.  There are a number of very responsible officials in the trade union movement but there are one or two who listen to the dictates of outside forces.  Where they are controlled from outside they can be influenced to take certain undesirable actions.  We must seal off any backdoor entry that would tend to disrupt the organisation which is set up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of the 18 months from the time of fulfilling the conditions before a licence can be granted, I think the period is somewhat long.  While I agree that a waiting period is essential, I think a 12 month period might be more acceptable.  This will only happen where there is a problem within the existing framework and once we have given them the right it should be a reasonable right and should not be made too difficult.  The Bill is absolutely necessary and desirable at this stage but I think the conditions should not be made impossible. If people have set about organising a group there could be complete disruption within a union for a period of <Col N="279" /> 18 months.  It could be solved in 12. The Minister should have a look at this.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there were too many trade unions in the country.  Most people would agree with this but there are obvious dangers on the other hand. In countries where they have too few unions they have many of the same problems that we have.  If we had too few unions we might have virtual dictatorship within the organisation. Mergers can take place and should take place.  Possibly the idea of industrial unions is one of the solutions. Mergers should be encouraged and legislation is desirable at an early date to ensure that amalgamations can take place and the terms of the previous Trade Union Bill are absolutely necessary if we are to bring about any amalgamation.  The 1964 Amalgamation Act in Britain brought about dozens of mergers because there were facilities and the necessary financial help was provided in that Bill.  We had a merger here of two unions which went through the courts on several occasions, and when they merged we still had two unions.  Nothing was achieved except that a greater number of people came together in one and then a splinter group broke away. Legislation to encourage mergers should be brought in at an early date. In that legislation certain lines of procedure must be laid down for mergers so that we will not have the messy situation that we had in relation to the IEI and ETU and the NEU merger about which we heard so much in recent times.  I happen to be a member of one of these unions.  To tell the truth I do not know which union I am a member of&mdash;whether it is the NEETU or the IEI and ETU.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely necessary that legislation should be brought in to deal with amalgamations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that there could be dissatisfaction between the existing trade unions and that they should be addressing themselves to the problems of particular group members.  While the desire of the Bill is to curtail in some way the rapid expansion of splinter groups and to eliminate them if possible, nevertheless, there is a responsibility on the officials in command of the trade union organisation to display adequate control over the affiliated unions and sometimes this is not evident.  There are problems and some of them are probably insurmountable and will need further legislation, but it is obvious at times that adequate control over affiliated unions, apart from splinter groups, is just not there.  It is necessary that everybody should have a look&mdash;the trade unions, the members of the Labour Party who <Col N="281" /> display an interest in trade union affairs and those who pretend to be interested in trade union affairs&mdash;at this aspect.  They would be doing better work than by coming in here interrupting people who are trying to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>Many problems are known to members of trade union organisations&mdash; problems in connection with the smaller unions, especially in the election of officers where it is by popular vote and where they are playing to the workers for support rather than paying the necessary attention to the problems of the workers.  They are concerned about their own survival and this is an undesirable situation.</P>
    <P>There are other pressures in the organisation which should be examined. There are problems which cause unrest in the minds of workers. One of these is the retention of the political levy.  The political levy should be abolished.  It should not be left in its present form or in any of the amended forms that have been suggested from time to time.  There have been certain types of victimisation. There have been threats to certain workers who wanted to opt out.  This aspect should be examined in relation to any further legislation that is being introduced so as to ensure that people have certain freedom as members of trade unions and will not be corralled or brought into the net of a political party by a variety of means, tricks, devices, statements or pressures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <P>Why should Deputy Desmond, with the sneers he throws <Col N="282" /> out, try to insinuate that we are something different in this party?  I hope Deputy Desmond will say to the members of his own union that he does not want members of Fianna Fáil or supporters of Fianna Fáil in his own union.  They are just as good and perhaps more effective and more loyal to the trade union organisation than possibly Deputy Desmond or other people who have made a good thing out of it.  This cheap type of sneer is an indication of the mentality of the people who are guiding in some way the trade union organisation.</P>

If Deputy Haughey were in the House, would Deputy Desmond have the courage to stand up and indicate that he should not be trying to help the trade unionists of this city and this country in the way he is?

      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the two points I have made.  The first was in connection with the reduction of the 18 months period in the Bill and the other is the question of completely closing the back door to foreign trade unionists. While we do not object to having association with cross-channel, European or other trade unions, nevertheless we want to ensure that we will be masters in our own house.  We have within the country officials capable of dealing with the problems of the trade union movement, capable of dealing with domestic problems.  We should close the backdoor to outside trade unionists so that they cannot come in in a variety of guises.  Trade unions with small numbers in Britain can be bought over at a much less sum than the £5,000 and can come in here with a negotiating licence and get in through the backdoor.  I hope the backdoor will be sealed and that we will have the legislation that is desirable <Col N="284" /> and necessary, even if it is on the basis of a small Bill to meet a particular need.  We could have such small Bills in rapid succession so as to seal off the various gaps and improve the trade union organisation.</P>

If he cannot, then he has to bring them home to wait for a more appropriate occasion to try again.  Let us have an end to this.  The big business associations have been pouring money into Fianna Fáil for years, up to this year, but they will not do it again.  Maybe Fianna Fáil are now a bit annoyed because they know this source of income is gone and they want to try to take some of the income from the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it on the record: the Labour Party received subscriptions from some trade unions. They are entitled by the law of the land to do this.  Whether or not the subscriptions paid by firms to Fianna Fáil were allowed by the law of the land is something I cannot comment upon.  Now that things are getting tight for Fianna Fáil, Deputy Dowling and others of his ilk would like to prevent those who want to do so from subscribing to the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling should know what the position is.  There was some question here about home-based trade unions.  When ICTU was formed some years ago out of the Trade Union Congress and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions one of the conditions laid down was that Irish unions had complete autonomy and if they were not prepared to accept that, then they were not acceptable into the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  That is the position.  We hear people talking about directions from London, about people being instructed, about strikes being caused by people living in Britain; the fact is that these people do not even know we are here.  They have enough to do fighting their own battles. As far as British unions here are concerned, they must subscribe to the law of the land and to the regulations laid <Col N="287" /> down by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is doing a damn good job.  Occasionally their efforts are sabotaged by people who do not seem to understand what the function of a trade union is. There are people who seem to believe &mdash;Deputy Dowling is not one of them &mdash;that the main function of a trade union is starting strikes.  As a trade union official for 26 years, let me say we spend more time trying to prevent disputes than we do trying to start them, if we do start them.  We spend most of our time trying to smooth relations between employer and employee and we have been very successful in this and, were it not for our efforts, there would be many more disputes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling talked about associations in one breath and trade unions in the other.  A trade union is a registered trade union with a negotiating licence.  There are trade unions which call themselves associations but, under the Act, they are trade unions.  There are groups which call themselves associations which are not registered trade unions.  They have no negotiating licence.  Unfortunately, we have Ministers of State who do not seem to be able to differentiate between these groups and registered trade unions with negotiating licences.  While they cannot negotiate&mdash;Ministers of State do not usually negotiate&mdash;they do discuss the matters under dispute and they occasionally agree that certain concessions could be given.  This does not help the trade unions.  It certainly does not help those who are trying to keep the agreement if someone comes along and makes a rash promise to a group, which calls itself an association, but which is not a registered trade union and has no negotiating licence.</P>
    <P>This sort of thing happens and I would ask the Minister to settle this particular problem where groups of people in similar jobs come together and call themselves an association. They may be members of various trade unions or of no trade union; if they are members of various trade unions they try to set themselves up as a ginger group to force the trade unions <Col N="288" /> to do what, in fact, they have been doing all the time to the best of their ability.  Whether these people parade outside Leinster House, or anywhere else, makes no damn difference: trade unions are making the best bargain they can.  It may be good publicity for certain people who are starved of self-advertisement on television and in the newspapers but it does not help the unions.  I would ask the Minister, if he at any time attends a function of an association that claims to be a trade union, to make sure that it is, in fact, a registered trade union with a negotiating licence.</P>
    <P>I would add my voice to Deputy Desmond's appeal that the educational judgment should be fixed up as quickly as possible.  The late Deputy Seán Lemass gave a solemn promise that that would be done.  This was gone back on on a number of occasions but, on the very last occasion, I think, on which he spoke in this House he did say that it should be done.  Would the Minister in this Bill or in another Bill at a later stage fix it up?  It is something which should have been attended to a long time ago.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be received very well by organised trade unionists and particularly by the Irish Congress of Trades Unions which represents the majority of trade unionists.  The Minister may have to do something about one or two matters.  I do not agree with Deputy Dowling about the waiting period for a negotiating licence.  I believe the period should be a fairly lengthy one.  All of us have had experience of people who, for one reason or another, disagree with what we are doing or with some terms negotiated for someone else which they think should apply to them also and, if they find we have to stand by the bargain we made, they promptly sever their connection.</P>
    <P>A trade union must keep to its word just as the employer must keep to his. Otherwise, trust between the two will go.  To prevent groups, be they small or large, in the heat of the moment rushing out and forming some type of trade union, there should be a lengthy period; 18 months is laid down in the Bill.  I see nothing wrong with it, particularly <Col N="289" /> as the people concerned have the right to go to the High Court if they feel they are unfairly treated.</P>
    <P>I am not in agreement with the suggestion that the deposit should be £5,000 for a new union in which the membership does not exceed 2,000. This deposit has to be registered for a negotiating licence.  Let me make that clear because some people do not know what it means.  The Schedule provides:</P>
    <P>Where the number of members does not exceed 2,000, the deposit shall be £5,000.</P>
    <P>Where the number of members exceeds 2,000 but does not exceed 5,000, the deposit shall be £5,000 together with £200 for each additional 300 members (or part of 300 members) in excess of 2,000 members.</P>
    <P>I think that is wrong.  Either we accept them as a trade union and there is a deposit laid down, they pay that and everything else is fixed up, or we are going to make a new set of regulations, regulations which will ultimately apply to everybody because, once it goes into the Statute Book, it is a lever which can be used by Ministers to force other people into doing the same thing; the precedent is there and will have to be followed.  I suggest the Minister should discuss this with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  While the £5,000 may be all right, there should not be a higher figure after the 2,000 members than there is at the moment. It would be unfair to insist on this.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he can in any way cover bodies which have become known as &ldquo;house units&rdquo;.  Their work is becoming well known.  Some do not like the title &ldquo;house units&rdquo;. The Minister knows that people in similar employment can negotiate without a negotiating licence.  A neat little trick is being worked by some people who are employed in groups and negotiate at their own level.  They attempt to come together at national level and pretend they are a national trade union when in fact they are no such thing.  This is a matter which should be looked into.</P>
    <P>If this Bill does anything to prevent <Col N="290" /> the curse of the trade union movement&mdash;the unofficial strike&mdash;all of us will welcome it.  No matter what we may say unofficial strikes are caused not by the people who are worst off, but usually by people who are reasonably well off, who are jealous of what somebody else has got and who feel that they, by using the strength they have got, may be able to twist somebody's arm and get that in addition to their own negotiations.  Co-operation with the trade union movement by the Government and particularly by employers is the one way this can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about trade unions let us get the facts straight. Deputy Dowling was correct in saying that there is a difference between the general unions and the other unions, I assume he was talking about craft unions.  One of the most jealous groups, and rightly so, are the various craft unions.  They have their own associations and it is not an easy thing to prevail on a carpenter or joiner to join with a bricklayer, painter, plasterer or somebody else because they all feel they are separate entities and their interests are not the same.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years through the building trade group negotiations things have improved a great deal. When we talk about cutting down trade unions this must be done by persuasion, and by giving people the right to make their own decisions.  If we try to force them to do this we shall reach a stage where they will be very dissatisfied and the cure will be worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>A number of trade unions have been formed quite recently.  Many were formed around 1910 and 1912 and some were formed in the last century when they were called &ldquo;combinations&rdquo;. My grandfather was secretary of a combination which was formed in North Meath in 1857.  They had a farm workers' strike because they were looking for something very unreasonable at the time.  Wages were nine pence a week and they were looking for one shilling.  I am glad to say they did strike and after a few days they were granted the shilling.  The point I want to make is that at that time <Col N="291" /> the Government decided combinations should be broken up and resolutions were passed by employers' bodies that the strongest possible action should be taken by anybody who was found to be a member of a combination.  Thank goodness we have changed a great deal since then and we can now have a reasonable discussion at the negotiating level with most employers and even with the Government.  The Government should not try to force anything down the combined necks of the trade union bodies because while they will accept something that they are asked to do they will not be forced to do something they think is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The general terms of the Bill do not appear to be very controversial.  They do not continue the mistaken trend of the 1966 Trade Union Bill which, as the Minister said in his opening speech, lapsed with that Dáil in 1969.  The 1966 Trade Union Bill contained a number of features dear to the official heart of the Department of Labour.  That Department has not always been the wisest in its dealings with trade union legislation in general.  There has been a tendency in the Department to more than flirt with ideas of tidying up what was regarded as a chaotic trade union picture by short-cut legislative means.  It was said that the chaos of the trade union world would be reduced to order by a few timely measures carried through in a Bill and from then on we would deal with an efficient, well co-ordinated, well managed trade union movement.</P>
      <P>As we said during that Dáil far from being the doctrinaire party that some people accuse us of being in the area of labour relations our advice in general has been to facilitate a voluntary association or combination or amalgamation of unions.  We did not think the best wisdom lay in more legislation, a tidying up purely confined to the legislative field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal task of Government in industrial relations remains one of management of the economy to provide conditions of full employment in that such successful management of the economy would in turn produce the conditions whereby trade unions <Col N="292" /> themselves could voluntarily come together and tidy up their own affairs. That central task of Government has been the single failure of this Government over the years.  That has been and remains the burden of the advice of the Labour Party in this particular area.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us avoids the more controversial aspects of the 1966 Bill. It avoids the group negotiation licence clauses of the 1966 Bill which at that time were opposed by the trade unions and by the Labour Party.  The principal measures of a deposit and the upward figure of 500 people being brought together before the union could be formed appear to be common sense and do not appear to strike at the fundamental liberty of any individual trade union member.  There is recourse to the courts and this should be ample remedy for any person or group of persons who may feel their rights of association granted under the Constitution are infringed by any measure contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The State made certain errors in the area of rights of association as far back as the 1941 Act.  We need to keep constantly in mind when we are thinking of legislating for the good of the trade union movement that we do not infringe on the citizen's right of association with whom he chooses. Some of our trade unions were formed as off-shoots of unions formed in Britain during the industrial revolution. They are mainly craft unions. The more native Irish growth is the general union.  Probably a higher proportion of our work force is in general unions than in any other State in Europe where trade union organisations exist.  It is accepted that it would be better for individual members if there were fewer unions, because members would seem to get a better service from them.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with associations of men and women.  Some of these associations have existed for nearly 100 years and are proud of their record, proud of the particular tradition of the group or association and who are jealous about amalgamating with another group.  There is nothing the State can do except facilitate a voluntary coming together of the members <Col N="293" /> of these unions.  The acid test here is whether the general unions themselves wish to come together.  This has to be a voluntary thing; it has to be decided by the unions and to be seen by them as being in their interests and to their advantage.  Congress itself has done a great deal of work in recent years to help the unions to come together thereby cutting out overlapping and giving a better service to their members. It has provided a service whereby members who may have complaints about their union can report their discontent and follow it up to congress level.</P>
    <P>Members have a legitimate fear about large unions, large structures where the old personal warmth of the smaller association may be absent. They may fear they will feel lost in the larger organisation, that since there is less competition as between one union and another catering for the same type of worker in the end the individual member will be the sufferer. The trade union movement have given ample evidence of being aware of this legitimate fear by constructing this inner machinery whereby the member may pursue a legitimate complaint he may have against a union decision in his own branch area. This is a healthy, logical and pragmatic approach to this problem.  The unions are the best arbiters of their own improved organisation.  The job of the State is to stand aside on this matter.  It is the job of the State to facilitate, not to escape its major duty, which must be to help unions to organise themselves more efficiently.  It is the job of the State to manage the economy, to provide full employment so that the question of overlapping, of apprentice grading and so on are eased out of the way because of full employment.</P>
    <P>Why is there such a thing as craft rivalry between one group organising one craft and another?  It is because the labour market is small, because the amount of jobs available in a particular area is limited, and the organisation involved must look after its own members.  Therefore, because <Col N="294" /> of the lack of employment this may lead in certain respects to restrictive practices.  These things are unavoidable where the employment position is as bad as it has been in this country for so many years.</P>
    <P>It means also that where a trade union movement have long experience of unemployment&mdash;and the Irish trade union movement are probably unique in Europe in having almost 50 years of unemployment&mdash;it is naive to expect such a trade union movement to welcome innovation in their organisation, to go forward with open hands to a State that has ideas on the reorganisation of that movement.  The major characteristic of a movement faced with continuing unemployment is caution and this has marked the dealings, and rightly so, of the trade union movement regarding any ideas of reorganisation of their own movement.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not read this into the Minister's speech.  I hope the Department of Labour have banished some of the mistaken ideas of the 1966 Trade Union Bill.  The Minister mentioned further measures that may be necessary.  The Minister should banish from his mind the idea that the trade union movement is willing to do any deal on the basis of a settlement of the Educational Company question.  The idea that there is any kind of bargain that could have as the <i>quid pro quo</i> a solution to this problem, or that the trade union movement could agree to other things, must be nailed.  In fact it weakens the trade union movement in the matter of being able to ensure a full trade union organisation at the place of work.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement are simply asking for a return to the previous position, the position won by the trade union movement as far back as the Taff Vale judgment at the start of this century.  The trade union movement are not asking for any new concession by asking for a settlement of the situation after the Education Company decision.</P>
    <P>There is a delusion in this country that trade unions are in the controlling position in our society.  I do not believe this.  Our trade unions are weak <Col N="295" /> in regard to major decisions affecting their members; they have little influence over the kind of houses in which their members live, over the lives their members live, or the security of jobs.  In many cases the denial of trade union rights exists in our capital city.  In many firms employing clerical workers the employees must fight the good fight of trade unionists of former years to be recognised.  It is a sorry admission to say that this recognition of trade unions is a contemporary struggle in Ireland.  All our newspapers, our leading spokesmen, churchmen, politicians, even trade unionists, tell us that trade unions have been accepted in our society.  In fact, they have not.  The fight for trade union recognition continues.  There are many employers, employing large numbers of workers, who obdurately refuse to recognise trade unions.  The report of the Labour Court will show that recognition of the employee's right to join a trade union can be a factor behind a dispute in 1971.  Let us get the perspective right before we think that all we have to do is simply to trim the sails of an over-powerful trade union movement.  The trade unions still have a significant struggle before them before they can truly be said to have arrived.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling spoke about the bad position, the bad effect, the tyranny involved, where members of trade unions must contribute to the Labour Party.  As was said, no member is forced to make this payment.  He may opt out and the fact that there is no deprivation of a citizen's rights under the Constitution in the matter of political levy is proved when one remembers it has not been contested in the courts nor has anyone thought it wise to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not understand these accusations from the Government party, who are always very sensitive about the relations between the Labour Party and the trade unions.  We are accused of introducing politics into the paradise of the trade unions where there are no politics.  The Labour Party are classed as the villains of the piece. We have a Government party doing their utmost for the honest trade <Col N="296" /> unionists of the country, never introducing politics into the blessed area of trade union relations.  We have a Government party that have never evaded their task of helping the trade unionists by every means in their power.  Everything that was necessary to bring the workers from their knees has been done by this Government and the latest act in that saga of help to the trade unionists is the trade unionist group formed recently in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party faithfully carry out in this Parliament any suggestion or request made to us by affiliated trade unions.  Bills relating to redundancy or social welfare bear the mark of our concern.  The question might fairly be asked: Who are the people who play politics in the trade unions? I think of the squalid collection of names in the 1968 referendum when every local paper in the country was filled with pseudo names and false addresses of so-called Fianna Fáil trade unionists who attempted to subvert the trade union movement's campaign for the retention of proportional representation.  The Government party were the party which interfered in the trade unions and attempted to introduce politics.  Therefore, let us nail the lie that the party opposite do not seek politically to manipulate the trade unions.  This has been their constant concern and is the reason they are so sensitive about the political levy. I realise this is a slight digression but I have made it because Deputies opposite have referred to it already. Perhaps on another occasion with another trade union Bill if the Minister sees fit to refer to it, we may talk about where the social concern of a political party comes from or who dominates the policy of a party.  I think it could be said to come from the people who finance the coffers of that party and there is no secret about whom, up to recently, financed the coffers of the party opposite.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Schedule section referred to by Deputy Tully, I fail to see that this gradual ascending penalty of cash deposits is necessary.  I should like to hear that better explained.  It may be necessary to put down one or two amendments but in general we <Col N="297" /> welcome the Bill.  We would like further information.  The Minister would not find us co-operative on any basis of a deal being done on the more unattractive and controversial features of the 1966 Bill.  We hope that has been finally interred in the Department and will not again see the light of day.  If it does, we can promise opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but I want to emphasise that we cannot legislate our way into industrial happiness or perfect industrial relations. One of the few things on which I agree with Deputy O'Leary is that I think it is mainly the trade unions' job to bring about a change in attitudes or organisation so as to reach a better system of industrial relations than we now have.  This Bill, even though it is only a short one, will help to a great extent. We have about 400,000 workers and 95 trade unions, 20 employers' unions and also house unions or associations which are not strictly unions but which cater for some workers who will not join a trade union.  Out of that dark picture let us record our appreciation of the fact that we have only one trade union congress.  Long may that be so. Probably we are the only country in Europe with one trade union congress catering for all unions.  Fifty one per cent of our workers are members of unions while in Britain the figure is 48 per cent and this drops to 23 per cent in some continental countries.  So, our position is not as bad as we sometimes think.  With legislation such as this we shall improve matters, not by any forcing of trade unions but by showing a general desire for co-operation between the Government and the unions and by emphasising that we fully support congress in their efforts to better the general position of the unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leads to the question: have we too many trade unions?  We certainly have sufficient.  I do not think we would welcome any more.  The Bill makes it more difficult for any group of workers who may be dissatisfied to leave their union and form a new one. I agree with Deputy Dowling that perhaps 18 months waiting time is too long and that 12 months would be better.  The Bill mentions a minimum <Col N="298" /> of 500 members resident in the State. Perhaps at a later stage the Minister would emphasise that any new trade union must have their headquarters in the State and must be purely Irish. At the same time we do not want to become insular in this matter.  I urge trade unions to have all possible contact with their continental counterparts. I may say a word of praise for the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union which for some years past have adopted a policy of keeping in touch with continental unions.  I believe they have contact with 11 different bodies and this is good.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law and we have checked the rise of new unions we might then suggest to the unions that they should think of some sort of federation or unification.  The largest unions, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the Workers' Union of Ireland are, I think, considering coming together.  I hope this happens; if it does we shall be going back to the position in the 1920s when men like Jim Larkin and William O'Brien, before any split came, had one big union.  Our aim now should be, having checked the rise of new unions, to try by all means to put the house in better order by amalgamating a number of unions.  In saying &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the trade union movement.  I think there are 12 unions with less than 100 members while on the continent there are six unions catering for millions of workers.  We must face the fact that the Government cannot by legislation change trade union structure nor perhaps can trade unions on their own do it but with full co-operation between the Government and the unions we can bring about a much better relationship between management and labour and between Government and unions. On this side of the House, from the Minister down to the humblest backbencher, there is that desire to create conditions in which trade unions will thrive and where there will be strong trade unions.  I believe that to have a good society we must have a strong and enlightened trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary, I think, went outside the scope of the debate when he attacked the Fianna Fáil Trade Union <Col N="299" /> Affairs Group.  This group have set out not to supplant trade unions.  We will not interfere in any kind of strike because we believe this is a matter for the trade unions, but whatever help we can give, whether through a trade union or through Congress or through workers, we shall certainly give.  We make no apology to Deputy O'Leary or anybody else for this group.  The group set out to fill a void in our society and felt they should help.  At all times they have tried to help those who sought help but at no time did they interfere in any way with a trade union or their working in any industrial dispute, even though on two occasions at least we were invited to take issue in a strike in the hope of settling it.  In the first case the trade union concerned had done everything humanly possible to reach a settlement but because of internal dissension they could not do this.  For my own group I want to say that we flatly refuse at any time to become involved in strikes once they have started.  If we can be of any help to any side in the dispute we certainly try to prevent a strike taking place or we would endeavour to have an agreement reached where a strike has already occurred but we will never assume the responsibility that is the trade union's.  However, we reserve the right to criticise either employers or trade unions or to criticise legislation that may be going through the House if we think that such legislation would not help the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Every person in the State is affected in some way by legislation relating to trade unions.  If, for example, the public are deprived of public transport, there is no use in telling them that the blame must rest with some unofficial group.  The Minister is anxious to curb development of unofficial groups.  This is a small Bill but perhaps there is more legislation to follow.  Last week the Minister made it quite clear that he would seek the full co-operation of the trade unions and the other interests involved when he is preparing legislation.  Surely it is not too much to ask that there would be the fullest co-operation from all sides, from the Government, from the <Col N="300" /> trade unions and from the employers. In the national interest this co-operation is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary talked about full employment and suggested that unemployment is in some way responsible for hindering the trade union movement. All I can say is that if Jim Larkin and men like him had held that belief, they never would have become involved in the trade union movement.  Through the trade union movement they saw the betterment of standards for workers and in the long-term they foresaw an economy that would give full employment.  By bringing in this Bill the Minister has indicated that these, too, are his views.</P>
    <P>It is a Bill that will rationalise at least one issue in the whole field of trade unionism.  It is a step forward but we must not leave the entire job to the Minister because he can only do his part.  Every trade union, every employer and, indeed, every Deputy in this House, has a duty to help in bringing about a situation whereby there would be free negotiation, and protection of workers and protection of society in general from unjust strikes.  I support the Bill and I hope that the Minister will consider the points put forward concerning waiting time and also concerning the setting-up of any new trade union in so far as that any such union should have its headquarters in this country.  With these two amendments, the Bill would be almost perfect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton and others have expressed their general views on the terms of this Bill.  There is a widespread recognition that any steps that can rationalise the trade union arrangements or that can bring some form of order into industrial relations are to be welcomed.  Publications by such organisations as OECD, the ILO and other international bodies indicate that our record in respect of industrial relations leaves a lot to be desired.  However, that is probably a matter for discussion on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill are desirable generally but there is one small point I want to make in connection with the idea that large unions are <Col N="301" /> necessarily the most efficient ones.  In common with other Deputies, I have had experience recently of a strike that lasted for some time and which could have been escalated into a much wider strike.  Part of the problem in connection with that strike was that the workers involved were members of a large trade union and that they themselves expressed great concern that they could not get through to the union because of the preoccupation of the higher officials of the union with other activities.</P>
    <P>Because they were a small group and were a group that were among those at the bottom of the wage scale, the dispute was very near to escalation at one stage because this group were in a position to bring about the coming out of many other workers.  Part of the delay in settling that dispute lay in the fact that the group were members of a large union but failed to get through to their union.  That may have been an extreme case but many industrial disputes that we have had in the past could be attributed to a multiplicity of unions representing workers in the same industry or in the same type of employment.</P>
    <P>However, I want to avail myself of this opportunity to raise one particular matter.  This concerns a cinema proprietor in Glasthule, which is in my constituency. This man finds that films are being withheld from him because he employs non-union labour.  I understand that the non-distribution of films to him is preventing him from running his business while cinema owners in other parts of the country who employ non-union labour are being supplied with films.  In the circumstances this man considers that he is being victimised.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if this particular rule applies at all, it should apply uniformly and that there should be no discrimination.  I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister to deal with a specific case of this nature but I have been asked to raise the matter and perhaps the Minister would direct the attention of officers of his Department to it in an effort to see if a settlement can be reached so that the man will be able to run his business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Bill was most satisfactory in so far as nobody disagreed with the terms of the Bill nor did anybody disagree with the need for legislation of this kind.  Therefore, my reply need not be very lengthy but I would like to deal with some of the matters raised which related directly to the Bill.  Many matters were raised that bear no relation to what is contained in the Bill and some suggestions were made as to what might have been contained in it. At the outset I would like to point out that this is an arrangement to deal with one situation, a situation that was regarded as having a certain urgency. The Bill was designed for the purpose of finding a solution to this particular situation without having a number of other matters tagged on to it which would inevitably delay it.</P>
      <P>There was agreement on all sides that the process by which groups could obtain negotiating licences was much too simple and tended towards proliferation of unions and the fragmentation of existing unions, something that nobody would like to support. For that reason, having regard to the right of persons to form associations or unions as laid down in the Constitution, the Bill was framed to make it not just as simple a matter as it has been for persons who are suffering from pique for a time, or in panic circumstances, to form a new union.  We arrived at certain requirements and these are as set out in the Bill&mdash;the £5,000 minimum deposit on an ascending scale which, like the 1941 Act, increases with the number of members, the requirement of at least 500 members and the waiting period of 18 months.  These were carefully selected as being the minimal or reasonable figures and periods to be observed and I do not think anybody seriously questioned them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Moore and Dowling suggested that the period might be too long.  However much I would like to facilitate those members of my party I do not think they made any really serious case in favour of a reduction to a year.  There is nothing sacrosanct about the year and a half except that one occasion on which a breakaway <Col N="303" /> group may seek to establish a union is when an overall agreement is arrived at by the union of which they are members which does not satisfy some minority group.  The only way they could seek to break the agreement would be to form a union of their own.</P>
    <P>Agreements usually run for a year and a half anyhow.  That was about the only thing I had in mind.  By the time the year and a half would have terminated emotion would have subsided and tempers would have cooled off and perhaps the need for fragmentation might not then exist.  It was just a reasonable measurement of time which was thought out.  There is nothing sacrosanct about it but it is agreed by all that a definite period is essential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton said that the Bill would not get rid of existing small unions.  It does not purport to do that but it certainly will have the effect of preventing the coming into being of small unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I said that.  I said it would get rid of small unions but it would not prevent a tremendous number of unofficial strikes.  Maybe I did say it but I did not mean to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another day's work.  This Bill has nothing to do with it except that it may affect the situation indirectly by bringing about a certain amount of rationalisation and preventing further fragmentation.</P>
      <P>The question of industrial democracy in the ESB and the Fogarty Report were referred to by a number of Deputies.  Most speakers seemed to point the finger at me and say that I did nothing about it.  If one reads the Fogarty Report one will find that he explicitly states that this should only come about after the union and the management have agreed that the way is clear and the preparatory work done.  I will be glad to co-operate in anything they agree on in this respect. The initiative is not with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was criticism of the exempted body status.  It is laid down in the <Col N="304" /> 1941 Act that a body must not negotiate unless it has a negotiating licence or has exemption by order of the Minister.  A negotiating licence would not, of course, be required by a body whose members were all employed by the one employer but there have been cases where the exemption has been given and for the information of those who said that they have been too frequent I may say that there have been 18 granted since 1941 and these mostly referred to the type of professional class who did not want to assume trade union status and applied for exemption.  It is understandable that that should be the case.  However, I have not operated to encourage this in any way but as the law stands if a reasonable application is made and all the requirements are evident I cannot resist it.  This Bill seeks to amend the provisions whereby I was obliged to give a negotiating licence when £1,000 was deposited by a group of more than seven members.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond raised the question of the anomaly which will now exist where one set of unions will be paying higher fees than others as new unions are formed under the new scale.  It would be unfair to seek in this Bill to bring up the existing deposits and it would, I am sure, be resisted.  I would not be averse to having it raised later on if agreement was reached and people found that it was essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully raised that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Desmond.  I know that if new unions are formed under this Bill they will be obliged to sustain higher deposits than those registered under the 1941 Act.  To that extent there will be two scales of deposit.  Deputy Desmond referred to the ascending scale which can go up to £15,000.  There is an ascending scale in the 1941 Act which can go up to, I think, £10,000; so it is not an innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the case of the one man protest at Dún Laoghaire &mdash;the cinema case.  The only thing I can say about that is that I will have the matter examined since he saw fit to raise it here.  Most of the discussion <Col N="305" /> was on a rather conciliatory basis and played in a low key.  Since I took over the Ministry of Labour I have always been rather careful not to tread on any acrimonious ground or enter into any aggressive discussions, particularly of a political nature.  Deputy O'Leary did make charges that this party were seeking to undermine the trade unions. I do not think anybody could sustain that argument.  I would be the very first to object to any such thing.  One thing that must be agreed is that the trade unionist is free to belong to any political party he may wish.  The political levy is operated in such a way that one must opt out.  This has been changed here time and again, as it has been in England.  At one time you were out and you had to opt in.  As it is now, you are in and you have to opt out.  The charge is made that sometimes it is not made pleasant for the person who wants to opt out but no definite case of that has been brought to my attention and I would take a very serious view if one were.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary made some reference to the political side.  Reference was made to things that are not in the Bill and there was some suggestion by Deputy Belton that there might have been many other things in the Bill.  The 1966 Bill which fell with the dissolution of the Dáil in 1969 did contain many other proposals, some of which were more controversial. One might say that the thing to do would be to deal with them as a package and get the lot through but I took the decision that we would take the very essential and less controversial proposals and have them put through, those things on which a reasonable measure of agreement can be reached.  As I said the other day in a Press conference, I am still prepared to do that in relation to the remaining provisions of the 1966 Bill. There were in that Bill some very essential provisions which would be of mutual benefit to management and workers and would be in the national interest.  On these things we can find some common ground and deal with them.  Some of them have been referred to here already.  I do not think it is necessary to say anything further <Col N="307" /> at this Stage, particularly if the House will consider giving me all Stages tonight.</P>
      <P>I want again to assure the House that this piece of legislation was taken out of the other Bill because it was regarded as a matter of some urgency on which a reasonable measure of agreement was shown.  I welcome the constructive and very satisfying debate on the Bill.  Although at times the debate went outside the scope of the Bill and matters not concerned with the Bill were brought up, they were all matters that I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss another day.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question, not in any sense of malice.  I agree with the Minister that the debate has been on a nice even keel.  We Irish are a very argumentative group and very independently-minded. In view of the equanimity of this debate, is the Minister satisfied that if some recalcitrant group of people take this Bill to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court on the basis that there must be a minimum of 500 members, it will be found to be constitutional?  I am not saying that it is wrong to have a minimum of 500 members.  Not at all.  That is not the point.  We have had experience in this House of a Bill being passed on which there was great unanimity and which was found to be unconstitutional and, since the Referendum Bill is not yet through, I am afraid the High Court and the Supreme Court still have a say in the matter.  Now I come to the question.  Is the Minister satisfied that, suppose some difficult group of people&mdash;as indeed did happen when two unions were joining up a few years ago&mdash;a very similar case&mdash; take this Bill to the courts on the basis that the Constitution does not provide for any number like 500&mdash;in fact you can form a trade union in the morning with five people in it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will say ten.  I am not saying that it will happen, but suppose it does happen, has the Minister had any advice that, in fact, the Bill will stand up if it is challenged <Col N="308" /> in the court under our Constitution on the basis of the figure of 500?  I am not saying that his figure is wrong.  On the contrary, I think there is a good deal to be said for it.  I should like the Minister to tell us what he thinks of this.</P>

      <P>The provision for appeal to the High Court should remove to a great extent any doubt about the constitutionality of the measure.  I could visualise a small number of select people who could be deprived under this Bill of forming a union who could succeed in court on an appeal. Somebody said to me that if actuaries wanted to have their own union they would be rather thin on the ground. They might be entitled to go to court. I could see them possibly succeeding. That provision which is in the Bill does help to remove any doubt about the constitutionality.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last night, I promised the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that I would not <Col N="309" /> delay the House very long more.  I promise the Acting Chairman now that the promise I made last night still stands. I have just a few points to make.  I am glad Deputy Healy is in the Chair because what I said last night might be taken by some as not absolutely accurate.  I am referring to my reference to the Cork TD.  If they want to correct me they will have ample opportunity to do so and, if I am wrong, I shall be the first to apologise.</P>
      <P>I was talking last night about the annoyance suffered by southern people generally because of the reluctance of the Minister to introduce multi-channel television in that part of the country. Most people in the south feel they are being discriminated against.  I thanked the Minister last night for the improvement in reception in Fermoy town. There is, however, a growing resentment because people believe they are not being treated equitably and I believe that statement fairly represents the views of those for whom I speak.  I would be quite happy if, when the Minister comes to reply, he says he will do something now, or in six or 12 months time, or that he will not do anything at all during his time as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I will be quite happy to accept what he says provided everyone understands exactly where we stand.  I will be quite happy if I have something definite to tell the people in Cork.</P>
      <P>I have never found the Minister go back on any promise he made.  The difficulty in Cork is that we are all apparently talking with different voices and in divers tongues.  I hope the Minister will tell us exactly where we stand.</P>
      <P>As far as television programmes are concerned, all the people I know have a high regard for &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;.  It is more fashionable, I think, to knock programmes than to praise them.  The most intelligent and the most humorous programme on RTE is &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;.  The only difficulty is the timing.  Masses are often celebrated at seven o'clock on Sunday evening and sometimes &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; almost comes between oneself and one's religion.  Could I suggest that it should be either put forward or put back? That would suit us all.</P>

      <P>This team does a great job.  I should like now to put on record my appreciation of the faithful service given by post office officials and telephonists from one end of the country to the other.

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  We should set about improving conditions for these telephonists immediately.  The Minister will say that conditions have been improved, but a great deal yet remains to be done.  The accommodation is bad.  It is, of course, absolutely wrong that these should be abused by public subscribers.  I have a great sympathy for them.  Some are there for quite a few years.  Others change fairly rapidly.  I suppose that it is only to be anticipated when girls are young and pretty; the single good-looking girl adopts a different role in life.  The Minister should look into the conditions under which they work because several of them have had nervous breakdowns as a result of the strain under which they are working and the abuse they get from subscribers.  That is an unfortunate state of affairs but it is time it was said.  I would like the Minister to state that he intends to improve their position; this might be some kind of solace to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to post office officials generally the Minister is improving their conditions.  I want to put on record my appreciation of his stand in relation to the auxiliary postman. Many ex-Ministers for Posts and <Col N="311" /> Telegraphs must be worrying today because they did not do what was crying out to be done years ago when we had a situation where auxiliary postmen were working for 40 years and retiring without a pension.  I should like to thank the Minister on their behalf for what he has done.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying will he tell me if the report I read in the newspapers some weeks ago that many of the tapes of Jimmy O'Dea and David Kelly in the railway scenes have been lost is true or false?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that specifically when I reply.  This query has been raised by other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very sorry if they are lost because I never enjoyed any programmes as much as I enjoyed them.</P>
      <P>Most of us seem to have forgotten how valuable the radio is.  It is only when one is in hospital or in some other unfortunate circumstance that one turns on the radio.  As soon as one does turn on the radio the life, the fun, the song and the dance of the old days comes straight back to one. From 8 o'clock in the morning until midnight one can hear lively and entertaining programmes on the radio. We are losing a great deal by not listening more to the radio.  When one is looking at television one cannot read in the paper what Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said in Galway but if one is listening to the radio one can read the paper as well.  I want to put on record my appreciation of the great job those people on the radio station do.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude by saying that whatever I might have said about the multi-channel TV in Cork I certainly did not intend to hurt anybody.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that any help he can give us will be reciprocated by me and by several other Cork Deputies as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues Deputy Desmond, Deputy Tully and Deputy Browne have already spoken on this Estimate and have covered <Col N="312" /> most of the considerable range of topics to which the Estimate has referred. I want to intervene primarily on one particular subject which arises on the Estimate and which has a bearing on other national issues and that is the Minister's written direction to the RTE Authority of 1st October, 1971. This is a difficult, delicate, important issue and I am going to come to it shortly.</P>
      <P>However, there are a few things that happened in the course of the debate itself to which I would like to refer at this stage, one of which is linked to the Minister's directive, that is a matter which arose during Deputy Crowley's speech.  The reference is in the Official Report of 18th November, 1971, Volume 256, column 2483 and in order to refresh the memory of the House I am going to read out the exchange but before doing so I would like to say why.  I am going to read it because I think the Deputy concerned deliberately and the Minister inadvertently have done something which is unfair to individuals.  They have used the privilege of this House in a way in which it should not be used in relation to individuals and in breach of a rather well established convention. Let me read out the passage concerned:</P>
      <P>...I must strike an unhappy note...</P>
      <P>He was as good as his word, I must say.  The Deputy continues:</P>
      <P>...and say that Telefís Éireann present some programmes that are neither balanced nor objective.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to that as a general comment.  He continues:</P>
      <P>One such programme is &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;&mdash;a programme that is masqueraded as a programme in Irish but half of which is presented in English and one chairman of which was an unsuccessful politician who has a lot of political bias.</P>
      <P>That is quite a severe charge in his professional capacity against an identifiable person.  It was made here in a way in which it is possible to work out by elimination who was intended because this is a small community.  He went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> When we get this opportunity of talking on this aspect, we should speak out as strongly about subjects as he seems to speak, subjects about which, in my opinion, he knows very little.</P>
    <P>Mr. Desmond: Who?</P>
    <P>Mr. Crowley: Mr. MacAonghusa.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was blamed later on for asking the name.  I think Deputy Desmond acted legitimately in asking &ldquo;who&rdquo; because he was faced with an innuendo by which someone was going to be damaged, possibly the man intended, possibly not.  Deputy Desmond asked the question and he got this reply.  I shall continue to quote from the Official Report, column 2483, Vol. 256:</P>
    <P>Mr. Desmond: He is not the only person involved in the &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; programme.</P>
    <P>Mr. Crowley: I am talking about one man.  I know that he is a member of the political party to which Deputy Desmond belongs.</P>
    <P>I believe this is factually incorrect.  I shall continue quoting from the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Mr. G. Collins: I think, too, that on one occasion he was seeking Deputy Desmond's seat in Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown but Deputy Desmond dealt with that.</P>
    <P>I think that was intended to be a jocular intervention, a harmless one in its intent, but I think it unfortunate that the Minister should become involved in this particular kind of exercise.  In the same column it is stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Crowley: Yes, but we are all aware of the vitriolic pen of this particular gentleman, Mr. MacAonghusa.</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: Individuals should not be discussed in this manner.</P>
    <P>Very properly, the Ceann Comhairle intervened.  That is the point I am trying to make here, that this kind of comment on people responsible for organising a particular programme necessarily involves comment on a few <Col N="314" /> identifiable individuals in ways that can be damaging to them in their professional capacities.  People who work in radio and television are especially exposed in this regard.  By the nature of their work they are more exposed than are people who work for other kinds of State authorities.  This indicates that we should act with a certain amount of delicacy in their regard if they are to remain possessed of the same rights as other citizens and not be stripped of these rights because they appear on television.  At column 2484, Vol. 256, it is stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Crowley: However, the most obvious example of what I have in mind and which I saw being perpetrated by the &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; programme was an interview with a certain member of an illegal organisation. This interview was in English but in the Irish news bulletin that went out before the programme, this man gave the interview in Irish.  I am merely wondering why the interview in Irish could not have been used on the &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; programme.  I am suspicious about the motives of &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Deputy is present and, for his benefit, I shall recapitulate the point I was making.  The point I was making was that comment of this kind is unfair to identifiable individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Crowley regarding the provision of multi-channel TV in areas outside Dublin.  This is a matter to which the Minister is giving attention and it is well that Dublin Deputies should add their mite of support to what Deputies from areas other than Dublin have said on this matter, which is important to a sizable number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to something Deputy Tunney said because it has important implications for what is expected of television and radio here. Deputy Tunney drew a rather moving picture in a way, of a family watching a certain kind of television show, a show the intellectual level of which was, in Deputy Tunney's opinion, unduly elevated.  This imaginary family consisted of an elderly father who had not got his primary certificate and had not got far with his education but his children were bright and reasonably well educated.  According to Deputy Tunney there is an unhappy, embarrassed pause when the show is over because they cannot discuss the show as the father is not educated and the children are educated.  As a little drama in itself it was not bad, but I do not think I liked the implications Deputy Tunney seemed to derive from it.  The Deputy seemed to say that in order to avoid this kind of unhappy scene, our television and radio programmes should never rise above a point immediately and totally assimilable by an elderly gentleman with very little education.  Surely this is a recipe for debasing the intelligence, the education and range of interest of the people?  We are in the habit of complaining, and rightly so, of the penal laws as a disastrous chapter in which the lack of access to education was one of the gravest matters.  According to Deputy Tunney's calculus it appears this was a good thing because it kept the family together.  There were no unpleasant discrepancies in education between them.  This is an unfortunate approach to the question of radio and television.  It is obvious that there is, as in every country, a fairly wide range of education and different kinds of interest among the people.  It should be the task of radio and television both <Col N="317" /> to cover that range, to interest people in every category of it, though not with every programme, and to draw people out, to encourage their intellectual as well as their other interests.</P>
    <P>Something which Deputy Tully said which was very interesting shows that can be done.  Deputy Tully was discussing the point sometimes made that television has the effect of distracting children from their education and in fact inhibiting and retarding their intellectual growth.  What Deputy Tully said was, and I refer to the Official Report of Thursday, 18th November, at column 258:</P>
    <P>I am a member of a library committee and we found that when television first became popular the demand for books decreased.  However, within two years we found that the demand for books which were unheard of before this, particularly by children and young adults, was astonishing.  There has been a complete reversal and there is more reading of worthwhile books than ever before.  That is a complete answer to those who say that people do not read if they look at television. </P>
    <P>When I questioned Deputy Tully about this library committee experience, he said that the children were not only looking for more books but were looking for more serious books, for a higher proportion of non-fiction, of history and biography books they might never have heard of or known to be interesting, had it not been for this medium, so that I do not think that in the use of the medium those who control it should be held to the idea which seemed to be put forward by Deputy Tully that everything should be kept on a very simple level, suited to poor people of very limited education only. I do not think that is what people want and I do not even think that it is what people who are conscious of limitations in education, as everybody must be, want either.  They want something that will test them, will arouse their interest, will draw them on a bit.  They do not want it completely out of range.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer, before I come to my main topic, to this question of destroying records.  I know that the Minister has referred to this matter <Col N="318" /> in answers to questions and I found his answer interesting and going a considerable distance to meet the public disquiet about this, but I still would like some further information about it. This is a question, of course, of national importance as it concerns the role of radio and television, as by now, radio especially has a very significant part of our national archives and national historical material.  We can grasp the interest of that at once if we could imagine radio going back to the 18th century and we heard the recorded voices of Wolfe Tone and Edmund Burke which we could use for schools and for ourselves and some of the matter on record in RTE will be of equivalent interest in the years to come, we may be sure.  It is not always easy to know just what, but it would be interesting to know something about the criteria which RTE are applying in this matter.  What do they decide to keep and what to throw away?  I am not quite satisfied when they tell us that the best of Jimmy O'Dea was kept.  I would like to know by whose judgment.  Was it, for example, Jimmy O'Dea?  Was he consulted in his lifetime as to what he would like kept, what he considered to be the high points.  Was any effort made in that direction?  What I would like to know is whether we could have something in the nature of an index of material preserved by RTE.  I am not speaking of things that happened over the past ten years&mdash;they are still formative&mdash;but of the material that has been kept from, in particular, the very early years, the first and second decade of sound radio&mdash;just what is still there. This is the kind of thing that might perhaps be circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The second thing to know would be what rules are applied, what criteria are used, by RTE in determining what to keep and not to keep.  There is a tremendous amount of obviously ephemeral material which has to go, but in the case of a composer like Ó Riada or a comedian like Jimmy O'Dea, it is not so easy to know just what should be ephemeral or not, so the question of the rules is important. It is also important to know who decides, at what level are these <Col N="319" /> decisions taken.  Are they delegated away down or is there a fairly high level committee which meets to consider the doubtful cases?  These are three things I would like to know.</P>
    <P>I come now to the point of the written direction to the Authority, the direction which might be broadly described as against allowing IRA recruiting to happen on television.  This is a difficult matter and I would like to start off by fully recognising that there is a difficulty.  I would agree that it is highly undesirable to allow radio and television to be used for the purpose of whipping up violent emotion or sustaining violent activity. That is highly undesirable.  It is also undesirable to institute a system of political censorship and I agree that between the application of these two principles, there is a decidedly grey area.  I think that on this the Government have come down too heavily and too much, in, in fact, the spirit of the censor, and also too vaguely.  I am being critical here and I would like to keep my criticism as temperate as I can in relation to a subject which I agree is of difficulty.  I should like also to make it clear that my criticisms are not aimed personally at the Minister.  My criticisms are directed at what I think was essentially a Government action which the Minister here executes.</P>
    <P>It raises a lot of difficult issues.  The relevant paragraph in the Minister's speech, begins with the words &ldquo;On the 28th of September, 1971, members of an illegal organisation were interviewed on a television programme&rdquo;. Here the Minister's direction says flatly &ldquo;members of an illegal organisation were interviewed&rdquo;.  Therefore, the Minister is telling us he knows that these were members of an illegal organisation.  If it is known to the Government that they were members of an illegal organisation, why are they not prosecuted?  This is a question that inevitably comes to mind. When we occasionally question the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, about such matters, the Minister professes extreme political agnosticism on the topic&mdash;he does not know what IRA people and he says, &ldquo;If you have evidence to suggest that people belong <Col N="320" /> to the IRA, given people, give the information to the Attorney General.&rdquo; He has said this more than once in reply to questions.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has that information, perhaps he will give it to the Attorney General because he says here, not people believed to be, not people thought to be or people who might be, but just flatly &ldquo;members of an illegal organisation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think we have to ask him how he knows this.  I do not think there is much difficulty about knowing it because there are many people who are known in that general sense of popular repute and by their own statements to be leading members of one or other IRA and who remain very comfortably and very openly around the place.  So, the Government seem to have it a little both ways there.  The sentence goes on &ldquo;people interviewed on a television programme, &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, in a way which I and the Government consider to be prejudicial to the public interest...&rdquo; As Deputy Dr. Browne has pointed out, and I agree, this is one of those ultra-vague portmanteau phrases which can cover a great deal of intrusion into the area of the rights of the citizen because most of us, particularly those of us in public life, behave from time to time in a manner which others consider prejudicial to the public interest.  We on these benches consider that the whole Fianna Fáil Party is constantly acting in a manner prejudicial to the public interest but we would not presume to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the phrase &ldquo;prejudicial to the public interest&rdquo; which I think is extremely vague and dangerous here particularly as it precedes this direction. &ldquo;Following full consideration and with the approval of the Government I issued a written direction to the authority on 1st October, 1971, to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class i.e. any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates&rdquo;&mdash; where have I heard those words before? &mdash;&ldquo;the attaining of any particular objective by violent means&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This, again, is a direction couched in words that are so vague that they must permeate all the workings of RTE at present with perplexity and difficulty. &ldquo;Any matter that could be calculated...&rdquo; By whom?  By the listeners?  By the authority?  By the Minister?  &ldquo;...to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in,&rdquo;&mdash;that is clear enough &mdash;&ldquo;promotes,&rdquo;&mdash;clear enough&mdash;&ldquo;encourages or advocates...&rdquo; this is the very wording of the Forcible Entry Bill. In its original form it seems to be wording which is particularly dear to the Government.  It is, of course, dear to them because it is loose in a way which extends the scope of arbitrary intervention into the activities of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> The point about &ldquo;encourages&rdquo; which we made <i>ad nauseum</i> in the long debate on the Forcible Entry Bill is that a person may inadvertently &ldquo;encourage&rdquo;; you cannot inadvertently engage in, promote or advocate but you can inadvertently encourage.</P>
    <P>It could be said, for example, that Fianna Fáil by some of its activities, by its very frequent commemoration of actions of the past is encouraging violence in the sense that people who hear that sort of language from those benches, who take part in certain commemorations, who see them and hear the narratives of survivors some of whom sympathise with the people referred to here may be encouraged to attain a particular objective by violent means.  It is known&mdash;at least Deputy Blaney made no secret of it&mdash;that he does believe that one particular objective, to wit, the unification of Ireland, may be attained, if necessary, by violent means.  Does that mean that Deputy Blaney is off the air?  An organisation like Aontacht Éireann appears to many of us to be encouraging and even sometimes advocating this kind of activity.  Are they off the air also? Of course, the various extreme left movements, the various communist parties and so on would all fall under this.  Then certain Deputies affect to regard this party as a communist or semi-communist organisation.  If so, we would fall under this because communists undoubtedly do advocate the attaining of a particular objective by violent means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that annoys the Deputy and I am sorry about it but I cannot help it.  I am just illustrating the dangerously wide scope of this.  The Minister adds: &ldquo;This was the first time any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs used the powers of prohibition conferred on him by section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960&rdquo;.  This means that this direction is a watershed in the history of radio and television in this country, a watershed on the other side of which it is easy to foresee increasing use of such powers.  The very <Col N="323" /> interpretation of this existing direction gives a widely proliferating range of possible intervention.</P>
      <P>I am certainly prepared to believe that the Minister would not wish to use his powers in order to gag RTE in a general way or to extend, within his use of it at any rate, unnecessarily the range of ministerial power of censorship. None the less, the decisive step has been taken: for the first time these powers have been used and already certainly radio and television here are less free in relation to the State than they were before because, up to this point, the fact that this power existed in the wings was one thing: such a power can exist, as has happened in other countries, and never been applied.  It can almost rust away; it can become so unthinkable in terms of convention and tradition that it would be applied that it simply fades but once it has been used people feel it can be used again.  Of course, this chimes in with interventions like those of Deputy Crowley attacking particular programmes.  There is a certain sense of mild intimidation about the whole process: the Government do this; supporters of the Government attack aspects of RTE's working in unbridled terms and people there must feel a little nervous and uncomfortable. I do not think this is to the public benefit.  We will agree the RTE should not, in the Taoiseach's words, provide a recruiting platform for the various IRAs.</P>

      <P>What we are saying is that we are against a recruiting platform being provided for the IRA either in RTE or elsewhere.  In fact, it is illegal to recruit for the IRA, but, as we know well, they are recruiting and are collecting quite openly throughout the country while the <Col N="324" /> Government look very much the other way except when it happens on RTE. This is what we do not like and we do not like the fact that the Government singled out RTE for the application of the general rule of the law that they possess and that they imposed that law only on RTE.</P>
      <P>It is undesirable that there should be special rules for RTE and that the consequences of certain instruments of the law should be applied only to RTE.  Is the idea, in part, to cut off from undue public attention what is actually happening in this country? Could this be the beginning of a kind of process which, so far as radio and television are concerned, would prevent the Irish people from knowing the full measure of that is happening?</P>
      <P>I do not know what other conclusion one can draw from the fact that recruiting platforms for the IRA are general throughout the country but that RTE are under heavy warnings as to what they should do in respect of this organisation, that is to say, that if such a recruiting meeting were to be held, the Government would do nothing about it but if RTE were to report the meeting, the Government would do something about RTE.  Is that acceptable?  Special rules for RTE are undesirable and special rules for people are undesirable.</P>
      <P>There are now a set of people in this country who are not being charged with any offence but who are being blacklisted within a particular medium by Government decision.  They are perfectly free to operate in the country.  The Minister for Justice says he does not know them to be IRA men but his colleague in the same Government, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, refers quite confidently to at least two of them as being members of an illegal organisation.  Therefore, part of the Government know of them while another part are not aware of them. What does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that people who are not charged with any offence can be blacklisted on this particular medium which, to a great extent, is supposed to be independent and autonomous means that other people can be blacklisted also in due course.  Why not, since <Col N="325" /> nothing has to be proven against them and all that need be said is that they are prejudicial to the public interest? It is the thin end of the wedge.  Methods such as this were applied in the past to French television but such methods have done nothing to increase the repute of either the French television authorities or of the French Government in relation to freedom of the Press, radio and television.</P>
    <P>This principle could be extended by gradation to anybody that Fianna Fáil considers to be extreme and eventually that could include everyone not belonging to Fianna Fáil.  We are still a long way from that, but it is this that is worrying in relation to the watershed because it seems to me to be downhill once this section of the Act has been applied and once it has been applied in such a generalised and ambiguous way.</P>
    <P>The Government have no wish to deal with the illegal organisations concerned, in themselves, but they have a wish to clip the wings of RTE whose handling of social criticism they may find inconvenient and so they bring RTE under closer Government control. It is much easier for them to get tough with RTE than to get tough with the IRA.  It is this Government's inclination due, perhaps, to their internal divisions, to choose the easier course. Throughout these difficult years it is with RTE that the Government have shown the greatest tendency to get tough.  We saw this in respect of the unfortunate &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; affair and I think many people connected with this medium believe that things are closing in on them, that the days when they had a kind of independence that could be compared with that possessed by, say, the BBC, while not over, are coming to an end.</P>
    <P>This kind of censorship is pervasive, is damaging to the medium, is damaging to the viewers who depend on the medium, in particular for its coverage of the news, and it tends to be ineffective in relation to its particular objective.  Part of the reason for that is that among people who are handling news and comment there is, because of their profession and character, a tendency to resist censorship <Col N="326" /> and to display independence from it with the result that since these words are extremely impalpable, the calculation of their effect is extremely difficult. As a result of an effort to impose a kind of crude censorship, there may be built up a more diffused kind of influencing the public in favour of these organisations.  This can be done, of course, by various forms of hints, including visual hints so that you can have a running down of general standards in RTE by reason of the existence of this kind of censorship combined with relative ineffectiveness for the kind of thing at which it is aimed.</P>
    <P>A move of this kind aimed at &ldquo;members of an illegal organisation&rdquo; who yet are not charged with any offence creates sympathy for the IRA in that they are considered to be discriminated against in so far as that people who have no evidence against them which they can bring to court, can penalise them without making any charge.  Fairminded people resent that kind of situation.  Therefore the Government, by administrative action, can find these certain people, including the two people referred to in the preamble to the directive, to be something which it is a criminal offence to be but in respect of which no charge is made. This surely is a most extraordinary use of Governmental power.</P>
    <P>Another undesirable aspect of this decision is that it creates a kind of respect for the people concerned, including the two people here envisaged, that these are mysterious, unanswerable people, that if they appear they have such a tremendous impact on the public mind that the Government do not dare to face this. I think that on this, RTE's own handling of the kind of episode which gave rise to this, deserves some criticism.  The criticism could point to the right way to deal with this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>It so happens that I was on the panel on the 28th September, 1971, at Montrose Studio before which these members of an illegal organisation were interviewed.  This was a strange process and I think it was a very faulty process and invited, in a sense, the kind of very drastic and undesirable action <Col N="327" /> which was later taken.  The way this was done was that these two people did not, like ordinary mortals, take part on the panel where they would have risked a back answer from other participants on the panel, where they might have been cut down to size, where they would be appearing as ordinary mortals.  They did it quite differently.  These two appeared as disembodied heads on screens within screens like the armed head that the witches use as a prop in Macbeth for &ldquo;conning&rdquo; people.  They appeared like this.  They made pontificial announcements which nobody had a chance of questioning.  The question master set the panel to answer questions which immediately had them arguing among themselves about another aspect of what was coming up. It was all pressed and hasty as far as the panel were concerned.  I think these panel discussions are to some extent a waste of time.  There are too many people scrabbling around for the topic and not finding it.  Separate from the panel you had these two oracular heads who were simply addressing the people, whom nobody was answering, and who had an opportunity of making their essentially recruiting appeal and I think that is what it was.  They were drumming things up.  I think that undesirable, just as I think it is undesirable to take them off, to say: &ldquo;We cannot hear you at all.  You must get off&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would suggest in regard to these people who are alleged to be, and alleged by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to be, members of an illegal organisation&mdash;but against whom his colleague can apparently find no evidence&mdash;who are in this peculiar category, flatly described here as members of an illegal organisation without proof or even charge, that as long as they are in that position, as long as the Government have not charged them, let alone convicted them, they must be treated on the same footing as any other citizen.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;on the same footing&rdquo;.  I do not say &ldquo;above&rdquo;.  I do not think they should get these oracular spots.  They should be put in where people can <Col N="328" /> argue with them and where it will be found that their arguments are not so invulnerable.  Appearances of that kind, appearances in adversary conditions and conditions where they can be contradicted will not have the effect of turning RTE into a recruiting platform for these organisations and may very well have the opposite result.  I would hope that there may be a chance of reconsidering this whole approach.  There are signs that the Minister at least disliked having to issue this direction.  He said:</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that it was with great reluctance that I came to the conclusion that it was necessary in the public interest to invoke that section of the Act.</P>
    <P>May we take it that as soon as the present crisis in this island diminishes in intensity&mdash;I hope there may be some signs that it may be beginning to diminish in intensity&mdash;the Minister will reconsider this directive in the direction, first of all, of narrowing the scope, making it more precise, more clear, but as soon as possible withdrawing it altogether?  I would hope that the Minister might meet with the authority and discuss with them how best the danger I referred to earlier on, of RTE being used as a recruiting platform, may be met without limiting the right to free discussion.  What I am suggesting is that it can be met precisely by applying the right of free discussion to the hilt, by what has been called &ldquo;the cleansing power of debate&rdquo;.  Let these people be heard but let them be answered, not interviewed by a deferential, perhaps slightly obsequious news reporter who is impressed by these gentlemen and tosses them gentle questions that they can deal with.  Let them be put on where they meet people who are thoroughly opposed to their activities and who can and will answer them.  That is the answer and I hope very much that the Minister will not dismiss the idea of moving along these lines because if we move in the direction in which this seems to point, in the direction in which I hope the Minister does not want to move, we will be beginning to choke RTE, beginning to turn it into an official mouthpiece as the French <Col N="329" /> radio and television became under the Gaullists.  That is decidedly a danger not to be ignored and one against which we have a duty to warn here. I do not think we should be distracted from that duty by the thought that the activities and speeches which the Minister has in view here are thoroughly repugnant to us, as they are. On the contrary, that is an additional reason.  When one sees people being gagged one has an additional reason, in conscience, for looking at the question of what the gag means and whether it is worthwhile or a good thing.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect connected with this to which I should like to refer and in relation to which I should like to make a suggestion.  This is the controversial question of news coverage by RTE especially in relation to the crisis in the North.  We all know this problem where the coverage by so very live a medium as television of particular events becomes a part of the event and where many people feel that it makes the process of violence go even faster than it otherwise would. This is a very difficult problem to which I think the right answer is that in near civil war conditions the most dangerous thing is rumour, the most dangerous thing is the multiplication of what is supposed to have happened in the next village, where people full of passion will spread the most alarming rumours and convince themselves hysterically where they saw some very nasty act that what happened was ten or a hundred times more nasty.  I have seen the effect of the spread of rumour of that kind in two African civil wars and in India. It certainly is the most destructive thing that can be imagined.  It is much more destructive than accurate news coverage even though that may shock and to some extent inflame.  It is better than reliance on rumour.  I have no doubt about that.  At the same time, I think that there is room for criticism in RTE's coverage of that particular news.  I am not blaming the individual reporters but it is the case that a reporter in a given situation identifies with a given group and he comes out of it sounding much less like a <Col N="330" /> reporter than like a spokesman for the group, arguing rather than reporting, at least in his tone.  At least that has been my impression.  But, I do not think that we here should debate RTE news coverage&mdash;it would be dangerous that we should do so&mdash;in terms of &ldquo;I liked this; I did not like that.  I did not like what he said&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would think that a kind of advisory committee could be useful here.  One hesitates a little bit about suggesting a new advisory committee but I am not suggesting the kind of committee that sits down and after a while issues a ponderous report that nobody reads. I am thinking of something much more live.  I am thinking of something like, for example, in the United States, the Associated Press, the wire service. They have a process whereby the editors who take their service constitute themselves into a sort of critics' box and supply a running criticism of the Associated Press coverage of different stories, which is important, of course, to the participating newspapers and very important to the staff of the wire service in question, and provides the flow, incidentally, of very acute, technically well-informed criticism of a news flow which undoubtedly benefits not only the wire service in question and the participating papers but the public generally through keeping up a better, and a better balanced, flow of news.  That is, of course, in relation to a wire service, a news agency.</P>
    <P>What I am wondering is whether something analogous could not be done&mdash;it would be a new departure but we are in a situation where a new departure might be of value&mdash;in relation to a news service supplied by a national radio and television, whether, for example, a committee could not be formed, made up of the editors or their deputies, of all the daily newspapers in this island.  I say all the daily newspapers in this island deliberately because these would include representatives, for example, of the two northern Unionist daily newspapers, <i>The Belfast Telegraph</i> and <i>Belfast Newsletter.</i>  These have occasionally criticised, sometimes in quite a virulent way, the kind of news coverage and comment which RTE is putting out and, of course RTE's services are receivable <Col N="331" /> in parts of the North.  There are ambitions to make them more widely heard.  If they are to be widely heard it would be very good that we would be in continuous contact with the reactions of the minority community in this island, the majority community in Northern Ireland, the community of one million Ulster Protestants who are also largely, by politics, Unionist.  An advisory committee of that kind could be of value discussing coverage of particular stories.  It would be a highly well-informed body both North and south. It would be critical but through informed criticism and I think it should be useful to participating newspapers, to RTE and, therefore, through that process to the public generally who are dependent on the flow of news both through RTE and through the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I throw out that idea and I would like it to be considered both by the Minister and the authority to see whether some approach of that kind would be to them acceptable if others wish to participate in it, and then for the consideration of the newspapers and media journalists themselves, to see whether an institution of that kind would meet a need, as I believe it would.  I am not concerned directly with their professional needs but I am concerned with the public needs which their profession serves and which are of very great importance at the moment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the thing cannot be done in that way.  Perhaps there would not be support for such a method of procedure but, if so, on those who rule it out devolves a duty of finding a better way of making informed criticism of news coverage from this source which is without a competitor in this country. That is why I think it is open to this particular scrutiny.  This would give RTE in its news coverage a kind of protection from uninformed criticism, which is also important, and it would mean that when this House came to debate these questions it would be in possession of the informed views of people with widely different opinions but high professional competence.  I think that approaches of that kind, a <Col N="332" /> greater emphasis on the actual use of debate and on the improvement of criticism of news coverage, and improvement of news coverage through that criticism, would be a better way of dealing with this range of delicate problems than is the imposition of a kind of censorship.  The Government seem to have chosen the road of censorship. I hope they are not going to go down it.  I hope they will find the courage to turn back from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The debate has covered a very wide field.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs plays an important part in all our lives.  The Department employs 20,800 persons.  By virtue of that fact alone it merits serious consideration in this House with reference to the standards under which these people work, the services they give and our dependence on them.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to deal with the telephone service and the standards which obtain.  We all agree that the telephone is an important factor in our lives both in the private sector and in the commercial life of the country.  In this city it is difficult to maintain public kiosks and telephones in general.  If one goes through the city of Dublin tonight he will find that half the telephones in the kiosks are broken.  This is a continuing problem and there seems to be no solution to it.  I know that supervising them and keeping them in order is a difficult problem.  Unfortunately we have in our society today individuals who seem to have no respect for public telephones.  That is especially true in the built-up areas and these are the areas in which the people do not have very many private telephones. In Ballyfermot, Crumlin and in my own constituency one will as often as not find public telephones out of order. Residents in these areas may need the services of the fire brigade, of an ambulance or of a doctor and it is not unusual for them to have to travel a mile before they can find a telephone in working order.  People will have to be educated in civics.  This is something that could be done in the schools.  Programmes on television could portray the damage they do not alone to public property but to their own neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> During the past 12 months 23,000 new telephones were installed.  This is a big advance, but there is still a backlog.  Even with the injection of an extra £10 million this year there will still be a backlog.  The capital invested is giving a return of 8.9 per cent.  This is one section of the Department which is a paying proposition.  I suggest that the telephone section be taken away altogether from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and set up as an independent semi-State body.  It could then get private capital to improve the telephone service.  When we enter the Common Market we will have to have the same standards as those which obtain in European countries. It is difficult for the Government to apportion all the money required to this particular section because there are certain priorities, such as housing, agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual to get crossed lines and so on.  This is due to overloading. New cables should be laid. When the necessary capital is available I am sure these faults will be corrected. It seems to be the policy of the Department to site kiosks where they believe they will pay their way. This is a service to the community and it might not always be desirable to place a kiosk in the most densely populated area.  This is a service and the purpose of any service is to facilitate the community needing the service. The repair and removal of telephones is a bit of a problem.  Recently a gentleman was decorating his premises and he wanted the telephone removed. This can take a considerable length of time.  Probably the section is understaffed, but contractors will not wait upon anyone.  The job must be done in a given time.  It cannot be postponed until someone comes to remove a telephone.</P>
    <P>The telephonists are doing an excellent job.  It is a difficult job.  It can be irritating at times waiting for a number.  By and large they work under difficult conditions.  At night time it takes quite a while before one gets a reply, but that is due to under staffing and one must make allowances.</P>
    <P>The Department is to be congratulated on its postal service.  It is excellent <Col N="334" /> in Dublin.  I cannot speak for the rest of the country, but I am sure the service is just as good there.  The Minister said that 90 per cent of the letters posted in time are delivered the following day.  That is an excellent record.</P>
    <P>Everybody has his own ideas as to how Telefís Éireann should operate. I do not envy the controller of programmes because it is impossible to please everyone.  Everyone has his own ideas as to the kind of programme that should be projected, the various organisations that should be represented and how our language and culture should be projected.  I think Telefís Éireann does a reasonably good job. My only criticism would be in regard to some of its films.  There is too much violence.  It would not affect me, but it must have an effect on children.  An effort should be made to project a different image.  Television will be meeting a big challenge in the future. Indeed, it is meeting it today with the communal aerial by means of which it is possible to get outside stations with the same clarity as Telefís Éireann. This is going to create competition for the station.  It is important that RTE maintain and improve their standards because there are some excellent programmes on sport and current affairs such as &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; on the foreign stations.  It is not good enough to say we have so many thousand television licences.  It is the duty of RTE to put on good programmes so that audiences are not attracted to programmes on foreign stations.  When we enter the EEC it may be possible for us to receive European television stations and this will mean even greater competition for RTE.  If the public are not watching RTE, it is obvious that our advertisers will advertise on the channels most viewed in the country.  For the sake of the revenue involved RTE should maintain and improve the standards of the programmes as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more programmes for children on television. There are programmes from four o'clock to six o'clock in the evening but I feel there should be more educational programmes such as carpentry for boys and dressmaking for girls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> I should also like to see programmes once a month about various Government Departments and how they operate.  I am thinking specifically of a programme on the Department of Social Welfare which could explain what benefits people are entitled to. There are many people entitled to benefits who are not aware that they are entitled to them and they come to public representatives and others for advice.  I should also like to see programmes on the workings of the Department of Local Government during which it could be explained to people what they are entitled to in the matter of houses, loans, the building of their own houses and how to purchase houses.  People are kept in the dark about many of these things and although information is available in printed form it would be instructive and informative if such programmes were broadcast on television.  The majority of people are anxious to get information about how they can acquire a house and everyone from teenagers upwards can take an interest in such a subject.</P>
    <P>Current affairs programmes have become very popular.  Such programmes, whether they be political or not, can be very informative.  I saw a programme last night on the maintenance of cars in garages.  I am sure some people thought the programme should not have been broadcast while others will have thought it was an excellent programme.  The public at large are developing an interest in political programmes and it is only right that they should have an idea of how our national Parliament works.  Public representatives and Ministers should be brought more and more into the picture because it is important that the public see how the democratic system operates.  The idea that Dáil Éireann does not serve any useful purpose and that TDs are all the same is a bad philosophy which should not be allowed to develop.  It is a good thing to criticise public representatives and Ministers and we should try to channel more of this into our television service.</P>
    <P>Now that we are about to enter the EEC the public should be informed <Col N="336" /> about what type of a community we are going to enter and what the customs, habits and standards of living of the Six are.  I am not suggesting we have pro-entry or anti-entry programmes but during the coming months the public should be informed about life in the Community.  I do not want RTE to express opinions.  I merely want them to state what conditions in the Community will be like.  People will be going round the country giving their views after Christmas but it would be helpful if RTE gave a balanced view of life in the Community. I should like to know how the Belgians, the French, the Dutch and the Italians live.  The public are entitled to this information because when a referendum is held it is very difficult to get the unvarnished facts.  Only an authority like RTE, which is independent, can give the facts; it is up to the politicians to sell the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien made a long speech dealing with RTE, much of which dealt with the Minister's directive. I see nothing wrong with the Minister's directive.  I would approve of it.  The right thing was done.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien exaggerated it out of all proportion and was unfair to the Minister.  This is the first time this was done and in the general interest and welfare of the country I think it was a right decision.  Having listened to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, one would think the Minister was going to take over the direction of RTE.  I am sure this is very far from the Minister's mind.  I do not think any Minister would like the task of directing RTE.</P>
    <P>We seem quite often to forget the important role radio can play in our lives.  Many people listen to the radio when the television is silent.  There are far more interesting programmes on radio than one will ever get on television.  I mention the Liam Nolan Show which is broadcast every morning on Radio Éireann.  This is an informative and interesting programme and I am amazed that Mr. Nolan can accumulate sufficient items to keep the programme going for an hour every day.  I am sure the housewives who listen to it find it entertaining and informative. <Col N="337" /> We should not run down our radio service and think that the television service is much superior. Both play their part but the radio has a special place in the hearts of the people and I hope this will always be so.  We must ensure that proper standards are maintained in the programmes on radio.  Sometimes, we only think of the glamour attached to Telefís Éireann but we should not neglect our radio programmes.</P>
    <P>Communal aerials are being erected in many parts of the city and this is an improvement over the older type of aerial.  I have been told that only 500 television sets are allowed for each communal aerial.  If this is so, can the Minister state how this figure was arrived at?  It could happen that there would be 600 houses in a housing scheme.  Does this mean it would be necessary to erect an extra communal aerial to cater for the extra 100 people?</P>
    <P>Any person who employs 20,000 people has a special responsibility to the community and the Minister is to be congratulated on the good relations that exist in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  This is no easy task when one considers the large staff involved.  The Minister has been criticised in the past for the various increases but we must look at this matter in a positive manner.  The people in the Minister's employ are entitled to their increase of wages as much as any other section.  When criticism is voiced against the Minister with regard to increased costs it should not be forgotten that the twelfth round wage increase, and the thirteenth round which is pending, have to be taken into account.  The Minister cannot take the money out of his own pocket.</P>
    <P>The political rights of people working in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been referred to by me previously.  The employees should be entitled to declare, if they wish, the political party with which they would like to be affiliated.  Perhaps at a certain high level in the Department there might be certain reasons for not allowing this but this would not apply to the 80 per cent of the people employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  There is no justification <Col N="338" /> why they should not have the right to be attached to political parties.</P>
    <P>By and large, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have done an excellent job in the last 12 months. The post offices and sub-post offices handle a huge volume of business&mdash; something in the region of £36 million turnover in the counter service of the Department.  The service has been carried out in a most efficient manner and the post offices are doing an excellent job, frequently under difficult conditions.  Last year during the bank strike the additional money they handled and the efficient way in which they carried out their business was a great credit to them.  If any help could be given to this sector they are most deserving because they worked long hours under difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>They are in a position to encourage people to save.  If the service is efficient at the post office counter, irrespective of whether it is a young person saving a very small amount or an adult making a sizeable deposit, it will help to encourage saving by the community. The saving certificates and the various other methods of saving are to be commended.  The people who save in the post office are the younger section and they should be given all encouragement possible.  I am glad that savings in the Post Office have increased and I hope this will continue to be the pattern.  This will happen so long as the rate of interest is attractive as compared with other places, many of whom are offering very attractive terms today.  If the Post Office wants sufficient capital, it will have to ensure that it gives a proper return. There are some very attractive schemes operating within the Post Office and I hope they will continue to get the support from the public to which they are entitled because this money is spent for the benefit of the State by and large.</P>
    <P>Any money that can be injected into the telephone section of the Department will pay its way because it is one section under the Minister's control which is a paying proposition, and even if it is separated from the Department and made a semi-State body, with an injection of outside capital, it <Col N="339" /> may be a good investment because it is important that we have a good telephone service, from the point of view of industry and commerce and the social point of view.  The Minister, as I said, is to be congratulated on installing 23,000 this year but there is still room for improvement.  I again congratulate him on his brief and the notes circulated with it.  Where you have under your control 20,000 people, industrial relations are always difficult. It is difficult to keep the machine ticking over smoothly, to avoid disputes and to have good labour relations within the Department.  Where you have such a large number as are in this Department, the humane approach is quite likely to be absent, and it is important that each member under the Minister's control should feel he is playing his part.  I am sure this is the Minister's desire, but we all know that, irrespective of whether you employ four people or 24,000 people, the human element, human consideration, is of vital importance.  It is not what is in the wage packet that always matters to an employee.  It is the recognition of service and the feeling that he is playing his part in the organisation to which he belongs.  Knowing the Minister, I know that this is his concern and nobody would wish more than he would for the smooth functioning of his Department, which is one of his primary objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I sometimes wonder in reading speeches like the Minister's opening speech, whether it is really necessary for the opening speech in a debate of this kind to consist of a long and useful catalogue of facts, not linked together by any overall view, philosophy or strategy.  Speeches of this kind always seem to be composed of the bits and pieces which the different branches of the Department have shoved together.  They even have a tradition as to what order they go in, and when you compare the speech of one year with the next, you find all the bits and pieces put together in the same order.  There is not even a bit of ingenuity exercised in juggling them around.  Generally speaking, Ministers <Col N="340" /> seem to reserve their general reactions and views for the closing speech in the debate.  This seems to me to be curious and I think it is a pity.  I can understand that in the closing speech they are drawing together the threads of the debate, reacting to the ideas thrown out, but the format of ministerial opening and closing speeches always gives me the impression that the Minister is trying to suggest that he has not any ideas but only has ability to react to the ideas thrown out in the House.</P>
      <P>This is not the case because very often Ministers in their replies do more than merely respond to the debates. They come out of their shells a bit and tell us something of their thinking, but it is at the beginning of the debate we want that.  The facts can be circulated in separate documents, now increasingly the practice.  The Minister's opening speech could ignore all these facts and give us his views on how his Department should be run, what the major problems are, how he is tackling them, the priorities he gives to different things, the philosophy and the particular stamp he is trying to leave on his Department, but this we do not get. I think it is a pity.  Ministers do not always do themselves justice in this respect, and this is probably true of the present Minister.</P>
      <P>I wonder would Ministers reconsider this and think of a different approach. It would improve the quality of the debate because we are left in ignorance of what the Minister's thinking is.  We have to debate in a vacuum, with lots of facts and figures, very few of which feature in the subsequent debate, but with very little to get our teeth into as far as the Minister's ideas are concerned and the quality of the debate sometimes suffers from this.  I throw that out as a suggestion.  I also sometimes wonder is there some inexorable law which dictates this, and if when the Government changes, and we find ourselves on that side, we are going to find ourselves churning out the same stuff in the same way.  Is there some reason why it is not possible to rise above this unfortunate tradition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the remarks of the last speaker, in a very thoughtful and constructive contribution, and taking it <Col N="341" /> up where he left off on the point of the humanity with which the organisation is run, this is, I think, a major problem.  It would be a problem in any circumstances to run an organisation with this number of employees in a way that would make each member of it feel that he really was personally considered and that he was a part of a living organisation which was concerned about him, but it is, perhaps, more difficult still when the organisation is a Civil Service department in which the necessary constraints of accountability, for example, and the long traditions of a very rigid hierarchy, sometimes a rather rigid bureaucratic approach, seem to inhibit, if not totally exclude, any humanity of approach.  I think there are problems here which the Minister will not find it easy to tackle but which I am sure he would like to tackle.  This is an area where we could start some kind of limited experiment in industrial democracy.  I do not mean that it must be limited&mdash; I would prefer to see it unlimited&mdash;but one starts experimenting in things of this kind.</P>
    <P>I think there is room for this here. There are many parts of the work of an organisation of this kind where those immediately engaged at ground level in it do acquire from their work and practical experience a volume of ideas and attitudes to their work which is rarely in any organisation adequately mobilised.  I do not think that in the Post Office, any more than in any other Government Department or State bodies the ideas of those engaged in it as to how their own work could best be organised are adequately sought, adequately mobilised.  It can be extraordinary to see how much you can get from the people actually doing a job as to how it should be organised, if you do try to get their views.  If you ever listen to any group of workers discussing their work, when they do so, discussing their bosses, how the work is organised and the efficiency and ability of their bosses, one is always struck by the obvious consideration they give to these matters, by what would appear to be very often the objectivity and accuracy of their assessment and their sense of frustration that the ideas they have never <Col N="342" /> seem to percolate upwards and, indeed, that so much of the system seems to be bureaucratically organised to repress ideas and to ensure that no subordinate shall show undue brilliance by having an idea moved up to a higher level.</P>
    <P>I sometimes wonder if it would not be a good idea, on a change of Government, to request from each Department a list of suggestions made by everybody in that Department over the previous year and find out just who sat on them.  Very often this sitting process&mdash;I see the Minister agreeing with me and I hope he will do something of the kind&mdash;of people sitting on ideas is because they are afraid that their subordinates will appear to have too many good ideas and might jump over their heads.  This is a hazard in every organisation at every level and I am sure it is no worse in the Post Office and the Civil Service than anywhere else but something should be done to open up this flow of talent on the organisation of work and to mobilise it properly.</P>
    <P>This involves industrial democracy in the true sense, giving people a voice in how their own work is done.  Very often you get the work done more efficiently.  I was told some years ago that something of the kind operates in RTE at the technical level.  If I recollect correctly I was told by members of the staff of a system under which they were told this technical job of providing resources for certain purposes was to be done with a certain amount of money and that the team decide how best to organise the work and get it done within the sum specified. That sort of approach could yield economy in terms of saving money, efficiency, use of resources and much greater work satisfaction among those involved.  The Department is an area where experiments of this kind could most usefully be launched.</P>
    <P>To anybody involved with economics it is quite absurd that the Government have here a commercial enterprise for whose services there is a quite extraordinary demand, a demand that is economic in that people are prepared to pay the cost and more besides to yield a profit and yet, in this area <Col N="343" /> which if it were under the control of anybody other than the State there would be enormous expansion and the demand would be met by the supply, in this area almost the only one where the State is running something commercial and potentially profitable which is tightly restricted and controlled, the criteria by which capital is rationed to it are the same as are applied to the rationing of capital for social purposes from which little or no economic return can be expected.  This is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is a commercial enterprise which is rapidly expanding, is profitable and potentially more profitable, and the fact that there should be any waiting list for more than a few days is a condemnation of the system, not of the Post Office, not even of the Minister but of the system under which the telephone service is organised.  If it were a private concern this would not happen.</P>
    <P>A concern with such great demand for its services and which was profitable &mdash;two necessary criteria&mdash;would by rights itself raise the necessary capital to meet the demand and would be trying to plan ahead to cope with the demand.  It would rightly get to the stage where it could actually advertise: &ldquo;Do you want a telephone?  Get on to us and you will have it overnight.&rdquo; It would be soliciting demand for telephones.  Any private enterprise would work like that and so would any well-run efficient, flexible State enterprise.</P>
    <P>You do not run an airline on the basis of making sure of not having enough seats and having long waiting lists all the time.  You do not always cater for the peak demand but that is not the problem here; we are not talking of a seasonal peak demand for telephones at certain times of the year but about people who want telephones and who pay their bills throughout the 12 months of the year.</P>
    <P>It is incredible from an economic viewpoint that this demand should not be met and that the waiting list gets longer year after year.  Surely the Government is hard up enough to want to make some money.  This is a commercial <Col N="344" /> enterprise.  The Government have a monopoly of one of the few things for which there is a very rapidly growing demand and which is profitable.  Why do they not go out and win with that?  Why do they not treat it as any private group would, if they had such a remarkable asset, and really try to make something of it, expand it as rapidly as possible, plough capital into it to get a return, raising the capital from the market if necessary.</P>
    <P>Why must all the capital for the Post Office by raised by national loan?  Why cannot the Government set up the telephone service separately as Devlin has proposed and float it as a public corporation with majority State shareholding?  I do not suggest denationalising it; I do not think any public service should at any stage be denationalised.  I believe the public interest is served by their being under public control, but I see no reason why, when it is a profitable enterprise and when money would be available from private sources on the kind of terms on which the private sector raises money, we should not use this and why we should restrict ourselves to capital raised by national loans, rationed and doled out by a Department of Finance which treats, I shall not say, all the children of the nation equally, but which certainly does not show very much ability to discriminate between those that are profitable and those that are not.</P>
    <P>There could be a quite different approach to this.  It would depend upon the telephone service being treated separately from and organised separately from other services.  I think this was recommended in the Devlin Report.  I cannot recall seeing anything in the Minister's speech about this and I am puzzled because I should have thought that this was the kind of major policy issue he would tell us about.  But, in accordance with this remarkable tradition and practice, just as the reports of State bodies tell us all the details of their activities but are inhibited from ever discussing the policies that inform their decisions and actions, so Ministers introducing Estimates refrain from telling us what they are thinking, their philosophy <Col N="345" /> or approach on any policy issue.  They will talk about the facts and figures, the nuts and bolts and then some time during the year they suddenly get a good deal of publicity announcing a policy decision, the matter never having been discussed in the Dáil or any opportunity given to indicate views or react to the preliminary thoughts of the Minister.</P>
    <P>This playing-the-cards-close-to-the-chest approach is not good democracy or, I think, very good politics even from the Government's viewpoint.  A more enlightened approach would pay off.  I hope the Minister will consider making the most of this asset by hiving it off, turning it into a State enterprise and if there is a problem of raising capital in the ordinary way, this State enterprise could raise capital in the market, have ordinary shares, give minority shareholding to the general public and behave as if it were a private enterprise out to make money by attracting capital that can be attracted for a profitable enterprise up to the point where they have to advertise for people to take telephones.</P>
    <P>That is the proper approach and I hope the Minister will come around to it very quickly because here and everywhere else the pace of decision-making by this Government is fantastically slow.  This has been the main burden of my criticism since I came into politics.  It is incredible to people not involved in the public service, not involved in politics and who are concerned with the ordinary business of running their lives in the private sector of the economy as professional people, that any body of men could take so long to decide everything as Governments take and this Government above all take.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one has a vision of a Government which came into office in 1957 and did not expect to be in very long and began postponing decisions so that they would never have to take any and finding themselves longer and longer in office and more and more desperate, having to go on postponing decisions until at some stage they ceased to be in office.  This is a topsy turvy view but how any Government can go on postponing decisions so long defeats me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> I shall not dwell on them but there are other areas like the whole question of regional policy.  From January 1963 onwards we have been waiting for a decision by the Government on the policy of growth centres.  We are now in November, 1971, eight and a half years later without a sign of a decision. How long are these and other decisions such as the one we are talking about going to be kicked to touch?  Certainly any new Government coming into office in the next year or so will have no difficulty in attracting considerable kudos by being efficient in taking decisions.  They will simply have to deal efficiently with all the files that are waiting on Ministers' desks unattended to produce a stream of well prepared decisions, possibly different from those this Government might have taken if they had ever come to take them, and will appear to be a very energetic and active Government. Nothing could be worse than the present lethargic dilatory approach to decision-making in this and other areas.</P>
    <P>Could I ask the Minister to get a move on among himself and his colleagues in examining recommendations like those in the Devlin Report?  They should not drift on indefinitely nor approach problems by referring them out to Departments for comment and having minutes passed from one to the other, inter-departmental committees set up and wait drearily for something to come back and when they get it back, say: &ldquo;The decision will be an awkward one; we might lose a vote here or there.  Let us set up another committee.&rdquo;  That is the kind of approach we have endured for the past decade.</P>
    <P>On more detailed aspects of the telephone service I endorse what the previous speaker said about damage to kiosks and the unavailability of telephones.  This is a really serious public problem about which I think more could be done.  Some sort of campaign could be waged against this damage.  I know the Garda Síochána are desperately overstretched because their numbers have been allowed to be depleted in the face of a mounting <Col N="347" /> wave of crime and mounting problems and it would be very difficult for them to tackle this particular problem. Even if a couple of men were detached so that they might watch over a couple of areas where damage is done persistently, they might catch even a few of these people and this would have an effect generally.  I would like the Minister to tell us how many people have been prosecuted successfully for damage to telephones in Dublin during the past 12 months. Perhaps these cases are not given space in the papers, but I have not heard of any, although in many areas in the city there are no public telephones in working order.  I can recall trying to find a telephone on the morning of the Hume Street affair.  I was told by the students that there were no telephones anywhere in the area but I said that was nonsense. However, having gone from one kiosk to another in my car, I failed to find a telephone in working order, and, eventually, I had the wit to go back to the Shelbourne Hotel and telephone from there.  Something must be done about this situation.  It is an area in which there is required co-operation between the Departments of Justice and Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I am glad that subscriber trunk dialling has been extended to Belfast and London.  It was depressing that for so long so little priority was given to this matter and that we were cut off from the rest of the world in this way. It is depressing, too, that there are so many parts of the North with which one cannot get into direct contact. However, something has been achieved and a link has been established but a Government concerned with doing something about the division of our country would have tackled the matter much sooner.</P>
    <P>Could I ask the Minister now to go a step further and to deal with the question of reversed charges.  I do not recall any announcement about such service since it was raised here last. It is absurd that, in this country, we cannot reverse charges.  I get telephone calls several times a month from other countries, and people often ask me to call them back and reverse <Col N="348" /> charges, but, of course, this is not possible.  I suppose one could telephone back and then send the bill to the person concerned but in practice this is not done.  For the sake of my pocket, if nothing else, I would ask the Minister to get on with this matter.  As I understand it, the reasons for not doing it have something to do with the fact that, on the balance of the transactions, we might lose some small amount of money but such transactions exist between all civilised countries and between many uncivilised ones.  May I suggest to the Minister also that he give a little more publicity to one of the facilities offered by the telephone service, namely, the trunk call pass-card system.  Is the Minister familiar with that system?</P>

      <P>I am glad to find somebody who is because it is a State secret.  About ten years ago there was an announcement in the English papers that there had been introduced a system of credit calls, and, following that, there appeared in our papers a very curt little paragraph on behalf of the Department to say that this system had been in existence in Ireland for 20 years and that we were ahead of the world so far as this was concerned.  Being interested in this very useful facility I telephoned the Post Office and told them that, while I was very glad to hear this, I could find no reference to the service in the directory. The person to whom I spoke said that, of course, there was no reference to it in the directory because if there was everybody would use it.  This seemed to me to be a very curious approach to the facility.  May I, through the medium of these debates, bring this useful system to the attention of the country because apparently the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not prepared to do so.  It is a system whereby a person is issued with a card and a code number as a result of which he may telephone to any part of the world and, if he had no money on his person or if he wished to make a long call but did not wish to keep on inserting change, he could have it debited to his account.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it was an exaggeration to say they can be used to telephone to any part of the world but they certainly can be used for telephone calls to England or to any part of Europe.  I have never yet tried to telephone anywhere and been told that I could not avail myself of the service for the particular country I wished to telephone to.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us exactly to which countries the service can be used to make telephone calls.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the service would be extended to cover telegrams.  Many years ago, from Donegal I had a long and difficult argument when I telephoned the exchange in an effort to send a telegram to, I think, somewhere on the Continent.  I was told, after a long consultation between Donegal and Dublin, that I could not be trusted with the cost of the telegram but I pointed out that the telegram would cost much less than the trunk calls they were trusting me with and I asked what was the reason for this. I was told that it was a different system, that telegrams were dealt with by a different department.  However, after an argument lasting almost an hour, they gave in and the telegram was despatched.  It would be very useful if the system could be extended to telegrams.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the efficiency with which this system operates considering that the general public are not made aware of it.  Telephone operators throughout the country are aware of it.  Once or twice at manual exchanges I have experienced people who questioned the system but in such cases I got in touch with the provincial exchanges concerned.  I hope the Minister will do something towards selling this service to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> I want to echo what was said by a previous speaker, I think it was Deputy Cooney, on the question of post office buildings.  The buildings in which some post office workers are operating are totally inadequate in size and, in many cases, the conditions are intolerable. I know that the Department have tried to do something about this matter but they will have to do better. No private organisation houses employees in such conditions and neither would they be allowed to do so.  There have been one or two occasions on which I have been tempted to invoke the Factories Act on the Minister, but possibly he is exempt from this Act, because, usually, Government Departments exempt themselves from all laws that might require them to behave with humanity to their employees.  The number of people who are crammed into small spaces and the conditions in which they operate are a scandal. I shall not dwell on that or bring the debate down to the level of constituency discussion but there are problems in this respect in my own constituency. The Minister is aware of these and I hope he will do something about them and about the question in general.</P>
    <P>On the question of postal charges, I have not been persuaded yet as to why it was necessary to impose an increase which, according to the consumer price index, is 50½ per cent. I know that costs and salaries are increasing but this increase in charges is extraordinary by any standards and among the various State bodies and Government Departments that are increasing their charges, this particular one is a record.  I know, of course, that virtually all the biggest increases that have taken place have been imposed by the various State bodies and Government Departments, with the exception of some increases in the prices of fresh fruit and vegetables.  We had an increase of 25 per cent in bus fares and 17½ per cent in train fares and there was another increase of 26 per cent but I have forgotten what that was in respect of.  The increase in respect of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is almost 100 per cent greater than the increases in other Departments.  How could it be possible <Col N="351" /> to have to increase charges by 50 per cent in any one year?  What conceivable increases in costs could necessitate this?  What failure to keep charges rising in line with costs in the immediately preceding years could account for this increase?  There must be some explanation.  It is not good enough that such charges be announced blandly while no detailed account of the reasons for the increase was given and while there was no indication of how much of it is due to salary increases or other factors such as materials or maintenance.  The Minister must give us some kind of itemised account to explain the reasons for the increase.  No doubt, by perusing the Post Office accounts, one might reconstruct some picture but it is not our job to do that.  It is for the Minister to give us an adequate explanation of the reasons for such increases but I am not aware that he has done that.</P>

      <P>Then, would the Minister direct my attention to an itemised account setting out in detail the explanation for this which will enable me to reconstruct, bit by bit, the entire 50 per cent.  If the Minister can do that I will apologise for what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally on the postal side, on postage stamps I regret that the Minister and the Government&mdash;I am sure this is a Government decision&mdash;have decided to confine themselves to the issue of what he describes as symbolic stamps in connection with the civil war.  It would have meant more to people and would have shown to the younger generation more of the spirit of reconciliation which they look for if we had had a series of stamps in which figures of people who died on both sides during the civil war appeared. The idea that we must confine ourselves to a symbolic stamp is a depressing thought and I regret that the Minister and the Government found that necessary.  We would all have our own views of the people who died but I think most people on both sides would agree that probably the <Col N="352" /> two leaders who died on the Government side at that time were perhaps the two most outstanding people but I do not think there would have been objections if they and a similar number of those who died on the Republican side had been commemorated equally in postage stamps. It was a pity this was not done, a pity that fears of arousing feelings should confine us to something symbolic.</P>
    <P>Turning now to RTE and speaking generally at first I should like to say that I think we all underestimate the degree to which we are endowed with a radio and television service of high quality at very low cost.  None of us has difficulty in saying what is wrong with the radio and television service, and I will make some criticisms which arise, I am sure, from lack of funds, but when you compare our service with that of other countries with which comparisons can be made while of course we fall short by various standards and various degrees and grievously short in certain things like drama, nonetheless the disparity between the standard of the output of radio and television in Ireland and that in other countries where it does exist is in no way comparable to the incredible disparity between the resources available to them.  That with such limited resources, a tiny fraction of those available in other nearby countries, we manage to produce something as good as this is a testimony to the ingenuity and skill of Irish people faced with the problem of making do with limited resources.  This is important. Not only are we much smaller than other countries but our resources per head are lower than elsewhere. We can only make a go of this country if we apply ingenuity to it so that with our lesser resources we achieve results as good or almost as good as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Our universities have to try to produce graduates of the same quality as those in Britain with one-third of the resources.  Our airline is obviously faced with far greater difficulties than airlines in larger countries.  It has to be that much more efficient to survive.  Our airline is, in fact, by objective international criteria more efficient than other international airlines with which <Col N="353" /> it competes.  It has to be.  It would not survive otherwise.  So with RTE.  It is more efficient in that for a given amount of resources it manages to produce far more material of high quality than any other similar organisation with which I have even the vaguest familiarity. I have spoken once or twice with our diplomats in foreign countries who have to put up with programmes there, countries which are much larger than Ireland with greater resources.  They tell me of the dreariness of the programmes that are made with far greater resources and I do not think it is just that their patriotism is overcoming their judgment because I have watched some of these programmes&mdash;I am not speaking of Britain&mdash;and they do seem to me, considering how much more money these countries have, to be very poor, compared with what you would expect given the standard of what our radio and television service produces.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley had something to say about this.  I found myself in disagreement with him as usual.  I should be unhappy if I agreed with him.  With the usual Irish inferiority complex he said at column 2484 of Volume 256, No. 13 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was rightly concerned that there were more and more people tuning in to BBC and ITV.  The only reason they are doing this is because they are getting better value, better programmes, from these two channels.</P>
    <P>The usual Irish poor mouth, that everybody else is better than we are.</P>
    <P>Otherwise they would not be turning over to them.  I cannot see how Deputy Desmond on the one hand defends RTE and on the other says that they are losing their viewing public.  The reason why they are losing their viewing public is they are not putting on programmes of sufficient quality to hold the audience.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of stuff one expects from some remnant of the Anglo-Irish and really Deputy Crowley has not hitherto figured to me in that particular guise.  I am sorry he is not here to defend himself.  No man is better able to do so.  I shall not dwell on him as <Col N="354" /> he is not here.  I would say a lot more if he were.  I do not agree with him. Of course there are problems in producing programmes of the same calibre matched item for item with the BBC or ITV because the resources here are minuscule.  There are areas like drama where I have been very disappointed with the output which seems to me to fall short of what ought to be possible even with the resources available. However, taking the whole range of radio and television we are fortunate to do so well for so little money and resources.</P>
    <P>I find myself in disagreement also with Deputy Crowley on the whole question of the bias in RTE.  It is not that I would disagree with him that there is some bias.  Human beings are bound to have some bias.  You cannot set up a new service in the early 1960s, staffed inevitably by younger people, not by a whole age range going up to 65&mdash;you start something new with people who are mostly in their 20s and 30s&mdash;and expect the people in it to be the mirror image of the views of the Irish people aged 18 to 90.  Of course they are not.  They reflect the critical, open, outward-looking attitudes, the more progressive attitudes of the younger generation.  Sometimes I find these attitudes trying as other people do.  That is when I do not agree with them.  Very often I agree with them and I am quite happy.  Whether I agree or disagree with them, it is not surprising that there is a slightly different tone from the output of this service than you would get from a service if it had the whole age span up to 65.  There is a certain approach and attitude.  They are&mdash;rightly so because this is their job&mdash;anti-establishment.  It is their job to criticise.  The function of any medium of communication is to expose what is wrong, to criticise what is badly done, to praise what may be well done, but to concentrate on constructive criticism and exposing evil. That is what the Press does usually.  A good Press does this.  If a Press does not do this it is not a good Press.  This is what radio and television should be doing.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned a programme last night.  I did not see it <Col N="355" /> but I have heard about it all day. It obviously made a profound impact on people.  It sounds like the kind of programme which it is useful to make. Of course those of us who get the rough end of the criticism, those of us who on a particular issue are part of the establishment, whatever that may be, get irritated when we find ourselves being knocked.  I detect, I think, a certain anti-EEC bias among some of the RTE output.  This annoys me because I happen to be in favour of the EEC and I am part of the establishment on this.  Fair enough.  I do not regard this as some heinous defect. It is not the communist plot which Deputy Crowley is always hinting at. It is the effect of the service being run by people of a particular generation whose job it is to criticise the establishment view.  If the establishment is for the EEC they have a natural inclination to attack and criticise this and make sure that the other side is heard. The same is true in any area of public policy.  Of course this is not to be exaggerated.  They try consistently and carefully not to show a bias but all of us subconsciously display bias.  When I am being at my most broadminded and congratulatory to the Government I am sure the very way I express myself displays some inherent bias against the Government even if I am saying something in their favour.  It is impossible not to display some kind of bias subconsciously.  I am only talking of that.  I am not suggesting that there is any concerted campaign by people in RTE to influence people in any direction at all but, inevitably, something of particular attitudes of some of the people concerned emerges at times in programmes.  It would be wrong if it did not.  What is important is not that, which is of minor importance and is not really observable except to those of us who are sensitive. We only notice it when it is something that we are in favour of that seems to be knocked.  We do not notice it the rest of the time.  We think they are terribly fair when they agree with our own prejudices.  That is not what is important.  What is important is that they should remain open, that they should continue to regard it as their <Col N="356" /> function to be critical and to expose social evils of various kinds.</P>
    <P>I was deeply concerned about the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; Tribunal for this reason, that I feared the approach the Government took there might have the effect of discouraging RTE from doing the kind of work they should be doing. It may have had some effect of that kind but there are signs that that effect, if it did exist, if I am right in detecting it, has not lasted.  I hope they will ignore all politicians, all of us who from time to time are disposed to object or to criticise when we come under fire, and that they will stand up to the politicians, as I believe they have done.</P>
    <P>The Board of RTE stood up to the Government on the question of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; report.  They and the Director-General are to be congratulated for the way they handled that affair and I hope that they will become increasingly uninhibited in their criticisms of all of us and that when the Government changes they will continue, as I am sure they will, to be as critical of us as they are of Fianna Fáil.  We will grumble about it.  We will not like it.  We will hate it.  But it will be good for us and good for the country and I hope I will never say otherwise however irritated I may be on any particular issue.</P>
    <P>On the presentation of politics on RTE, especially on television, I have never been happy about this.  It is not the fault of television.  It is not even the fault of the politicians.  It is the fault of the situation they find themselves in.  If three of us go on a programme together, or four as it now appears to be, there is something about sitting down with fellow politicians of another party to discuss a subject knowing that all one's supporters and their supporters are watching.  There is something about this that produces a psychological pressure to be stupidly partisan and to score points against the other side.  Many of us go on to such programmes determined that we will not fall into this trap.  We make the best of resolutions.  Very few of us do not fall into the trap at some time and behave very stupidly and of course the general public, rightly, are critical. <Col N="357" /> They do not understand the kind of psychological pressures that exist, that when one is actually in the middle of arguing something and there is a point that you can score, you are conscious of all your own supporters who will be disappointed if you do not make the point and you forget, of course, the general public who do not like points being scored but who want a civilised, useful, constructive discussion. All of us fall into this trap.  The format of the programme creates this.</P>
    <P>It would be much better for us all and better for politics generally and would be a fairer representation, really, of politicians&mdash;at least the better side of politicians&mdash;if instead of confronting us in these programmes in this way, politicians were brought more into ordinary programmes.  I have said this before and there appears to be a strong bias against it.  RTE seem to think that they have some obligation&mdash;they do not always feel this but there seems to be some kind of pressure on them that if they put one politician on any programme, all three parties must be on it.  They should have a nice little ledger in which they would write us all down and each time Deputy FitzGerald appears for half-an-hour, he is down in the Fine Gael column and when Deputy Desmond appears, he is down in the Labour column and when the Minister, Deputy Collins appears, he is down in the Fianna Fáil column, and every time, between different programmes, it balances out in whatever proportions are thought proper by the Whips who argue these things out.</P>
    <P>It should be possible and it should be encouraged and it should be normal practice that if there is a programme on, say, mental handicap, whoever amongst the politicians happens to be the person best equipped to go on that programme should go on and if there is a programme on social welfare, somebody from Fianna Fáil who is good at that goes on with other experts on the subject, university people, social workers, if it is about social welfare, and participate in a discussion without the political pressures, the partisan pressures, and that this be balanced every time by keeping us all noted down in a ledger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> This would be better for politicians, better for politics.  The present system is giving an unfair representation of what politicians are really like.  We are partisan enough as it is but to be put into an environment where all the worst elements of partisanship are highlighted is not to the general benefit and I hope there will be more of the approach I have suggested, of bringing us into individual programmes where we have a particular interest or expertise and if a person can conduct an orchestra let us have him conducting an orchestra, but not during a debate of importance in this House.</P>
    <P>There are two other points of a general character.  Talking about politics on television&mdash;I do not want to spend time on this because we all know the arguments&mdash;I do think that we are approaching the time when some form of presentation of Dáil and Seanad on television and radio would be acceptable and useful.  We do not need to go bald-headedly into putting the cameras in to go on day and night, showing everything that happens here, but we could begin, perhaps, by edited radio programmes because it is much easier to get a tape recorder into this place than it is to get a few television cameras in.  There could be edited radio programmes, a half-hour programme at the end of the day&mdash;a Dáil report&mdash; but illustrated by actual extracts from what people say.</P>
    <P>I am more than content to leave the editing to RTE.  They will fall over backwards to be fair and equitable in counting up the seconds each person gets.  You need not worry about that. Any failure to do so would get them into trouble.  They will believe that one of us somewhere will keep a record and will come back on them if they do not keep a proper balance.  I am sure the balance will be kept.</P>
    <P>Moving on then to television coverage, I see difficulties about television coverage.  I cannot see where the cameras are going to be.  If you look around the Chamber it is hard to see where you would put them. The top of our heads is probably the most that would appear.  It is a technical problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The other point of a general character that I want to make is that out of the limited resources available to RTE more and more should be put into the provision of adequate coverage of foreign news by Irish correspondents abroad.  They are moving towards this.  Think of the difference it is today&mdash;I will leave Belfast out for the moment; I will come back to that &mdash;when we get from London, for example, the RTE correspondents there who tells us what is happening there in terms that are relevant to us. It is not the same thing to have a BBC man or, as we used to have, somebody from CBS or someone in London or someone from some absurd Canadian or American Corporation, with his nasal American accent, telling us what was happening in the British Parliament&mdash;that absurd period we went through with RTE, on the radio side anyway.</P>
    <P>Now we have in several centres people who because they are based there are extremely well informed. They have the contacts.  They know what is going on.  They can interpret the news for us in a way that is useful to us.  They know what we need to know.  They know what we do know and do not have to be told.  It is only a correspondent of one's own country who can really interpret foreign news properly.  The difference this makes is enormous and the value of it to this country cannot be exaggerated and it has been a great disappointment to me that ten years after the advent of television and 45 years after the advent of radio, which advented at the same time as I did, we still have not got adequate coverage of foreign news.</P>
    <P>At one stage I wondered whether we should not vote a special fund for this purpose but, of course, any kind of earmarked expenditure for RTE would impinge on their independence and they would not welcome that.  We must leave it to the Board of RTE to decide how to use the general resources they get from us or from the public through the decisions we make about licence fees but I hope that they will accelerate the process of providing adequate coverage in places like Brussels, Paris, <Col N="360" /> Bonn, Rome and Washington.  I know it is costly but the cost, although it would be a large amount of each year's extra annual budget for RTE, as a proportion of the total budget is not great and it should have a much higher priority than it has.</P>
    <P>That brings me to Northern Ireland. There are several things I want to say about this.  First of all, I do not think we are treating Northern Ireland as if we really believed it was part of Ireland and that the different parties up there were Irish parties representing the views of Irish men and women. We have, I think, a remarkable team of correspondents operating in the North and it would be difficult to praise them too highly.  It should be said that there and elsewhere the RTE correspondents are, in my opinion, by world standards in the top class.</P>

      <P>As one who listens to news bulletins, not only Irish but also British and, very often, French bulletins&mdash;I believe the four French networks have the finest news service in the world&mdash;I find some of the RTE correspondents&mdash;it would be invidious to name them even when saying something good about them, so I shall not mention them&mdash;really in the top class. I think of one in particular, but there are a number of them now; their ability concisely to give the facts, analyse the background and explain it, and do the whole thing in two or three minutes flat is almost incredulous.  It is only when one has had a certain experience of having to report, to write articles or news stories, as I have had to do myself in my chequered career, that one appreciates what is involved and how great is the skill involved.  Sometimes when I listen to some of these reports they seem to me to be literally perfect; given the situation, their ability in such a short time to give the facts, the background, the analyses and the interpretation in a balanced way is beyond anything I have heard on other networks.  I do not criticise the correspondents in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  Far from it.  God knows, they have an appalling job to do under terrible <Col N="361" /> strain; at times I cannot understand how they can do the job, never mind covering the 24 hours, remembering that their work is mostly in the night time because of the explosions and so on.  Nevertheless I am not convinced that our approach to Northern Ireland is satisfactory.</P>
      <P>There is one thing which shows this very clearly.  It demonstrates it in a way which is, I think, objectively ascertainable, because bias is very hard to measure, and that is the persistence of the RTE newsroom staff in referring to Northern Ireland as &ldquo;the Six Counties&rdquo;.  They have done this now for at least ten years.  I cannot go back beyond that because I do not remember clearly, but I can remember ten years ago when the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, decided to abandon this offensive usage and to use &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  He was not immediately followed in this by the <i>Irish Press</i> newspapers.  This was not followed by RTE either and, although I was assured to the contrary in an exchange in this House last week, my information is that it was suggested to RTE by the Government Information Bureau at that time that this usage of &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; was the one that was acceptable, but they were not prepared to follow this usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think one should interfere with the independence of this authority but they have a responsibility in this matter.  It is not their job to allow the particular prejudices of particular people on their staff to show in this way.  If it is the correct practice, as it is, to refer to Northern Ireland as &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;, if that is accepted as the name of the State and if we, in this House, in our own legislation use &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;, as we do&mdash;<i>vide</i> the Great Northern Railway Act, 1958, which refers to &ldquo;the Government of Northern Ireland&rdquo; and even, God help us, goes so far as to refer to &ldquo;Londonderry&rdquo;, it is in the context of an Act of this House; I am not advocating that part of it&mdash;and as it has been the practice of the Government so to do then it is wrong for the people in RTE, perhaps because of their own personal background, to decide otherwise and use an offensive phraseology.  That is a political act on <Col N="362" /> their part.  It would be a different matter if each man were allowed to use what came into his head.  I might accept that.  But it has been clearly ruled that &ldquo;the Six Counties&rdquo; shall be used and not &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  At times this even goes so far that the words are changed in actual quotations.  I had the extraordinary experience with one of the <i>Press</i> group of newspapers ten years ago of writing an article about Northern Ireland and they changed &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; to &ldquo;the Six Counties&rdquo; throughout my article.  This has been the practice of the <i>Press</i> group of newspapers for years.  I wrote in a letter and I demanded that they publish my letter.  They did publish it. The letter contained a long quotation from Mr. Seán Lemass, the Taoiseach, justifying the use of &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  I never had that trouble again. Going to the length of misquoting someone and changing the words used to another form argues a political bias of a very high degree indeed.  It is time it was corrected.  It is a political act of a partisan kind deliberately to push such a usage.  When it is not required by State policy it is inappropriate that that should be done.</P>

      <P>No, they do not.  At times they call us &ldquo;the Irish Republic&rdquo; and I have had occasion to complain about that at various times both to London and Belfast.  But that is another day's work.  It is not policy on their part; it is simply inadvertence or stupidity.  I am talking about the policy in RTE, or what seems to me to be the policy, because of the uniformity of the usage.  I understand it is the policy and they have refused to change it.  That, I think, is an indication of bias.  This is a television service of the Irish people as a whole.  It is, of course, run and paid for by the people of this State.  It is a national television service and, if we believe this is fundamentally one nation, then we must have regard for the views and feelings of all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to read to the House <Col N="363" /> now something I said in the Seanad 5½ years ago, 2½ years before Derry and when the North was not much talked about here.  Speaking on the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill, 1965, I said:</P>
    <P>This gives us an opportunity in this debate to consider the whole question of the rights of minorities, and the inadequate provision made for their representation because of their background.  I happen to believe quite genuinely in this being a single country and I believe, therefore, that there are a million people in Northern Ireland whose viewpoint has a right to be heard and who should be represented, broadly speaking, in a proportion of one to four, in any public discussion or controversy on matters of interest to the whole country.</P>
    <P>Not, of course, if we were discussing our own domestic affairs down here, but on an issue affecting the whole country they should be represented as a matter of course if we believe what we pretend we believe.</P>
    <P>I know that this is not a widely held viewpoint, and, indeed, there are many people who would think that anybody who suggested that this million people in Northern Ireland have a right to have their viewpoint expressed in this part of the country should be regarded as engaging in some sort of treason.  I think the Northern Unionists have this right and I do not think that sufficient is being done to ensure that it can be exercised.  Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann have made efforts to get outside the boundaries of this State and have interested themselves and the people in this part of the country in the problems of Northern Ireland.  They have presented programmes on Northern Ireland, but they have presented them from the outside and are still in the position of occasionally sending their foreign correspondents into the wilds of Northern Ireland to interview the natives.</P>
    <P>Thank God, that has changed anyway.</P>
    <P>This is not a national television service representing the whole people <Col N="364" /> and giving to various minorities their fair representation.  We have a long way to go before we achieve that. If we do achieve it then we will show that we have a genuine belief in the unity of the country. </P>

      <P>February 16th, 1966.  We have gone a long way since then.  Radio Éireann have their resident correspondents in Northern Ireland now.  That has all changed, though it took a particular situation and many deaths before we reached that point of interest in the affairs of Northern Ireland.  However, I do not believe that anyone listening to Radio Éireann would believe it is a national television service representing in reasonable proportion the views of all our people.  It is not.  It is a service of &ldquo;the republic&rdquo;, representing our views, our biases, our prejudices.  Of course, the views of the Northern Unionists are reported and, of course, they are interviewed from time to time, but this is done as if one were dealing with a foreign situation, interviewing a foreigner and getting his views.  They are not brought in as if they were fellow-Irishmen.  We are not consistent in this.  I know, of course, that there are people who believe these are aliens who must be exported and deported from the country like the French from Algeria but, thank God, that view, with all our &ldquo;republican&rdquo; passions, is still a minority one and most Irish people genuinely believe that there is an Irish nation and that there are people of different views in the country, but we are fundamentally all Irish and they are entitled, therefore, to have their views represented and entitled to be brought into the national consensus in some way.  I think that is not adequately done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more practical level, one unfortunate feature of RTE is that, because of their lack of resources, I suppose, they virtually shut down during the summer.  This was tolerable in <Col N="365" /> the old days but in the last three years the summer has been the period of, to put it mildly, greatest political activity in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been the period of crisis in Northern Ireland.  It is intolerable, when this happens every year, that the RTE public affairs programmes shut down and the staff go on their holidays as if nothing is happening.  We all like to get our holidays but we cannot always have them in these circumstances, and some of us have to interrupt our holidays on this account.  The fact is that we face a situation in the North of Ireland which in the past three years has involved crises.  Of course these have been reported in the news bulletins and we have seen what is actually happening but when it comes to informed comment and discussion there is virtually nothing.</P>
    <P>I asked a member of the Northern Opposition a month ago what he felt at that time about us in the Republic, and how we were dealing with their problems.  His first comment was that he was appalled by the amount of ignorant pro-Provisional feeling amongst our people who seem to have failed totally to comprehend the situation in Northern Ireland, and who seem to be betraying all that the Northern Opposition were standing for as the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>His second comment was on the fact that this House was so ill-attended during the debate and for that we all have to be ashamed.  His third comment was that it was incredible to him that RTE should close down their public affairs programmes in the summer and no attempt was made to keep our people informed on the meaning of what was happening in the North of Ireland.  There was no proper discussion, and very often what appeared in the news did not, of its very nature, reflect what was happening behind the scenes, and no attempt was made to explain it.</P>
    <P>His fourth comment was on the stupidity, as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien commented, of simply shutting down the IRA people so that they do not appear instead of trying to answer them.  What had happened up until <Col N="366" /> then was that they had appeared and had been given an opportunity to put forward their propaganda but nobody had ever debated or argued with them. They were not put into a position where they had to justify their silly beliefs which do not stand up very long when faced with reasonable, critical discussion.  It would have been much more to the point had these people been on programmes where they were forced to explain and justify their actions and beliefs instead of which they were allowed for a period to carry on the propaganda role and then they were shut down completely.</P>
    <P>We have never had an opportunity of seeing the shallowness of their philosophy exposed and it will not be done now because the Government have made it impossible.  I can understand why the Government were tempted to act in the way they did but they cannot justify, as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien said, allowing these people free action in this part of the country and at the same time failing to enforce the law against people who are self-proclaimed members of an illegal organisation and as such justify, under the Offences Against the State Act, jail sentences.  The Government cannot justify not even charging these people but suppressing them on RTE, because either, as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien said, they are members of the IRA, self-confessed, as indeed they are, or self-confessed leaders in which case they should be charged with that offence, which they will not be by this Government, because they have not the guts to do it, or if they are not they should not be kept off our national television service.  I do not understand the grounds for this other than that the Government do not want it to be too obvious that they are failing to enforce the law against these people because every time they appeared on television everybody throughout the country said, &ldquo;How could these people appear on television as members of an illegal organisation?&rdquo;  It was rubbing in the fact that the Government would not enforce the law, and for that reason, it seems to me, the Government suppressed them.  I am not at all convinced it was the right approach.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House <Col N="367" /> any longer but, having been critical of some aspects of RTE, I want to reiterate some of what I have said about the remarkable performance they have put up.  The quality of news coverage has been very good indeed, although at times there has been a certain selectivity in the editing of it.  It is the editing I am worried about rather than the reportage itself.  With the resources at their disposal the quality of much of their output is very high indeed.  It is right that we should take the opportunity of this debate to advert to some aspects of their work which merit criticism.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a few brief remarks about certain aspects of this Estimate.  I want to refer first to Lettermore Post Office.  Some of the applicants for this post took strong objection to the Minister's statement that applicants must be of good financial standing, have a good office to offer and all the other usual regulations that go with the letting of a post office.  The feeling was sent abroad that the other applicants were not of good standing.  The people of Lettermullen have been deprived by the Department of their postal deliveries.  The Minister says &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <P>I had people in to me at 8 o'clock on the morning the post was not delivered.  It was most unfair that they should be deprived of delivery of the weekly cross-channel remittance which keeps the home fires burning. When the Minister is replying I should like him to explain why they were deprived of their postal service.</P>

      <P>I will not press the matter any further.  There appears to <Col N="368" /> be a shortage of telephones but anyone who dials the Department's number looking for a telephone will find he has dialled the wrong number. As my constituency is a tourist area it is essential for people to have telephones. There is a queue for telephones. I should like to press the Minister to give priority to telephones in the west.  It is bad enough that the charges have been increased without there being delays in installing telephones. It is almost Christmas time and the Christmas cards will soon be flying around.  Ministers send out thousands of gorgeous looking Christmas cards and they do not have to pay a penny for them.  One woman said to me, &ldquo;Isn't it grand of the Minister, I never even knew him&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Minister sent a card to someone who was dead; it was very hard for the postman to deliver it.  Thousands of pounds are involved in these Christmas cards although the actual figures have not come to light because there are many ways of sending Christmas cards.  If one is Minister for Transport and Power one can send cards through CIE and involve dozens and dozens of civil servants who could be employed doing something more useful.  If the people have to tighten their belts and pay increased charges I do not see why the Ministers should not have to tighten theirs as well and send fewer cards. The Minister is saying, &ldquo;Happy Christmas&rdquo; and, at the same time, he is increasing the charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have a go at television and I do not know what we spoke about on this Estimate prior to the introduction <Col N="369" /> of television.  On the whole the television programmes are not bad, but nothing is perfect.  Personally I should like to see less of the radical and dissident type of person being highlighted as the best type.  Frequently students are shown as being radicals.  Of course, some students are high-spirited and I could tell a few things the Minister did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would want to be present when the Deputy is telling the story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of what is shown on TV, to many people all students are branded as radicals.  I should like television to show the amount of charitable work done by students and how they raise a lot of money for good causes.  I realise that is not news but when a long-haired chap turns a car upside down that fact gets prominent coverage on our screens. The students have been given a bad image and in fairness to them television should do something to correct the balance.</P>
      <P>Television could play a part in promoting our country among our own people as an attractive holiday place. Not many people in the country can afford colour television but many of the wealthier people have such television sets.  If television presented attractive pictures of our country these people might be tempted to spend their holidays here instead of going abroad to Spain and elsewhere.  Many of the people who go on continental holidays have never been beyond the airport road or as far as Maynooth. This country has a lot to offer and television could play an important part in promoting our tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>On our television programmes too much emphasis is placed on the gun. If it is not the North of Ireland it is the cowboys and Indians who are featured.  I should like to pay a special tribute to a programme which has been presented on our television screens for many years, namely, &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;. Credit is due to the producers, the scriptwriters and to the characters. They are racy, they are natural, and it is a pleasure to watch the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> I have referred to the matter of privacy in post offices many times when this Estimate was being debated. In rural areas, frequently it is difficult to conduct business in privacy if there is a queue waiting for attention.  Invariably there is a character like Minnie in &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; looking over your shoulder in order to see what you are writing and this news is broadcast as soon as she leaves the post office.  I should like to see some type of shuttering erected in the post offices to ensure that people can conduct their business in privacy.  I raised this matter some years ago and this shuttering was provided in the GPO in Galway.  I should like the same accommodation provided in post offices throughout the country.  Privacy is especially important where people wish to conduct business regarding savings accounts.</P>
    <P>With regard to telegrams, I should like the post office to display a little more imagination with regard to the type of form provided for telegrams of congratulation.  At the moment, if one wants to send a telegram to people who have got married, the form provided is the same as that used for messages of condolence.  The post office should use a little imagination and provide a more appropriate type of form for messages of congratulation.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of stuffy regulations in the post office.  The same thing applied in the Garda Síochána until the gardaí decided it was time to call a halt.  The officials in the post office will soon cry halt to many of the regulations and the Minister would be well advised to have a look at them.  Many of the existing regulations are forgotten so far as the Minister's office is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister bears the name of a great man&mdash;I refer to Michael Collins. The Minister should be a big man too and this year issue a stamp to commemorate Michael Collins.  The Government party have come on a lot in 50 years.  Some of the Ministers have attended masses for Michael Collins and this was a breakthrough. I would ask the Minister this year to pay a just tribute to a soldier and a <Col N="371" /> statesman.  We will soon have the fiftieth anniversary of when Michael Collins signed what he knew was his own death warrant and it is about time something honest and proper was done to commemorate him.  Something in regard to recognition of the occasion which will be coming up shortly is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the news programmes on television.  Could we have in the programmes&mdash;we have too long a delay between one news and another &mdash;something like a short news flash? About a year ago, I suggested that we should have a synopsis after the news. I am glad to see they are doing this now&mdash;whether the officers in the House here passed it on to the Authority, I do not know, but I should also like to see a time signal, a flash from the clock, to let people know each hour and the correct time.  These are very simple details but they would be helpful to viewers and I could put them to the Minister for consideration.</P>
    <P>We are going to have in my area a radio service for the Gaeltacht.  Ní bheidh sé i bhfad anois go mbeidh sé againn.  I hope that this will not be used as a vehicle for the party.  When I say &ldquo;the party&rdquo;, we all know which I mean.</P>

Strange to say, I notice the appointment on that board in the area of a gentleman who is outside the church gate on Sunday morning, roaring his heart out on behalf of Fianna Fáil. <Col N="372" /> Is this the pay-off?

Sin a bhfuil le rá agam anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in his Department since he took over and on the manner in which he examined the various aspects that needed examination, and particularly in relation to the problems of the people in the lower sections of the Post Office who were mentioned here today, telephonists and others, in bringing about an improvement in their conditions.  We all welcome every effort by the Minister to bring about a betterment in the conditions of the workers in general and I want to pay tribute now to the many loyal workers in this Department, whether in the Post Office, those in Telefís Éireann and those who do long hours of duty during holiday periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that and having conveyed my appreciation of the fact that there is in the Department a large section of workers, there are others whose position calls for further comment. At this stage I want to pay a special tribute to Joe Fahy and Arthur Noonan for the productions of &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dáil this Week&rdquo;.  These are two people employed by RTE who give a fair and honest assessment, an unbiassed assessment of the situation in relation to the political scene.  I think every party member will agree that their assessment is a fair one.  These men have a newspaper background which is vitally important.  They understand the role of the politician and they understand the attitudes to politicians and other people, and they carry out their duties in a fair and honest way.  Their background <Col N="373" /> is important and that background being projected in a fair assessment is something we should appreciate. With this newspaper background, with the newspaper correspondents, they give a fair and honest assessment. This is what is laid down in section 18 of the Act which requires all programmes to be balanced and fair.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this does not go right through the entire radio-television network and I should like to start by asking who pays for the Montrose moonshine.  It is paid for by the housewives of this city and this country who pay television licences. What do they pay for?  When we examine the situation in a little more detail, we find out why the licence fee has to be increased and why the less well off sections have to pay an additional sum.  First of all, we examine the party political broadcast called &ldquo;We, the Irish&rdquo;.  I thought there was only one, but now we see that there are two party political broadcasts, the official one and another, controlled by a politician, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien. I wonder what would be the attitude of the Labour Deputies if a Fianna Fáil Deputy was appointed to act the same role as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien. I am quite certain that there would be a lot of objections from the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>This is what they call an objective appraisal or honest assessment.  This is not so, and I want to say as strongly as possible to the Minister and the Authority, that they had better shake up their ideas in relation to this particular type of programme and the selection of personnel to project programmes of this nature.  There are very competent people in this country, people more competent than Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, people who spend longer hours in this country than he, people who are with it and people who would make a fair and honest assessment of the situation, an assessment on a much more impartial basis than Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  It is rather regrettable that the television authority have not yet spoken out against this appointment, that the Director-General and other people have not spoken out against a politician being appointed for this particular <Col N="374" /> type of appraisal.  This was purely a party political broadcast and anybody listening to or seeing this television show will agree, irrespective of party.  Members of the Labour Party have been boasting that Deputy Cruise-O'Brien has projected a great image for the Labour Party because of the various comments he made, but he did it at a very substantial cost to the ratepayers. Some people say that the fees were somewhere in the region of £1,000.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but it must have been a very substantial one, and it is no wonder that these people defend RTE and every aspect of RTE programmes. They are well paid for doing it.</P>
    <P>I think the Director-General and the authority should wake up and ensure that we have no repetition of this type of approach.  Let us have a fair and honest assessment and let us have independent personnel who are quite competent and who are plentiful in this country.  Let these people make the appraisal, and if the authority are not going to do it, there is no reason why the Minister should not remove the authority for failing to discharge their responsibility.  I am quite certain that he has taken up this appointment possibly in order to ensure that he would have a job after the next election because I can see no future for him in this House, but at the same time it is unfair that the country should be treated to such a display.  This is one of the moonshiners, at a very substantial cost, and it is no wonder they come in here to defend RTE on every single aspect.  If one listens to the speeches of members of the Labour Party, one can well understand why they are always defending RTE. According to the Labour Party in particular, every single action of RTE is acceptable in full&mdash;they have never made any mistakes.  I do not feel that way; I feel they have made mistakes, and are continuing to make them, and an effort should be made to rectify them while there is still time.</P>
    <P>These people have a vested interest in it and why would they not?  We know the situation&mdash;we know that it is the producers of the programmes who are the bosses at Montrose.  These are the people who are running Montrose, <Col N="375" /> these people who are defended here by members of the Labour Party.  The Director-General and the Authority are only rubber stamps; it is the producers who run the programmes. I wonder how long will the Labour Party run after these people. I suppose they will continue to do so while they want to curry favour.  Now they have Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien; before that it was Deputy Dr. Thornley and before that Deputy Keating and a variety of other Labour Party hacks have from time to time been in prominent positions there and have projected themselves and the party at the expense of the ratepayers.  This must cease.</P>

Only yesterday we had a court decision in regard to one of the Late Late Shows.  It is a great pity that, by this time, Gay Byrne would not think of bringing in responsible people.  We have seen costs given against RTE.  I should like the Minister to tell us what the legal costs are in this case because it is the housewives of this city, from my constituency of Ballyfermot and Drimnagh and other areas who must pay for the blunders of Gay Byrne and the people in RTE.  They must pay if RTE brings in irresponsible people.</P>

We are concerned about these people and their problems and it was well there was some balance in the programme with men like Austin Currie and John Hume and Ted Bonner present to bring some realism into the situation.  We have seen the stupid mistakes that have been made.  We saw the bad-mannered attack by Gay Byrne on Ulick O'Connor.

Thirty people were sent in with plenty of equipment to take photographs of the victorious Labour Party and Fine Gael Party leaving the House. What a surprise and what a disappointment !

This type of squandering must stop.  This is what I meant when I referred to the Montrose moonshine. The Ministers must examine seriously the charges that are made here from time to time.

I must say at this point that last night's programme on the servicing of motor vehicles was an excellent one.  It gave a realistic picture of the problems involved.  It is a pity, however, that they would not concentrate on programmes of that nature and so win the confidence of the community.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I appeared on a &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme.  On that occasion, Deputy O'Connell was with me in the star chamber at Montrose.  We had gone there in response to an invitation but we found that the programme was stage-managed and rigged.  I did not have the opportunity of saying so on that particular occasion but I am saying it now.  The people responsible for the programme had done a substantial amount of research and before the programme they were already aware of the views of the panel.  No doubt the questions were pre-determined.  Certainly Deputy O'Connell was attacked viciously.</P>

He did not explain himself, though.  I can tell him that the days of the soup kitchens have long gone from this country. There was a time when they had a particular connotation here.  The soup kitchen, as he called it, was one run by a group of workers at the request of the Archbishop.</P>

      <P>In relation to the development of the particular programme to which I have referred, there were a number of issues involved that did not reach the screen.  For example, I know from people in the Ballyfermot area that young children leaving school had been asked to fight so that Telefís Éireann cameras could project them in this way, but of course this is a very orderly area and the children did not co-operate.  I knew Deputy O'Leary would laugh.  That is what he thinks of the constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That, then, was my experience at Montrose.  Of course, anyone who criticises RTE is bound to be rapped by them at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other items to which I would direct the Minister's attention.  I regret that we are not to have a shortwave broadcasting station because, at this particular stage, it is important that we would have very real communication with the outside world.  We all know that a shortwave station was planned but that when the first Coalition came to power in 1948 they sold it to the Turks and, no <Col N="381" /> doubt, the Turks are now using it to their advantage whereas Irish workers could have been working on it here. Unfortunately we have not a station that would penetrate the paper wall that still surrounds this country but I hope that within a short time we will have a high powered transmitter that will enable us to beam programmes into Britain and Northern Ireland so that we can project the facts in respect of the present problems and thereby correct the distorted coverage by the BBC of events North and South.  I understand that about 14 per cent of viewers in Northern Ireland can pick up RTE television programmes but we need to have a booster station in order to give a realistic assessment of the position here to people in the North, and in particular, to give them a realistic assessment of what happens in this House.  In fact, if what happened in this House was all they received, the effort would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>One of the local matters I wish to deal with concerns the telephone service in the Tallaght, Walkinstown and Ballyfermot areas.  With the great industrial and housing development in Tallaght the services have been for a considerable time totally inadequate. Where development has taken place and where factories are moving into perimeter areas priority should be given to providing these services.  In the housing estates they should be provided in the early stages.  In Tallaght at present there are 700, 800 or 900 houses and no public telephones. The local authority should take an interest in this.  These services should be part of the entire development and should be provided in the first stage of development.  People on these estates are a distance from bus stops, sometimes unaware of the whereabouts of doctors and unable to make contact with the outside world because of the absence of these services.</P>
    <P>When one goes into a new area it takes some time to become familiar with the location of telephone kiosks. It could happen that a person would require an ambulance or a doctor and would be unable to get one because <Col N="382" /> there were no telephones.  I would ask the Minister to have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and ask him to ensure that the local authority should include this development in the first stage of housing development.  Let us not have the excuse from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that it must be a viable proposition before it will be installed and that people must be living in the area.  The lives of people are of the utmost importance.  The Minister should ensure that this attitude is discontinued.  What about the people who move in the early stages of development?  I would ask the Minister to ensure that his Department will take a more realistic view of the type of development that is going on and the lack of facilities and also that some priority is given to industrial concerns so that they can keep in contact with the outside world.</P>
    <P>In the Tallaght area it has been impossible in the last couple of years to make contact with outside areas. Walkinstown was also affected.  Where there are developing industries it is important that they should have these services.  The Ballyfermot area was also affected.  I would ask the Minister to make a statement in relation to the Walkinstown, Tallaght and Ballyfermot areas.  I know that on a site in Tallaght the houses were completed before the telephone was made available to the builder.  This caused him a considerable amount of inconvenience and incurred a considerable amount of expense and loss of valuable time.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that there is no repetition of this type of delay.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the attitude of Dubliners who have more than one television station to choose from.  Judging by some of the stuff that is dished out, I would say that the sooner they get other stations in the remote areas the better because I am sure they do not turn on television at all.  I would join with Deputy Coogan and other Deputies in asking that this matter be expedited and people given a choice.  I had a television set before RTE was established and I was able to get outside stations which these people, many years afterwards, are unable to get. <Col N="383" /> Every effort should be made to ensure that they get a second station.</P>
    <P>I received a complaint recently that it is impossible to send a telegram from Ballyfermot post office.  If this is so it is very serious.  There are 34,000 or 35,000 people in Ballyfermot and I have been told that they must travel to Inchicore or Thomas Street to send a telegram.  It may be possible to send a telegram from a telephone kiosk but there are people who are not familiar with kiosks and do not want to use them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien referred to Volume 256, No. 13, of the Official Report in a vicious attack on Deputy Flor Crowley and on the Minister.  I want to quote the same statements but with a different interpretation.  I quote from column 2483.  Deputy Crowley said:</P>
    <P>However, I must strike an unhappy note and say that Telefís Éireann present some programmes that are neither balanced nor objective.  One such programme is &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;&mdash;a programme that is masqueraded as a programme in Irish but half of which is presented in English and one chairman of which was an unsuccessful politician who has a lot of political bias.  When we get this opportunity of talking on this aspect, we should speak out as strongly about subjects as he seems to speak, subjects about which, in my opinion he knows very little.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond, of course, knew who that was and he said:</P>
    <P>Who?</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Mac Aonghusa.</P>
    <P>This was a deliberate attempt by Deputy Desmond to blacken the name of Mr. Mac Aonghusa because he knew, just as I and other members knew, who Deputy Crowley was referring to.  Deputy Crowley, manly enough, had not mentioned the name of the particular individual but Deputy Desmond said &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;  If we take this a little further we see the hypocrisy of Deputy Desmond.  He said:  <Col N="384" /> He is not the only person involved in the &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crowley said:</P>
    <P>I am talking about one man.  I know that he is a member of the political party to which Deputy Desmond belongs. </P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he said: &ldquo;I will communicate with the Deputy&rdquo;.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I think, too, that on one occasion he was seeking Deputy Desmond's seat in Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown but Deputy Desmond dealt with that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry said:</P>
      <P>They ran him up to Co. Louth.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>There were other reasons for that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond said:</P>
      <P>In fairness, there is more than one person involved in that particular programme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crowley said:</P>
      <P>Yes, but we are all aware of the vitriolic pen of this particular gentleman, Mr. Mac Aonghusa.</P>
      <P>Very properly the Ceann Comhairle intervened and said:</P>
      <P>Individuals should not be discussed in this manner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crowley said:</P>
      <P>I agree, but it was Deputy Desmond who asked me to name him.  I had not intended naming him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this is the punch line.  He asked who was he.  So, Deputy Desmond has misled the House.  At one stage, in order to ensure the name would go on <Col N="385" /> record, that he would get the man out of his way once and for all and ensure that his name would be blackened, Deputy Desmond asked Deputy Crowley to name the man and then, at a later stage in the volume of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>I did not ask the Deputy to name him.</P>
    <P>What did it mean when he asked who was he if he was not asking for the name?  Of course, he was and then at a later stage he had to lie to the House. This is the type of thing that I suppose we can expect from the interrupter, Deputy Desmond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that I have had the opportunity here tonight to mention these facts.  I would ask the Minister once again to ensure that the squandermania that is taking place in Montrose and the inefficiency there will be eliminated as soon as possible and that there will be some sense of responsibility and that the housewives of this country will no longer be called on to make substantial contributions to travelling expenses, expense accounts, legal expenses, court fines and all the other results of irresponsibility.  I would ask the Minister to take a very serious view of these things.  If the authority are not doing what they should, get another authority.  There are plenty of competent people in the country who could run the service competently and efficiently and who would not be continuously looking to the people for more money to pay for irresponsible expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a constituency that is mainly rural and there are many problems affecting the people there that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  For example, I was approached by a businessman only yesterday morning who represented to me that the village where he lives should have a telephone kiosk. This is not a very big village and it is about ten miles from Sligo town.  The people in that village have to depend on the goodwill and neighbourliness of <Col N="386" /> those people who have a private telephone. It can be rather embarrassing to have to trouble one's neighbour in order to make a telephone call.  For one thing, it is an interference with their privacy.  There is the other factor that a good neighbour does not like to take the few coppers to cover the cost of the call.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to expedite the matter of providing a telephone kiosk in this village of Ballintogher for which there has been continuous demand.  There is another village, Lurganboy which is crying out for a telephone kiosk.  I quote only those two villages but there are many others that are equally in need of a telephone kiosk.  Money spent on the provision of these kiosks would be money well spent.  It is only right that this service should be provided having regard to the heavy taxation imposed on people.</P>
      <P>There is another reason why telephone kiosks should be installed.  Many Garda barracks have been closed down. Before this happened people were able to use the telephone in the barracks in case of emergency and the Garda felt obliged to allow the telephone in the barracks to be used by the people. Garda barracks have been closed and many of those that are left may have only one member of the Force in them and that member may be living in his own home, which means that the telephone in the barracks is not available to the public.</P>
      <P>I realise that the Minister has been in charge of the Department for only two or three years and that he has a tough job in meeting the demands for telephone service.  People need the telephone in order to keep in touch with the outside world.  Applicants for private telephones are informed that there is a huge waiting list.  The people expect the service to be provided for them.  Many Irish men and women come home on holidays from America and from England and they create a heavy demand on the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are often told by the Department that the number of calls that would be made from a kiosk would not be sufficient to make the provision of a kiosk <Col N="387" /> an economic proposition.  That is not the proper criterion.  If a telephone kiosk were installed, far more calls would be made.  Admittedly, there is some abuse of telephone kiosks, but that does not take place by the general public.  In many cases privacy is not provided for in post office telephones and for that reason people are reluctant to use them.</P>
    <P>There are some areas in which the people will not go in to make a call. The drift from the land, the depopulation of the countryside is one of the most cogent reasons that can be advanced for the provision of public telephones in sparsely populated areas.  It would be an amelioration of the position of those who are spread so thinly on the ground now if they had the comfort of knowing that in an emergency they need only run down the road and phone for help.  It could mean the saving of a life.  A doctor died in a tragic accident on the Edgeworthstown/ Longford road six or eight months ago.  Had a telephone been available his life might have been saved.  Because he could not get medical attention in time he bled to death.</P>
    <P>The Minister argues that it is uneconomic to instal these telephones. Economics should not enter into it.  It is an amenity that should be provided. It would be invaluable in the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, in getting in touch with the local AI station, in getting in touch with the rehabilitation centres, with the veterinary surgeon, the doctor, the priest and even with one's friends and relations.  The Minister, of course, comes from Limerick and he does not understand the problems of the West.</P>
    <P>There are all kinds of voluntary organisations saving the Government and the local authorities a tremendous amount of money.  This saving should be weighed against the economics of providing telephones in rural areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to television, reception is poor in my part of the country. Because it is so poor the people should not have to pay the same licence fee as those who live in areas where reception <Col N="388" /> is very good.  They are, in fact, subsidising the television in those areas where reception is satisfactory. This is not justifiable.  If they fail to pay the licence fee they should not be prosecuted.  The television is there but it is of very little use.</P>
    <P>Postal charges are becoming prohibitive. It costs almost a shilling to post a letter now.  Decimalisation has had a demoralising effect really.</P>
    <P>The cost of sending a postcard is far too high.  It is very hard to understand how this service can be so expensive. Anybody who thinks that costs will be reduced is fooling himself because everyone is looking for an increase in wages and it has to come from somewhere. People are crying out against increased taxation but, despite their cries, taxation continues to rise.  The Government will have to face the fact that one day the people will not be able to pay: the whole thing is a vicious circle.  People are asking themselves where this will all end.  There will have to come a day of reckoning because these huge increases cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The telephone rental is very high and charges for telephone calls are also very high.  Even a small businessman will find he has a telephone bill of £50.  Telephone costs for big business concerns must be fantastic.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are using transport a great deal in rural areas.  We are told that every move is made in an effort towards greater economy.  It is very difficult to understand how it can be more economic to deliver post by van rather than employing a postman to deliver it.  Employing a postman in a particular area created a job for someone. People do not have the same contact with the man who delivers post by van as they did with the postman who called at the door every morning.</P>
    <P>A few months ago I asked a Parliamentary Question about postal services in the Sooey (County Sligo) area. The postman who delivers in that area delivers first in Geevagh and it is about 12 o'clock before he gets to Sooey to deliver the post there.  The effect of my raising the matter in the House has <Col N="389" /> been that the postman is coming earlier but I doubt if he is coming as early as he should.  There should be a postman in each area but instead we have vans flying around the countryside delivering post as quickly as is possible.  We are told this is being done in the interests of economy but it is very difficult to see how it is more economic to have a van and a driver delivering post instead of local men delivering the post.</P>
    <P>Some postmen are being established as postmen but having operated for the last eight or ten years from the local office are now being told they have to go into the big town and operate from there.  The Department should keep postmen working in towns in the town area and postmen working in the country in the country area.  As long as postmen are established they will be quite willing to provide their own transport.  Every time a postman retires or leaves the service the Department reorganise the area, and many people do not agree with the changes they are making.</P>
    <P>Now that we are talking about entering the EEC our agricultural industry should be featured more on television.  From December to May there are many famous livestock shows and sales throughout the country. There are also many fine horse and cattle shows.  More of these shows should be televised.  This would let the farming community see what is going on throughout the country because many farmers do not get an opportunity to attend the bull sales in the Spring or the livestock shows.  They would enjoy looking at an hour-long programme of such shows on television. It would help the livestock industry if more publicity was given to the industry on television.  Apart from the programme presented by Michael Dillon, there is no programme on this subject.  Members of committees of agriculture have raised this matter many times but so far they have not succeeded in getting programmes relating to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our most valuable industry.  Recently it was estimated that our exports of agricultural products were worth approximately £500 <Col N="390" /> million, a remarkable figure when one considers the size of the country.  Considerable expenditure is devoted to the industrial sector but despite this many industries do not succeed.  On the other hand, agriculture is the mainstay of our country and it should be given prominence on our television service.</P>

      <P>This Estimate allows us to comment on a subject that many of us during the year have wished to discuss, namely, the national television service.  There are many other items equally important in this Estimate but from the point of view of reaction and interest the subject which most interests the public is that under the television authority.</P>
      <P>When discussing this Estimate we must resist the temptation to concentrate only on Telefís Éireann and in our remarks not to parade our pet prejudicies and dislikes; in fact, we must not abuse the privilege of this House, which was intended for a totally different purpose.  Using the privilege of this House for name-calling of particular producers or people employed in Telefís Éireann is a regrettable practice.  While we may have our legitimate interest in one programme or another, we should attempt to discipline ourselves in a debate of this kind to a discussion on major policy areas. We should avoid parading our pet prejudices or hoisting into general principles the foibles of individual Members of this House.  This Estimate gives us an annual crop of these remarks&mdash;this kind of character assassination and loose talk about various programmes.  Perhaps Deputy McLaughlin is correct in saying that the farmers are not catered for sufficiently in the programmes on television. I know several programmes that could well be replaced by programmes on cattle.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech the Minister remarked on the fact that he had invoked the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  In his speech he stated, rather proudly, I thought:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was the first time any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs used the powers of prohibition conferred on him by section 31 of the Broadcasting <Col N="391" /> Authority Act, 1960.  I need hardly say that it was with great reluctance that I came to the conclusion that it was necessary in the public interest to invoke that section of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister was referring to his use of that power to order the authorities to refuse any coverage to members of illegal organisations.  At least the Minister's action here was open and above-board&mdash;I am not speaking about the content of the action&mdash;and it was infinitely to be preferred to the practice that has governed relations between the Government and the television authorities in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>We know that section 31 had never been invoked prior to this time. Instead, there was frequent use of the telephone as directives were passed to the news studio or any other section of RTE.  No telltale signs were left of any ministerial instruction or directive. I must admit that the use of section 31 is infinitely to be preferred to that kind of back-handed instruction, innuendo or suggestion which had been the practice between the Government and the television station.</P>
    <P>RTE have known only one party Government since their establishment &mdash;the party opposite.  I do not know if the experience of the station would have been better or worse with any other one party government in that period.  RTE have had to live with that one party Government.</P>
    <P>There will always be tension between a public authority and a television station, especially where that station in the particular State is the only television station in that State and has been, in fact, set up by Act of Oireachtas and that party opposite were the Government, the particular Government who have been in power over its whole lifetime.  There will always be a tension between the authority and any station that concerns itself with public affairs and this must be intensified in a situation of one-party rule which has existed over most of the period of its existence, and, added to that, we must see the further complication that communications <Col N="392" /> media in this country up to the advent of Telefís Éireann were in very safe hands indeed.</P>
    <P>Most of the national newspapers in this country had a particular orientation towards acceptance of things as they were&mdash;mild criticism now and again of some flagrant abuse of power on the part of a Minister but, by and large, little of a critical nature was heard, seen or read on public affairs and politics in general.  I leave out of account the trivialisation of politics which goes on in one form or another and has gone on for a number of years.  I am talking of serious political criticism, an effort to discuss policies of parties and their actual content.  So, added to the fact that it was a one-station, a solus television station, set up by Act of the Oireachtas, there was the obstacle to be overcome by Telefís Éireann that the traditional politicians, accustomed to this kind of treatment of their views as sacrosanct, accustomed to a kind of sacerdotal treatment of their pronouncements in the press and so on, all the more were annoyed, and all the more was the stage set for deterioration of relations when something like Telefís Éireann came on the scene.  I think that Telefís Éireann has, against that background, done very well indeed.  It encountered this great blockage, this great problem of one party being in permanent rule, and against the limitations of this kind of situation, I think it has served the Irish public as well as could be expected.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we can ensure this thing which is on all our lips&mdash; whether it is in our hearts is another matter but which at least democratic politicians profess themselves to be on the side of, full freedom of expression and so on&mdash;I do not think we can ensure that in a State where in fact there is only one television station.  I know that under the way we set up Telefís Éireann, it was seen as a compromise between the commercial considerations and a station which sought to project&mdash;I think that is the word generally used in this connection &mdash;our cultural heritage, to give us some kind of a deepened process of national self-identification and so on. <Col N="393" /> It was given a lot of these rather vague tasks, but generally, what was required of this station was that it was not simply to be a station that would feed us pop music, was not to be a piped television station, but that its general role was to uplit values and to mirror the spiritual side&mdash;whatever traditional beliefs our people had.  It was asked to do these things, to fulfill these rather vague obligations, and at the same time, asked, in good straight accountant's language, to pay its way.</P>
    <P>At the very heart of Telefís Éireann there is this contradiction, and it is a contradiction to which a great deal of the station's problems are due.  Speaking honestly about it, under that Act of the Oireachtas we set Telefís Éireann an impossible task.  Other countries have faced this problem, and I think the only satisfactory solution here is that we will have a continuous problem of two contradictory aims&mdash; attempting to pay its way and attempting to give us programmes that do not depend for their viability, totally at any rate, on commercial considerations&mdash;and that these two conflicting aims cannot be held within the one station at least for an appreciable time in any satisfactory condition.  I think we must, in the future, arising from these Estimates here&mdash;and, in fact, these problems are in the section dealing with Telefís Éireann and they meet one in every line of the Estimate &mdash;at some stage tackle this particular problem, this particular conflict, and come up with some solution.</P>
    <P>I think we must at some stage, if it is granted, as we will have to grant, that the taxpayer could not pay the entire cost of a station which would have a serious public role, a station that would not be simply another kind of Telefís Luxembourg&mdash;if we wish that kind of station to continue to exist in the State, we will have to separate the commercial consideration from this particular objective.  That means, I think, that we have at some stage to set up, to clear the way, legislatively, for the establishment of a commercial television station, from which we can subsidise the State television.  I know <Col N="394" /> that it is not exactly referred to in the Estimate but this problem, as I say, underlines all that the Minister has to say on Telefís Éireann, and, sooner or later, we must face this particular problem.  I think myself that we may best ensure a certain freedom of expression, a certain confidence on both the producers' part and the people taking part in particular programmes, and we may best ensure that there would be some kind of balance of expression when, in fact, there is a choice of a second station in the country.</P>
    <P>At the present time this demand for a second station is finding its way through into the Estimate in the demand for multi-channel reception in the south.  It is interesting, at a time when Deputy Dowling says that it is necessary to break down the British paper wall, that several strongly republican areas are looking for more British television.  It is interesting to note that, and I would say that the State would be, as I think, performing its legitimate functions and at least resolving this conflict, which is at the heart of Telefís Éireann, the conflict between commercial considerations and considerations based on higher criteria if in fact we honestly faced this problem and separated these commercial considerations from these other functions of Telefís Éireann.  As long as we try to confine them in a kind of uneasy alliance in one television station, we will continue to have these sterile and barren disputes about what the purpose of television should be in the State.</P>
    <P>People make the criticism of Telefís Éireann that we do not have enough home-produced programmes and the answer will come back that these are very expensive to produce and you are back to the commercial consideration once more.  They are; but I am not convinced that, in all instances, they need be quite as expensive as is sometimes thought.  I have no technical competence in this area, but I do know that there is a great desire on the part of the ordinary people up and down the country to see good programmes on public affairs, trade union affairs, problems that concern them in their <Col N="395" /> daily lives&mdash;a great desire to see more of this kind of programme&mdash;and a great boredom on the part of the public when they face night after night &mdash;especially in those parts of the country which have no other station, no choice&mdash;dreary, out-of-date American films from before the Second World war.  This is their predicament and, in the circumstances, I suppose that one cannot be critical of their desire for a second station from anywhere&mdash;Harlech, UTV or anywhere&mdash; which will give them the news with, as <Col N="396" /> Deputy Dowling says, a British propaganda slant on one of our great national problems.  One cannot positively I suppose blame people, faced with a night given over to some old Bob Hope film of the Second World War and the possibility of an up-to-date thriller from one of the British stations, for their desire for a second choice.</P>
