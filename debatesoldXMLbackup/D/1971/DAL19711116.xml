      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any efforts are being made by the Government to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the detention in Crumlin Road Jail, Belfast, of a citizen of this State, Mr. Michael Murphy, 11 Loreto Road, Cork Street, Dublin on October 16th last; whether allegations of torture on him which appeared in recent press statements were investigated by the Government; if so, with what result; and what efforts are being made to secure his release in view of the continuing hardship to himself and his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The case mentioned by the Deputy is one of those which have been under investigation.  As I said in reply to a question on 9th November evidence is being closely examined with a view to considering recourse to the European Commission on Human Rights.  So far as securing the release of internees and detainees is concerned, the objective of policy is to end internment without trial, other repressive activities and violence in the North and to promote a political solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say how this case could be one of those under investigation when no contact was made either with Mr. Murphy or with any member of his family by the Government or by any of their agencies?  How were these facts ascertained?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Mr. Murphy's solicitor, Mr. Napier, wrote to the Department of Foreign Affairs on 2nd November giving the circumstances surrounding the detention of Mr. Murphy and the torture inflicted on him and that the Department of Foreign Affairs in reply told him that he should secure a sworn affidavit from Mr. Murphy?  I fail to see how this could have been secured in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the dates of the correspondence but I accept the Deputy's word for the date he has given.  All the information I have here is that the Department have been in contact with Mr. Napier and also, as I have indicated, they sent a representative to Belfast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the action being taken by his Department and by the Department of Foreign Affairs in this particular case is sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the overall action being taken is the <Col N="2033" /> kind of action that is necessary in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but at the same time I am sure the Taoiseach will appreciate that since this man is a constituent of mine I have a special responsibility in the matter.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that when a citizen is detained by a foreign army and when there are serious allegations concerning the infliction of torture during that detention, it is, to say the least, a serious neglect of duty on the part of the Government not to make even initial inquiries as to the circumstances in which the person is detained?  Surely such inaction on the part of the Government must appear not only to condone but to encourage the detention and torture of citizens by those who can be described only as licensed sadists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is an unhappy situation that Government action in a case like this should follow only after a Deputy has raised the matter here?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that since it was necessary for this method of questioning in the House before any Government action was taken, there must be grave disquiet at such inactivity on the part of the Government?  Further, would it be fair to describe the Government's neglect of this matter as inactivity and to say that it needs prodding in this House to get any move on it?  How can we have any confidence that the whole question of internment without trial is being dealt with as an urgent matter by the Government if this appears to be their lackadaisical attitude in this case?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can <Col N="2034" /> take it from me that the matter of internment is being dealt with seriously and as a matter of urgency.  I can only accept what Deputy Cluskey says about the date of the letter notifying this man's detention as being 2nd November.  I take it that was the first indication the Department got and that since then they have been in contact with the solicitor who wrote that letter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the provisional figures available from the latest population census, his Department have considered amending the recommendations contained in the Fitzgerald report for the Dublin area; and whether further consideration will be given to the original plans for the building of the new St. Laurence Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fitzgerald report in chapter 10.3 refers to the projections made in relation to the population of the Dublin area and suggests in chapter 10.16 that at a future date it may be necessary to have a second community hospital in South Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have already said in reply of 30th June, 1971, to a question from the Deputy that the plans envisaged some years ago for the building of a new St. Laurence's Hospital are no longer relevant taking into account the recommendations in the Fitzgerald report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the figures and the section from which the Minister has quoted, does the Minister not think that with one-third of the population of this country in the Greater Dublin area there is a need for a second general hospital on the north side of the city of Dublin, which is under-hospitalised compared with the south side?  There is a complete lack of adequate hospital facilities for patients on the north side of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is planned to bring into operation 120 beds in the Blanchardstown James Connolly Memorial Hospital within the next 12 months.  Some beds are already being <Col N="2038" /> used and that forms part of the Fitzgerald report proposal.  The question of a regional hospital is still under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that the Blanchardstown Hospital is inaccessible to the great majority of patients in north Dublin.  They have no way of getting there unless they come into the city centre and go back out again.  The majority of the patients will be channelled into the Mater Hospital.  In view of the fact that plans, a site and a board of governors are already in existence, does he not think that he should go ahead with the building of the St. Laurence Hospital as was very properly planned some years ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Byrne looks at a map of the Greater Dublin development on the north side of the city he will see that the development of Blanchardstown Hospital is quite inevitable from a geographical point of view.  The hospital grounds are there, and the beds in the hospital which are no longer used for tuberculosis purposes can be made use of. There is a very active committee, of which a member of the Deputy's party is chairman, developing the facilities there.  We are still examining the question of where a regional hospital should be placed.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister to elaborate on this?  Perhaps he would now reply to the second part of the question.  He replied previously in 1970.  This is the end of 1971.  I should like to know what is to happen about the disposal of the property in St. Stephen's Green.  Will the money accruing from this go to the Exchequer?

The reciprocal arrangements cease to apply to British insurance contributions for the purpose of disability benefit when a man reaches the age of 65 and payment of disability benefit accordingly ceased when the claimant reached that age.

      <P>A general pensionable retiring age of 65 years applies to State servants and employees of semi-State bodies with whose superannuation schemes I am concerned.  The main exception to this is the pension scheme for non-established State employees.  Employees to whom this scheme applies may retire or be required to retire at age 65 but service up to age 70 may reckon for superannuation.  In the case of holders of military service pensions service up to age 75 may reckon.  The introduction of legislation for a uniform retiring age of 65 is not envisaged.

He lost £2,000 on the deal.  There are many other people in a similar position.  Surely the Minister will admit that the present system is unfair and unjust to one section of the community?

      <P>The question was put down by Deputy Donnellan of Galway and in that county there are 8,800 applicants for the beef cattle incentive scheme.  This requires the extension of the inspection period at both ends; as Deputies will recall, it is extended forward to 1st March and at the other end to 31st December. What Deputy Creed has said is probably right, but the great mass of cattle in Galway and elsewhere have already had their second inspections.  The net point here is that the great success of the beef cattle incentive scheme requires greater time to carry them out, but there is no undue delay that causes unnecessary difficulty to people.  However, if there are such and Deputies <Col N="2050" /> bring them to my notice I shall have them looked into.</P>

      <P>No grant is paid towards the cost of imported fish boxes out of the funds provided for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the Exchequer. The Fishing Industry Development Committee, for which the board provides secretarial and other services, has operated a scheme in recent years whereby Irish fishermen, fish processors, wholesalers and retailers could obtain grants from the committee's funds towards the cost of purchase of approved plastic fish boxes.  These funds are private funds contributed by the fish trade and decisions regarding their disposal are a matter for the committee.  The purpose of the grant scheme for plastic fish boxes was to encourage the use of a box that would improve the quality and appearance of Irish fish.  No plastic box of Irish manufacture was on the market at the time of the scheme and, as the scheme was intended only as a promotional project to initiate interest in the plastic type of box, it has served its purpose and has since been suspended.</P>

      <P>When account is taken of the proposal by the US authorities to remove non-cotton textiles from the scope of the surcharge, the value of Irish exports affected by the measure is estimated at approximately £35 million.  While the maximum rate of surcharge is 10 per cent, the actual rate varies from product to product.  It is not possible to say precisely what the cost of off-setting the surcharge would be, but it is estimated that it could be as much as £3 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The extent to which the Irish manufacturer will be constrained by his US customer to bear the cost of the surcharge will be determined by a number of factors, such as the elasticity of demand for the goods in question, and the nature of the association between the importer and exporter.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that the Government, through Córas Tráchtála, have announced certain measures to help exporters who are adversely affected by the surcharge.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that a driver (name supplied) in Dublin with a valid driving licence has been refused insurance cover by other insurance companies since the company with which he was insured withdrew from the Irish motor insurance market; and whether he will take steps to require all insurance companies to quote a premium on a competitive basis to every driver seeking insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of this case.  I presume the person referred to by the Deputy is a former policyholder of the Century Insurance Company <Col N="2057" /> which withdrew from motor and some other classes of insurance earlier this year.  As I indicated in answer to a question on 6th May last another company expressed a willingness to help Century clients.</P>
      <P>If the man referred to is unable to get cover, he should apply to the Minister for Local Government, who has special machinery available, arising from his responsibilities under road traffic legislation, for securing cover for persons who have been refused cover entirely or who have been quoted a rate so prohibitive as to be tantamount to refusal.</P>
      <P>I have no power to compel an insurance company to undertake any particular risk, and the existence of the machinery I have just referred to is relevant in this respect.  Should the Committee on Insurance currently sitting have anything to say on the subject, I shall of course consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not feel that he ought to have power to require an insurance company which is making profit in this country to quote for any risk put to them?  If a firm are engaged in motor insurance, should such company not be required to quote, even though their rate may be prohibitive?  People would then have at least some opportunity of being insured, because firms will quote competitively.  No company should be allowed to remain in business if they refuse to quote a rate, while it is for the company, of course, to decide what their rates will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts, a person must be licensed in order to carry on the business of a house agent.  The definition of &ldquo;house agent&rdquo; in the Acts covers only the case where somebody acts as agent for another person, for reward, in connection with the purchase, sale or letting of a house or flat.</P>
      <P>I understand that there are agencies which for a fee give information about available accommodation.  The Auctioneers and House Agents Acts do not apply to this type of activity and there is no requirement that an agency must be licensed in order to engage in such business.

They charge a fee for information and this is not covered by legislation. Surely the Minister will agree, therefore, that where young migrants come to Dublin and seek flats, or where young civil servants or young married couples seek flats, this kind of exploitation whereby a charge is made for information should not be allowed? Ten or 12 people are sent along to the flats and are charged a hefty fee simply for being provided with information by the people who actually own the premises.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>International Federation of Voluntary Health Services Funds (Corporate Status) Order, 1971&mdash; a copy of which Order in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann on 2nd November, 1971.</P>
      <P>This draft order is being made under the International Health Bodies (Corporate Status) Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Act I mentioned that I expected that it would be used in the first instance to enable the incorporation in Ireland of the International Federation of Health Service Funds.  As anticipated, an application has been made by that body for the making of a corporate status order to enable their incorporation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>This body had its origins at the first International Conference on Voluntary Health Insurance held in Dublin in 1966 at which delegates decided to establish an International federation to promote co-operation in the development and study of voluntary non-profit-making health services throughout the world.  At the second international conference held in Sydney in 1968 a constitution was adopted which set up the International Federation of Voluntary Health Service Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aims and purposes of the federation are to assist individuals in obtaining <Col N="2068" /> health services and for this purpose to promote the development and study of voluntary non-profit health services throughout the world.  These aims are in accord with the type of international body envisaged in the Act.  The federation is a non-profit-making body.</P>
    <P>Membership is open to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  organisations carrying out, or co-ordinating voluntary health services on a non-profit basis;</P>
    <P>(2)  other organisations interested in voluntary non-profit health services; and</P>
    <P>(3)  persons interested in voluntary non-profit health services.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board is a member of the federation and its general manager is secretary general and treasurer of the federation. The former general manager of the board is administrative director of the federation.  Present membership of the federation consists of 89 organisations under category (1), seven under category (2) and eight individuals in category (3).</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the federation is a body that should be welcomed to this country and that its status is such that I would not hesitate to permit its incorporation.  I have, in accordance with the terms of the Act, consulted the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he has no objection to granting corporate status to this body.</P>
    <P>I would therefore commend this resolution to the House.</P>

      <P>We, in the Labour Party, are not opposed to the setting up of this body here, but I would like to point out that we are opposed to voluntary health services because we believe voluntary health services are not the kind of services that are needed <Col N="2069" /> since health should not be on a voluntary basis.  Health is too important a matter to be on a voluntary basis and, the cost of health services being what it is, the onus is on the State to intervene and provide proper services for all the people.  We can no longer accept that health should be a voluntary matter.  I am concerned with the fact that health services in Europe are mostly voluntary health services; the State pays only for the lower income group.  I am concerned about this because of our proposed entry into the European Economic Community.  No health service should be on the basis of one's ability to pay for it.  Countries will have to accept the fact that there is an obligation on the State to provide proper health services for all.  I know the Minister believes in private enterprise and voluntary organisations but he cannot deny that health is too important a matter to be left to voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the Draft of the Regulations entitled Social Welfare (Insurance Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1971.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to give the full protection of the Social Welfare Act to sick or disabled persons employed in rehabilitation work by local or public authorities. Hitherto such employment with these authorities was not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts except for occupational injuries purposes and, as a result, title to other benefits was liable to be impaired through lack of contribution by the employment in question.  Representations have been made by the persons concerned, the organisations involved in rehabilitation, and by Deputies to amend the relevant provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I shall pass on this.  It is only a short statement.  I undertook in the House to have the statutory basis of this exemption examined with a view to determining whether its retention is justified.  The exemption is contained in paragraph 7 of Part 2 of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952 which was added by the Social Welfare Insurance (Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1952.  Under this provision <Col N="2072" /> employment by any local or public authority of a sick or disabled person with a view to his rehabilitation is exempted from all insurance under the Social Welfare Acts except for occupational injuries benefits.  The particular category of employment which brought this question to notice is that of park ranger with Dublin Corporation where the men concerned are receiving a wage which in the normal course is equal to that paid to many insurable categories but who feel they are risking the sacrifice of entitlements under the Social Welfare Acts while in the employment in question and paying no social welfare insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>These regulations will restore such employees and others employed by local and public authorities on a rehabilitative basis to full insurance coverage.</P>

      <P>Like the other Deputies present, I am at a disadvantage in not knowing exactly what the Minister said.  His being a Donegal man and me a Cork man might help to explain some part of the difficulty but I take it the Minister must have found some flaw in the Social Welfare legislation that he now wishes to remedy. Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The order amending the regulation in question is on the Order Paper.  It is as simple as this. Deputies raised the matter in the House previously: persons employed by local authorities for rehabilitation purposes have been exempt from paying weekly contributions.  This was done at a time when it was felt that it would be an inducement to the local authorities to employ persons requiring rehabilitation.  We now have complaints from the people concerned since they can be, and sometimes are, deprived of the benefits of contributing and I am anulling the regulation which exempts them.  That is the explanation in my best Donegal accent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I heard <Col N="2073" /> Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Tully and, perhaps, others on those benches making this complaint during the discussion on the Social Welfare Bill and I am glad the Minister has seen his way to remedy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce the amending regulation under subsections 4 and 5 of section 4 of the 1952 Act.  As one of the Deputies who made direct representations to the Minister and his Department in this matter, I am glad that here we have a practical demonstration of the way in which Dáil Éireann works and of the way the Minister and his staff respond to representations.  I am pleased that the position is now being rectified.</P>
      <P>In Dublin Corporation, the local authority with which I am most familiar, a number of sick or disabled persons are employed with a view to their rehabilitation.  Unfortunately, the regulations did not give them full social insurance coverage.  I am glad that provision is also being made by the Minister for the granting of credit contributions to the category in question to enable them, immediately on reentry to insurance, to fulfil statutory conditions which govern entitlement to benefits particularly disability benefit and unemployment benefits.  I am glad that the persons who raised the matter directly with a number of Deputies, who in turn raised it with the Minister, will now find the position ameliorated somewhat.  I welcome the move and thank the Minister for this direct change in legislation.  Not only should the new regulations be introduced but local authorities throughout the country should be advised by the Minister of the change so that they will be encouraged to employ an ever-increasing proportion of persons for rehabilitation purposes.  Private employers should likewise be made aware of the change in the regulations.

      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on taking the initiative in introducing this amending legislation which I think is very important. It also shows that a Minister who sees injustice is prepared to do something about it.  I shall say no more except that, perhaps, he might act in the same way about some of the other injustices in the present Social Welfare Bill which I have brought to his attention. I should like to see him coming in next week and the week after to do the right thing.  He would have my admiration and full support.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> With all due respect, in the course of his remarks I think the Minister said that one of the points of this was to encourage employers to employ physically handicapped people.  I shall not take up the time of the House for more than a few moments.  I know from experience that people who are physically handicapped find it difficult to get full time employment when they have to compete in the market with people who are physically fit.  I believe something could be done in the Department of Local Government to ensure that local authorities would employ a quota of such people.  They have jobs such as that of telephonist and other work that these people can do perfectly well.  I think it should be nearly compulsory on local authorities to employ a quota of physically handicapped persons.  The same could be said for CIE and all the other semi-State bodies and, indeed, the civil service.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his influence to see that this is done.  The Minister for Health should also interest <Col N="2075" /> himself in it and the Government in general.</P>

I hope the local authorities will continue, wherever possible, to employ people who are undergoing rehabilitation work.  The reason these people were exempt in the first instance was to encourage local authorities to employ them.</P>
      <P>A similar order will have to be approved by the Seanad and when it has been approved the regulation will be operative but it will not be retrospective and cases could arise of persons who would move out of rehabilitation employment and get a period of work and then become unemployed or disabled and find themselves not in a position to qualify for any of the benefits for which they would ordinarily qualify had they been insured during the entire period of their rehabilitation employment.  If that type of case arises, I propose to amend the governing regulations to give them the necessary credited contributions.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that one of the provisions of this Bill is a restriction of the right to trial by jury in respect of the Circuit Court.  The Minister in his speech referred to the third interim report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  It is significant that in that very report it was stated that not only was the solicitors' profession evenly divided on the question as to whether there should be any restriction of the right to trial by jury <Col N="2076" /> but the Bar were overwhelmingly against any restriction of the right to trial by jury.  So also were the law schools of both UCD and Trinity College, who were consulted.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat disturbing, therefore, that the Minister should come into the House to introduce a provision which involves a restriction of what is a very fundamental right.  One would have thought that if there were any serious doubt at all expressed the Minister would not have moved in this matter. Not only was there doubt expressed but the overwhelming body of authoritative opinion which was consulted on the question expressed itself against a restriction of the right to trial by jury.</P>
      <P>This is probably a subject which does not set the public imagination alight because most members of the public are fortunate enough not to have to come in contact with the courts in the course of their lives.  However, those few who have will probably realise with considerable force the value of the jury system as it operates in this country at the moment.  It is a protection for the ordinary member of the public against a completely ingrown legal profession laying down its own rules and interpreting those rules often within fairly wide limits set by Parliament.</P>
      <P>I think it is fair to say that the jury system, being probably one of the only methods whereby the ordinary member of the public, the non-lawyer, can directly participate in the legal system, serves to make the law intelligible to the ordinary member of the public.  It is very important that we should preserve and be seen to be preserving the fundamental right of the ordinary member of the public, who is not a lawyer, to participate in the judicial process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the legal system should not become a professional ritual solely performed by the legal profession.  The ordinary member of the public should be allowed to participate and any restriction of this right is, to my mind, wrong.  Where there is a jury trial a number of different minds are brought to bear on the determination of a question.  The people who are serving on the jury may <Col N="2077" /> not be geniuses but there are a variety of different people there and there is less likelihood that they will be wrong than there is that one individual will be wrong, no matter how brilliant he is, because he is acting alone and they are acting as a panel of 12 men.  There is less likelihood that they will make a mistake.</P>
    <P>There are also many cases coming before the courts which require a practical knowledge of business&mdash; questions like the assessment of damages.  Somebody who has been involved in business, either as an employee or as an employer, will know exactly the extent of damage caused to a person by a particular injury in regard to jeopardising, or minimising, his prospects of employment.  If one is involved in this sort of work or involved in employing people, one is likely to know the effect of a particular injury much more than if one is just a man sitting on the Bench who more than likely has never done manual work in his life and more than likely also has never even been in the position of employing manual workers at any time in his life.  Jurymen are much more in a position to assess the real impact of a particular injury on a man's employment prospects than are judges.</P>
    <P>There are also many cases where the common law lays down that the criterion should be the judgment of a reasonable man.  One should note that the common law does not lay down that the criterion should be the judgment of a reasonable lawyer.  It is the judgment of a reasonable man, an ordinary man, not somebody who has been schooled in law and whose judgement is possibly canalised into particular lines of thought but the judgment of an ordinary reasonable man who has been open to many influences to which lawyers, due to some form of occupational myopia are not likely to be open.  The implementation of that maxim is something which can only be properly carried through if there is full and frequent access to jury trial. Although it is true that the present provision for jury trial in the Circuit Court which it is now proposed to abolish, is not availed of to a very <Col N="2078" /> great extent that is no reason for removing that right.  It is very important that that right should be there.</P>
    <P>The other point is that while people might not have felt the necessity to avail of this right of jury trial, with its present financial limits for jurisdiction in the Circuit Court, it is proposed in the Bill that these jurisdictional limits should be widened considerably.  It is likely with the increased financial jurisdiction involved in the Bill that actions of a sufficient seriousness will be dealt with by the Circuit Court. People who from now on will be involved in Circuit Court cases may feel that the seriousness of their case warrants a jury trial yet as well as widening the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court this Bill proposes to remove the basic right to jury trial from people appearing before the Circuit Court. This should not happen.</P>
    <P>One thing which is absent in the Bill, and which should not be absent &mdash;although I recognise the financial limitations involved&mdash;is some provision for civil legal aid.  In many civil actions there is not true equality between the litigants: one side may be a wealthy corporation or a wealthy individual and the other side may be a very poor person.  Very often cases do not come to trial, although if they had it might well have been the case that the persons through whose fault they had not come to trial would have won.  This is because the people concerned do not feel sufficiently confident about their case to be prepared to take the risk of employing counsel, although if they had employed counsel they might have won.  They are not prepared to take this risk because there is no provision whereby they can get State funds to enable them to insist on their rights. There should not be a financial bias in favour of wealthy litigants in that they are in a position to take risks and employ very good counsel.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the Bill to maintenance orders.  It has been a matter of comment for a considerable time that courts are not empowered to make reasonable maintenance orders.  Up to now the courts could not order the putative father of an illegitimate child to pay more than £1 a week <Col N="2079" /> towards the maintenance of that child. In terms of the present cost of living the figure of £1 is unrealistic; so also is the £4 a week limit in respect of a deserted wife.  While the new limits are a definite improvement the case can be made that £15 is not enough as a limit. I am not saying that in every case this figure of £15 should be reached but we must remember that what we are setting out here are limits to the court's powers to order the payment of maintenance. There may well be exceptional cases where a figure above £15 is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps are being taken in regard to having Irish maintenance orders enforced abroad and foreign maintenance orders enforced in Ireland?  I was talking to a Member of the British Parliament only two weeks ago and he said that in Britain there is provision for the making of international agreements whereby British maintenance orders would be enforced abroad and the maintenance orders of other countries with whom they had made this agreement would be enforced in Britain. That seems a very sensible provision. However, although there is provision for making such agreements by Britain they have made very few and certainly I do not think they have made one with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man who deserts his wife here goes over to England.  The fact that he can escape a maintenance order merely by going over to England makes a mockery of the whole thing.  There is a common labour market between <Col N="2080" /> Britain and Ireland at present and it is very easy for a man to go to England. This trend will become even more marked when we enter the EEC because there will be a common labour market without immigration barriers throughout the ten member countries of the EEC.  People will be able to skip from one country to the next if they want to avoid paying maintenance orders.  They will have a choice of eight other countries in Europe as well as Britain to which they can go and thereby avoid paying maintenance simply because our maintenance orders are not enforcible in those countries. Before entering the EEC we should initiate a multilateral agreement for the mutual enforcement of maintenance orders throughout the EEC.</P>
    <P>With the expansion of the jurisdiction of both the District and Circuit Courts there is a strong case for having extra judges in the Circuit Court.  The existing judges are already overtaxed and many cases are being held up for an unduly long time because it is impossible to get a judge to deal with them.  The Minister should have a very close look at this because if we are going to expand the jurisdiction still further without increasing the number of judges it is clear there will be an even greater backlog of cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he is extending the right of audiences to solicitors to all courts in the land.  He stated that this is intended to go some way towards the removal of the rigid distinction which exists in the legal profession between barristers and solicitors.  We all agree that this division is a fundamental one.  It is my opinion that this division between solicitors and barristers is operating in some ways as a restrictive practice and is providing a less than good service to the public. We should approach this problem in a more fundamental manner than that adopted by the Minister.  The provisions in this Bill are worthwhile but these reforms should not be carried out in a piecemeal fashion.  It is not desirable that this whole question should be approached by carrying out some minor reforms now and waiting until a future date to carry out further reforms.  We should take a long hard look at this division in the legal profession and try <Col N="2081" /> to evolve a comprehensive approach to the problem rather than adopt the piecemeal method we are adopting at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to re-emphasise the great value of the jury system.  There is one objectionable aspect in this Bill in that it will involve restriction in the operation of the jury system.  With regard to eligibility for jury service, I do not think there is provision in the Bill for an extension of eligibility. Women should be eligible to serve on juries.  We are moving in the direction of women's rights in many areas and their right to serve on juries should not be excluded.  It is surprising that the Bill does not contain some provision in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended, some years ago, the extension of jurisdiction of these inferior courts and the point was made in the lengthy Seanad debate on this Bill that there has been very tardy progress on law reform in general. Points of reform were unanimously recommended many years ago, notably in the programme of law reform in 1962 and reference was made to this in the Seanad debate.  While this Bill is welcome in several respects, its appearance now is evidence of the kind of hesitant approach of the Government on matters of reform of law. There are a number of such reforms which have been agreed by a number of committees on which little progress has been made.</P>
      <P>The principal feature of this Bill&mdash; extension of jurisdiction&mdash;was recommended some years ago and most Deputies would be in favour of that change.  The point was made also that the extension of jurisdiction for these inferior courts will mean a great additional burden of work devolving on the people in these courts.  This is a particular problem in the Dublin area where there is a considerable delay in cases going through at Circuit Court level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some debate about the factors contributing to this delay.  One factor which contributes to it is the factor of insufficient number of Circuit <Col N="2082" /> Court judges and this must be considered with regard to this Bill.  If we are going to increase the jurisdiction to a figure of £2,000, which will mean a greater workload, we must consider seriously how we are going to tackle this increased workload.  I do not know if the Minister gave some indication about this matter to the Seanad but I hope he will give us some information on this point here in reply.</P>
    <P>The increase to £250 in regard to the District Courts will mean that these courts will be occupied with work that previously was conducted at Circuit Court level.  This matter also needs urgent consideration, particularly having regard to the delays occurring at present.  It is a difficult and arduous process in many instances to get a rapid hearing in the Dublin Circuit Court at present.  I am not blaming the people working in these courts. The major factor contributing to that situation is the insufficient number of Circuit Court judges.</P>
    <P>In considering this extension of jurisdiction, which most people agree is worthwhile and necessary, the only controversial matter entering into this debate is the question of the abolition of juries in these inferior courts.  I do not think the debate need necessarily concentrate on the relative merits of jury versus specialist lawyer in cases of this kind.  The point has been made by the Minister that at present juries are rarely used at these inferior court levels and this is true.  The question may fairly be put: why it is necessary to eliminate them in this Bill?  If they are rarely used why is it necessary to legislate for their removal?  I do not think the Minister has proved his case for the necessity for legislating for the abolition of juries at this level.  The point has been made that with the new financial jurisdiction up to £2,000 in cases of defamation, slander or libel, the juries can perform a worthwhile service and may be helpful in these cases.</P>
    <P>The suspicion may reasonably remain that the intention is to abolish juries up to High Court level in civil <Col N="2083" /> actions and I think this was mentioned by Senator Ryan in the Seanad debate. I know the Minister at a later stage denied there was any such intention in his mind.  Nevertheless, there remains an unhappy impression that, to some extent, in the Minister's mind, and perhaps in the minds of certain of his advisers, there is the idea that juries should be axed where they are not considered necessary.  This is a dangerous tendency.  I think Senator Ryan mentioned the advisability of getting rid of them up to High Court level.  They have been rarely invoked in cases up to now and the necessity devolves on the Minister to explain why it is necessary to sign their obituary, as we do for these inferior courts, in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the aspect of the Bill which gives a solicitor a right of hearing in the courts, that right is there already but is rarely utilised and it is probable that it will be used just as rarely in the future.  However, it is right that it be written into the Bill. This, of course, leads to the question of the amalgamation of the professions of solicitor and barrister.  I have no definite views on this matter but there has been a great deal of superficial talk from Government circles on the so-called advantages of such amalgamation. I am not convinced that such amalgamation would result in any great advantages either to litigants or to the legal profession generally.  Some years ago the Minister for Justice of the day told us here that it would be a matter of not longer than a year before amalgamation took place.  I wonder if there has been any fresh appraisal during that period at departmental level of the so-called advantages of amalgamation. I should like the Minister to tell us, when he is replying what his mind is on this matter.  I suppose there could be certain advantages in the short term to people practising in the capital.  One could foresee the growth of certain large legal firms&mdash;there may be advantages in that&mdash;but I am not convinced that amalgamation would result in any great advantages to the public in general.  The least compelling part of the Minister's argument in favour of amalgamation is that in some way or <Col N="2084" /> other it would be necessary in the event of our becoming a member of the EEC. From what I can see this unfortunate group, the EEC, are being used for every unwelcome innovation over the past three or four years.  The latest in that litany of necessary changes which must be undertaken is the proposed introduction of a value-added tax.  We are not concerned during this debate with that matter but I am merely making the point that we seem to take very literally and more rigorously than any other applicant member the changes which must follow on accession to the EEC.  I am not influenced by the argument that this particular amalgamation becomes an automatic necessity on entry to the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals, also, with the question of deserted wives.  The suggested increase in the allowance for deserted wives from £4 to £7.50 with an additional allowance for each dependent child of £2.50 is inadequate by any standards in today's conditions. I am aware that the Minister has power to vary this level but I do not think that the suggestion that allowances for deserted wives should be related to the incomes of their husbands would have the backing of all of us here because I do not see how this would work out fairly in practice. Perhaps the proper thing to do would be to arrive at an allowance that would bear some relationship to the cost of living and to current income levels.  I cannot foresee legislation going through here that would relate simply to the previous status of deserted wives.  This is not in any way denying the hardship caused to women who are deserted by their husbands and who have heavy commitments in relation to the education of children and so on.  The Minister's proposals are inadequate in the circumstances of 1971.  I do not know when the previous figure of £4 was fixed but I am sure that whenever it was costs in general have advanced in the interim by more than £3.50 a week.</P>

    <P>It can be said that everybody is agreed about increasing the jurisdiction of inferior courts.  This will mean that more cases can be heard in the localities of origin and this is a good development both for the litigants and for the general community in the different areas.  On the question of the abolition of juries, I am not convinced by the arguments put forward.  In many of the cases in which it is said in this Bill they will not feature any more, they were rarely availed of anyway.  I should like a definite indication of what is the Minister's own attitude on this question of amalgamation in the legislation.  There has been a lot of loose talk about the matter for a number of years.  In the Seanad, the Minister spoke of the necessity of inaugurating a debate on these matters.  This <Col N="2086" /> House would welcome such a debate so that we might hear what are the socalled advantages of the amalgamation of the professions.  I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity of the debate on this Bill to let us know what is his thinking on these matters at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Dáil for what I think I can say was, generally speaking, a welcome for nearly all the provisions of the Bill, if not all of them.  I will endeavour to deal with the points that were raised.  I may not deal with all the more detailed ones as I can deal with them on Committee Stage.  As the House knows, the Bill has already been fully debated in the Seanad where quite a number of amendments were made to it.  Many of the points raised here were raised and threshed out in the Seanad.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, the Seanad debate was very useful.  The Bill which left the Seanad was an improvement on the Bill that was introduced into it.  The Seanad debate was conducted in the right sort of spirit.  It was a constructive effort on the part of everybody to improve the Bill.</P>
      <P>There has not been a great deal of disagreement about the Bill here.  The first point I should like to deal with is the question of the general increase in jurisdictions which is the main matter involved in this Bill.  In so far as there may have been any criticism of the proposed figures here it was possibly on the lines that they may not be sufficiently great.  In fact, the only criticism in the Seanad was to the opposite effect, that the figures were too great.  Senator Mrs. Robinson had an amendment or amendments down to reduce the figures fairly substantially. I could not accept that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that the figures reflect pretty accurately the majority opinion of the Committee which advised on this matter, taking into account the fact that the committee reported several years ago and that, of course, the value of money has fallen somewhat in the meantime.  Therefore, it was necessary to set a figure somewhat above the <Col N="2087" /> average of the figures recommended by various members of the committee. The average recommendation of the committee when they reported in 1966 for the Circuit Court was £1,500.  The feeling of the Government was that that was several years ago and that, if you were to take account of inflation and probable future inflationary trends, the figure would want to be somewhat above £1,500.  We finally settled on a figure of £2,000.  There were members of the committee who thought that perhaps £1,000 would be enough.</P>
    <P>There were others who were strongly of the opinion that it should be as much as £5,000.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the power which exists under the Courts of Justice Acts for a litigant to sign a consent beforehand, if both parties are prepared to do that, to have any action tried in the Circuit Court irrespective of the amount involved. Unfortunately that procedure is not used as much as one would like to see it used.  One would hope that, with the extra jurisdiction given, a proportion of claims for more than £2,000 will in fact be heard by consent in the Circuit Court.  The increases are substantial.  In the District Court they amount to 400 per cent and in the Circuit Court to 233? per cent.  There have also been very substantial increases in the equity jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.  This will have the effect, I suppose, of bringing 95 per cent of property within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, which is as I think it should be.</P>
    <P>I hope to give early consideration to the recommendations in the fifth interim report of the committee in regard to the introduction into the District Court of similar machinery to the consent machinery in the Circuit Court.  In that instance the committee were not in agreement on the particular form which that procedure should have in the District Court.  Obviously some limitation will have to be placed on the consent jurisdiction in the District Court if that proposal is eventually accepted by the Government, unlike the situation in the Circuit Court where there is no limit at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> So far as problems may arise in the Circuit Court due to its increased jurisdiction and the increased business that will be created there by the provisions of the Bill, I should like to say that, so far as one can judge&mdash;and one cannot anticipate these things with a great degree of accuracy&mdash;in approximate terms the amount of business which the Circuit Court will acquire will be equal to the amount it will lose at the other end.  It will lose the £50 to £250 type of case which, of course, is very much more frequent than the £600 to £2,000 type of case which it will acquire.  One must balance that by saying that the £600 to £2,000 action is a more substantial one and takes a good deal longer to hear.  We do not anticipate that there will be such an abnormal increase in the work of the Circuit Court as to create severe difficulties.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point that in the Circuit Court in Dublin at the moment there are difficulties, as quite a number of Deputies mentioned here and quite a number of Senators mentioned in the Seanad.  There are delays which I regard as longer than one can tolerate.  I decided accordingly some months ago that it would be necessary to appoint a further Circuit Court judge in Dublin.  I have not yet been able to approach the Government to ask them to make this appointment because I had accommodation difficulties and I felt I could not justify appointing an additional judge unless we had a suitable place in which he could sit.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that I now appear to have overcome the accommodation difficulties and that this appointment can and will be made in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that the appointment of one more Circuit Court judge will be sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one more judge should clear the arrears.  If a situation arose after the enactment of this Bill&mdash;and it will have a somewhat delayed effect because the extra cases will not come on for hearing for about nine months or so, after it has passed &mdash;in which the work of the Circuit <Col N="2089" /> Court had increased to an appreciable extent I would ask the Government to appoint another temporary Circuit Court judge.  I might explain to the House that existing legislation envisages the appointment of ten permanent judges only in the Circuit Court and there are ten there at the moment.  Therefore any additional judges would have to be temporary judges.</P>
      <P>While saying this I should like to draw the attention of the House to a speech I made and, to a greater extent, to a speech made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald in the Seanad on the Second Reading of this Bill.  This suggestion had been put up to me and I said to the Seanad at that time, as was the case, that I was considering it.  Senator FitzGerald said he did not think I should consider the question of the appointment of extra judges.  He felt, if I may paraphrase him, that the existing judges should do more work. He set out the facts and figures of the sittings of the average Circuit Court judge.  Certainly, I could not take it on myself to disagree with him but, at the same time, unfortunately, I cannot enforce longer hours on the judges.</P>
      <P>The general sitting week of a Circuit Court judge in a provincial Circuit Court is: he does not sit on Monday; he sits on Tuesday for four hours; he sits on Wednesday for four hours; he sits on Thursday for four hours; on Friday he sits usually for two hours, sometimes three hours.  I am not saying that this is the sitting week of every circuit judge; it is not; but, it is a fair average of the sitting week of most of the provincial judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one provincial judge who does sit on Mondays, I understand, and the Dublin judges sit on five days a week.  At the same time, I do not think anybody could suggest that that working week is excessive and I do not think that anybody could suggest that judges generally could not undertake longer sittings.  It is really, I am afraid, a matter for themselves rather than a matter for me.  I cannot dictate the sittings, nor do I wish to.  One must allow a certain flexibility because, of course, there are many occasions when <Col N="2090" /> a judge may have to sit late into the night.  There are possibly, to compensate for that, occasions when a list collapses and a judge may sit only five or ten minutes in a day.  That, of course is not his fault because the collapse of lists is not foreseeable.  But, one could say that judges in general could, perhaps, sit longer hours and I think greater productivity, if I may express it in those terms, could be achieved in this direction, not just from the Circuit Court but, indeed, from all our courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the point of who should keep a record of the decisions made by the District Court in view of the fact that an order would, of course, quite clearly be required only in a small minority of cases.  It would be a matter for the rules committee to prescribe what type of record should be kept and who should keep it but I do not anticipate any difficulty whatever about this.  A very informal note in a book, either by the clerk or by the justice, will be sufficient.  Deputies will be aware that in the Circuit Court there are no rules laying down what type of record should be kept and no difficulty is experienced by the county registrar afterwards in having an order made up.  In particular, of course, in civil cases the orders have to be made up by the solicitors and approved by the county registrar and no problem has been found in that respect and I would not anticipate any problem in that respect in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I feel that it is necessary to retain the liability of the district justice to sign his orders.  I do not think it is quite a correct analogy to draw with the Circuit Court where you have a somewhat different situation in that you have a legally qualified man as registrar of that court, a man with a minimum of either eight or ten years practical experience since qualification.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick went on to make what I think is quite a valid point with regard to the registration of District Court decrees as judgment mortgages. The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have, in fact, made a recommendation to the same effect in their fifth interim report, namely, that the machinery of sections 3 and 4 of the <Col N="2091" /> Circuit Court (Registration of Judgments) Act, 1937 should be available in the District Court, particularly in the light of the extended jurisdiction, because while there were doubts as to whether in many cases it was worth registering as a judgment mortgage a decree for £50, it would be worth registering a decree for £200 or £250.  This recommendation is under consideration at present together with the committee's further recommendation made in their tenth interim report dealing with the subject of interest rate on judgments, which was also raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  When decisions have been reached, the necessary implementing provisions will be included in a suitable Bill.  I might add that the committee recommended in their tenth interim report that the interest rate should be 1 per cent above the prevailing Central Bank rediscount rate.  This would, of course be a very great improvement on the existing rate of interest.</P>

      <P>In or about eight.  It would be 1 per cent above that.  Of course, Deputy Fitzpatrick again, I think it was, made the point that interest should run from an earlier date than it does at the moment and we have had situations that have been brought to my notice where insurance companies have appealed against large awards although they felt they had little or no hope of success but they did this because the price of the money was such that it paid them to hold on to their money until the latest possible date.  They were going to have to pay the plaintiff only 4 per cent, whereas they might be able to get 9 per cent or possibly 10 per cent for their money elsewhere.  This is something that I feel is very unfair to a plaintiff and it is something that I would wish to remedy.</P>

      <P>This is done every day of the week very successfully by solicitors in closing sales where there may be a delay for a month or so.  The solicitors put the balance of the purchase money on deposit receipt in their joint names and the parties are then entitled to whatever interest would have accrued on it in that short period. This applies, of course, even more to a lodgment which may lie in court for as long as 12 months or even 18 months before it is eventually paid out and one would like to see the plaintiff or, indeed, whichever party is successful, having the benefit of interest on that money in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am probably right in saying that the only aspect of this Bill, or section of this Bill, which did not seem to find favour with the Dáil and also did not find favour with some Members in the Seanad, is the proposal in section 6 to abolish the right of a civil jury in the Circuit Court.  We threshed this matter out at great length in the Seanad and I assume we will be threshing it out at great length on the section on Committee Stage.  If I were <Col N="2093" /> to deal with it in any detail now I would be repeating what I said in the Seanad, which is on record, and would be repeating what, more or less, I will be saying on Committee Stage and I do not, therefore, propose to go into it in any detail now.  But Deputy Bruton and, I think, Deputy O'Leary, referred to the fact that there were various law schools and other interested parties who had recommended against any change at all in relation to juries and I think Deputy Bruton gave us a list of those who were not in favour of any sort of change at all.  I would draw his attention and the attention of the House to the fact that a committee which was set up to examine this particular problem, among others, recommended by a large majority what we are doing here and set out the reasons why they thought it was foolish to allow the existing situation to continue. There were a number of dissenters from that recommendation but the significant thing is that at least one if not two, of those who dissented did not dissent on the point that they disagreed with the main recommendation but dissented on the grounds that the main recommendation, which we are now implementing, did not go far enough and that all civil juries should, in fact, be abolished.  I made my position quite clear in relation to that in the Seanad, that I did not propose now, or at any time certainly in the foreseeable future, the abolition of civil juries in the High Court.  I think they perform a valuable function there.  I do realise that to some extent they slow down the course of justice a little, but, on balance, it is in the public interest that they should be there. However, I cannot accept that it is in the public interest that they should continue to exist in the Circuit Court when, so far as one can ascertain, they have been utilised throughout the country at the rate of about one a year.  A number of ex-practitioners, including myself, in the Seanad tried to think of the number of such cases we come across.  All I could think of was one in seven years practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a very different type of appeal from what other Circuit Court litigants would be entitled to, and I would find it very hard to justify that.  However, I shall leave a more detailed discussion of that matter over until the Committee Stage when I assume it will be raised again.</P>
      <P>There has been a fair amount of talk about legal aid in civil cases from most Deputies who have spoken here.  I appreciate the problems that are involved and I sympathise with what causes them to urge this.  It simply boils down to a question of money.  The cost is very substantial, and, as I said before, at the moment, with so many things competing for benefits from the Exchequer, this is one to which we simply cannot give priority at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I do not want anyone to get the impression that there is not, in effect, a civil legal aid system here.  Due to the generosity of solicitors and barristers, which is a tradition in the Irish legal world for many years past, I think it is fair to say that no plaintiff with a reasonable case has ever been turned down or has ever failed to get a full hearing of his case in the High Court or, if it needed it in the Supreme Court; and he has never failed to get the best brains at the Bar and the best of solicitors to argue that case for him, too.  I know this is not satisfactory and that it has overtones of charity about it, if you like, which one would prefer not to see; one would prefer to see a man have this as of right.  At the same time, the fact of the matter is that, at the moment, we cannot afford, it. There are many other social welfare schemes&mdash;because this is basically a type of social welfare scheme&mdash;that do appear to be more pressing and for <Col N="2095" /> which there appears to be a far greater need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One would assume that neither man of straw would get very far in those circumstances.  Reference has been made to courthouse accommodation.  This does not strictly arise on this Bill, but I just want to make my position clear, that I am not the responsible authority, that the responsible authority is the local authority. There is some provision in the Act of 1935 that if the local authority fail to fulfil their obligations I can be mandamused to get the Board of Works to do the job, and, unfortunately, it seems that I then have to pass on the bill in full to the local authority for payment.  However, I do not intend to go into that matter other than to say that I am not the responsible authority, but I do wish that local authorities would fulfil their obligations. I say this particularly because several local authorities, to my knowledge, not least the Limerick Corporation and the Limerick County Council have fulfilled their obligations in an excellent way.  There is a splendid courthouse in Limerick that cost the local authorities and the rate payers a good deal of money when it was built ten years ago or so.  It seems to me to be very unfair that some local authorities have faced up to their responsibilities while others refuse to do it.  There is an inter-Departmental <Col N="2096" /> committee sitting on this matter at the moment and I expect to have its report within a few months.  We may be able to make further progress when I hear from them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested a commencement date of 1st August, 1972, but in my opinion this would unnecessarily delay the coming into effect of the new jurisdictions.  It is desirable that the new jurisdictions would come into operation at the earliest possible date.  The Bill now provides that the commencement date would be 1st March, 1972.  I put the date back in the Seanad from 1st January to 1st March, and this should allow sufficient time for the various rules committees to make new rules in relation to the higher jurisdictions in so far as matters such as cost are concerned.  The Bill has, of course, been published since June of this year, and I sent word to the committees of the necessity, even at that time, of getting down to do the work of drawing up the rules.  I am satisfied that 1st March will give them ample time to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the question of the reciprocal enforcement of foreign maintenance and affiliation orders.  So far as we are concerned in this country that problem is almost exclusively one with Britain, because our deserting husbands almost invariably go to Britain.  Early last year discussions took place between representatives of my Department and the Lord Chancellor's Office in London, who are the responsible authority there.  A very high degree of agreement in principle was reached, and both sides set about drafting the necessary legislation.  That drafting has reached an advanced stage, but the matter has now been complicated somewhat, unfortunately, by the EEC situation.  We find when we examine the existing EEC conventions that the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Civil and Commercial Judgments, which provides in detail for the reciprocal enforcement of civil judgments as between member States of the EEC, applies to maintenance and affiliation orders.  It has so far been ratified by Belgium, France and <Col N="2097" /> Italy and will come into force following its ratification by the remaining member States.  It is at present the subject of adaptation negotiations in Brussels with the applicant countries. This is one of the few existing legal conventions that apparently will bind us on our accession and it precludes member countries entering into or enforcing bilateral agreements either with one another or with outsiders. For that reason both the British and ourselves have now come to realise that, as between the two of us at any rate, both being applicant countries and hoping to enter on 1st January, 1973, there may not be any great future in a bilateral agreement by legislation here and in Westminster</P>
    <P>We are looking into this aspect of the matter to see whether it would be worthwhile now to finish off the Bills and introduce them, a great deal of work having been done on them.  It may really prove to be a bit of an academic exercise because the Bills, or Acts as they would be, would have to be repealed or would become repealed automatically by this convention on the enforcement of civil and commercial judgments.  I might say that the provisions of the convention mentioned are very thorough in so far as enforcement is concerned and that we would not have any difficulty after our accession in enforcing maintenance or affiliation orders in Britain or in any other member country of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the proposed fusion of the legal profession which has been raised by a number of Deputies.  Deputy Bruton claimed that the approach to this problem was a piecemeal one and he felt that the problem would continue to be approached in a piecemeal way.  The Deputy wanted an overall plan towards fusion adopted and worked on. Another speaker, also a student at the Inns, Deputy M. O'Leary, did not seem to be in favour of it at all.  This is why we have to work in this manner. It is extraordinary how many of what we would regard as obvious, necessary reforms of the law are strongly resisted on the grounds that the existing position has worked well for 200 years and that, therefore, there is no need to <Col N="2098" /> change it.  I find that sort of thinking on matters difficult to accept, but even though I am not in agreement with it it poses a very practical problem. Strangely enough, practically every attempt to modernise the law is resisted.  One would have thought that the proposal in this Bill to give a right of audience in all courts in the country to solicitors was an obvious change and was clearly in the public interest and that scarcely anyone would object to it.  In fact, this proposal brought strenuous and strongly expressed objections from the Bar Council who regarded it as a retrograde step.  I do not share this opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about amalgamation.  I am simply talking about the proposal in this Bill to give solicitors a right of audience in the superior courts.  So far as the whole general question of amalgamation or fusion is concerned, I have expressed myself fairly clearly on this subject more than once.  I do not want to impose fusion or amalgamation. Since it is against the will of so many members of the Bar it would be practically impossible to achieve it in this way.  I should like to see gradual fusion.  I should like that to begin in a common educational system.  I see in that a key to the whole thing.  If a common educational system is established, inevitably the two branches of the profession must gradually tend to fuse with one another over the years. This will happen in ten or 15 years time as a result of the establishment of a common educational system.  At the moment the various systems of education pertaining to law are unsatisfactory, to say the least of them.  The overall total number of students of law in the State is about 600-650.  There seem to be about six different institutions teaching law with the result that no one of them is of the calibre that it should be or has the resources it should have.  It would not create too large a school to bring all the 600 students together.  Many of the medical schools in the country are bigger than <Col N="2099" /> that.  I would envisage that legal education would not be simply professional training.  I hope to see the day when everybody undertaking legal professional education would, before he became an apprentice or a bar assistant, already have a primary degree.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm five orders made during 1970, under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, and the Finance Act, 1962.  It is a statutory requirement that such orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made, if they are not to cease to have statutory effect.</P>
    <P>The first of these Orders, No. 184, was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  It provided for an increase in the excise duty on Irish wines and a reduction in the customs duty on still wines in bottle of United Kingdom origin.  The effect of this was to make a fifth 10 per cent reduction in the protective differential between the customs duties on wines of United Kingdom origin and the excise duty on Irish wines, in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>The second Order, No. 185, was also made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  It provided for the fifth tariff reduction on goods of United Kingdom origin in accordance with the terms of the free trade area agreement.  In addition, the order provided for the maintenance of the special tariff concessions in favour of certain goods of Northern Ireland origin.  The order also provided for the reduction of duties on certain yarns and certain knitted or crocheted fabrics in accordance with recommendations made by the committee on de-pyramiding of tariff protection, and made a number of minor changes in the customs tariff.  The new rates of duty brought into effect by this order are, of course, those which appear in the standard &ldquo;Customs and Excise Tariff of Ireland&rdquo; with which Deputies are familiar.</P>
    <P>The third Order, No. 186, provided for the imposition of a customs duty at rates of 40 per cent (full, preferential and special preferential) and 13.3 per cent (United Kingdom) on certain mobile home type caravans which inadvertently incurred a loss of protection as a result of the changeover <Col N="2101" /> to the Brussels Nomenclature form of customs tariff.</P>
    <P>The fourth Order, No. 187, was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  The order was necessary because of the changeover to decimal currency on 15th February, 1971, and it provides for the conversion to decimal form of all references to £sd amounts in the tariff.</P>
    <P>The fifth Order, No. 188, provided for a reduction of 10 per cent in the <i>ad valorem</i> rate of duty and certain reductions in the specific rates of duty on watches of non-United Kingdom origin, with effect from 1st January, 1971.  The Swiss watch industry has made representations about the high rate of duty on their products and it was decided to grant these reductions in duty.  In deciding to grant this concession, the Government took into consideration the considerable contribution which the Swiss watch industry had made to the establishment of the Swiss/Irish Horological Institute in Ireland and that the Swiss propose to continue to make a substantial financial contribution to the institute, which trains workers for the watch industry.  The Irish watch assemblers were consulted and they did not oppose the granting of the concession. Because of our international obligations the reduction of the duty had to be extended to watches of other countries.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to give any further information required in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of our discussion here I think it is fair to say that the matters referred to as the third and fourth orders by the Minister, namely, a correction because of a change in the nomenclature in Brussels and the changing over to decimal currency provision could be ignored.  It is not worthwhile discussing those two orders inasmuch as they are mechanical things which had to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other orders should certainly be discussed and should be the subject of some consideration by this House.  The gravamen of this Bill is that we have the fifth reduction of protective <Col N="2102" /> tariffs in line with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I do not want to weary the House by repeating <i>ad nauseam</i> what I said the other day, although it is in order on this particular measure, but the point must be made that there has been in certain instances some hardship and loss of employment because of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and the reduction in tariffs.</P>
    <P>There is provision in section 19 of that agreement for unilateral action and for bilateral action in section 2, subsection (5).  There is also the question of the year of review&mdash;I referred to this the other day&mdash;which ended in July last.  These safety clauses were, in fact, included to enable a much weaker nation, industrially, to defend itself, as I see it, from what could be, with the gradual reduction of tariffs, a temporary attack which could be extremely dangerous for our employment here.</P>
    <P>It seems to me as if the Government are predisposed to automatically reduce these tariffs without considering at all the areas of damage and the areas of difficulty.  The Minister in his opening speech on the Estimate for his Department last Thursday in Volume 256, No. 10 of the Official Report made very strong play of the fact that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement had not affected trade here and that the increase in redundancies here had not been a very serious factor.  He said at column 1833:</P>
    <P>I will not deny that the freeing of trade has been a factor in some of these closures but it is only one of the factors involved.</P>
    <P>Later on in that column he said:</P>
    <P>Other factors leading to redundancies have been product obsolescence; difficulties in external markets (a number of well publicised cases of closure earlier this year involved firms which were selling entirely in export markets); market depression externally and at home (this has affected the textile industry in particular); cost inflation; and management difficulties highlighted by more demanding trading conditions and by the incidence of free trade.</P>
    <P>In that column we get two references <Col N="2103" /> to the incidence of free trade.  Today we are debating what the Minister referred to as the second of these orders, the fifth reduction in the freeing of trade under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I suggest that the Government are at fault in not taking advantage of the clauses in that agreement to produce here an Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1971 which would contain lesser reductions or no reductions in tariff in respect of certain items.  I assert that it is possible to do this even unilaterally for a period of 18 months under the agreement.  It is the duty of the Government to see to it that redundancies are obviated or are avoided if at all possible.  If the Minister admits in his speech that in certain sectors there was some effect from the freeing of trade then it would appear to me that the rather global nature of what the Minister referred to here as the third order is in my view not a correct procedure and that there should have been a lessening of the degree of reduction.</P>
    <P>The Minister last week referred to the position in the textile industry.  At column 1834, volume 256, No. 10 of the Official Report of the 11th November, 1971, he said:</P>
    <P>Wool textiles as an industry is notoriously subject to cyclical depressions and short-time working but, up to 1970, the industry in Ireland had, for more than a decade, been largely free of this difficulty. However, the industry, world-wide, has recently been subjected to what is stated to be the worst depression for 40 years and this has affected most of the Irish mills in varying degrees.  The continuously growing competition from materials made from synthetic fibres and from materials made from processes other than weaving, does not help the situation.</P>
    <P>On top of this, there is the fact that excess capacity exists in this industry and, so far, efforts to induce the industry to rationalise its production have not succeeded.  One obstacle is the likelihood that no such rationalisation could be achieved without the closure of some <Col N="2104" /> mills.  Unpalatable though this may be in particular cases, I am afraid that it must be faced.  If not, there is a danger that mills, which might otherwise be viable, would be forced out of business along with weaker and less efficient units.</P>
    <P>These quotations direct from the Minister's speech last week indicate to me that in one sector of industry at any rate there is need for very kindly treatment.  There is provision in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement for the lessening in the degree of tariff reduction.  This in my view should have been done and it is a fault in this Bill that it was not done.</P>
    <P>In order to defend the jobs that are at risk, even the short breathing period under unilateral action could have been availed of.  Perhaps even the changing of jobs completely and the creation in an area of a new industry to supplant one that was going to go to the wall would have meant the difference between misery, unemployment and a continuance of a fair life for many Irish families.</P>
    <P>My main criticism of the Government is because of their global and wholesale approach to all these agreements and I bring to that criticism the personal knowledge I have of the manner in which continentals have acted in relation to the Rome Treaty. The continentals read, as it were, the small print and have recourse to the very last action that can be taken to defend their jobs.  They are utterly unashamed about this.  They could not care less whether they appear before the Court of Justice in Brussels or before any other international body, so long as they keep their people working, even for a temporary period, while they rearrange their own economies and their own budgets. They do their utmost to provide jobs to replace the jobs that will be lost and they make every use they can of that far more complicated agreement than we do of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>I accept that this Bill is necessary. I accept that free trade must come. Britain has decided by a large majority in the House of Commons to go into Europe.  From the economic <Col N="2105" /> point of view we must enter into free trade.  We are a very small trading entity whose maximum exports of any product, with the possible exception of beef, will have no impact on the huge trading block into which we will probably enter fairly soon.  Most of our products will have very little effect.  In that position of weakness it is our Government's duty, as I said last week, to nurture the weaker among us.  As the Minister said, there is a danger that mills, which might otherwise be viable, would be forced out of business along with the weaker and less efficient ones.  I have gone to considerable trouble, expense and effort to equip myself with all the knowledge I possibly could about the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the workings of the Common Market institutions and this is not the way in which smaller countries in the Common Market approach these problems; the smaller the country the harder they bargain.  An té nach bhfuil láidir ní folair dó bheith glic&mdash;those that are not strong must of necessity be clever &mdash;and that is the way these small countries approach their problems.</P>
    <P>This Bill should have had provision in it for individual industries where tariffs are concerned.  That can be done under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I know that it can be done and so does the Minister and his officials.  It should be done.  I suggest we should make every effort to defend every job.  My hope is that the Minister will take heed of my words and the words of other Members of this House and, when the review takes place, I hope we will see a lessening of the tempo in tariff reductions in certain sensitive areas.  In this instance the Minister will be dealing with just one partner.  In Brussels he will be dealing with nine, and that at a time of very serious change.  He will have to take individual action to protect individual industries.  Everybody in this House must accept that we are going into Europe.  There will have to be time to enable our people to take their place in a free trade situation and to fit themselves to meet the competition which will be there even while the removal of tariffs is proceeding.</P>
    <P>There is no individual provision in <Col N="2106" /> this Bill to safeguard individual industries.  It is just a readymade, reach-me-down, blunt instrument.  It could have been something far more selective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked last week why the Government have not had a review of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, an agreement which so far has worked in favour of Britain and not in our favour.  It may be argued that in the last two years there has been an improvement but in the first two years of its operation the balance from our point of view was most unfavourable.  One would have thought that the Government would have sought, perhaps, postponement of the reductions in tariff because of the adverse effects it is having on Irish industry.  I should like the Minister to say a few words on that.</P>
      <P>I see that Order No. 185 provided for the maintenance of the special tariff concessions in favour of certain goods of Northern Ireland origin.  I should like, if at all possible, that we should extend this concession.  If we are to make any worthwhile contribution towards the Northern Ireland problem, almost eliminating the Border on the industrial front, I should like tariff concessions extended in favour of Northern Ireland goods.  The balance of trade with Northern Ireland at present is very much in favour of the Twenty-six Counties.  By extending these special tariff concessions we could, perhaps, bring the people in the North closer to us.</P>
      <P>The Minister might tell us also in what direction the present discussions between officers of his Department and officers of the corresponding department in Northern Ireland are going. In the midst of all this trouble in the North we are apt to forget that it was agreed that there should be discussions between the two Departments on how they could co-operate more.  We have heard nothing about it since.  I should like to hear what has happened about these discussions?  Have they continued? Or have they ceased altogether in the present unhappy situation in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which is a source of <Col N="2107" /> worry to me is this.  The Swiss watch industry have made representations about the high rate of duty on their products and it has been decided to grant reductions in duty.  I should like the Minister in replying to say how we stand with Switzerland at present.  The Minister says that the Government took into consideration the considerable contribution which the Swiss watch industry had made to the establishment of the Swiss-Irish Horological Institute and that the Swiss proposed to continue to make a substantial financial contribution to the institute.  Could the Minister elaborate on this and tell the House how much money the Swiss Government have contributed?  What is involved?  Will he also say what will be the effect of reducing the tariff on Swiss watches and what it would amount to if there is a similar reduction on watches of other countries?</P>
    <P>He mentions that the Horological Institute trains workers for the watch industry.  This also calls for elaboration. The Minister should tell us the number of workers engaged in the watch industry in this country, in assembly and so on.  We should know the consequences of reducing the tariff as against the benefits.  I do not, and I am sure many Members of the House do not, know much about this industry and it would be of great interest if the Minister answered these questions. What will be the loss to the Exchequer and what do we receive in return by way of financial contribution from Switzerland and how many workers are employed in the Irish watch assembly industry?  The Minister said the Irish watch assemblers were consulted and did not oppose the granting of the concession.  Does the Minister mean the manufacturers or the workers when he says they were consulted?  I should also like to know the present state of our balance of trade with Britain under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and if a recent review has taken place or is proposed. We should also be given details of negotiations which were to have taken place between the Minister's Department and their counterparts in Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of secret behaviour by the Government behind closed doors in the summer period about the further reduction in tariffs under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  In this party we were consistent and our attitude towards that agreement has been vindicated up to the hilt, and never more so than this year with the massive redundancies caused.  Whenever a Minister speaks about unemployment, he says of course that it is not due to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  That is the very first thing they mention.</P>
      <P>Of course, this is quite false because the major part of our redundancies have been brought about by the final reduction in tariffs.  What redundancy will be like eventually, when tariffs are obliterated, remains to be seen.  We are only at the halfway stage now. There was to be a major inquiry as to what would happen then under the agreement.  No such proper inquiry was held because the Government were busy at their usual game of diverting the attention of everybody from this major current problem to whether we were going into EEC&mdash;something not at all realistic because EEC is still in the far distant future, regardless of what the Government say, just as it is in the distant future for Britain also.</P>
      <P>The least the Government should have done at this crucial moment in the working of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, when tariffs have reached halfway between their highest point and nothing, was to offer a full report instead of nonsensical rubbish, particularly their most recent document about employment if we join EEC.  So stupid are the people who wrote that document that within a few pages in the one document they said on the one hand that there would be massive increases in employment for industrial workers and on the other hand they said there would be no danger of losing any employment through industrial products coming in from the Continent.  Whoever wrote it, it was a stupid production.  They did not even realise they were cutting the throat of their own argument inside one page.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" /> This kind of game can go on all over the place, including the pretence that the Government would reduce inflation this year.  We heard so much about that in the Budget including a remark from a simple country Deputy that there was a cutback.  The only cutback that took place this year was in tariffs and that occurred on 1st July and it was done in complete secrecy so far as the Government could manage it.</P>
    <P>We get this kind of thing: &ldquo;... the fifth reduction of protective duties and the protective element in revenue duties on certain goods of United Kingdom origin in accordance with the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom establishing a Free Trade area ... maintenance of the import duty preference in favour of certain goods of Northern Ireland origin...&rdquo;  I have nothing against this.  On the contrary, I am all in favour of this concession.  It goes on: &ldquo;...reduction of duty on certain yarns and certain knitted or crocheted garments in accordance with the recommendation made by the Committee on De-Pyramiding of Tariff Protection...&rdquo; That is an original one.  I never saw that word before.  I could understand talk of pyramiding.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks <Col N="2110" /> about de-pyramiding of tariff protection, certain minor changes in the customs tariff.  I am no great supporter of excessive tariffs but I remember the care with which the Department of Industry and Commerce used to keep what is called the &ldquo;water&rdquo; in the tariffs.  This was to be squeezed out when negotiations came up about reductions in tariffs.  Of course, the British civil servants are not fools and when these negotiations started they said: &ldquo;This is just &lsquo;water&rsquo;.  We will not give you anything except &lsquo;water&rsquo; in exchange for &lsquo;water&rsquo;.&rdquo;  That is what they gave us.</P>

      <P>I am always glad of assistance from Deputy Dr. O'Connell.  I see in the Minister's speech the phrase: &ldquo;Reduction of duties on certain yarns and certain knitted or crocheted fabrics.&rdquo;  We have heard from the Government time and again that the awful condition of our textile industry is not due to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Free trade Area Agreement, that it is all due to a decline in world trade.  Of course it is due to the signing of the agreement. The great bulk of the redundancies this year have been brought about almost entirely by this agreement.  It is a nice introduction to our going into the Common Market.  There is an old saying. &ldquo;To the people is given judgment.&rdquo; The people will judge all right.  They will not be led blindfold into the Common Market as easy as the Government think they will, in spite of the huge expenditure by the Government on propaganda.  The reason they will not be led blindfold into the Common Market is in this Bill.  It is stated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> It is the effect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  I am delighted this has happened because it has given the people fair warning.  This party alone could never have got it across to the people, but this party does not have to say anything any longer.  The people know it now.  We had a performance last night on television about tariffs with the Minister for Finance arguing about 10,000 new jobs this year.  Ten thousand new jobs and 20,000 people gone out of employment so we are left with 10,000 fewer people employed. I was glad that the Labour representative in that discussion stuck to his point.  Anybody can &ldquo;create&rdquo; employment by spending massive amounts of money.  One way is by building factories.  Employment is created while they are being built.</P>

      <P>Yes, they say there will be 30 people employed this year and in three years time there will be 500.  This Bill and Bills like it, and we will have more and more of them, show us what this non-Government are doing to the economy.  One can borrow abroad, one can borrow at home and one can &ldquo;create&rdquo; employment while one is pushing out this slush money, but one is not creating any sound foundation for the economy by these actions.  In fact, one is destroying the basis of the currency and will end up with massive inflation.  We have been told during the summer that they have done this and that about inflation and we have been told to watch it blow over on the turn of the year.  The people can be codded for a short period, especially with the change in currency, but they will only put up with that for a limited time.  Everybody now knows the meaning of inflation and everybody knows how to guard himself against inflation.</P>

      <P>If there is more unemployment owing to this order <Col N="2112" /> surely it will give rise to massive inflation, especially with the Government spending more and more money.</P>
      <P>There is a reference here to the imposition of customs duty on certain structures of the mobile home type. That was something we all agreed with because firms have been set up to build these mobile homes.</P>
      <P>When I think of the method of introducing these Bills to confirm certain orders and of the manner in which we used to talk about reducing tariffs&mdash; nobody more than the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;saying that the era of free trade was upon us and more and more orders were made imposing new tariffs.  The more they talked about getting rid of the tariffs the more they imposed until this Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement was made.  The whole effect of that agreement was that the British sold the Government a pup.  The Government sold out this country for short-term advantage.  There is the same thing in the Common Market. We have five years.  Five years in this context is five minutes.  It is absurd.  I am delighted this has happened because we in this party do not have to spell out anything to the Irish people about the effects of going into a big economy and having no tariffs.  The argument is advanced that we will have more opportunities to sell our goods, as if the other fellows would not engulf us with their goods.  Of course they will.  This Bill has come up at a very suitable moment because I suspect that one of these days we will have the big putsch by the Government in the hope of getting the idea of the Common Market across on the basis of the ignorant pamphlets that are being produced by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>One of the things that may have been forgotten in dealing with this Bill is that we are dealing with orders actually made during the calendar year of 1970.  Deputy Donegan queried the efficacy of the talks that took place arising out of the review which occurred during the course of the year from 1st July, 1970, to the end of June, 1971.  The <Col N="2113" /> corresponding Bill which I will need to introduce this time next year, relating to the orders that have been made during the course of 1971, will be quite different from the Bill before us.  Order No. 185, which led to the greatest amount of discussion, deals with the reduction of duties in accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement from the period commencing 1st July, 1970, which is the start of the year of actual review.  The outcome of that review, as I explained last week and on other occasions in reply to questions, has not yet been finally determined but it will be discussed on the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1972.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donegan drew specific attention to the statements I made last week when introducing my Estimate.  It is a pity Deputy O'Donovan was not in the House when Deputy Donegan was speaking because he would have heard Deputy Donegan accept that a number of redundancies were due to a variety of factors.  Both Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy O'Connell attributed every redundancy to the adverse effect of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Last week I pinpointed the many reasons for the redundancies.  I did not deny that the freeing of trade was a factor in some of the closures but the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement had nothing at all to do with other closures which took place.  Deputy O'Donovan, Deputy O'Connell and their colleagues will continue to say that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement is responsible for all our problems.</P>

Deputy Donegan and his party accept the fact that we have no <Col N="2115" /> option but to join the EEC; on the other hand, Deputy O'Donovan feels there are other options.  He accuses Government spokesmen who advise the people to prepare for entry into the EEC of producing a red herring in order to take people's minds off other more pressing subjects.  On the one hand we are accused of not informing the people sufficiently about the EEC, and on the other hand we are told by Deputy O'Donovan, when we do inform the people, that we are doing so to distract their thoughts from other matters.</P>

      <P>I know it is difficult, when talking in November, 1971, about a reduction in duty which took place in July, 1970, not to carry over the discussion into the present time.  I want to assure Deputy Donegan that the Government are very conscious of the rights they have under both Articles 19 and 15 of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  This is tied in with the continuous discussions we have had with the British arising out of the review which took place during the year ending 1st July of this year.</P>

      <P>The review and the subsequent discussions made considerable progress and I was able to announce to the House in answer to a Parliamentary Question that intermediate steps had been taken prior to 1st July and I reported to the House that the discussions were going on. That is on record and there is no question of the review talks not having taken place.  A certain amount of progress was made.  Further progress needs to be made and further discussions need to be held before I may have to take specific decisions in the event of agreement not being reached.</P>
      <P>Order No. 185 takes into consideration the further reduction of duties on items coming from the North of Ireland.  As originally provided, the order took into account the further reductions in duties on goods coming from the North.  There is a 10 per cent preferential rate on goods from the North as compared with goods from the United Kingdom.  This differential was maintained under the order we are discussing and a similar order made this year maintained this preferential treatment for goods from the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated that he would like to see discussions taking place with a view to introducing general overall social benefits and for having greater co-ordination between the various establishments here and in the Six Counties.  In his contribution, Deputy O'Connell asked if there had been any discussions in relation to the lowering of protective tariffs against the Six Counties.  In my reply I endeavoured to outline that there was <Col N="2122" /> preferential treatment for imports from the Six-County area and that this preferential treatment had been maintained in the order under discussion and in the order that was made this year.  I went on to say that there were not any trade discussions between officials of my Department and officials of the Ministry of Commerce regarding any further reduction in this.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell asked some questions in relation to Order No. 188, a number of which I am in a position to reply to and some to which I am not in a position to reply.  One question he asked concerned the number of people employed in the watch assembly industry here.  My information is that there are about 50 people involved.  These are employed by the Irish watch assemblers.</P>
      <P>The reduction in respect of this order is not of any real significance.  As I have indicated, the reduction is 10 per cent, that is, 10 per cent of 26.7 per cent which is a reduction of 2.6 per cent in duty.  Therefore, it is not a considerable reduction but from the point of view of the Swiss industries, it is considerable.  I was asked by the Swiss watch industry to make this order in view of their contributions to the Horological Institute in Ireland.  That contribution is made direct to the institute and I do not know what is its size in financial terms.  I presume that as well as being a financial contribution there is also a contribution by way of expertise.  At the time of making the order the information available to me was that it was to be recommended that I should accommodate the Swiss watch industry in this way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The sole purpose of this Bill is to increase the ceiling of the contribution payable by county councils towards the finacing of county committees of agriculture.  Section 1, sub-section (1), of the Bill is designed to give each county council the power to increase the contribution to its committee of agriculture for the service of agricultural schemes to a sum not exceeding 15 times the produce of a rate of 1p in the £, that is, a maximum of 15p in the £ or 3/-.  The existing ceiling was fixed by legislation in March, 1970, at 2s 3d in the £.</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (2), of the Bill will enable arrangements validly to be made by county councils prior to 1st April, 1972, for the purpose of financing the committees of agriculture for the financial year 1972-73.  Under section 2 the legislation will come into operation on 1st April next, which is the beginning of the local authorities' financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual income at present available to the committees of agriculture consists of contributions from their respective county councils together with State grants related to the amounts of such local contributions. The State grant in each case normally approximates to the same amount as the local rates contribution by the county council but, in the case of the 12 committees of agriculture in the western small farm areas, further State <Col N="2126" /> assistance is granted by way of a contribution of 75 per cent instead of the normal 50 per cent towards the cost of employing adequate numbers of advisory staff.  In the current year 13 of the 27 committees of agriculture obtained from their county councils contributions based on the existing maximum rate.</P>
    <P>As in the case of other public bodies and organisations, the general expenditure of committees of agriculture has been increasing in recent years.  Also, the progressive expansion in the county advisory service is reflected in the jump in expenditure from a total of £1.2 million in 1965-66 to £2.1 million in 1970-71.  The increase is attributable mainly to the employment of more instructors as well as to increases in salaries and expenses of the advisory staffs.  The extent of the salary increases granted during the past year, or so, which were necessary to give the advisory staffs increases corresponding to the increases given in the public service generally, could not have been foreseen when the existing maximum of county council contributions was fixed.</P>
    <P>The most recent pay awards to instructors employed by committees of agriculture was recommended by a conciliation council which included representatives of the General Council of Committees of Agriculture.  A case for increases made by chief agricultural officers and deputy chief agricultural officers is at present awaiting determination by an arbitration board which recently heard the case.</P>
    <P>Apart from salary costs, a number of other factors have contributed to the increased expenditure of committees of agriculture, namely, higher travelling and subsistence allowances to officers in respect of official duties, attendance at training courses, seminars and conferences both in this country and abroad.  Increased allowances are also now payable for the attendance of members of county committees at meetings.</P>
    <P>The educational and other agricultural services of the committees have also been expanding.  These include new farm education centres, winter <Col N="2127" /> farm schools, the pilot areas schemes, the small farms (incentive bonus) scheme and the farm home management advisory scheme.  Further advances in most of these areas are necessary if the farming community are to be adequately catered for in the advisory and educational work of the committees.  The principal object of these educational courses is to train young adults on the farms to become proficient and to be leaders in good farming practice in their localities.</P>
    <P>This Bill, I should explain, is basically an interim measure designed to enable the more hard-pressed committees of agriculture to pay their way in carrying on their very important work until such time as a final decision is reached on the whole future of the agricultural advisory and educational service which, as Deputies know, has been under comprehensive review.  The new maximum rate will meet the needs of those county committees which in the immediate future cannot carry on without a contribution in excess of the present permitted maximum.  Otherwise, those committees would have to consider curtailing their schemes and possibly the numbers of their advisory staffs.  Such a contingency would not only be highly undesirable but would be seriously detrimental to the interests of the farming community.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, suggesting in the Bill that the existing law be amended to empower county councils, where they so decide, to pay to committees of agriculture a contribution up to a maximum of 15 times the produce of 1p in the £, that is a total of 15p in the £, or 3s as compared with the existing maximum of 2s 3d.  A number of committees will, I should point out, be able to continue meeting their needs in the immediate future from income derived from significantly lower rates than the maximum now being proposed.  Contributions from the Department will, of course, continue to be made on the same <i>pro rata</i> basis as hitherto.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I should like to welcome this Bill.  It is very necessary at this <Col N="2128" /> stage to give an increased allocation of money to county committees of agriculture. I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to be more specific as to what will be the future role of the county committees in the context of the reorganisation of local authorities.  We believe that the county committees of agriculture have played a very important part in the improvement of farm incomes and of the services provided for the farming community.  It is very important at this stage, prior to entry into the EEC, that the county committee of agriculture would be retained and that county boundaries would be maintained in relation to the county committees of agriculture.  Rather than reduce their powers, I would strengthen the functions of county committees of agriculture.  They have proved to be effective and efficient in the administration of services provided for the benefit of the agricultural community.  We must anticipate a great deal of change and we must examine the future activities and the role of the county committees of agriculture.  I would be in favour of bringing within the ambit of the county committees of agriculture many schemes not now administered by them.  For example, land project schemes could be operated much more effectively by county committees of agriculture than they are at present by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  In the case of a land project scheme, the person concerned is involved in a considerable amount of work and is subject to visits from departmental inspectors to ensure that the scheme is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Department.  Very often there is considerable delay which causes frustration in the matter of grant applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For five or six years I have been a member of a county committee of agriculture and have taken a very keen interest in the working of that committee. To my knowledge, a good number of people avail of the facilities provided at the office and use it as an information centre.  Anybody involved in a scheme administered by that county committee of agriculture can go to the county hall if he is in any difficulty <Col N="2129" /> and there meet the CEO or deputy CEO or one of the staff so as to get the necessary advice.  Therefore, I say that particularly at this point in time, where change is indicated, the powers of county committees of agriculture should be strengthened rather than reduced.</P>
    <P>The only criticism that I have of the provisions of this Bill is that I doubt if they are sufficient.  In his introductory statement the Minister referred to the agricultural advisory service.  I should like to pay tribute to that service.  Great advice has been given by that service to the agricultural community.  This matter represents the greatest drain on the financial resources of county committees.</P>
    <P>There is one point which I took up with the Minister's predecessor in connection with the small farm incentive bonus scheme.  This is a very desirable scheme which has brought benefit to some of our smaller farmers.  It is true to say, however, particularly in regard to Cork, and the south generally, that the office dealing with the scheme is understaffed and that in order to deal with the flood of applications the staff must be increased.  This would involve increased financial commitment.  Therefore, I have doubts as to whether the provision made in the Bill will be sufficient to meet the increased costs resulting from the increased services that will be demanded in future and the increased cost of administration.</P>
    <P>In my view there will be increased demand on the agricultural advisory service, particularly in view of the change in planning and programming of farming generally.  Advice is being sought to a greater extent than ever. This will involve increased costs for the county committees of agriculture in excess of the contribution that this Bill will enable them to get from the county council.</P>
    <P>In relation to the agricultural advisory service, there is an increasing backlog of work, particularly in Cork. They find it difficult to meet the demands made on them in relation to soil testing.  Soil testing is important. It determines the application of lime and fertilisers for the production of <Col N="2130" /> top quality grass, which is a vital factor in farm income.  Silage is regarded as a very important winter feed.  In the county committee of agriculture there are not sufficient instructors to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>While reorganisation may be necessary, it is absolutely essential that there should be a long, hard look at the workings of county committees of agriculture at this stage.  The county committees have themselves studied this matter for quite a long time with a view to making recommendations and having the necessary changes made. The present structure where each of the 27 committees provide an agricultural advisory service has been in existence since 1931.  It will be generally accepted and conceded that these services have a lasting effect on farming progress to keep in line with the changes that will be demanded on our entry to the EEC.  For that reason the functions of the advisory service should be examined so as to avoid overlapping in the functions of the county committees of agriculture.  For example, if instead of county councils being in charge of slaughterhouse inspection, sheep dipping, and so on, all these things could be administered by the county committees of agriculture, there would be much more efficient administration from the point of view of the farming community.</P>
    <P>I shall be brief on the Second Reading of this Bill in view of the fact that the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will be before us in a week or two, when I shall have some more to say.  I welcome the Bill.  It is very necessary.  I want to assure the Minister that the Bill will have the full support of the members of this party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the last speaker, would like to welcome the Bill and to refer to the important role that county committees of agriculture play in the existing agricultural set-up. They employ many instructors in the various fields and they see that the whole system by which farmers can better themselves is made to function properly.  I notice here that in the western small farm areas the State will <Col N="2131" /> be paying a contribution of 75 per cent instead of the normal 50 per cent towards the cost of employing adequate numbers of advisory staff.  That is a good thing, and I would hope the Minister would go even further to help out those areas.  It may be said that the rates are paid for those people under £20 valuation, but many of them have to pay very high rates on their buildings and dwelling houses. The people with small holdings deserve all the help we can possibly give them.  It is often difficult for the county councils to pay large sums for them, and I would ask the Minister to consider going the whole way by giving a 100 per cent contribution to the 12 committees of agriculture in the western small farm areas.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing that the county committees of agriculture can avail of the conciliation council which deals with rates of pay and conditions of employment for instructors.  Some people have the idea that the different committees of agriculture should be sorting out these matters themselves, but it is desirable to have a uniform system for the whole country.  In regard to the appointment of agricultural instructors, I often think it is very degrading for somebody who has been educated to the stage where he gains an agricultural science degree to have to ask us for our votes, and very often people do not know for whom they are voting.  A selection board should be set up by each committee of agriculture for the purpose of selecting instructors.  However, that subject can be discussed further when the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Creed mentioned the matter of soil testing.  It is very important that the backlog in relation to soil testing should be cleared off so that everyone, whether he is growing grass, grain or root crops will know what to apply to the soil.  The agricultural instructor of today has a great deal more to do than the instructor of 15, 20 or 25 years ago.  He has to be well versed in pilot area schemes, small farm schemes, home management advisory services and so on.  It is vital for our farming <Col N="2132" /> community that the best men should be appointed to these jobs.  They are not overpaid and whenever an increase in their remuneration is due the committees of agriculture should be in a position to meet it and also to increase the number of instructors as required in the different counties.</P>
    <P>There is not very much criticism one can make on this Bill, and I think it is a measure which will be welcomed generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as accounting for the changeover to decimalisation this Bill provides an increase in the permissive limit of support for the county committees of agriculture from the county councils and as such it will be welcomed and, indeed, has been welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I wish to raise in relation to the county committees. There should be some form of guaranteed minimum representation on the county committees for rural organisations, particularly farming organisations.  They have a part to play alongside the democratically-elected public representatives in shaping agricultural policy in the locality, and I hope the Minister will consider such a provision.</P>
      <P>There is often danger that the activities of the county committees of agriculture tend to get an unrepresentative Press.  Very often what gets the publicity are the sensational statements which are made by certain members of county committees and which are not truly representative of the good, solid work being done without publicity by the committees.  This is unfortunate, because I think it is fair to say that most committees are doing very good, methodical work which is not rewarded in terms of publicity but is rewarded in terms of results for their own areas.</P>
      <P>In looking at the county committees we tend to see them in their advisory roles and not in their educational role. County committees have played a very significant role in providing scholarships for various types of education for young people who are interested in farming in their areas.  This is something for which there is considerable room for expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> It is important also that the county committees should be integrated into the overall scheme of regional development which is taking place at the moment.  There are these regional development boards which have recently been set up by the Department of Local Government on which county councils are represented, as are port and docks boards and a number of other bodies who have an interest in regional development.  There is an equally strong case for the representation of county committees of agriculture on these regional development boards, because they have just as much interest in regional development, in the development of regional services and regional infrastructure, as many of the bodies are at present represented.</P>
    <P>It is important that the advisers in their ordinary work should be perfectly free to turn to any quarter for advice which they feel is necessary in order to give the farmers the best service. There should not be any attempt to channel all inquiries from county committee advisers to the Department of Agriculture experts.  The instructors should be free to get in touch with whoever they believe is able to give them the information they want in a hurry.  In any organisation there is a tendency to empire-building and no one organisation should have a monopoly in advising and helping the advisers.  One of the ideas behind the Mansholt proposals, in addition to the technical agricultural advice, is the development of socio-economic advice. I must confess to being a little vague as to what this means.  The idea is that farmers should be advised in the more general financial farm management as distinct from strictly farming matters, and they should be advised of their rights under the Health Acts and in regard to matters affecting their financial position and family welfare.  The agricultural advisers should be in a position to give this advice or, alternatively, there should be specialist advisers to give farmers such advice.  I am not sure that the setting up of such a service for this purpose would be wise at all.  Very often the agricultural adviser is the only adviser of any description, agricultural or otherwise, <Col N="2134" /> to visit a particular house from one end of the year to another.  It is important that he should be qualified to give advice over a wider area than the strictly agricultural.  There might be a case for short courses for agricultural advisers in the general field of social legislation and other areas which might be of help&mdash;for instance, matters in relation to financial management and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the small farm incentive bonus scheme.  This scheme is administered by the county committees at the moment.  It is fair to say that the basic principle of this scheme is completely in line with the principles laid down in the Mansholt proposals.  There is this idea of an overall target for the farm, which should reach a particular limit within a planned period.  Perhaps the main objection to the operation of the present small farm incentive bonus scheme is that it is so limited.  It is limited to a certain category of farmer. There are many farmers who could not reach the limits and who do not qualify.  In addition, there are a number of farmers whose starting point is too high to enable them to enter into the scheme.  It is fair to say that the whole idea of development planning over a five-year period which lies behind the small farm incentive bonus scheme is something which can be of benefit to farmers starting off at a point above the limit at present covered by this scheme.  If we are to be in line with the proposals advocated by the EEC we should consider the extension of the scope of this scheme and the application of its very sensible principles to a much wider range of farm enterprises.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems in the county committees at the moment is the fact that agricultural advisers find it difficult to obtain promotion opportunities without having to leave their own counties.  If figures are examined on this point, it will be found that the rate of movement of advisers from one county to another is high.  This is not a good development in one way.  While what one learns at university is useful, what one learns about the specific conditions in the county in which one is <Col N="2135" /> working is probably even more valuable as a source of advice to the farmers whom the adviser is meeting. The accumulation of specific local knowledge is severely disrupted if the adviser is moved from one county to another in quick succession.</P>
    <P>The reason why an adviser moves is that he finds that the prospects for promotion are not good in the county in which he is employed.  There are not many grades within the advisory service.  There are the grades of adviser, deputy CAO and CAO.  The adviser may find that if he wants to become a CAO he may often be forced to move.  If a young man is appointed as CAO an adviser in the same age group in the same county knows that he can never achieve that rank in that county because the young man will be in that position for many years to come.  Instead of remaining in the county where he has gathered much local experience he has an incentive to move to some other county where his chances of becoming a CAO are better.  This is not a desirable development. A man might move from Meath, where the farming is of a particular type, down to the west or south of Ireland where the farming is quite different.  He has then to learn about the conditions in the new area.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a career structure within the advisory service which would give an incentive to men to stay in the areas in which they are working. There are a number of possible approaches to this problem.  A special increment should be given to a man for each year he stays in a particular place.  A man could be given more money for staying ten years in a particular place even though his grade remains the same.  Perhaps another grade, intermediate between that of adviser and CAO, could be created&mdash; possibly some sort of specialist grade for a man providing specialist information to the advisers.  There is also the question of integrating the advisory service with the administrative service, namely, the service of inspectors for the various local land projects, farm buildings schemes, and other schemes. It might not be desirable to do this. <Col N="2136" /> There might be some way of creating new grades which would provide opportunities of promotion.  This is something which should be examined. I am not going to make a categorical recommendation about this, because there may be some difficulty.  A man might be doing an inspection job which would involve criticising a farmer for something he has done, and then find that he is visiting him on a later date in his capacity as adviser, coaxing him to do something he wants him to do.  This might create difficulty.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Hogan mentioned the seeds subsidy scheme, which at present is administered by the county council, and said that the scheme should be administered by the county committees of agriculture.  I would have thought that this Bill would be an appropriate one in which to make this rather obvious change.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter carefully.</P>
    <P>I would recommend this Bill to the House.  It at least involves the possibility of giving more money to the county committees of agriculture for the valuable work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying to note that it is proposed to allow the county councils to increase their contributions to the county committees of agriculture from a maximum level of 2s 3d in the £ to 3s in the £.  This will enable the county committees to expand their services and to do more work.  At the same time it will mean that their estimates of expenses for the coming year will be higher.  This will attract a higher State grant as well for the county committees.  In other words, more money will be spent by each county committees of agriculture as a result of this Bill because the councils will be in a position to increase their contributions as a result of the increased State grants.  I believe that certain proposals and suggestions which have been made from time to time to have county committees of agriculture abolished should not be entertained.  The county committees of agriculture should be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot beat the county spirit in any effort.  Whatever we may say <Col N="2137" /> about regionalisation it is necessary in many fields but matters relating to agricultural advisory services should be operated entirely on a county basis because the size of holdings, the method of farming and the method of deriving income from agriculture varies from county to county.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the agricultural instructors throughout the country who are doing such an excellent job on behalf of the county committees of agriculture.  These men work very hard and often under difficult circumstances to assist farmers and they are available at all times to advise them.  They are doing a very useful job indeed.</P>
    <P>I would like to see certain other services integrated with the advisory service at present carried out by the county committees of agriculture.  I see no reason why the land project offices could not be amalgamated with the county committee of agriculture.  I also believe that certain operations carried out locally by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries could be carried out by the local instructors, such as the farm buildings scheme. Generally speaking one officer should be in a position to advise the farmer about the development of his holding or about land drainage.  The fact that one man is offering advice on different matters should not in any way conflict with his duties in regard to recommending the payment of grants under the land project scheme.</P>
    <P>The same applies to farm buildings. I cannot see how the duties of an agricultural instructor, in his capacity as adviser, could conflict with his duties as an officer advising on buildings, recommending agricultural grants and recommending the payment of grants afterwards, if these duties were assigned to one man.  This proposal should be investigated fully.</P>
    <P>I believe the county committees of agriculture should be allowed to operate model farms.  County committees of agriculture could have model farms in different parts of a county representing the average size of a holding in that particular county.  For example, in certain parts of a sheep area you could have a model sheep <Col N="2138" /> farm, a model small farm and a model large farm.  You could also have a model farm based on beef and a model farm based on milk.  The county committees of agriculture should be allowed to develop such model farms.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion made here that the majority of the members of the county committees of agriculture should be nominated by bodies; all members of county committees of agriculture should be elected. It is very desirable that members representing the agricultural community should be elected to those committees. The only exception I would make would be in the case of co-option if a vacancy occurred during the term of office of that county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I would like, in conclusion, to pay tribute again to the Minister for bringing in this Bill which enables the councils and ultimately the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the State to pay more money to improve the agricultural advisory service and to carry on this important work until such time as a final decision is taken on the whole future of the agricultural advisory and educational service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the previous speakers in welcoming this Bill. I am pleased to note that the Minister stated in his speech:</P>
      <P>This Bill is, I should explain, basically an interim measure designed to enable the more hard-pressed committees of agriculture to pay their way in carrying out their very important work until such time as a final decision is reached on the whole future of the agricultural advisory and educational service which, as Deputies know, has been under comprehensive review.</P>
      <P>I hope that it will not take too long to reach finality in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself I am glad to see from it that the maximum rate from county councils is to be increased. As far as I know we have reached the maximum rate in Carlow County Council.  Anything that can be done to increase the advisory services <Col N="2139" /> of these county committees of agriculture is certainly very welcome.  I should like to pay a tribute to the staff of the county committee of agriculture in my own county.  The previous speaker asked that we do not abolish county committees of agriculture.  I think that what he was really thinking about was their reorganisation.  I believe county boundaries should be maintained.  Problems differ from county to county.  In Carlow the problems would be different from those obtaining in Laois, Kilkenny or Kildare.  It is imperative that county boundaries should be maintained.</P>
    <P>I hold the view that the members of local authorities elected to these agricultural committees should be people with an interest in agriculture, people experienced in agriculture and with a knowledge of agriculture.  Members should not be elected because of party affiliations.  This is a pet theory of mine.  I have been a member of Carlow County Council for 23 or 24 years now and I have never offered to go forward as a member of the agricultural community, because I believed there were councillors who had much more experience of agriculture than I had and, in the interests of the agricultural community, only those councillors versed in agriculture should be elected to the agricultural committees.</P>
    <P>The more the services of these committees can be expanded the better it will be.  I have paid tribute to the work done by the agricultural advisers.  Anything that can be done to expand these services will be very welcome indeed. This is an interim measure.  I trust that future measures will be designed in the interests of the agricultural community, that community which is, as has been so truly said, the backbone of the country.</P>
    <P>It was stated here that a number of committees will be able to continue meeting their needs in the immediate future from income derived from significantly lower rates than the maximum now being proposed.  I would like the Minister to tell us the number.  Where grants are concerned, such as grants for farm building schemes and water supply schemes, payment is very slow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  It proposes to raise the ceiling in the case of the contribution requisite for financing the administration of committees of agriculture.  It would be a negative approach for anyone in Opposition to oppose a Bill just because he is in Opposition and it would be wrong for anybody in an agricultural country like ours to refrain from giving encouragement to an industry which, now that we are going into Europe, will require all the backing it can get to help it to adjust.  That is particularly true in the case of small farmers.</P>
      <P>Agricultural committees have been in operation for many years.  Their work has been very successful and has resulted in a rich harvest.  There is appreciation of their activities and their energies.  The best evidence of their work was displayed in the pilot schemes on the west coast.  The agricultural instructors, the officials of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the officials of the Land Commission and the officials of the land project scheme all combined to increase productivity in these pilot areas. The work was magnificent and the achievements in Clare were particularly noteworthy.  First of all, the Land Commission set out to divide estates and to enlarge small holdings; the land project officials drained those holdings and Department of Agriculture and Fisheries officials advised on farm improvements, erection of new out-offices, dairies and all buildings necessary on a farm.  That was one of the most intelligent schemes of the Department and if a lesson is to be learned from the information gained in that activity now is the time to apply it all over the country.  There must be co-operation and proper understanding between all officers engaged in improving agriculture. That is vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farm bonus incentive scheme has been very successful but <Col N="2141" /> some people are debarred because their valuation is too high and I think it is necessary to raise the limit to allow a greater number of farmers to qualify for inclusion in the scheme.  If we must have larger farms under Common Market conditions now is the time to consider raising the valuation limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a suggestion which I think will come within the activities of committees of agriculture and which I suggest should come from those committees.  These committees could give some thought to this matter and make a recommendation to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the work of all these officials in every capacity&mdash;the instructors, horticultural instructors and home management instructresses &mdash;and with the way in which they have built up contacts in their districts.  It is good policy to encourage young men or women from particular areas to go back and work in those areas.  They are familiar with the territory and have contact with the people and therefore I believe they are the best people to advise and would be better received in their own areas.  Home management instructresses, who do an excellent job, should be permitted when they marry to return to their employment especially in view of the valuable contacts they have made in their work areas.  It would take a long time for others to build up the goodwill they have established and it is worth while maintaining continuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a suggestion of better concessions and travelling allowances being made to members of these committees. I think if the Minister permitted representation from farm organisations such as the NFA, ICMSA and the ICA, they could make a valuable contribution.  They have grassroots knowledge of the problems and there is no sound reason why a committee of agriculture should not acknowledge the valuable contribution such people could make.  That would <Col N="2142" /> be much preferable to what exists in some cases, one party representation. Whether it is entirely Fianna Fáil or entirely Fine Gael or entirely Labour it is undemocratic and such a type of structure in a committee of agriculture should not be encouraged in any county.  It does not make for good relationships.</P>
    <P>In the 12 western counties where perhaps a greater contribution is made&mdash; about 75 per cent instead of the normal 50 per cent&mdash;towards the cost of employing instructors and an advisory service, it seems that if the much talked of &ldquo;Save the West&rdquo; campaign which has hit the headlines over the years is to be really effective, committees of agriculture must be given much greater power and much more State finance must be injected through these committees into the small holdings of the western counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

We are all aware that the value of money has depreciated and many committees of agriculture are in strait jackets.  They cannot afford to employ agricultural advisers or to increase their services.

      <P>I am not dealing with that.  If I were, I would start on a different note.  I hope to keep within the bounds you have set for me.</P>
      <P>This extra money that is to be given by the county councils to the committees of agriculture is very badly needed. We in Cork county had serious difficulties and at various times we asked the powers that be for consent to get an increase in this amount.  The western part of Cork county should be treated like other parts of the west.  We did not get that concession.  Even though it is coming now it is a bit late and a bit too small.  However, it is better late than never.  There is plenty of room to spend this little extra contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of Cork <Col N="2144" /> County Committee of Agriculture for many years.  There is no doubt that many great advances have been made. I remember when we had only eight or nine instructors in our advisory service in Cork; now we have about 29.  We need a large amount of money to provide for these services.  It is the feeling of the farming community down there that, especially with the approach of the Common Market, we should be making even greater progress.  There are several services we are still not able to give.  I shall confine myself to one aspect which I have discussed with the Minister on various occasions&mdash;getting rid of disease in sheep.  We have been tinkering for years with sheep scab and various other diseases which other countries have got rid of in a very short time.  We have not the money to do the job.  Our sheep dipping stations are badly in need of repair.  We are looking to the county councils to do that for us.  We asked for help from the Department, financial and otherwise, to deal with disease in sheep but we did not succeed in getting it.  I hope the Minister will take steps to see that money is provided for these things that are so badly in need of being done.</P>
    <P>We have made some progress in regard to dairying.  We are working within financial limits and we badly need more money.  We would need more inspectors for the inspection of slaughter houses.  I hope the Minister will refer to this when replying.  If we go into the EEC our meat factories and their products will have to be first quality and in order to have that we must have inspectors going around to the factories and keeping them on their toes to see that what they produce is first class and fit to be sent to any country in the world.</P>
    <P>The advisory service is probably the most important service the farmers have and, while improvement was rapid for a number of years, I think at present more advisers in each county would pay very well.  The amount that has been granted here, up to 15p in the £, is still on the small side.  I am sure the Minister, as a practical farmer and as a member of a committee of agriculture for a number of years himself, will realise <Col N="2145" /> that.  If he consulted the committees of agriculture before deciding on this small increase they would probably ask him for something considerably more.  The Minister should keep in close touch with the committees of agriculture.  They are in touch with the grassroots and would be able to inform him just as well as some of his senior advisers who were themselves in that position many years ago.  I would prefer if the county councils were to give at least another 1p in the £ more to agriculture.  I do not think there is any better way in which we could spend any extra money we have.  It would be in the interests not alone of the agricultural community but of the whole country if we geared up our advisory and other services to the greatest extent we possibly can in the short time at our disposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil&mdash;we had no contribution, as far as I know, from the Labour Party&mdash;who welcomed this Bill.  Certain features stand out in the debate.  One is the consciousness of the fact that, while we are all very grateful for and appreciative of the yeoman service that has been given to us down through the years by the advisory services, it is time the service was reorganised and improved.  As I said in my opening address, this small amendment Bill is an interim measure until such time as a new and better service is provided. Deputy Creed, Deputy Meaney, Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Bruton referred to the desirability of linking up the advisory service with other farm services such as the farm buildings scheme and the land project.  This is a logical and sensible suggestion.  I would rather have a type of farm development service which would embrace the provision of buildings, the drainage of land, soil testing and other ancillary services of that kind than the present advisory service where a farmer merely gets advice on specific matters.  Those Deputies who spoke seem to share this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Deputies referred to the desirability of expanding and improving the small farm bonus incentive <Col N="2146" /> scheme.  I should like to see this development take place because it is a very important part of the service as administered at present by committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and another Deputy referred to the desirability of the representation of farm organisations on county committees.  I agree with this. My colleague from Carlow-Kilkenny, Deputy Governey, said it was one of his per aversions that people get places on committees of agriculture for purely narrow, political reasons.  I share Deputy Governey's point of view that this is plainly destructive and obstructive. It is of no political value whatever, which is the main interest of politicians but worse than that it tends to produce a committee who are less useful than they ought to be.  I agree with those Deputies who said that such county committees should be manned by people who have practical experience and knowledge of the requirements of farming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the promotional opportunities and their limitations in the matter of advisory staff and as far as I can see this is true.  I hope that a reconstructed and centralised advisory service will provide somewhat more mobility and certainly more opportunities for promotion for staff.  I am sure rural Deputies are familiar with advisers who are specialists in some particular field&mdash;it may be animal breeding, animal nutrition, cereal production or something of that kind.  Occasionally one comes across an adviser who has specialist knowledge in one of these fields and his service should be available to farmers other than those in his own county.  A service that would provide the necessary mobility for such a person is desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton, Deputy Creed and Deputy O'Sullivan referred to sheep dipping, although they were out of order in doing so.  I agree that sheep are not being dipped adequately at present.  In the last couple of weeks I have been discussing this problem with officers of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  In my own area there have been some outbreaks of sheep scab in recent times.  This arises from the fact that statutory dippings are not being given.  Something will <Col N="2147" /> have to be done about this, but, as I say, we were all a little out of order in talking about that but I am sure the Chair will forgive us because it is an important matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also referred to the educational functions of the committees of agriculture.  I want to pay a great tribute to the unselfish and devoted way in which advisers all over the country have gone out winter after winter to little, cold, drafty rural halls to conduct lectures and give instructions to young farmers and farmers who are not so young, which have been of great assistance to them.  I would like to see the farming community in general look upon the advisory service as something which is there for their benefit.  The main function of an advisory service is not so much a kind of spot treatment for an acute condition but the evolution for each farmer, looking for a service, of a long-term farm production plan which would involve the baring of his financial soul, the examination of his soil, the preparation of a long-term farm plan, the keeping of records and books and their periodic examination by a farmer, his adviser, possibly his bank manager and the ACC as well. This is the type of development we shall have to get.  The jog-along type of farm instruction that farmers give their sons&mdash;and we who are farmers will be familiar with this&mdash;will not be adequate in the future.  We want to begin thinking about specific agricultural instruction for young men entering farming in future, but that again is a little beside the point.  I want to thank those Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 provides that the maximum contribution payable will be increased from 27 times <Col N="2148" /> the produce of one old penny in the £ to 15 times the produce of one new penny in the £.  There is a table in my brief which would be very difficult to read out but it sets out the progressive increase in recent years.  In the last couple of years it was increased to 25 pence the optional additional rate as well as the minimum twopence.  It was 27 pence in 1970, 21 pence in 1964 and 15 pence in 1958 and in 1955 it was 10 pence.  There has been a steady rise and we are now providing another rise up to 36 old pence.</P>
      <P>Since the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1970, came into force, 20 committees have been obliged to ask for a rate higher than the maximum of 21p in the £ prescribed in the 1964 Act and hence we had the 1970 Act.  We have had increased salaries and a deterioration of the financial situation of all the committees.  Since the 1970 Act was introduced committees of agriculture were obliged to apply the second phase of the 11th round pay increase of 4 per cent and 3 per cent in addition to arbitration awards to members of advisory staffs.  After that, further increases to instructors serving in the advisory services were awarded in July, 1970.  There was a 12th round pay increase of 7 per cent with effect from 1st April, 1970 and an additional 10 per cent from 1st January, 1971, was also awarded.  These increases were necessary to keep the officers concerned in line with people in the public service sector generally.  That was the reason for the introduction of section 1.</P>

    <P>He is 33 years of age and to my mind he typifies the finest type of Dublin person.  He is a quiet, non-aggressive, hard-working man who earns a reasonably good income as a panel-beater.  The reason Mr. Murphy went to Belfast&mdash;and this is the custom with a considerable number of Dublin men who are single and who earn reasonably good wages &mdash;is that he spends his weekends visiting various parts of the country.  When I visited him at Crumlin Road Jail and asked him why he went to Belfast he told me he had been to Cobh the previous weekend and that when he left home on the weekend in question he was not sure whether he would go to Wexford or Belfast, as it was his custom to go somewhere on his free weekends.  This is to clear up a point some people have mentioned to me since this matter was raised.</P>
    <P>The main point is that Mr. Murphy, in the company of a friend in Belfast, was arrested by four British soldiers, taken into custody and, while in custody, was subjected to the most brutal treatment.  I see in this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> reference to the Compton Report; the heading states: &ldquo;Men were ill-treated but no brutality.&rdquo;  I do not know how some people would define brutality but I have here a signed statement by Mr. Murphy witnessed by his solicitor Mr. Christopher Napier of Donegall Square, Belfast.  I shall read some extracts from the statement.  It states:</P>
    <P>After that they put paper about the collar of my shirt.  They said that there was paraffin oil on the paper and that they were going to put a match to it.  It was there for <Col N="2150" /> 15 minutes.  Then they took it away. They never set it on fire.</P>
    <P>The statement continues:</P>
    <P>I got tea from these military police then.  When I drank the tea I started to see images on the wall. It was about five to ten minutes after the tea.  The heads of dogs, stagecoaches and peculiar looking horses menaced me.  I asked could I turn around.  I was refused.  I was made stand up again on my toes, fingers to the wall and was beaten around the back of my body with fists and batons and I was kicked.</P>
    <P>It is further stated:</P>
    <P>Then I was put back on the chair. One of them took out a revolver. He showed me the bullet and he showed me the cylinder with one bullet in it.  The other spaces were empty.  He closed the gun and put it to my head.</P>
    <P>It clicked.  &ldquo;Not this time&rdquo; said he. It clicked again.  All of a sudden there was a big bang.  This went on for a long time.  Nine times the gun was discharged.  I am not sure if it was live ammunition as I only saw the back end of the bullet.</P>
    <P>Then they put a green sack over my head.  After this others came in. I am not sure if they were military or not.  They said &ldquo;Take him out in front of the firing squad.  It is useless talking to this fellow&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It probably sounds like a ham radio programme but it did not sound like that to Mr. Murphy. Mr. Murphy had been kicked and beaten over a period of 48 hours.  He is a native and resident of this city.</P>
    <P>The matter of this man's detention appeared in the newspapers on a number of occasions.  As a result of information I received and the fact that he is a constituent of mine, I made arrangements through Mr. Paddy Devlin, MP, in Belfast to try to secure some aid for this man, who, apparently, up to very recently, had been disowned by his own Government.  As a result of this conversation with Mr. Devlin a solicitor, Mr. Napier, was secured and it was arranged also for a doctor to examine Mr. Murphy.  However, the doctor was not able to get into the <Col N="2151" /> prison for the purpose of examining this man until six or seven days after the injuries had been inflicted on him but the certificate which I produced here last Thursday, and which I can produce again now, confirms that even after that length of time, Mr. Murphy's person still showed signs of the injuries that had been inflicted.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last I arranged to go to Belfast to see Mr. Murphy and in fairness I must say that when I contacted the British Embassy here they, without much loss of time and with the utmost courtesy, arranged for that visit to take place.  I spoke to Mr. Napier and I spoke also to the doctor who issued the certificate that I can produce.  I spoke, too, to Mr. Murphy and I ascertained beyond all question of doubt that the details of the injuries as described in the doctor's statement are absolutely true.  I am prepared to stake my whole political future not only on that fact but also on the fact that Mr. Murphy has not been in any way engaged in illegal activity of any kind.</P>
    <P>Although this man had been dragged off the streets of Belfast, he having committed no crime and although he was subjected by people who obviously have sick minds to the most brutal form of treatment that can be described only as sadistic, no action or no representation was made on his behalf by this Government.  The man's solicitor, having visited Mr. Murphy and taken a statement from him, wrote to the Department of Foreign Affairs on 2nd November describing the circumstances in which Mr. Murphy found himself and asking that the matter be brought before the Court of Human Rights.  The only reply Mr. Napier received to that letter was to the effect that he should secure a sworn affidavit from Mr. Murphy.  He wrote again to the Department and quite rightly asked them if they had any suggestions to make as to how he could secure a sworn affidavit from a man who was detained in Crumlin Road Jail.  Let us note that that is not the important issue here.  The important issue is that although the Department of Foreign Affairs had been made aware officially of the circumstances <Col N="2152" /> in which a citizen of this country, an inhabitant of this city, was detained in Crumlin Road Jail and of the treatment to which he was subjected, they refused to accept any responsibility whatsoever for that man. If I, not as a TD but as Frank Cluskey, a citizen of this country, were to go to, say, France or Spain, or any other country in Europe, and to find myself in conflict with the law even through an illegal act of mine, the Irish Embassy in the country concerned, or a representative of the Irish Government in that country, would at least inquire about the initial reason for my detention, what charges were being brought against me and in what circumstances and conditions I was being detained, but the man we are concerned with here, who committed no crime and who has done nothing illegal, but who has been detained in prison and subjected to the most brutal treatment was not only ignored by the Government but the implication was that this Government were not prepared to accept any responsibility whatsoever for him.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult not to be emotional about this case.  Yesterday while listening to a news bulletin on the radio I heard that the British Army had announced the arrest of eight men in a swoop in Belfast.  My immediate reaction to that was: &ldquo;God help those eight men particularly for the first 48 hours of their detention.&rdquo;  While I have had the opportunity of discussing detention with only one man who was detained, I have no doubt that hundreds of others were subjected to the same sort of treatment.  Not only were there no representations made but I doubt whether this Government know the names or indeed the total number of people who are subject to detention or internment in the Six Counties.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; and let the people judge for themselves.  The Taoiseach told a falsehood to this House in replying to me today.  We all know that every word the Taoiseach utters has to be examined very carefully because it can have very many meanings but this particular word can have only one meaning and it can be used only to mislead.  In replying to Question No. 1 on today's Order Paper, the Taoiseach said and I quote:</P>
      <P>The case mentioned by the Deputy is one of those which have been under investigation.</P>
      <P>I find this extraordinary.  How can a case be under investigation with a view to sending it to the Court of Human Rights or the European Commission on Human Rights when no one has even tried to ascertain the circumstances in which this man was arrested and when no effort was made by this Government until last Friday the 12th?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reply to a question by me today stated that the Department of Foreign Affairs have been in touch with the solicitor involved, that they have written to him and that they have also sent a representative to Belfast to interview people.  The Taoiseach was asked could he say when the representative from the Department of Foreign Affairs went to Belfast and also when the Department of Foreign Affairs contacted Mr. Murphy's solicitor.  The Taoiseach replied that an officer of the Department was in Belfast on the 12th.  Was it the 12th July that he meant to imply?  He was asked, fortunately, by Deputy FitzGerald <Col N="2154" /> was it the 12th November and the Taoiseach replied: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just as well. Mr. Murphy's case has been appearing in the Press for approximately three weeks.  Mr. Murphy's solicitor wrote to the Department of Foreign Affairs on 2nd November.  Yet we are now told by the Taoiseach in reply to a direct question today that this is one of the cases that have been under investigation. Nothing has happened.  Mr. Murphy was not contcted.  Mr. Murphy's solicitor was not contacted. Mr. Murphy's family were not contacted. They live approximately one mile from where we are sitting now. Nothing happened until last Friday, the day after I raised this question in this House in, I accept, an unorthodox manner.  Surely the smallest crime in this whole sorry mess is my lack of orthodox behaviour under the rules of this House.</P>
      <P>It would appear that for some strange reason there is a deliberate policy by the Government to give no offence whatsoever to the British Government.  I do not want to over-state this case.  I say this with all sincerity.  I understand the difficult situation in which the Taoiscach must find himself on many aspects of the sorry mess in Northern Ireland.  I cannot&mdash;and I doubt if the Irish people will&mdash;accept that when the plight of a citizen of this State has been brought to the attention of the Government no effort is made, no representations, no queries, no questions, but the appearance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start off by saying that I refute entirely what Deputy Cluskey has alleged against me, that I deliberately misled the House today in a written parliamentary reply. I want to repeat that the case of Mr. Murphy is one of the cases which have been under investigations.  Deputy Cluskey mentioned a date, 2nd <Col N="2155" /> November, as the first date on which a letter was written by the solicitor of this detainee to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That is incorrect.  I could just as easily accuse Deputy Cluskey of misleading the House but I will give the dates in a few minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has ascertained it.  Up to this afternoon apparently he had not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I have advised the House on a number of occasions of the Government's view in relation to the introduction of one-sided internment in the North of Ireland in the circumstances that exist there.  Indeed, the attempt to bolster up the Stormont regime through measures of this kind is so objectionable and so contrary to the expressed intentions of the British Government in regard to the rights, political or otherwise, of the minority and so incapable of doing anything other than worsening the situation in the North, that this Government called for the removal of the Stormont regime shortly after internment was introduced in the North. We called for the replacement of that regime by a new form of administration.</P>
      <P>The same demand has been made by the elected representatives of the minority in the North and, indeed, the minority themselves have manifestly demonstrated their refusal to further acquiesce in a Unionist Government or, indeed, in the system of administration of that Government.  Furthermore, opinion in Britain of the most serious and responsible kind is steadily coming around to the view that the Stormont experiment is a failure and that a fresh start must be made both in the North and in terms of the future destiny of this country as a whole.  It is the Government's intention to continue to express these points of view and to use every available legitimate means, political and diplomatic, to obtain the desired result.  I believe this to be the view also not only of the vast majority of Deputies in this House but of every Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as taking specific action in individual cases is concerned, the Government have decided against this for a number of reasons.  This, I think, is <Col N="2156" /> pertinent to the complaint made by Deputy Cluskey.  The first and most important reason is the one I have just mentioned, that is, that the essential thing is to remove the regime which obviously can survive only on the repression of the minority.  The departure of internment is clearly allied to the departure of the present form of Government in the North.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons which are also cogent.  They include the fact that to make representations in the cases which have been brought to attention individually could be an unfair procedure. Some people are unable, and for that matter some are unwilling, to have their cases brought to attention individually.  They could be left in an inferior position and it would be possible for some people to draw the inference that we were, in fact, condoning internment in those cases which were left unmentioned, or, perhaps, we could be accused of deciding that internment was justified in those cases.</P>
    <P>I do not think the House would hold with that opinion or hold with that point of view.  I am sure we would all agree that an injustice would be done in giving preference to one case above another, to the case in which the internee or the detainee did not bring his case to notice as against the internee or detainee who, as in the case of Mr. Murphy, was fortunate enough to have a Deputy in this House to expose the facts of his case.</P>
    <P>In this respect it must be remembered that nobody who has been detained or interned has been charged or tried because he committed any offence.  To suggest, therefore, that one case might be more deserving than another is to impose judgment on men none of whom will receive a proper judgment in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is the additional point, and it is this, that as far as we know, all the internees or detainees are Irishmen, are Irish citizens, and our law on citizenship does not differentiate between the rights of citizens, and quite rightly, in the present situation especially.</P>
    <P>I have already told the House on a number of occasions that investigations into these cases of detainees and internees were in progress and have been for some months, investigations in <Col N="2157" /> regard to allegations of torture, brutality and, in those unfortunate cases who never had a chance of being interned, deprivation of life itself, by the security forces in the North and I want to repeat that these investigations are continuing and I want to repeat again that Mr. Murphy's case is one of these.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey mentioned in relation to Mr. Murphy that he went quite innocently to the North of Ireland on a weekend visit.  I accept entirely what Deputy Cluskey has said.  I have no reason whatever to impute any other motive to Mr. Murphy than that he went there innocently and to visit friends if he had friends there and certainly with no evil or subversive intent.  But I want to say to the Deputy that we heard about it much before the 2nd November and action was taken immediately, but I would like the House to understand that an investigation of this kind calls for a degree of co-operation from persons who are themselves under much stress and considerable pressure.  Many of these people have displayed considerable moral courage, have displayed resource and skill in compiling the necessary evidence and it would be obviously unfair of me to reveal their identities and I do not propose to do so.  There is already sufficient evidence that men are interned without trial for no apparent reason and evidence that men have been subjected to torture and brutality in the process.  We should not, even inadvertently, by naming people with whom we have that contact in our investigations, put them into jeopardy in an area where such terrible things are capable of happening to them.</P>
    <P>We have correspondence, and I want to say to Deputy Cluskey it was not on 2nd November but rather on 25th October that the first letter was received from the solicitor, Mr. Napier, solicitor for Mr. Murphy.  That was replied to on 27th October, in a letter looking for more information, looking for a medical certificate if that was available and any affidavit Mr. Murphy may have made.  There was no direction in that to procure an affidavit, but a request seeking a copy of any affidavit he may have made.  The solicitor <Col N="2158" /> replied again on 29th October and following certain inquiries, and studies having been made here, the reply was sent back to Mr. Napier on 10th November, immediately following which an officer of the Department was sent to the North to interview Mr. Napier.  I am sure that if Deputy Cluskey again checks with the solicitor involved he will find that that solicitor does not share the view, and would not be party to the remarks made by Deputy Cluskey, about the work in which the Department of Foreign Affairs are at present engaged or about the manner in which they have co-operated with Mr. Napier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke to the solicitor and he definitely shared the view on the 9th of this month when I spoke to him.  Make no mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about an interview on 12th November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that as a result of that interview I am satisfied the solicitor involved was satisfied with the manner in which the Department were handling the situation.</P>
      <P>Brutality and tortures have been mentioned in this case as well and, as we all know, the Compton Report was published this afternoon.  I received a copy of it this afternoon.  It contains about 75 pages in all and I have had a chance only of a preliminary reading of it.  I have been asked for some comment and I think I can make comment here because it would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The facts set down in the Compton Report together with the investigations which have been made and are being made by the Government provide very substantial evidence of a very grave state of affairs in the administration of justice in the North.  The Government will now examine very closely the Compton Report in conjunction with the results of our own investigations with a view to deciding whether recourse will be had to the European Commission of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17th November, 1971.</P>
