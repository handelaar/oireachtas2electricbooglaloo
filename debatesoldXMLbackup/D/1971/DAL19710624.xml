    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest cause of dissatisfaction among local authority tenants is the question of differential rents.  This system is not being operated either fairly, equitably or with justice to the tenants.  As I explained already&mdash;I hope the Minister has since obtained some information on the matter&mdash;there is a valid reason for this dissatisfaction.  These tenants are deprived of the right to transfer or inter-transfer because in such event they are then put on a new scale of differential rent.  If a member of a family succeeds to the tenancy of a house he is deprived of the rights that were granted to his parents by Dublin Corporation despite the fact that he may have lived in the house for many years.  There are many such cases on the books of Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>The assessment of rent on gross income under the differential rents scheme is also a source of grievance in so far as it constitutes double taxation on these people who have already had to pay tax on their incomes.  Some of these grievances would be removed if the Minister would institute an investigation for the purpose of ascertaining how the differential rents scheme would be modified so as to grant to tenants their basic rights. There should be no victimisation in the case of transfer or inter-transfer and rents should be assessed on net income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These, then, are the major grievances of the tenants.  The Minister must be <Col N="2421" /> aware of the number of people who are being victimised under present regulations. The valuing of these houses has gone completely out of hand and is unrealistic.  The Government talk about spiralling costs and inflated house prices which are not justified while they themselves are condoning the present system whereby Dublin Corporation are inflating house prices beyond the means of the tenants who have been in occupation of the houses for a long time.  I know of cases where independent valuers have valued houses at prices much lower than the value put on them by Dublin Corporation valuers.  This, too, is a source of grievance to tenants who are contemplating buying the houses.  Some of these houses do not contain the basic amenities&mdash;many of them have no bathroom&mdash;but yet tenants who wish to purchase them are asked for prices as high as £2,300 and £2,400.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously these matters in an effort to have them rectified and, consequently, to have some content among the tenants.  The discontent is building up to such an extent that the Minister, by his inaction, may be inviting trouble with which he may not be able to cope.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the local authority housing programme.  I have heard the Minister and the Taoiseach say that the programme for housing as projected in the White Paper, <i>Housing in the Seventies,</i> was not only reached but was exceeded. However, if we consider the figures we will realise that local authority housing has not kept pace with the demand. Therefore, it is a blatant lie to say that housing has exceeded the target set. One can talk about private houses in the £5,000 to £10,000 range but are we solving the social need for the provision of shelters for persons who are not able to provide houses for themselves out of their own means?  I have looked at the list of projects in hand by the local authority in Dublin.  I have no hesitation in saying that it does not even attempt to cope with the enormous problem that exists.  By not giving full figures, by concealing the real figures by not including on the list persons who have no children, Dublin <Col N="2422" /> Corporation are hiding the fact that there is a housing crisis.</P>
    <P>I do not know if you have heard of Hollyfield Buildings, Mount Pleasant Buildings, Benburb Street Buildings, Corporation Place and other such areas.  I would compare them with the hovels that one might see in underdeveloped countries.  Public toilets only are provided for these tenants of Dublin Corporation.  Amenities are not provided.  In some cases electricity is not provided.  I do not think that the tenants of these buildings have been considered in the housing programme. These people are treated as worse than second class citizens in being asked to live in these hovels.  A debtors' prison has been created out of Hollyfield and Benburb Street Buildings, where people who go into arrears of rent are forced to live.  I have seen a case where a family of ten are sleeping in one room with a tiny kitchen attached.  They fell into arrears of rent through no fault of their own.  This is the way in which the housing authority deal with social problems.</P>
    <P>Public representatives have a right to full details from the housing authority. We are deprived of full details in Dublin city.  We are not given the facts regarding the housing problem. We are given the regular stereotyped reply that there are worse cases on the list.  This is not good enough.  In the booklet &ldquo;A House of your Own&rdquo; the Minister mentions that there is a queue. There is no one on the Dublin Corporation housing list who can say that he is in a queue because he does not know his place on the list.  This is the greatest cause of discontent and was perhaps the cause of many cases of squatting.  People felt that there was not a just and equitable system in the allocation of dwellings because no one could give them accurate information as to their place on the list.  I have found that these people would be more than patient if they could be given any indication of their chance of being housed.  They were told to put down their names for one area and then they were told that they must move to another area.  Because the system is wrong the people can be given no idea of when they may be <Col N="2423" /> housed.  If there were a points system in operation in Dublin such as works very satisfactorily elsewhere, people could be given accurate information as to when they would be offered accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is shameful that one has to say to people who have one child that there is no hope whatever of their being housed.  A husband and wife with one child can now be told that there is no hope of their getting accommodation from Dublin Corporation.  This has been the position for over a year.  They can be granted no form of accommodation no matter what their living conditions may be.  It is a sad state of affairs that priority should be given to office blocks and luxury flats.  A husband and wife with one child will not be accepted for furnished dwellings. We may be a Catholic country but unfortunately we are not a Christian country.  Dublin Corporation is not attempting to solve the problem.  I defy the Minister to contradict me on this, that a husband and wife with one child have no hope of being granted accommodation.  In the case of a husband and wife who through no fault of their own cannot have a family they will not even be permitted to go on the Dublin Corporation list.  We should be aware of these facts and face up to them.  These people will be denied local authority accommodation forever. It is a terrible state of affairs when one sees a case such as I visited two nights ago, of a husband and wife and daughter of 12 living in a small room which served as bedroom and kitchen and having to tell them that there is no hope of their getting accommodation.  It may be asked why they themselves cannot do something about this.  A man earning £20 a week has very little chance of saving the deposit required for a house if he has a wife and child and is paying £7 a week for one furnished room.  He could not hope to get a room cheaper than that at the present time.  One could only tell him that he would have to continue as he was and hope that his wife would have another baby so that he would be considered&mdash;considered only&mdash;for housing by the local <Col N="2424" /> authority.  This is the situation when Ministers talk about the programme and how they coped with the problem. So far as local authority housing is concerned they are far from coping with it.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out a few years ago showed there were 59,000 families in need of rehousing due to overcrowding and related problems and a further 9,000 houses needed annually because of demolition, increase in households, migrations, <i>et cetera.</i>  We must also take into account the fact that 60 per cent of the houses are over 50 years old and in many cases need replacement.  This gives one some idea of the housing needs.  At the present rate of building I cannot see the problem which was shown to exist three years ago being solved in another ten years.  It must be borne in mind that the problem is increasing.  Even if we increase the pace of the programme the existing problem would not be solved for 15 years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has boasted that the targets of the White Paper have been met and exceeded.  According to a survey covering the four year period, 1963-1967, we have had the lowest output of houses per thousand inhabitants and as a percentage of our gross national product we have spent less on housing than any other European country with the exception of Spain. We have the second lowest stock of housing per thousand of inhabitants. Another point worth noting is that for every 100 new houses we lose 47 houses.  It is an idle boast for the Taoiseach and his Ministers to say we are coping with the problem.  The situation is deteriorating rapidly and the Government are hiding the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has set a precedent in this House in that he will not accept responsibility. We must not forget that we have not got a corporation in Dublin, we have not a city council, and we have no means of getting information we require. The Minister for Local Government has set a precedent in that he will not give the information to the Dáil.  Time and again I have tabled questions only to be told that it is not the Minister's responsibility.  I do not agree with this.  The Minister knows <Col N="2425" /> that he cannot give the true figures and he has decided the best way out is to say it is not his responsibility.  We should deplore this and we should tell the Minister he is not entitled to decide it is not his responsibility.  He appointed the city commissioner and he knows what is happening.  Every housing project must be sanctioned by his Department and the Minister is fully aware of the situation.  He should be forced to give us the information we request.</P>
    <P>It has been said that if more money is provided for housing it sets off an inflationary spiral in housing costs. That has happened here but it is noteworthy that it has not happened in Northern Ireland.  The authorities there have been able to initiate a housing programme that is ahead of anything we have done and we must give them credit.  The Government are mishandling the housing situation.  They have not taken any action with regard to land speculation&mdash;a subject on which we have spoken at length.  Their only answer is that this would involve constitutional changes and they are afraid to tackle this problem.  Where a social evil exists the constitutional problem should be tackled without any fuss or qualms.  People are entitled to their rights and any Article in the Constitution that deprives people of a right or permits a social evil to exist should be changed.</P>
    <P>In a motion put down by the Labour Party in regard to housing we asked the Minister to freeze the price of land required for housing but the Minister said it was not possible to do this. The authorities in Northern Ireland have been able to do this and in the new town of Craigavon the price of land is £275 per acre.  In this way the authorities in Northern Ireland were able to stop land speculation.  However, we allow land speculation to continue. Exorbitant prices are paid for land; the speculators are getting off scot-free and, it appears to me, with the blessing of the Government.  I would nearly go so far as to say that Government members are conniving with land speculators.</P>
    <P>The Government deplore the price of housing and say they must do something about it.  However, they imposed <Col N="2426" /> a 15 per cent wholesale and turnover tax on building materials and by this measure they have contributed substantially towards increasing costs.  The Government regulations have slowed down the flow of finance for house-building. The regulations are so cumbersome that there is not a regular flow of finance for housing and even builders constructing private houses are forced to borrow at exorbitant rates. This further increases the price of houses.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to accept the pious plea of the Government to all concerned to keep prices down when we consider the rise of 400 per cent in the Dublin Corporation betterment levy and the ESB demand of £100 from those builders who will not install electric central heating.  These are measures that have been approved indirectly by the Government and they are major factors in the rising cost of housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach have mentioned rising labour costs.  This is a myth because it has been proved that the number of hours spent on the building of a house is less than half what was spent in 1957-58.  That is proof that what the Minister is saying is wrong.  The reasons for the increased price of houses are land speculation, the wholesale and turnover tax imposed by the Government, the rise of 400 per cent in the Dublin Corporation betterment levy and the £100 demanded by the ESB from those who do not install electric central heating.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about the local authority in Dublin building up a land bank.  I can tell the House that they are endeavouring to sell off some of their land to speculators and supermarket groups.  It has happened in Ballyfermot.  We must remember that we have no control over Dublin Corporation. They can act as they like, the decision is made, there is no city council, there is only a commissioner appointed by the Minister.  Obviously the Minister is dictating to them what to do.  Here we see the hypocrisy of Government pleas and exhortations to housing authorities to build up a land bank while they are approving and perhaps telling authorities to dispose <Col N="2427" /> of land to supermarket groups and so on.  This proves that the Government are not concerned about our housing problem.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read last October where Canon Kerr in an address to the Diocesan Synods of Dublin, Glendalough and Kildare, spoke about the housing problem in Dublin. Obviously he was very much aware of the problem. He called for a reactivation of the public conscience.  He spoke about the grossly inadequate housing problem and he said that the number of families living in one room was such as to be a reflection on us.  He said we appeared to be unconcerned about this problem.  He contrasted the miserable housing of so many Dublin families with the proud development of luxury hotels, supermarkets and vast office blocks.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we provide as much as we can with the money we have.  I am wondering who provides the finance for the office blocks, the supermarkets and the luxury hotels. The money comes from the commercial banks.  Are the Government serious when they say they cannot get the money when money can be provided for these other projects, projects which are not of such importance in the light of the social problems that are so prevalent?  We look at these edifices and we forget that around the corner there are people living in hovels.  Just 50 yards from O'Connell Street, in Corporation Place, four minutes walk from O'Connell Street, there are sights that make one cringe with horror.  It is futile to talk of people living in substandard dwellings.  The term &ldquo;substandard dwellings&rdquo; means nothing until one has actually seen these dwellings for oneself and the conditions in which the unfortunate inhabitants of these dwellings are trying to survive.  Everyone should see these conditions for himself because no one can get a proper picture unless he actually sees things for himself.</P>
    <P>Take Benburb Street.  I had a priest who was concerned about the problems there and he wanted to go and live in one of the rooms there.  I saw the <Col N="2428" /> assistant city manager and asked him if this priest could have a room in Benburb Street and I was told &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Surely no one should begrudge anyone a room in these hovels.  Surely no one would envy this priest in his particular mission.  He wanted to live with the people and to know their problems.  It is a shocking indictment on us that we turn a blind eye to these problems.  Our priorities are wrong.  Things are topsyturvy. We are going the wrong way about things.  Fortunately people are now beginning to ask questions.  Perhaps the mass media of communication is helping.  People ask why they cannot have a proper roof over their heads.  To condemn people to live in these hovels is morally wrong.  The officials are hardened.  They regard the people as just numbers.  We have a computer way of thinking.  We forget that humanity is involved.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated in 1969 that he was contemplating setting up a Department of Housing.  This is something of which this House would approve.  The ramifications of local government are so widespread that it is impossible to give special attention to housing.  I am talking about the situation in Dublin.  I have visited all these substandard dwellings.  What I say about Dublin is probably true of other parts of the country; the situation is probably equally bad.  A Department of Housing could tackle the problem and plan a proper housing programme, a programme designed to improve the situation and ensure that all our citizens have proper dwellings in which to live.</P>
    <P>We hear the Minister constantly talking about rationalising building schemes so that we can produce lower-cost houses.  This is hypocritical because I do not think he has any intention whatsoever of rationalising.  He talks about system-built flats.  I believe they cost as much as, if not more than, traditional building.  I should like the Minister to prove to us how these flats are better and cheaper.  They are certainly not better.  I was in some flats in Inchicore last Saturday.  They are scarcely a year old, but the rain is coming in and the walls are damp.  The wallpaper being destroyed.  I have <Col N="2429" /> sent the details to the city manager.  It is not right to allow that sort of thing to happen.  The tenants are paying very high rents.  The lift has been out of action for ten weeks and the people and children have to climb eight flights of stairs.  If we were asked to climb eight flights of stairs we would be breathless at the end of it.  The people have been told that the parts have to come from Germany.  This is just not good enough. Those who install these lifts should be compelled to carry the essential spare parts for them.  There should be no question of waiting for these to come from Germany.</P>
    <P>These people's requirements are few and they do not complain unnecessarily. They have had no heating since the 1st June.  We all know what the weather has been like in the last few weeks.  Last Saturday the flats were really cold.  Some of the tenants have resorted to paraffin stoves and one can scarcely breathe because of the fumes. Heating should be provided when the weather is cold and inclement.  The tenants are paying for heating.  We build these flats and we think everything is great and that the tenants should not complain but if an ESB fuse blows on Friday night or Saturday morning they are in darkness for the whole weekend because the corporation has the box locked and you cannot get a corporation official and the ESB cannot get in.  Tenants are not complaining too much in asking that these matters be put right.  If the central heating goes off in mid-winter when there is snow and ice&mdash;it invariably happens on a Saturday or a Friday night&mdash;nobody comes to restore it until Monday.</P>
    <P>These are some of the things that arise in these system-built houses where every amenity is supposed to be provided. On paper everything is fine but the hard fact is that people have these problems.  These new flats that are damp are not ideal.  I am opposed to flats.  I do not think that children brought up in a flats environment behave properly afterwards and they are handicapped in later life.  Anybody who has grown up in flats will not want to bring up his children in flats. No facilities for children are provided <Col N="2430" /> with these high rise flats.  In the case of the Ballymun flats which are 14 or 15 storeys high there is not even a public toilet for the children at ground level.  Mothers cannot keep children cooped up; they must be allowed down but there are no amenities.  If we have to build high rise flats we should ensure that there are proper amenities with them and take into account that the tenants will be rearing children in them.  That was not done and it is a great reflection on us that we cannot have planners in the Departments or in the National Building Agency, which was responsible for this development, who will consider the type of people who will occupy these flats and what amenities should be provided.</P>
    <P>What I have described may seem like small grievances but they are very real.  We all have house problems but we would not like to find, when the main fuse blows, that nobody is available to remedy it.  It is irritating and frustrating to be without electricity for a whole weekend.  Perhaps these luxury dwellings are very nice inside but when you find dampness destroying the decor it is not very good.  There should be an inquiry into this.  In the case of the Bluebell scheme of flats in my constituency I think the builder should have been brought before the courts.  The corporation has spent a fantastic amount trying to rectify dampness.  In one case of a four-roomed flat they moved the occupants into one room while the other rooms were put out of commission.  The water was flowing down the walls even though they tried everything to remedy it.  They finally got on to the city manager and now I think they have decided to take off the whole roof in order to solve the problem.  This is the sort of building that is going on.  If this is allowed to happen I wonder if money is being misspent or wasted.  You must see this to realise what happens.</P>
    <P>Since Bernard Curtis House was built it has been a disgrace but the builder was not taken to task.  I wonder why, considering that this is one of the worst buildings I have seen.  If we admitted to these tenants that they had got a raw deal and said that they would be provided with proper accommodation we might get some progress.  These <Col N="2431" /> people do not want much; they are easily satisfied but at present they are paying rent for flats that are not proper living accommodation.  That is what is happening in Bluebell.  There is also dampness in parts of the Inchicore flats, in St. Michael's estate and if that is the case now within a year of these flats being built, what will be the position in a few years time?</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with system built flats.  This matter should be investigated; perhaps the builders are cutting down on something.  If we have these problems the flats may not be so cheap.  I tried to estimate the cost in the early hours of this morning of the Ballymun flats because the Minister has refused to give the information. I should like to know the exact cost of them and compare it with the cost of traditionally built flats.  Certainly, it appears they should be built cheaper but, in fact, that is not happening.  I should like to know how much rent is obtained from Ballymun in a year, what subsidy exactly is necessary and how it is arrived at, the cost of it, the interest rate and the total interest payable.  If one were able to produce these figures to the people they might be a little more amenable to paying high rents.  Instead, we are just telling them that it is costing the Government a fortune.  We are not spelling it out and this is wrong.  Details in respect of four-bedroom, three-bedroom, two-bedroom and one-bedroom flats would be very helpful.  It might help us to see how the Minister can justify the high rent the corporation charges these tenants.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how he arrives at a figure of 25s a week for central heating, how and why this is subsidised. I know private houses can have central heating cheaper and have it all year round.  Time and again it is said that people have no means of controlling the heat in their flats.  Was it an economy to provide a central heating system which did not enable tenants to control the heat as required?</P>
    <P>I lived in America for years and in every apartment in which I lived it was possible to control the heat.  If we had incurred the initial expense of providing <Col N="2432" /> a controllable system in these flats would the cost now be reduced? Dublin Corporation's answer to me is; &ldquo;Let them open the windows.&rdquo;  This is waste of heat which could, perhaps, have been prevented if control had been provided originally.  I should like to know the cost per flat of providing central heating.  We should be given these figures but the Minister constantly says it is not possible to give them.  It should have been possible to work out the cost per flat originally. No doubt Deputy Foley is concerned about some of the problems he meets in the Ballymun flats.</P>
    <P>If the Department increased the number of technical personnel by offering better salaries and conditions this would help to speed up the housing programme.  The Minister has promised every support for co-operatives but would he consider setting up a national building co-operative movement for the building of houses?  When people apply for sites they get sites all right but the city manager has admitted he makes a little profit on the sale of sites.  An article on whether our houses are too dear in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 18th October, 1970, stated:</P>
    <P>...the Corporation did not sell the land at a loss.  Neither did the original owners, the Irish Christian Brothers.  We repeatedly asked the Corporation to break down the land price of a site but the City Manager, Mr. Macken, just as often refused. We reckon that, as an employee of the State, he has no right to do that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Macken's attitude is no different from that of his officials.  They tell people they have no right to any information and this is the sort of bureaucracy we have in Dublin city.  If proper assistance and co-operation were given instead of pious platitudes and vague promises people would get interested in building their own houses and setting up co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I was brought up with the idea that building societies were established to help people provide their own houses but I have had a rude awakening since I began studying the problem. I do not accept what the Minister has said, that the money is provided solely for private housing.  I can cite cases where building societies lend money <Col N="2433" /> for commercial development properties and hotels because they can get a higher interest rate but this is not the purpose for which building societies were set up.  If they are contravening the rules there should be an inquiry. When we hear of a building society which has a permanent chairman and permanent directors there should be an inquiry into that society.</P>
    <P>One building society included a new rule in its articles of association&mdash;it went unnoticed by the Registrar of Friendly Societies&mdash;which states that the society can dismiss any member without reason and without giving an explanation.  That means if a person becomes a shareholder in that society &mdash;and it must be remembered that borrowers are only one-fifth shareholders, they are not real shareholders&mdash;and wants to apply to become a director, as every shareholder should have the right to do, he must apply to become a director of this building society, the Irish Permanent, before 31st December for the AGM held on 31st March.  If a person applies to become a director in December this building society can operate the rules against that person and have him thrown out of the society before he comes up for election.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Registrar of Friendly Societies has gone to sleep.  That rule is unconstitutional and can be challenged in the courts.  I do not think people with their sons, brothers and in-laws should be allowed to control these building societies which were established to help people and not for the profit making which is going on.  Some are operating quite legitimately. There is no doubt about this but there are some who are not.  It is wrong for an auctioneer to have a building society because the temptation is there for the auctioneer to use the funds of the building society for opportunities in building, land speculation, houses or commercial development. It is all very well to say loans are given but there should be more public accountability of these building societies.  I thought further money was to be given for housing but I now know that it is not in many cases. I have been told in reply to questions I have put down that building societies <Col N="2434" /> generally conform to the rules but that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>This inquiry into the building societies has been going on for a very long time.  In April, 1969 I brought up the question of the increase in the interest rates.  A person may get the cheque for his house today but it may be back-dated two months and yet he has to pay interest for those two months.  This is not right but it is happening.  This is a shady business which should not be tolerated.  An inquiry was set up and the responsibility for approval of increases was transferred then from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Department of Local Government.  The inquiry is still on to my knowledge. I wonder when we will hear the result of it.  I wonder are these inquiries set up just to fob us off.  We should have an inquiry into it because if this sort of thing is going on something should be done about it.  They are able to advertise.  I quite accept normal advertising. I think they should attract money but I should like to see the money being used properly for the purposes for which the building societies were set up.  Perhaps the Minister could extend the inquiry to include questions like the misuse of money, the allocation of money for purposes other than housing, the question of rules of the society, the question of the directors and chairman and the question of vacancies on the board.  These vacancies exist and when somebody asks if they could be co-opted they are told: &ldquo;No, I have four other sons.  They must get on.&rdquo;  This is not right.  No one has the right to control or own a building society like this.  It belongs to the members.  The vote by proxy and people being told to vote for so-and-so is wrong.  It is operated wrongly.  The sooner we have a public inquiry into it the better because I do not think people should control a society like this, set up their own rules, tell people to shut up and sit down when they ask questions at annual general meetings. Unless we expose this we will see it get worse and worse.  If you do not believe me buy a share and attend the annual general meeting of the Irish Permanent Building Society.  It has a permanent chairman <i>et cetera.</i>  That is <Col N="2435" /> what is permanent about it and it will be permanent as long as they are allowed to operate as they are doing. I hear the annual general meeting is a comedy.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what insurance companies are providing loans for houses.  To my knowledge it is only foreign insurance companies.  If they are not I wonder why our Irish insurance companies are not providing house loans.  It galls me to see them building office blocks.  There is a nice development around the corner in St. Stephen's Green by an Irish insurance company.  Why can this money not be invested in housing?  Investment in housing is a long term investment but so is office block investment.  Why can they not be compelled to provide a proportion even of their money for housing?  Perhaps the Minister would answer this question.  I brought it up before and he evaded it, whether deliberately or not I do not know.  We do not often get an opportunity to discuss housing and when we do we should be given proper answers.</P>
    <P>The traffic problem in Dublin city is a headache for many people, including the Department of Local Government. We see it getting worse and we wonder if we have looked at it properly. I do not know that we were right in passing over power to Dublin Corporation again.  I think we made a big blunder.  We had a Garda superintendent in Dublin Castle who was coping with the problem very masterfully and very competently but he was being harassed and frustrated in all his attempts to alleviate the problem. Nearly four years ago he suggested that traffic lights should be provided all along the quays.  This has not been done.  That is one instance.  He asked for many other things and nothing was done.  They said they had gone as far as possible and that it was now up to the Government to decide about building proper roads and bridges. Instead the whole problem has now been passed over to a bureaucratic department who have decided that they are above the law.  They have taken over the powers of the police and this is very dangerous.  I do not <Col N="2436" /> think any director of traffic should have the powers of the police.  It is wrong.  I shall give an example which involved the life of a baby.</P>
    <P>There is a health authority dispensary in Lord Edward Street, Dublin, perhaps the only central city dispensary. The dispensary doctor attends there each morning.  He needs his car there because he must be available to go out immediately he is called.  Every time he parked his car there he was fined £2.  I approached the corporation on his behalf several times.  He got in a case of a baby who was blue.  He had to take the baby to the hospital immediately.  Seconds counted.  He had to run up Lord Edward Street to his car in High Street with the baby in his arms.  When it reached the hospital it died.  If it had been three minutes earlier its life would have been saved.</P>
    <P>One must think of how these things affect people.  I approached the city manager and explained the case to him.  He said he saw the reason for it and would arrange an appointment for the doctor with the traffic director. The doctor met him and he was abused by the traffic director.  He was asked how dare he ask for this concession. This was not a concession, it was a right because as a dispensary doctor he had to go at any second to deal with emergencies.  He was abused by the traffic director.  This is what happens in Dublin Corporation when officials are given powers like this.  They are above the law.  They have more power than the Minister and there is no check on it.  The attitude now is: &ldquo;If you do not fall in line we will put you in your place.&rdquo;  It is very dangerous to allow people like this to be above the law and to have powers in excess of the police.  There is no flexibility about their regulations.  A French tourist's car parked, inadvertently, perhaps, in a no parking area, was hauled off immediately.  It was parked in a no parking area but it was not an actual obstruction.  This car was hauled off because the traffic director, who is the big dictator, says there is no flexibility.  Laws and regulations must have a certain amount of flexibility. We must not turn our tourists away.  This can do us untold harm. <Col N="2437" /> One man, a big dictator, can say he does not care who they are.  He is given this power by the Department of Local Government.  I am very disturbed that this should happen.  I do not think we have the right to give a man these powers.  Look at the mess that was made of the scheme in relation to the road from Howth into Dublin.  This was the greatest fiasco of all times.  Anyone with common sense could have known that it would be a fiasco.  It was an immature, puerile attempt at solving a traffic problem in Dublin city to have one lane operating for buses only.</P>
    <P>This man and his colleagues have their own parking lot.  A special place is set aside for them, and dare anyone come into it.  There is a big notice saying, &ldquo;No Entry&rdquo;.  They have this privilege and they can sit back and dictate to the people: &ldquo;You must not do this and you must not do that.&rdquo; I had a look at the special parking lot for these dictators who tell the people who provide so much money by way of taxation what to do.  The people of Dublin city are not being given the parking facilities to which they are entitled.  Private individuals and companies can now fleece them with parking fees.</P>
    <P>I brought to the attention of the city manager that Dublin Corporation had handed over a piece of land near Christ Church Place and Winetavern Street which they did not own to the Private Motorists' Protection Association. They are not trying to provide parking facilities.  They are trying to make it more and more difficult for motorists. They say that the best place for a car is at home.  If everyone left his car at home revenue would drop and they might discover that they had killed the goose that lays the golden eggs.  Their policy is wrong.  They are certainly not helping motorists.  We have not got the subways and tubes which they have in Britain.  The buses are not providing the service.  Until the Department produce the proper roads and the proper bridges they have no right to operate a dictatorial policy.  Something will have to be done about this and, for that reason alone, the sooner the council is reconstituted the better.  I <Col N="2438" /> hope it will not be a rubber stamp council.  If we were over there we would make sure that the city manager would not have the almighty powers he has at the moment.  The last council was a rubber stamp council.  As public representatives we would like to see democracy in action.</P>
    <P>The Inchicore Road is very dangerous. There have been very bad accidents there.  What seems to be forgotten is that it is a main road into Dublin. It passes by Kilmainham Jail.  The camber is wrong.  I live on this road and my children can never cross it.  It is the most dangerous road I have ever seen.  It is a narrow road with three bends.  There was a very bad accident just at my own gate in which a priest and his mother were seriously injured. Their car was crushed against the wall of my house.  Since 1964 I have been writing and asking questions about it but nothing has been done yet.  I have seen huge rocks falling off trucks which use that road.  It is hard to imagine how bad it is.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> ran a story and photographs showing how bad it is but still no action was taken by the Department.</P>
    <P>About two years ago Deputy Murphy asked the Minister was this not the main road into Dublin from Cork and he was told that it was.  He then asked was it not one of the worst roads in the country and the Minister said it was.  Still nothing was done about it. Dublin Corporation put a white line there but the road is too narrow for cars to pass.  The white line is now gone, anyway.  A &ldquo;go-slow&rdquo; sign was erected but it was so obscured that no one could see it.  It is terrible to think that nothing will be done about it until somebody is killed.  Then there will be an outcry and all of a sudden the Department will do something about it. I understand that plans have been submitted to the Department.  The last reply I had from the Minister was that no plans had been submitted.  I asked for a pedestrian crossing to be provided there but that would not be done either. How long more must we wait until this stretch of road is improved?  If the Minister could do something about this he would be doing a worthwhile job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal briefly with the problem of planning, development and conservation.  These matters were very much to the fore during 1970, Conservation Year.  While the publicity given to these matters during 1970 helped to awaken the conscience of many people to the problems of development and conservation, this drive should not cease now.  Every year should be conservation year and a more active interest should be taken in these matters.  Conservation and development are two very conflicting forces.  We must have both.  It is a matter for the planners and the local authorities who are charged with the enforcement of planning regulations to ensure that we get the optimum benefits from both.</P>
      <P>Conservation means more than the preservation of what we have, the landscapes and seascapes and all the other things which go to make a better life for our people and a better country for tourists.  Not only must the existing amenities be preserved, but we must also try to improve them and also to create new amenities, thereby ensuring that not only will our country not be spoiled but that it will be improved, in every way possible.  On the other hand, with our increasing population and increasing economic and industrial development, there will be some conflict with conservation policies and practices.  It is up to us to ensure that any development we undertake is planned development.  We must ensure that factories will be planned in such a way as to cause the least possible damage to our environment and to our amenities and to everything else that adds to the enjoyment of our countryside.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to maintain a balance between conservation and development. Many people have argued that new conservation legislation should be introduced. We have been unfortunate in the sense that the industrial revolution of the last century passed us by &mdash; we were an underdeveloped country &mdash; but, on the other hand, we might be regarded as having been fortunate in that the spoliation which occurred in other countries did not happen here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2440" /> The Planning Act of 1963 gave much power to local authorities in relation to planning and to conservation.  Any local authority which use the provisions of that Act will find they have sufficient power to do almost all of the things, conservationwise and developmentwise, that they wish to do.</P>
    <P>Conservation and planning under the county development and other plans are the responsibility of the local authorities because it is the local authorities who are the statutory bodies for the administration of development and planning regulations.  These plans are currently under review.  When the county development and other development plans were formulated three or four years ago some of them were based on a five-year period.  Many local authorities produced excellent development plans but others produced plans that were not so good.  Some of them did not conform to what the people generally and the Government would like to see done.  However, we cannot fault the local authorities for this because some of them did not have available to them the necessary facilities and staff.  Also, at the time, planning was quite new.  Many of the development plans contain provisions which I am sure the elected members of local authorities would like to see changed.  This should be done now and, therefore, we have advised the local authorities to revise their plans. Since the plans were adopted special studies have been carried out and the results of these will be a guideline to local authorities when, at the end of the five-year period, the new development plans for the different areas are being produced.  In addition to the results of these studies being available, local authorities will also have the benefit of the new thinking and of the many booklets that have been published on these matters.  There is also, of course, the experience of the members of the local authorities in regard to the operation in their own areas of their own particular plans. Therefore, at the end of the five-year period we should have revised plans which will be an improvement on the original ones and which will be more acceptable to the public.</P>
    <P>While it is our duty in planning to <Col N="2441" /> ensure that the objects and aims of proper planning and conservation are reached, we must remember that we are planning for people &mdash; for the people of today and for the citizens of tomorrow. In order to get acquiescence we must plan in so far as possible in line with the wishes of the people.  In this way, the plans should not warrant undue criticism or annoyance.  The basic aim should be to develop a system which will be seen to be fair and practical, a system that will take account also of the human problems arising from the planning control system.  This should be the guiding force for local authorities when they get down to revising the county, urban and other development plans.  I have here an excellent document, copies of which were sent on 15th January from the Department to the planning authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it available to Members of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We will see to it that any Deputy who is interested will get a copy.  It is available. The reason I mentioned it and intend to put on the record extracts from it is that it is an excellent document and a guide to the local authorities in the revision of their county development plans.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 says:</P>
      <P>In revising their plans planning authorities will have the benefit of the various regional and other planning studies which have been completed (See Appendix). </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I referred to previously, a number of studies have been made and these studies will be of great assistance to the local authorities.  There is the Traffic Planning for Smaller Towns, published or commissioned by An Foras Forbartha; Planning for Tourism, published in 1966; Urban Redevelopment, New Ross, published in 1966; Killarney Valley Survey &mdash; the same; Regional Studies in Ireland; Regional Development in Ireland; A Renewal Programme for the City of Waterford; Galway City Plan and Planning for a special coastline survey being carried <Col N="2442" /> out, a survey on water pollution, Amenity Recreation and Tourism. Then there are other studies.  There is special amenity study on Brittas, and so on.  These things are available to local authorities.  The advisory reports commissioned by An Foras Forbartha on the Gaeltacht and on roadside development, traffic survey, traffic and safety of arterial roads, will be published in the near future, and the coastline study which I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The work being done under the regional organisations in the preparation of these reports should also be of value to planning authorities and it is hoped that decisions taken following the receipt and analysis of these reports will be available in sufficient time to give guidance to them.</P>
    <P>The Department's administrative and planning staffs will be available for consultation in connection with the review of development plans.  If it appears necessary, arrangements for local visits by planning inspectors will be made provided the pressure of appeals work can be reduced.  Assistance will also be available from An Foras Forbartha.  An Foras will be co-operating with the Department in organising conferences and seminars dealing with the particular aspects of development plans.  The first of these, the working conference on the surveys, was held last November.</P>
    <P>I will read the third paragraph because I regard it as very important:</P>
    <P>But the responsibility for producing effective plans will rest with the planning authority.  It is for their areas the plan is being reviewed and it will be for them to draw the practical lessons from their experience to date in the operation of existing plans and/or planning control to ensure a realistic plan emerges which while based on sound planning principles and such relevant facts as are available, will be acceptable to the public by reason of its practicality and fairness.  This is not to denigrate the value of the plans already made but to stress the need to build experience to date into the review.  Indeed, the Minister takes the opportunity to express his <Col N="2443" /> appreciation of the manner in which the local authorities launched what was in effect for many of them a new service.  In particular, he wishes to record his appreciation of the manner in which the local authority staffs built up their knowledge and expertise in planning and developed from limited resources quite an effective comprehensive planning apparatus. However, the system has not been without its critics and if planning does not sell itself on its merits to the public its whole standing can be undermined.  It is essential, therefore, that the public should see that the system is not only built on sound professional principles but also takes account of the practical human problems arising from the operation of a controlled mechanism capable of affecting the property and the aspirations of every individual.</P>
    <P>This, I think, is important and I know that local authorities when they come to revise their plans will have regard to the advice and the suggestions made there.</P>
    <P>Another important point about the local development plans is that it is for the elected representatives to sanction the plans and I find and every Deputy here and every member of a local authority finds that it is impossible or at least it is very difficult, when a draft plan is produced for a local authority, for elected members of the local authority to delve into a voluminous plan and to familiarise themselves with all the provisions of it but I think it is necessary to do this. In other words, if the elected representatives do not do this they cannot very well grumble when the plan has been adopted, a plan with many of the provisions of which they may quarrel.</P>
    <P>This is a very lengthy document.  It gives the Department's and the Minister's views on development along arterial roads, that is, ribbon development, pollution, and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people helped Dublin Corporation out of existence, did they not?  I would hope that when the new development plans are produced by the various local authorities they will be first of all generally acceptable to the people, but here again if prohibitions are to be imposed and if conservation and development are to go ahead, there must be regulations.  In regard to regulations it is impossible to please all the people all the time and I do not think anyone would try to do this.</P>
      <P>As the Minister announced, the 1963 Planning Act will be amended by the 1969 Planning Bill.  In the light of the operation of the planning legislation we find it is possible and desirable to improve the legislation.  The Minister proposes to bring in a new Bill and to abolish the procedure of appeals to the Minister.  Dealing with planning appeals is a heavy job.  More than 2,500 appeals are received annually in the Department&mdash;this forms about one-tenth of the planning applications received throughout the country. We should and must improve the procedures.  There have been delays and in the new legislation we will try to shorten the period between the time of application and when the applicant gets permission to carry out the development work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies are familiar with what happens.  A person makes application to the local authority.  There is provision in the Act that statutory notice of four weeks must be given.  He cannot <Col N="2445" /> get planning permission before this and unless there is some query in regard to the matter the applicant must get permission before the expiration of two months.  If he is granted planning permission a third party may appeal to the Minister and he can also request an oral hearing.  The oral hearing and the appeal can take quite a while.  I would envisage that in the new legislation there should be some method of reducing that delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is envisaged in the new legislation that a board would take the place of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a welcome change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it would be a welcome change to the Minister because getting through 2,500 planning appeals yearly is no joke, as well as having to listen to all kinds of accusations. In the past year I have dealt with about 1,300 planning appeals and there have been few criticisms of the decisions taken.  In general, whether it is a board, a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary who deals with the matter, each will try to do his best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with planning applications the local fire authorities give their advice; in other words, when an application is made for planning permission the local authority fire officer is asked to advise on the fire prevention provisions and on whether a proposed building constitutes a fire hazard. Generally these officials do a fine job. In most new buildings there is adequate provision for fire prevention by way of fire escapes and the fire-proofing of ground floor and second floor ceilings. Even though the fire authority may have ensured that an hotel has all the proper fire safety measures, it sometimes happens that there is no indication in the hotel regarding the location of the fire escapes or the fire hoses.  This matter should be rectified because it is necessary that the public should know the location of fire escapes and fire hoses.  They should be informed on this <Col N="2446" /> matter by way of notice in the hotel or by some other means.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of unauthorised development, namely, development without planning permission.  This happens in the case of conversion of houses to flats, discotheques and other such places.  In many cases the premises are old buildings which are converted into flats without permission or supervision by the fire authorities.  It is quite possible that the old wiring remains and this constitutes a fire hazard.  This kind of development is occurring in the cities and in the larger towns.  There have been a number of fires in flats and I urge local authorities to ensure that where there has been unauthorised development the problems created by this development will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Another matter that must be considered is how much development will be allowed.  This is a problem occupying the minds of various bodies.  We must, I think, allow a certain amount of development in areas which are now designated non-development areas. With the operation of the five-day week, the 4½ day week, and so on, the demand for the unspoilt rural areas will become more intensive.  The cities of Western Europe are very polluted and the tendency will be to try to get away from these polluted areas to undeveloped areas.  I attended a planning conference in Bonn last year and a suggestion was made there that, instead of bringing more workers into the over-populated and over-polluted cities of Western Europe, the reverse should be the pattern; the industries and the development should be brought to the areas where the people already are.  These are some of the problems of planning and conservation.  We should be very much alive to them. We should have a continuing interest in planning, development and conservation. As I said earlier, every year should be not alone a conservation year but a development year as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The very long contributions to this debate indicate the importance of this Estimate.  We had a long introductory speech from the Minister but despite its length, I could see no evidence of any great <Col N="2447" /> change in the attitude of the Minister and his Department.  The Minister's difficulties are appreciated.  He has a great many functions.</P>
      <P>My first criticism is the fact that the Department's priorities are completely wrong.  Everybody realises that housing is the most important function of the Department since a house is a basic essential for every family in our community.  If the Minister dropped all his other activities for one year and introduced legislation here for a crash housing programme he would have my full support and, I am sure, the support of every Deputy in this House.  I heard Deputy O'Connell point out how difficult it is without first-hand experience to get any idea of the misery, the mental anguish and the problems of those living in hovels.  I understand he has visited people in his constituency living in very bad housing conditions.  I have had similar experience in my own constituency.</P>
      <P>Both at local authority level and here in this House there are members who questioned the provision of the money for water, sewerage, swimming pools, public conveniences, and so on. Last month at a meeting of Cork County Council the provision of money for a swimming pool in a certain village came up for discussion.  I objected to the provision of that money and some people put the wrong interpretation on my objections.  In the area in which this swimiming pool was to be provided there are people living in caravans.  It is very little consolation to tell a woman with young children that she has a public convenience across the way which cost the ratepayers and the tax-payers £3,000, or that she has a swimming pool down the road which cost up to £100,000, but there is not sufficient money to put her, her husband and her children into a proper house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is really sincere in tackling this problem he should concentrate on it and leave his other functions to one side.  If he did that he would have my full support.  I know a family, husband, wife and three children, who have been living in a caravan for the last three years.  They are on the housing <Col N="2448" /> list for approximately three years. The system where housing is concerned is too cumbersome and people like this get tired of waiting for houses.  I have made representations on behalf of this family but I have made very little progress.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to put housing at the top of the list.  I know that other amenities are essential, but the most essential of all and the most basic requirement of any family is a proper home.  It is frustrating visiting these people and knowing one can do very little for them.  I am very familiar with the housing problem in my constituency because, like Deputy O'Connell, I have visited these people.  Often a young married couple will approach one to put them on the housing list. One asks the housing authority to send them an application form to fill in and send on to the manager.  Their current housing position will then be examined and they will be put on a waiting list. I shall never accept from any Minister or manager of a local authority that it should take so much time.  We have people in Cork who are four, five or six years on the housing list.  Somebody applies and qualifies under a housing survey.  Between the date he qualifies and the date sanction is given by the Department that case will have travelled up and down between the authority and the Custom House very many times.  The delay is inexcusable.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister interrupting a Deputy on this side saying this matter would be dealt with in the reorganisation of local authorities.  I hope this is so but I have looked through the memorandum on the subject from the Department and I see no specific reference to giving more autonomy or authority in decision-making to local authorities.  Local authorities with their technical staff are far more familiar with the housing situation in their functional area than the Custom House staff.  This is no reflection on the Custom House people but it is not necessary that every decision in relation to a housing scheme should be sanctioned in the Custom House.  It would expedite the provision of houses and streamline the system making it much more effective if members and <Col N="2449" /> technical staffs of local authorities had authority to provide houses without intervention by the Custom House.</P>
    <P>What we as well as the Minister and his Department should do is try to induce people to build their own houses. To a family their house is their palace and the wife particularly will be more interested if living in her own house. This would relieve the local authority of the burden of providing houses.  We should have a scheme to provide loans at a very much reduced rate of interest, if not interest free, to people building their own houses.  The Minister may ask how and why you should provide interest-free loans.  I believe such loans should be provided for those who qualify in a housing survey and are on the council's list for rehousing.  This is the only way in which we can wipe out the backlog in respect of local authority houses.  At present young people getting married are forced into flats at exorbitant rents up to £5 or £6 a week and this brings them no nearer having their own house.  If we could induce them and encourage them to build their own houses it would be more economic and would be a wiser course for them.  I believe this is a necessary provision.  I am very keen on encouraging people to provide their own houses.</P>
    <P>There is a problem, a great problem, in regard to the provision of land for housing sites.  I welcome very much what the Parliamentary Secretary said is envisaged in the new Planning Act where the Minister will no longer set himself up as judge and jury on who should get planning permission and who should not.  Planning has a big bearing on the provision of houses. Local authorities can play a part here because they should be engaged in buying land near settlement areas, near towns and villages where housing is envisaged.  The land should be available fully serviced so that when somebody, particularly those on the housing list, are induced to build their own houses, sites will be available.  When such people through relatives or friends secure a cheap housing site and apply for planning permission the planning authority will say: &ldquo;No, you cannot get permission for this site because <Col N="2450" /> it infringes the Planning Act provisions.&rdquo; Nobody complains about the application of the Planning Act, which is necessary.  But hardship can be created.  I believe that a local authority, when they refuse permission to people building their own houses on their own sites, should be able to say: &ldquo;We have a fully serviced site nearby at a reasonable price where we can grant planning permission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Act, I think, providing that a son or daughter of a landowner is entitled to planning permission but there are many people who will buy land from some relative cheaply.  Then they find the cost of a site where planning permission is available is beyond their means.  We should have a more humane approach in such cases.  I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that even though planning is necessary local authority members and planners should consider the human aspect of planning and take into consideration the circumstances he mentioned.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees that planning is necessary.  In fact, we were not quick enough in producing a Planning Act and controlling development so as to preserve beauty spots particularly in the southern coastal area where speculators were quickly off the mark in putting up buildings that would not be allowed under the Planning Act.</P>
    <P>In Cork County Council we are at present in the process of producing a new plan.  We are going over the old plan which in its application was rather rigid.  A sub-committee of the council is now examining the old plan and producing a new one.  The elected members of the local authority are, in fact, the planning authority; they provide the plan and turn it over to the technical staff under the manager for implementation.  I think it is necessary that any member of a local authority should have access to all the files in relation to planning.  They should be able to go into an office and say: &ldquo;I want to see such-and-such a fellow's report, I want to see the file and I want to examine it in detail.&rdquo;  This might inconvenience the office staff but it is very necessary if one is interested in somebody who has made a planning application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear this because in my opinion not alone should justice be done as far as planning is concerned, it should be seen to be done.  Members should at least have access to the files and the reports particularly when planning is refused.  One of the objections to planning is that one cannot create access to a main arterial road.  We should have far more development along our main arterial roads.  Between Cork city and Macroom town there is only one area in which housing development has been allowed along that 25-mile stretch of road.  There are people anxous to build their own houses on the main road and for that reason we should have more areas where planning is allowed.  I am opposed to sprawling or ribbon development but I feel it is necessary to allow development along main arterial roads where a speed limit operates and where services would be provided.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with some other problems in relation to housing.  Not only is it necessary to increase grants for new houses, it is necessary to increase reconstruction grants which have not kept abreast with rising costs.  I do not know when the £340 maximum reconstruction grant was introduced but it certainly needs to be increased because the cost of materials and the cost of building is such that the grant is no longer relevant to the cost of improving or reconstructing a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" /> It is encouraging to see an increase in the number of people reconstructing and improving their houses.  Whilst people are now more conscious of amenities like water and sewerage facilities every encouragement should be given to them to carry out improvements. This brings me to a point about which I feel very strongly and about which I have a criticism to make &mdash; the provision of group water schemes.  In my own area a number of schemes have got off the ground in the last 12 months.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the amount of community co-operation required if a scheme is to get off the ground. In Cork county we have people who have paid money since 1965 and still no work has been done on the scheme. This has happened because there is no co-operation between the local authority engineers and the Department's inspectors and engineers.  I can remember asking the Minister's predecessor if he would allow his inspectors to come to meetings in order to discuss schemes of mutual interest. I cannot understand why the then Minister refused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am almost certain this is being done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  We had a very recent experience in Cork where not alone did we write to the Minister's office but the officials got on the telephone on the day of the meeting, because of the schemes which were held up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not attend meetings but they can and do attend at county council offices to discuss with applicants any problems which they may have.  It is being done in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pay a tribute to the officials in Cork because they are hard working and under-staffed but are not allowed to come to meetings. All we ask is that they be allowed to attend two meetings a year so that we can discuss schemes of mutual interest. In the case of the Ovens group water scheme the supply is to be taken along the main arterial road.  After the <Col N="2453" /> money had been paid by the members of the group the county council engineers demanded a sum of £2,000 to put the road back into repair after the scheme had been completed.  Every member of the southern housing committee of the Cork County Council is aware of this.  They have all expressed their concern and disgust at the fact that the Minister refused to allow his inspectors to attend meetings where they would be confronted with the engineers of Cork County Council and where a compromise could be worked out so that the scheme could go ahead. Instead we have the engineers of Cork County Council on the one side and the engineers of the group water scheme on the other and there is no compromise and no dialogue and as a result the group members who would benefit from the scheme are still waiting for the engineers to iron out their difficulties and their differences so that the scheme can start.</P>
      <P>In another case the Department's inspectors wanted to take a scheme across private property.  The members again paid up their money.  The council engineer objected because the water was coming from a local council scheme.  For 12 months nothing more has been done because the Minister will not allow his inspectors to come in to discuss the scheme.  I remember going on a deputation to the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor and when we discussed it with him he said, &ldquo;I think you have a very good case, I think we should allow this and I will talk to the Minister about it.&rdquo;  That happened one and a half years ago and nothing has been done since.  There are houses in this country which will never have running water except through a group scheme and for that reason it is very necessary to have dialogue and co-operation between the local authority engineers and the Department's inspectors. Would the Parliamentary Secretary have this re-examined, let commonsense prevail and allow his inspectors to attend meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>They do attend at county council offices where they can meet engineers, applicants and councillors and discuss any schemes in the area.  This already is possible and is <Col N="2454" /> being done.  I agree that the provision of more group schemes is necessary and we have had a 300 per cent increase over the past couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because the people have come to realise that there are areas that will never have a water supply except through a group scheme. The Minister's inspectors are not allowed into the meetings in Cork. They have access to the offices but there is no hope of getting the two sets of engineers together with the members so that they can have a discussion and reach a compromise.  The Minister has refused this time and again and this creates a problem.  If the Parliamentary Secretary doubts this he should get on to the council office in Cork or to his Department's office there and he will be told that this is the situation. There is also the problem that where the provision of a group scheme is held up people are not allowed grants for private installations for the sinking of pumps, because there is a group scheme envisaged in the area.  I agree with that if the group scheme can be expedited.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of what I have said and if he has any doubt about its validity he should get on to the office and he will be told the true position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Road Fund I can never understand why we cannot be notified prior to the estimates meeting of the Cork County Council the amount of road grant we are to get. The Minister knows that it is mandatory that the rate should be struck by a certain date.  Last year our members refused to strike the rate until the last day.  They wanted to be informed by the Minister the amount of money which was to be given to us for that particular year.  The Minister refused to inform us.  We met and by a vote it was decided to strike the rate.  If we refused to strike a rate the council would be abolished.  Three weeks later we were informed by the Minister for Local Government that the road grant had been reduced by £68,600.  The engineers had prepared their estimates. They had gone out to the roads and discussed with their assistant county engineers what was demanded in the different areas.  In Cork we have about <Col N="2455" /> 50 assistant county engineers.  All this was done in anticipation of the road grant being the same as it was the previous year.  The shock came three weeks later when we had struck the rate and had budgeted for the year. The engineers in view of the reduction in the road grant, had to go back over the work they had done.  Can anybody tell me what is the idea?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister inform the House why local authorities are not notified well in advance of the estimates meeting the amount of money that is available to the county council from the Road Fund?  Otherwise the council is working in the dark, striking a rate which is not realistic, a rate which is based on what the road grant was for the previous year.</P>
    <P>This is the second time in four years that the road grant to Cork County Council has been drastically reduced. The effect of the reduction means the disemployment, if we are to accept the manager's assessment, of approximately 50 road workers.  This is a very serious situation.  Some workers thought it was so serious that a deputation should visit the Taoiseach.  We are still waiting for that.  I believe that there will be very little result.  Fifty men who have given service to the council, some of them for many years, will now be made redundant.  To add to that we are in Cork county &mdash; I voted against it and will continue to oppose it &mdash; recruiting area supervisors to assist the local engineers at a cost to the county of up to £50,000 a year.  The whole thing is crazy.  The Department of Local Government have expressed their interest in providing for the engineers helpers known as area supervisors.  This is a colossal cost to the county particularly when the Road Fund was reduced to such an extent that we have to let 50 road workers go.</P>
    <P>At our estimates meeting this year the rate went up by approximately 25s in the £.  This was a colossal increase. We on this side of the House have been saying for a long time that the present rating system is completely out-dated and has no relationship whatever to the ability of individual ratepayers to pay.  This demands attention.  Rates at present are creating <Col N="2456" /> terrible hardship for people trying to meet their demands.  Some of them find it almost impossible.  There are many people who are living on social welfare, widows and people with small incomes, people whose business was completely taken away from them in towns and villages by the introduction of big combines and supermarkets and they are still paying the full rate on their houses.  The Minister should have a look at this.  There is great hardship in the case of a person who in the past had a reasonably good business from a small shop and was able to meet the demands made on him but the introduction of the supermarket took away his livelihood and he is now not in a position to pay his rates.  Rates are continuing to rise with little improvement in the services.  All members of local authorities are innundated with people asking them to get them time to pay their rates.  I do not know what the answer is but I know that people are groaning under the burden of continually rising rates.  We are coming to the stage when, unless the rating system is changed completely, it will be almost impossible to collect the rates.  In Cork most of the rates are collected through the council's office and great difficulty is experienced in trying to get the rates from the people.  This must be tackled. It is creating tremendous hardship for small shopkeepers and people living in private houses.</P>
    <P>Together with the serious reduction in the amount of money which the Department are paying to the local authorities, there are rising rates and a spate of increased valuations.  In some cases valuations have been increased by almost 500 per cent.  People are finding it very difficult to meet the demands made on them.  I had a case recently where the valuation of a premises went up from £17 10s to £98. This is not unique.  In the past 12 months the number of people whose valuations have been increased in Cork county was unusually large to say the least of it.  I want to refer now to the housing of itinerants.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister.  He is a young Minister and when he was first <Col N="2457" /> appointed to this very responsible position he expressed concern for these people.  He has done more for them than any other Minister.  He was sincere about re-housing itinerants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give credit where credit is due.  This met with the approval of everybody concerned.  If we are to succeed in rehabilitating or re-integrating these people into the community we must have community involvement.  We must encourage people to take an interest in the re-housing of itinerants.  There is no point in putting a number of itinerant families into one area.  When they are being rehoused this development must have the goodwill of the people of the area.  This is the only way in which we can solve this terrible problem.  They must be provided with a house in an area where the people will welcome them, mix with them, talk to them and get them involved in the community spirit.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council were the first authority to provide a number of social workers who were specially assigned to this type of work.  When an itinerant family are housed in an area and accepted in the area, the local authorities are inclined to house more itinerant families there.  I think this is wrong.  Those families must be dispersed in different areas.  That is very necessary if this very desirable work is to be effective.  We must have the goodwill of the people concerned.  There are areas in which people object to this development. I think they object because they do not want to have more than one itinerant family in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter which has been mentioned to me on a number of occasions is the derating of land within urban areas. This should be tackled.  It is long overdue. In reply to a Parliamentary Question by me the Minister said that land within urban areas is regarded as building land.  This is not so.  There is some land within the urban areas which could not be put in that category. Smallholders living solely on farms within urban areas are not benefiting from the derating scheme which operates outside the urban areas.  The <Col N="2458" /> Minister should consider this point.</P>
    <P>We have another problem in Cork to which some of the time of this House was devoted in recent years, that is, the extension of the Cork borough boundary. I can remember one day when we voted a number of times against the extension of the boundary.  The last time the boundary was extended was in 1965.  We had a discussion in this House and, following arbitration, the amount of compensation was fixed and is still being paid to Cork County Council on the instalment system.  At present there are rumblings from corporation members, officials and people in responsible positions about a further extension of the borough boundary.  I want to express my view in strong terms.  The Minister should not agree to any further extension of the Cork borough boundary.  We must have a city which is containable.  At the moment the traffic problems and the housing problems are acute.  Rather than extending the boundary and extending the functions of Cork Corporation we should be building satellite towns in places like Carrigaline, Ballincollig, Blarney, Midleton, Cobh and Youghal.  The towns around the hinterland of the city should be strengthened and improved.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is in relation to the re-structurng or reorganisation of the local authorities.  I concede that certain changes are necessary but I would not agree for a moment that local authorities should be done away with.  I know that the rules of order do not allow me to refer in detail to the setting up of the regional health boards but my opinion is that they will not work.  I would be opposed to anything on those lines suggested by the Department.  While there is nothing specific in the memorandum that came from the Department, there are suggestions and hints, and one never knows what the Department have in mind.</P>
    <P>I know that some of the town and urban councils throughout the country have very little to do.  They should be given greater powers and have complete control and complete authority so far as decision making is concerned.  In their own way, members of local <Col N="2459" /> authorities are social workers.  In the absence of any information centre or bureau to inform the people of what they are entitled to, the local authorities are necessary.  All members of local authorities &mdash; whether it is a county council, an urban council or a town council &mdash; appreciate that every day of the week people are inquiring about what they are entitled to and asking them to fill out forms and advise them on what they should do when they are applying for any of the services which are available.</P>
    <P>If changes are necessary, and I believe they are, those people should be given more autonomy and more power in decision making.  If we are to have a system such as that which is in operation in relation to health, time will prove that it will be a complete failure. So far as regionalisation is concerned we have gone completely mad.  If the Minister had anything to offer I would wish him to be more specific than what he was in producing the memorandum that was circulated.  Local authorities are providing a good service for the people whom they represent.</P>

      <P>In introducing the Estimate, the Minister for Local Government made an exceptionally long statement.  On behalf of my colleagues here we welcome this in itself. That is to say, we welcome the fact that the Minister, unlike, perhaps, some of his colleagues, has endeavoured to take this House into his confidence, has explained to us his problems as Minister and what is his approach to them. We are glad also that the Parliamentary Secretary has added some important elements to that statement.</P>
      <P>We have many criticisms both in relation to the Estimate and to the Minister's speech but I should like to make it clear at the outset that we are not criticising the Minister personally except to the extent that he may not yet have brought to his important office enough of the new-broom approach that is needed so much there but which, in certain areas, he has tried to bring in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Government have been in office for as long as the present Government, it is inevitable that not only <Col N="2460" /> among the Cabinet but also among those who administer decisions, there should grow a certain amount of complacency and this has happened in respect of Local Government as has been reflected in the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke, speaking of the Minister's speech, said that it made history. I think he was referring to the length of the statement.  However, Deputy Moore went a good deal further and said as reported at column 1270 of the Dáil Debates for the 9th June, 1971:</P>
    <P>When one considers the Minister's introductory speech on this Estimate and the tremendous evidence in it of planning at every stage I feel sure it will be regarded as a classical reference work on local government.</P>
    <P>It is seldom that we say kind things about each other in this House but we have no objection at all to this kind of comment.  At the same time, it seems to us that a classic reference work on local government is not exactly what most people need from the Department at this time.  According to the lowest computation which is the Department's own, there are over 8,000 applicants for local authority houses. We think the correct figure is much higher than that.  Many of these people have been on the waiting list for a long time and they are not looking for a classic on local government.  They are looking for a house.  The same applies to many other people &mdash; those, for intance, who wish to purchase houses, but who have been deterred and disappointed by the increase in housing costs and by the increases in deposits. Again, these people do not want a graceful and rounded statement on the subject.  They want an answer to their problems.  The same applies, too, to those who are bewildered and distressed by the operation of the differential rents scheme.  I would say there are more of these than the Minister is prepared to allow for.  Another source of distress to many people, particularly in Dublin city, is the lack of adequate amenities in houses.  I know that the Minister is concerned personally with this problem and here, again, I should say that what we must direct ourselves to is not the Minister's personal attitude but the Minister's <Col N="2461" /> attitudes in conjunction with the habits of the Government of which he is a member and the habits of the Department which he must administer.</P>
    <P>Again, people concerned with the pollution of our waters and air, particularly in Dublin city, are not concerned with words or the arrangement of words but, of course, they are interested in what Deputy Moore refers to as the &ldquo;tremendous evidence of planning at every stage which is reflected in the Minister's speech&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We, in the Labour Party, believe in planning and we believe also in adequate studies for planning and in action on the basis of these studies. However, we are not happy in regard to the relation of these various elements as they are reflected in the Minister's speech.  In this context I should like to give some examples but to do so it will be necessary for me to quote from several parts of the Minister's speech.  If the House will bear with me, I shall have to quote from a number of sections, the point being that we regard them as having something in common.</P>
    <P>The common element seems to us to be the putting off of the evil hour or, in other words, passing the buck.  We may be wrong in this view in relation to some of these and the Minister may be able to indicate to us that we are so wrong but it seems to us that the quotations to which I shall refer reflect a common pattern and that that pattern is a disturbing one.  It is a pattern that shows a dilatory tendency in relation to urgent problems.  The Minister himself may well be concerned about this.  I would refer back to what I said earlier about a distinction between the present incumbent of an office and the traditions of a Department and of a Government.  All my quotations for this section of my remarks will be from the Minister's speech, that is from the Official Report, volume 254 of 27th May and I will give the column references.</P>
    <P>The first matter I should like to mention is the question of land for building.  This is a matter on which, as the Minister will know, the Labour Party have laid considerable emphasis. We all know, and the Minister emphasises this, that the main block in <Col N="2462" /> the way of housing our people adequately is a financial one.  We also know that a main component in this has been the price of land for development. Of course the price of land, as we all know, skyrockets once it is known that it is going to be used for development purposes.  We in the Labour Party advocate a quite clear method for dealing with this, that the purchase of land for development purposes should be entirely in the hands of the local authorities and the price of the land should be fixed by reference to its previous use and not just by reference to its development potential. That is a clear-cut policy.  What has the Minister's speech got to say? At column 445 he said:</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted the appointment by me of a committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny, to inquire into the problem of the cost of land for building.</P>
    <P>We would like to have it noted that this problem has been there for quite a long time and that people outside the Government have been drawing attention to this urgent problem for quite a long time but it is only now, in 1971, that this Government get round even to setting up a committee to study the problem.  So, although this is in our view welcome to some degree in that they are paying some attention to the problem that the Minister's predecessor seemed to ignore, it is still a very belated measure.  The Minister goes on:</P>
    <P>This problem was under examination in my Department for some time but it was not found possible to devise a practical, workable solution.</P>
    <P>This again seems very strange.  Here we have a large, well-financed, well-equipped, Department and available to it the services of a research unit which Ministers for Local Government are in the habit of praising annually, An Foras Forbartha, and yet, although they think the problem is soluble, since it has been referred to a committee, they have not been able to see a solution for it.  What kind of strange paralysis is this?  How did they get themselves into this position and why <Col N="2463" /> do they think a commission will be able to solve what they with their resources have not been able to resolve? We would like to know the answer to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government have been acutely conscious of the problem and wish to pursue the search for a solution, treating the matter as an issue of urgent public importance.</P>
    <P>It was an issue of urgent public importance, as we pointed out, at least two years ago, and long before that, but it was greatly emphasised two years ago, and the Government's way of treating it as an issue of urgent public importance is to set up a committee to look at it now.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>While I am aware of the difficulties involved, I hope that the committee, under their eminent chairman, may be able to find a solution within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long the Kenny Committee will be expected to take in finding this solution which has evaded the combined resources of the Department all these years but we hope it will not be out of proportion because this is a very urgent problem.</P>
    <P>I suppose we may infer from the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny that perhaps, although the Department presumably have already legal advice available to them, what they are concerned with and what they think the committee may solve which they have not solved is the possible constitutional issue.  This, of course was frequently referred to by the Minister's predecessor. When questions were put to him on this point the Minister's predecessor used always say that nationalisation of land, as he used to put it &mdash; we thought it a rather distorted way of summarising our proposals on this matter&mdash;might be unconstitutional.  I wonder how long we are to stand paralysed on this question before it is put beyond doubt whether it may be unconstitutional or not.  No decision can be made on that issue by any Department, by any Deputy or even I would think by the Kenny Commission, <Col N="2464" /> but is it not possible for the Government to decide what they think equitably and properly should be done about the purchase of land and then put the question to the body which has the ultimate decision on this matter, which is the Supreme Court?  Is there no way of doing this?  If the Government think that the measures which it might be proper to take might conceivably be repugnant to the Constitution can they not in some way invoke or obtain a decision &mdash; I do not know through what legal channels, I am not a lawyer &mdash; but it seems commonsense that the Supreme Court surely tries as the Government do, to apply commonsense. Surely it should be possible to determine this issue in some way or another, even if necessary by putting through a Bill and having that tested then?  But we do not think that this should be left in the air as it has been for so long as a problem that has apparently baffled all the best brains in the Department and then has to be referred at this extremely late date to a new committee which will report, we do not know when.  And, again, another thing we do not know is what the Government will do with that report when the Kenny Committee have reported.  Will they, perhaps, act on it or will they perhaps get the reactions of somebody else to it or refer it to some other group or in general keep it hanging in the air?</P>
    <P>Let us see what they are doing with other things.  I think there is certain pattern in these adjournments of decisions and indecisions.  In referring to the steps he was taking in dealing with the problem of controlling water and air pollution the Minister said at column 452.</P>
    <P>A significant development in this respect was the recent establishment of a working group representative of all Government Departments concerned to examine and report to me on the nature and extent of all air and water pollution problems, the different remedial strategies that might be adopted, the cost of these strategies...</P>
    <P>The working group have commenced their examination of these problems and I am confident that <Col N="2465" /> they will report without undue delay.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can be satisfied here with that &ldquo;without undue delay&rdquo; because while the working group are deliberating&mdash;and again they were set up at a late date when the pollution problem was far advanced &mdash; the problem is still growing and it has been growing of course, particularly in the city of Dublin which is most accutely affected, as every Dublin Deputy and even those Deputies who are obliged, as all Deputies are, to spend some part of their time in Dublin, very well know.  So, I should like to ask the Minister whether when such a working group is set up a definite date cannot be laid down for them to finish their work and report to the Minister when we have an urgent problem of this kind?  We do not want to be misunderstood on this.  We are not urging action without study.  Where studies are needed they should be initiated promptly, as was not the case either with the Kenny Committee or in regard to this problem.  There should be a definite time limit and when the results are in the Government should make up their minds about what they want to do.  These are problems all of which need action &mdash; not just study.</P>
    <P>In regard to water pollution we are told that Dublin Corporation have retained a firm of international standing to advise them on the project in order to ensure that the effluent from the treatment works will be of an acceptable standard.  We are told that when the new treatment works come into commission the condition of Dublin Bay should be improved noticeably. I would hope this would be so.  As many Deputies know, Dublin Bay is in a filthy condition.  We all have experience of this; we have experience of it where I live, particularly in regard to the far side of Howth.  Anyone who is engaged in the study of this problem should take a daily swim in a suitable area in the bay, or beyond the bay at a place such as Balscaddan.</P>
    <P>Let us take a more advanced example of a study, followed by more study, followed by prolonged inaction. I refer to the Buchanan Report which has become something of a scandal. The responsibility for this goes far <Col N="2466" /> beyond one Minister.  Let me cite some of the references to this in the Minister's statement.  At column 464, Volume 254 of the Official Report, for 27th May, 1971, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Buchanan Report is one view, by independent United Nations consultants, of what the framework for regional development might be. The Government are determined that there should be adequate opportunity for other views to be aired and for the implications of the Buchanan recommendations to be examined before policy is determined as regards objectives for development at the regional level.</P>
    <P>Even before objectives have been decided it appears we will need a great deal of further study and reference.</P>
    <P>The Buchanan Commission were set up in October, 1966, and were invited to study the matter.  The Commission reported in 1968 and the report has neither been acted upon nor rejected since that time.  It is still being pushed around among various people to get their reactions &mdash; reactions which are predictable in many cases.  The Minister has stated that very serious consideration must be given to the kind of action recommended in the report.  Various organisations have been invited to make known their views and conclusions on how a programme for regional development should be approached in their region.  At column 467, Volume 254 of the Official Report for 27th May, 1971, the Minister states:</P>
    <P>The procedure I have described takes time, considerable time.  No apology need be made for this.</P>
    <P>Surely it must be clear that if more time elapses the contours of the problem which the commission examined will have changed.  Already they have changed to some extent since 1968 and if this study continues for much longer the problem will no longer be the problem originally studied.  Will we then have another United Nations commission to look into the matter?</P>
    <P>This is serious in its implications not only in relation to the Buchanan Report but in relation to the credibility of any other study the Government <Col N="2467" /> may commission.  It is necessary and desirable to commission a study and this study covered an important range of topics.  However, if the study when completed is passed round to an indefinite number of people and nothing happens, one may suspect that the Government are reluctant for political reasons to take action and that the simplest way out is to stall.  Stalling in the guise of study is something Opposition Deputies think it their duty to expose.</P>
    <P>The White Paper is relevant in this matter.  At column 477, volume 254 of the Official Report the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I repeat that the White Paper is intended to provoke public discussion and to serve as a basis for consultation with interests concerned. Constructive comments on the proposals, from whatever source, will be welcomed and taken into account before final decisions are made as to the changes which should be affected.</P>
    <P>Later the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>It was for this reason that the White Paper itself asked that comments should be submitted before the end of April, 1971.  I received, however, a number of requests from local authorities and other bodies to extend this date and, in order to meet these requests as far as possible, I decided to extend the date by two months, i.e., until 30th June, 1971.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that by the end of this time a decision would be made but the Minister has stated that at the end of this period he hopes to hold discussions with local representatives throughout the country in regard to the White Paper.  I do not know if the Minister will correct me on this, but I would infer that it is not likely that the kind of proposals contained in the White Paper will be in force before the next local elections.  The Minister does not correct that assumption so I take it it would not be an improbable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I could produce many references in regard to local finance.  At column 479, Volume 254 of the Official Report the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The comprehensive investigations and reviews which have been in progress are, of course, a necessary preliminary in any major overhaul of the system of local finance and taxation.</P>
      <P>There are similar passages about votes at 18 and about roads but I do not need to elaborate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should like to emphasise that we are not against adequate, competent study of any problem, nor are we against consultation.  We are against study and consultation as an alibi for indecision, inaction and for shelving the problem.  That has happened in the case of the Buchanan Report and we have reason to fear it will happen in relation to the wide variety of other issues on which the Minister commented in his speech.  We have the right to make these comments at this stage.  Fianna Fáil have been in government for nearly 14 years and they have had control of the important Department of Local Government. They have had time to adjust to change, to be able to predict changing trends, to set up studies where studies are needed at an early phase in the development of the problem.  Certainly studies in pollution in the Dublin area might well have been initiated five years ago &mdash; I would say ten years ago, or even longer &mdash; and when we find a study mounted at this late stage in the evolution of a problem we have some reason.  I am afraid, to doubt the <i>bona fides</i> of this movement because any decision is, of course, likely to involve two things.  It involves an unpleasant tension of political choice &mdash; I am speaking of electoral areas &mdash; and it costs money.  There will be a certain amount of pressure on any Government to stall, to avoid these unpleasant dilemmas, not to meet them, and to advance some plausible reason for not meeting them.  There are two plausible reasons &mdash; one is study and the other is consultation.  The present Government <Col N="2469" /> have made and are making an altogether excessive use of these two pretexts and in a way which tends to discredit the very idea of study.  I think it was General de Gaulle who said that to govern is to choose.  A way of refraining from choosing is by continuing to study and consult.  That is also a way of refraining from governing. We think this way of dealing with things fits into the general pattern of this Government's activity and inactivity.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into details about other matters.  I would not be permitted to do so.  I should like to say, however, that this idea of flying a kite and then hauling it down again &mdash; we have seen it so often in relation to prices and incomes, to education, to dole proposals, to community schools, and so on&mdash;does not encourage confidence when we are told about all these studies and consultations that are going on.  We do not think in those circumstances it is demagogic to say that, at this stage, after all these years in office, we ought to be seeing much more action and hearing much less about eventual studies and consultations.  We think the Taoiseach's first Government in this Dáil was a dangerous one.  We think his second is also dangerous in a different way, through hesitancies, postponements and the alibi of study and consultation.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something now about housing, especially housing in Dublin.  We have heard a great deal from the Government benches about &ldquo;Not to worry; the shortage of housing in Dublin is really a good thing because it reflects a growing city.  There will always be a problem in a growing city and Dubliners should be happy that their city is growing instead of complaining they have not got houses.&rdquo; This alibi, of course, would apply in reverse in areas in the country which are no longer populated; the people, such of them as remain, should be happy because they have houses and because there is no housing shortage instead of complaining about emigration and the denudation of the land. Surely here, as the Minister and his supporters have laid emphasis on planning, it should be taken into account <Col N="2470" /> that planning is a matter of keeping pace.</P>
    <P>The growth of Dublin city has nothing unpredictable or strange about it, certainly not to people who have been reading Buchanan for so long as the members of the Government have given themselves the opportunity to do so.  If there is a backlog, and there is a very large backlog, it cannot be attributed just to growth.  It must be attributed to the failure of planning to keep pace.  As we know, the backlog here was created, I think as a matter of deliberate economic policy, by this Government in the late fifties and early sixties when the government deliberately emphasised the housing problem. Those who are now homeless in Dublin city are homeless because of decisions taken at that time and the failure of the Government subsequently adequately to compensate for that policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement on the whole housing issue, and this applies also to the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary just now, was unduly complacent and anyone who represents a Dublin constituency has good reason to be aware of this.  We are well behind other countries, almost all countries indeed in Western Europe, and well behind Northern Ireland in this matter of housing.  We have fallen below Spain at the last count and in the number of new dwellings provided according to the figures published by the OECD in 1971, relating to an earlier period, we are shown to be ahead of Turkey only, with Greece, one of the poorest countries in Europe, building dwellings at twice our level. I am aware that statistics in regard to housing can be diversely applied.  I shall come back to that later.  There is the question of the type of units used. I think that, whatever juggling one might do with the details of the statistics, any candid Minister for Local Government would have to be aware and have to say that at the present time &mdash; I am not speaking of the past when we did place a great deal of emphasis on housing; the first Fianna Fáil Government certainly did in the thirties; we were then making a very big effort in this area, but we have <Col N="2471" /> allowed ourselves to fall well behind&mdash; we come very low in the European table in the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I am concerned.  It is the backlog in meeting the needs of the homeless which is used as an alibi for ignoring the reasonable needs of those who are already housed.  At column 438 of volume 254 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This means, for instance, that we cannot spend on subsidies for local authority houses money which we should be using for new construction. Persons living in houses of reasonable quality may have their grievances, but these can be nothing like as genuine and pressing as the grievances of families in slum conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not think that will do.  I do not think that a Government who have shelved the problem, a problem which the Kenny Committee are now going to study, have the resource of being able to say to people who are already housed: &ldquo;You are damn lucky to have a house and we are not going to worry about your problems&rdquo;.  This, in effect, is what they are saying because, they argue, the housing of the homeless is urgent.  That is the vicious circle in what the Government are saying and in what is implied in that statement by the Minister.  If this were pushed to its logical conclusion &mdash; and it is very near that now, as anybody who visits certain housing estates around Dublin can see &mdash; it would come very near the point where what we are doing is taking people out of old slums and putting them into what, as a result of neglect, will very soon become a new type of slum.  It is not enough to say that because some people are still houseless we can pay no attention to the needs of those already housed. Particularly, it is not enough if means for housing those who are not yet housed are not available in the form of laws which would reduce the price of development land and the Government are not pressing ahead with that matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to an attitude of mind which exists on the part of some officials in relation to this.  Officials, <Col N="2472" /> like other people, have different characters.  I have accompanied a number of deputations from my constituency to see members of Dublin Corporation at official level &mdash; the only level now existing &mdash; and we have been courteously received.  Tenants' grievances were discussed but almost always at some point in the discussion someone on the official side makes a remark to the general effect: &ldquo;You people are living in subsidised housing and you should be grateful for what you get&rdquo;.  That view, which is seldom as brutally or clearly stated as that, is present all the time and affects the general view on the matter.  I should like to come back later to the question of subsidy.</P>
    <P>We on these benches welcome the statement just made by the Parliamentary Secretary about the forthcoming legislation which, as I understood from him, will take the final decision on appeals for planning permission from the Minister and give it to a board. That is very welcome.  We were among those who criticised this power and some examples of the use of this power in Ministers' hands.  We think it would be a very positive element if the power is now transferred to an independent board, as I understood from the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be. Unfortunately, we must qualify our approval a little until we know more about these proposals in that we need to be satisfied that it will be a genuinely independent board.  I have a piece of legislation not directly relevant in its form to what we are discussing here &mdash; we shall be discussing it next week &mdash; and it is a proposal which purports to transfer responsibility from a Minister to a board.  Unfortunately, it is only too apparent from the provisions of the Bill in question that the transfer will be only an apparent one: the Minister will, in fact, exercise control through a board which will be entirely in his power, as would be the case with any board, being selected by the Government. Therefore, we would like to reserve, as indeed we must, our final comments on this matter until we know what kind of board this will be, what powers it will have and what guarantee there will be of its autonomy and whether <Col N="2473" /> its composition is such as to entitle it to the respect of the community without regard to party.  Assuming that will be the case &mdash; rather a large assumption at this point &mdash; we would welcome that development.</P>
    <P>I should like some elucidation about the kind of help which will be forthcoming for co-operative house-building associations of which there are now a considerable number.  There is one in my own area very near me and they were perturbed by the recent statement by the Minister on television, I believe in Limerick, about setting up a special section to deal with their needs and requests.  Those who saw me about this, while they welcomed it in principle, did not seem to feel that there were any signs of such a system being yet available to them practically and I would be grateful if the Minister would refer to this point in his concluding remarks.</P>
    <P>One big difficulty in regard to housing which has been mentioned by other speakers and is important in Dublin is that unless you have three children at least you have no chance of a local authority house at present.  Certainly, Dublin Deputies and, I suppose those in other parts of the country also, have had the unpleasant experience of listening to some harrowing tale told by somebody with one child, two children, or no children living in absolutely miserable and distressing conditions. Any Deputy who listens to such a story has to say at the end: &ldquo;I am sorry; you have absolutely no chance. Your chance of getting a house or any accommodation is simply nil.&rdquo;  The implications of this obviously are very serious.  Other countries &mdash; this I think is one reason for the odd divergencies in interpretation of international statistics on this matter &mdash; have a policy of providing different sizes of housing units, which seem to make sense, for different sizes of family units.  We agree that large families naturally require, from a commonsense point of view, larger housing units and also a considerable degree of priority but we think the provision of housing units should be such as to include smaller units.  At present the implication almost appears to be that if you have a smaller family than three children there must be something <Col N="2474" /> wrong and you do not deserve too much consideration.  We think this is altogether wrong and we hope the Minister will hold out some hope in these cases of introducing at least a small degree of diversification in the housing units available because there is virtually none at the moment.</P>
    <P>We all know the old story of brigand Procrustes' bed.  If one was too short for the bed he stretched one and if one was too long for the bed he cut off one's feet.  Our housing policy has been somewhat Procrustian in that way.  I have heard families say: &ldquo;We must hurry on with the third to qualify for a house&rdquo;.  There are very few countries in the world at the moment which operate in the direction of supplying incentives for larger families. I do not know whether that philosophy is involved here.  Most countries are concerned with the population explosion, as it is called, and this is one of the problems which does not, perhaps, come home to us very directly in that our population has been static for a long time.  It is, of course, static through emigration and many of the children growing up in the large housing estates will, in fact, emigrate so that we are contributing to the population explosion if not here then in other countries.  The policy of not providing houses for people with less than three children is surely ripe for review.</P>
    <P>Another point made by one or two other speakers which I should like to endorse is the question of people not knowing where they are on the list. I agree there will probably always be some measure of uncertainty, but the present uncertainty which we have here is total and is not paralleled in other countries and is a feature of the present somewhat paternalistic way of dealing with people who are in the category of being applicants for houses.</P>
    <P>Under the same head I should like to refer in the general area of Dublin to the question of transfers, that is to say a person living in one district adequately housed, according to the criteria which are being applied, but wishing to live elsewhere.  As far as I can see, almost no attention is paid to such wishes on this matter even in cases where a transfer would be possible. <Col N="2475" /> It does not seem to me that this is a question which one can brush aside by saying: &ldquo;There is a great backlog of homeless and we do not have time to deal with your problem&rdquo;. If somebody moves from one house to another there is still a house available so that alibi will not serve here.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this very wide area of Dublin who have as strong an attachment to a particular part of the Dublin area as people can have to a particular village or rural area outside and a considerable degree of hardship is caused by ignoring that fact.  I know that Howth people are attached &mdash; and this is true of many other urban areas &mdash; to the area from which they come and this is true in particular of women.  If they are transferred to a completely different area they tend to be unhappy and nervous unhappiness can result.  This kind of distress seems as far as I have been able to find out, to be treated as of no account by Dublin Corporation.  Possibly it is that the officials of Dublin Corporation are too hard pressed; possibly they have a rather old-fashioned attitude to the effect of nervous distress, particularly on women.  It is of no account.  In any case, it does seem that this kind of demand is quite simply brushed aside.</P>
    <P>Another problem which is acute in the new housing suburbs, which are the size of a good-sized provincial town, is the shortage of parks and playgrounds. This shortage is quite acute in my own constituency and I believe it is acute in others as well.  There is supposed to be a 10 per cent rule, that is to say, that 10 per cent of any new housing area shall be in open spaces but I should like to know whether that is now going to be changed because in his speech the Minister referred to an increasing density of houses.  I hope in his reply he will spell out a little more what he means by &ldquo;increasing density&rdquo;.  We realise the pressures there undoubtedly are for economy but the words &ldquo;increasing density&rdquo; strike an ominous note to anyone familiar with city conditions here at present.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent rule sounds good and sounds as though there ought to <Col N="2476" /> be quite adequate space for recreation and exercise for the children of Dublin and for the older people who also need usable open space.  Anyone who goes around Dublin at all knows that the usable open space is far less than 10 per cent.  A great deal of the 10 per cent, which is reputedly available as an amenity, consists of wedges of completely useless land, land which is even worse than useless as it tends to be used as a dumping ground and can become a health hazard.  Do I understand the Parliamentary Secretary is denying this is the case?</P>

Last year on the Supplementary Estimate when I raised this question of parks and playgrounds in Dublin city I was interrupted at that time by the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan, who was here a moment ago.

      <P>I made the point in reply that this put me in a difficulty.

      <P>I would be very happy to take the Parliamentary Secretary around areas of my constituency, if he would be willing to come with me, and show him what passes for open spaces in various areas and hear what the people have to say about them.</P>
      <P>My second point was that it happens that in the case of certain spokesmen on this issue, including the present Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, it is certainly no reproach to them or to anybody else, their main areas of experience are not in Dublin city. This might not matter very much and I am far from claiming that the Minister for Local Government or the Parliamentary Secretary must be a Dublin man.  I am not making this tribalistic assertion and I would not like to be misrepresented as so doing.  What I am saying is that it is an unfortunate situation when the elective representation of a great city, and Dublin is a great city, is abolished and it so happens that the parks which were nominally, to some extent at least, controlled by the corporation are handed over entirely to a great Government Department, the Department of Local Government, of which Dublin Corporation is effectively now a sub-Department, not in theory I know, but in practice.  The officials of Dublin Corporation are not answerable under God to anyone but the Minister for Local Government.  That is a fact and it is an unfortunate matter for the city in these circumstances that their affairs are decided for them by officials who may know little enough about Dublin as was certainly true in the case of the man who was speaking for the Minister on the previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2479" /> Dublin is something in itself.  Its problems, the scale of its problems, the quality of its problems, the quality of its existence are something a bit different from the rest of the country. It is at present locally disfranchised. That is an important matter and here I should like to quote from the White Paper.  The White Paper says some stirring things.  I am referring to Local Government Reorganisation, Appendix A, page 69.  The White Paper says some fine things about the management system as it should be and as it represents it as being.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Under the Management Acts, the functions of local authorities are divided into two classes &mdash; reserved functions performable only by the elected members, and executive functions, performable by the city or county manager by order.  While the law must make an exact division of functions (so that responsibility for their exercise may be clearly defined) it was never the intention that the elected members and the manager should operate independently of each other.  Both the reserved and executive functions of the local authority and the fact that the executive ones are assigned to the manager is simply intended to provide the elected council with an experienced, whole-time administrator for the prompt and efficient discharge of day-to-day business without making an undue demand on the time of the elected members.</P>
    <P>I will say this for Dublin city.  No undue demand is made on the time of the elected members.</P>
    <P>The manager is an officer of the county council or county borough corporation.  He is appointed by them ... and he may be suspended by them or removed from office with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The elected council are responsible for all policy decisions &mdash; including decisions on financial policy &mdash; and the manager must act in conformity with the general policy laid down by them.  In carrying out his duties, the manager operates under the general supervision of the council; he is expected to have regard to their wishes and even in the <Col N="2480" /> conduct of day-to-day affairs he can be overruled by them.  The elected members may require the manager to give them all the information in his possession or procurement on any business or transaction of the local authority.  In addition, they may at any time direct him to give them prior information about the manner in which he proposes to perform any specified executive function.</P>
    <P>That is a very fine definition of some kind of ideal relationship that there might be between elected members and a manager but what kind of meaning can it have for those of us who live in Dublin city?  Again, the Minister has spoken in the same vein at column 474. He said:</P>
    <P>It is essential, for these reasons, that we should have a live local government system&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;live&rdquo; presumably means with a democratic element in it &mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; with a sound structure and sound principles of operation.</P>
    <P>Amen.</P>

      <P>Indeed.  It is Volume 254 of 27th May, 1971.  I apologise for having inadvertently omitted that citation.  Frankly, reading that passage from the White Paper about what the relation of the manager to the elected members is, it is hard not to feel that there is an element of effrontery about that presentation when the capital city of this country, the only really large city in it, has remained for two years without any elected element in it at all and with its manager operating only under the remote control of a member of the Government and when, in fact, democracy in local affairs, as far as Dublin city is concerned, is suppressed and has been for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not agree with but we can understand the reason why the Minister took action on this in relation to the non-striking of a rate.  What seems to us indefensible is that, two years after that date, this city should still be without <Col N="2481" /> elected representation.  This seems to us altogether indefensible on the grounds set out by the Government in the White Paper.  How can the Minister reconcile &mdash; and I hope he will tell us how he can &mdash; the principles set out in the White Paper with his actual practice in relation to Dublin city?  We see in this way of dealing with the problem, that is to say the lip-service to the idea of elective democracy in local government and the actual application of a purely managerial system, yet another symptom of a general erosion in our democracy.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of pollution. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to this matter in his statement here this morning.  While some of the things he said were interesting and reassuring, I must say that I found others a little bit alarming.  He began by saying that he thought Conservation Year might have awakened the conscience of the people.  The Government are part of the people and they are the part of the people's conscience that most urgently needs to be awakened on this matter.  One looked to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, as to the Minister's also, for evidence that this was the case.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said &mdash; and I think on the whole this is rather alarming in this decade &mdash; that conservation and development conflict.  He seemed to me to be indicating that, where development and conservation conflicted, the needle would go down on the side of development.  This was a philosophical statement I would agree, and there is an element of truth in it but, as an indication of the Government's attitudes and preferences, it is something we need to be a little wary about.  In most countries and cities today, the view is growing that development and conservation have to be related, that is to say, that the kind of development which really sharply conflicts with conservation should be limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy was not listening to what I said.  I said it is the duty of those responsible to hold the balance.  It is not a question of the needle going down in favour of one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will forgive me if I say that it is precisely about those responsible that I have some doubts.  On the whole, the governmental emphasis has not been a very strongly conservationist one.  We see evidence of that all around us in our environment. What we would welcome would be a less hold-the-balance-even approach and a greater emphasis on conservation, a greater aliveness to pollution, to what is for most parts of the country a pollution threat and what is for Dublin city and its environment a very present reality.</P>
      <P>In referring to that circular of his, I took the Parliamentary Secretary to be referring to a section in it dealing with pollution but then when I asked him to cite the section in question I rather got the impression that it was not really there.  Is it there?</P>

      <P>Another aspect of the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks was the emphasis on the local authorities.  We hope that, under this general umbrella, the inaction or the faults of the local authorities will not become yet another alibi for Government inaction.  We believe that pollution and, on the positive side, conservation, are matters of national importance which cannot be shelved on to the local authorities.  We think also that in relation to that part of the country where these problems are most acute, that is Dublin city, the national responsibility and the governmental responsibility to deal with them are all the more inescapable <Col N="2483" /> in that the Government have abolished for two years now the democratic participative element in local government and, therefore, cannot use any failure on the part of such body as an excuse for their inaction.  We think that the problem of pollution as a whole is a problem for the Government and, in the immediate present, the problem of pollution in Dublin city is squarely on the shoulders of the Government.</P>

      <P>On the alleged promise made.  The erection of these premises commenced long before the by-election of May, 1968.  So far as I know, they were completed by May, 1968.  Therefore any alleged promise given by the Minister for Justice, then the candidate, in consideration of an appointment to the sub-post office, falls on the facts of the case as they are.  Also, I understand that the premises are now let very profitably as a radio-TV rental premises.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that this was an election subscription.  On the face of it it says that.  The by-election took place, as the Deputy knows, on the 22nd May and the cheque was paid on the 18th May and used, to good effect, to elect Deputy O'Malley to the Dáil.  All political parties receive subscriptions from people all over the country at by-elections and at election time.  It is not a bit unusual but this cheque was submitted by Mr. Tierney as a party supporter and he was told at the time he gave the cheque that it was not going to affect his right to the post office and the events bore it out; he was not appointed because he was not selected by the selection committee.</P>

      <P>I do not deny that Mr. Tierney wrote a lot of letters.  He wrote a lot of letters to a lot of Fine Gael Deputies, obviously, but I say that the £50 subscription was made as a subscription to the by-election fund and was used for that purpose and for no other purpose.  The £50 subscription, therefore, having been used for that purpose was not given in consideration of receiving a post office. If it was, Mr. Tierney was disappointed but the fact that he did not receive it indicates that it was not given for that purpose and would not have been accepted for that purpose.</P>

The Minister told me that the subscription was made as an election subscription, that he was told at the time that it would neither enhance nor impede his application.  I wrote to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who told me at the time that the person who was selected at the top of the list and who was not Mr. Tierney was appointed by him. This, apparently, has been travelled now by Mr. Tierney for a long time, hoping to make a scandal of it.  The three Independent newspapers, the three Deputies opposite, apparently, have documents.

      <P>I will repeat the answer to Question No. 4.</P>
      <P>I was informed by the Minister for Justice on last Friday afternoon that members of an illegal organisation had been invited to take part on Sunday 20th June, in RTE's radio news programme which would deal with the activities of that organisation and that an invitation was extended also to a member of the Government to take part.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that the programme in question&mdash;which was commendedly prepared by Mr. Hourigan and the RTE news staff in Belfast &mdash; was a serious and significant contribution towards a fuller understanding of the need to repudiate unequivocably violent measures, and the use of violence, in order to achieve unity in this country?  It was a matter of profound regret that members of the Government did not see fit to make the views of the Government known in no uncertain manner on such a programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

In short, if the Government condone the parades, surely they must condone discussion of the subject.</P>

      <P>Having conveyed my views I was told that the programme was to be introduced by certain responsible people, that it would be interrupted by an interview, and followed by another group of responsible people &mdash; politicians of different affiliations and private persons.

      <P>Surely the Taoiseach <Col N="2499" /> would accept that with the substantial overtones of violence and the use of violent measures &mdash; which are not necessarily confined to Northern Ireland or to any one political party &mdash; it ill becomes the Taoiseach or members of the Government to adopt a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude?  It ill becomes them to refuse to appear on a serious programme where valuable contributions were made by John Hume and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, who rejected unequivocally the use of violent measures as advocated and condoned by those who call themselves the &ldquo;Provisionals&rdquo;. It would have been proper and fitting that rather than putting a self-imposed censorship on RTE, that authority should have been allowed to bring this to the public notice and have the matter resolved in this way.  This has been a questionable form of backdoor censorship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the annual report of Mayo County Committee of Agriculture in which it is stated that (1) there is a decrease in population and a trend away from agricultural work, (2) there was no marriage in the Kiltimagh area in 1970, (3) the age structure of the farming community in one area showed that 60 per cent are over 50 years and (4) a number of schools have closed as a result of rural depopulation; and what steps he proposes to take to remedy this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a copy of the report mentioned in the question. The factors referred to, namely, the movement of people out of agriculture to more remunerative employment, coupled with a high age structure and low marriage rate of those remaining are characteristic of small <Col N="2500" /> farm areas in most countries.  The Government's policy for the development of such areas in this country has been set out in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to a question on this general subject on the 18th May last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire from the Taoiseach if he is aware that this report was compiled by a group of technical advisers attached to the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture and that it has been described in the local paper, the <i>Western People</i>, as correctly describing the situation in the county? If the Taoiseach has read the report he will appreciate that all the assistance by him and the Minister for Lands has meant nothing, if this report is true, and it is absolutely true and correct. The people who compiled it are not politicians and they have no connection with political parties.  Would the Taoiseach comment on these facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not in any way intimated that I do not accept the report.  I have not read it in detail but I am quite satisfied it is an objective report in its component parts compiled by the officials responsible for it.  It is a recent report and while the measures to which I referred in the second part of my reply are fairly recent measures, they include the expenditure of £500,000 on different projects in the West, of which one-fifth is devoted to County Mayo.  Many of these projects are recent activities.  The subject matter of the report covers a very, very long period &mdash; one might say half a century &mdash; and it is not easy in methods recently introduced to overcome and offset the trend that set in so long ago, but I think we are making progress in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that 8,400 people have left County Mayo since 1961?  What effort has he and his Government made to provide employment designed to keep people in their own country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the very extensive reply I <Col N="2501" /> gave here on 18th May.  The Deputy will see from that reply the variety of measures designed to assist in reversing this trend.  I think many of these measures are already having that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the failure of the measures taken up to date, may I put it to the Taoiseach that it is absolutely necessary now to initiate a crash programme in this region in order to save a situation which has been described, and rightly so, by local people as a doomsday situation?  May I put it to the Taoiseach that promising something for the future or drawing up plans will not solve the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a great believer in crash programmes but, in so far as reference has been made to them, some of the measures to which I referred might be described as crash programmes.  For example, the special regional development fund made available a couple of years ago is being administered in a very flexible manner. Worthwhile economic projects are being assisted.  Economic projects which are in danger of folding up for shortage of capital, if they have any viability at all, are being assisted.  A variety of things might qualify as crash programmes.  As well as that, there is a solid effort being made by the county development teams and by the regional councils.  In the long run all this will inure to the benefit and welfare of the West better than any crash programme.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware, just to take one example of the recent incidents involving the unfortunate people in Scotland, that probably the problem which he now accepts may have been in existence for more than ten years and might not have reached the present serious proportions if there had been a local consular office in say, Glasgow?  Would he agree that there is a problem in that large numbers of Irish workers in British industrial centres do not have the assistance of the Irish Embassy in London because of geographic reasons? Frequently, we hear calls in this House to help the Irish workers in Britain and would the Minister not agree that it would be a practical step towards affording such help to have consular offices within reach of these large industrial centres where there are many Irish workers, the people who most need assistance, in England, Scotland and Wales?</P>

      <P>As regards the Scottish problem my predecessor sent somebody over from here and, arising from that visit, some years ago measures were taken to improve the situation. I and my predecessor also sent people from the Embassy in London to Scotland. I do not think you can blame the situation on that.  It is an extraordinary situation where people were <Col N="2511" /> not allowed to talk or were afraid to talk.  It was quite extraordinary in the 20th century and could not be attributed to absence of consular offices.

      <P>We talk here about immature young people going to Britain.  Would the Minister agree that most of the problems of the Irish in England arise from lack of work or difficulties with employers?  At present all we can do is send somebody from London as a result of a complaint, that is, after the damage is done.  Had we local offices in large industrial centres it would have been money well spent.  We have many consular offices through the US for tourist and trade purposes but the vast majority of Irish workers abroad are at present in Britain and if we wish to help our people surely there is a strong case for establishing such consular offices in places like Scotland and Wales?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware that the Bord Fáilte financial provision for marketing for the year 1971-72 shows a reduction of £175,092 compared with the figure for the year 1969-70; if so, whether, in view of the increasing competition and the number of adverse factors affecting the marketing of Irish tourism, he proposes to make additional marketing funds available to Bord Fáilte for 1971-72.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The marketing expenses of Bord Fáilte are met out of the provision for administration, operational and general expenses under subhead F1 of my Department's vote. In 1969-70 the provision for that purpose was £2,750,000 while that for 1971-72 is £3,350,000, and increase of £600,000.  The allocation of funds from this provision for marketing is a matter for Bord Fáilte.  I am informed by the board that the marketing allocation for 1969-70 was £1,889,954 and that for 1971-72 is £1,714,862.  The latter figure, however, does not include any part of the <Col N="2514" /> £395,000 spent by Bord Fáilte on the special promotional campaign for the 1971 season.  £200,000 of the cost of this campaign was met out of 1970-71 funds by the transfer of this amount from the interest grants provision for that year.  £195,000 was set aside by Bord Fáilte out of the £3,350,000 provided for administration, operational and general expenses in 1971-72 to meet the balance of cost of the campaign.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the future financial position of Bord Fáilte particularly in relation to marketing under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be an extraordinary situation that the money available to Bord Fáilte for marketing in the year 1968-69 was greater by £175,000 than it is for the current year. These are figures furnished by the Minister in reply to a question here last week in which he gave a breakdown of the amount of money spent by Bord Fáilte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was spent over the winter months.  We initiated a new procedure this year in order to stimulate the necessary promotional and marketing work that was necessary to ensure an excellent season this year and we transferred practically £400,000 from other aspects of Bord Fáilte's activities and that particular promotional work was with a view to <Col N="2515" /> extra selling for the current year. Depending on the result of that campaign, we can decide whether we shall do something of this kind next winter for the following season.  This is a matter in which I am keeping my options open.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting of the International Air Transport Association commencing on 29th June will consider North Atlantic air fares for next year.  Aer Lingus will be represented at the meeting.  Aer Lingus will be seeking a fare structure which will help in the development of air traffic to and from this country and which will at the same time take <Col N="2516" /> account of the problem of steeply rising costs with which the airline industry has to contend.  Aer Lingus are at present discussing their proposals with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Aer Lingus have publicly expressed deep concern about this move towards cheaper fares on the Atlantic?  Could the Minister explain the grounds for this concern?  Is it not likely that if fares were reduced it would lead to a greater volume of traffic on the Atlantic and we would have a better chance of keeping the jumbos and the other aircraft filled.  Why are Aer Lingus so worried about the reduction in fares?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex development which has taken place in recent months arising out of the surplus of aircraft because of the run down of the Vietnam war.  This surplus of aircraft, particularly in the United States, is in the hands of all sorts of non-scheduled carriers which are carrying various types of charter operations. If the national scheduled carriers, such as Aer Lingus, allow this to get out of hand it could have very serious financial repercussions for the national scheduled carriers who are maintaining a service right through the year, giving steady employment to their employees and it could jeopardise all the investment which has taken place in these national airlines.  It is a very finely balanced matter and there is a special meeting of IATA inside the next few weeks and at the moment my officials and Aer Lingus are discussing what attitudes we will adopt at this IATA meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point which has to be balanced because if this is pushed too hard and too far there is a very grave danger of jeopardising the financial structure, the existence and the employment in national scheduled carrier airlines such as Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus have very real interests in preserving their own financial integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I know of this it appears that much of the pressure for higher fares is coming from the major companies operating in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case because of the very stiff competition which has emerged in recent months from these non-scheduled operators, due to a surplus of aircraft in America, the major companies like PanAm and TWA are now seeking to compete with these non-scheduled operators by pulling down fares and the smaller national airlines, such as Aer Lingus, have a very real fear that this may go too far and put them in jeopardy.  Somewhere between the two there is a balance.</P>

In the sort of war that could start between the big scheduled carriers and the non-scheduled carriers a <Col N="2518" /> small national airline like Aer Lingus could be jeopardised.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that it was necessary to lower the level of water on the River Shannon upstream of Athlone recently in order to facilitate the resumption of dredging which was commenced last summer but had to be suspended during the winter months.  I am advised that during the present year the lowest level reached has been fourteen inches above the statutory minimum navigation level and that difficulties for navigation should not, therefore, have arisen.

      <P>Since 1st January, 1969, two consultancy assignments have been commissioned by my Department and in both cases they were given to the firm of McKinsey and Company, Incorporated.  The first assignment, which was commissioned in April, 1970, was to review the activities of the B &amp; I Line and CIE in cross-Channel freight transport.  The consultants reported finally in August, 1970.  The fees amounted to £21,000 and expenses to £6,835.  The second assignment, which was commissioned in December, 1970, was to assist the committee set up to investigate the deterioration in CIE's financial position and to identify possible corrective measures.  The terms of appointment provide for professional fees of about £7,500 a month plus out of pocket expenses, but as the consultants have not yet furnished their report, it is not possible to give particulars of cost.  In the case of both assignments, the number of consultant personnel engaged is a matter for McKinsey and Company, Incorporated. It is normal practice for the State sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department to engage consultants from time to time to assist the management in the solution of particular problems. The choice of consultants, the duration of each consultancy, the costs and other particulars are matters for the body concerned and the particulars sought by the Deputy are not available in my Department.</P>

      <P>Within our Department we have considerable knowledge of consultancy operations.  There have been other consultancy operations in Bord Fáilte and other bodies.  I can say with confidence that the value we got from the investigations into the cross-Channel transportation situation was magnificant because the McKinsey company had just completed a very detailed investigation into British Railways and also a very detailed investigation into European transportation organisations.  They had this expertese available and we were immediately able to make use of it and a large amount of research and preliminary research and investigation that would otherwise have to take place was avoided in this case and a very rapid report was made to me by them in a matter of months.  As a result of that we are now completely reshaping the transportation operation across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Britain as it impinges on British Railways and other British transport corporations, B &amp; I and CIE.  I shall be announcing the full details of this in the very near future.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.  In July, 1970 Irish Shipping Limited placed an order for four bulk carriers with Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Limited.  Of these ships three were scheduled for delivery in 1972 and the fourth in 1973.  On 14th June, 1971, Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Limited announced the appointment of a provisional liquidator to administer the affairs of the group.  Representatives of the company had a preliminary discussion with the liquidator in London yesterday.  While it is too early yet to predict any outcome to the shipbuilding group's difficulties, Irish Shipping Limited have indicated that as a result of this meeting they are hopeful that their ships will be built by the group. They expect to hold further discussions with the liquidator in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB are by statute obliged to operate on a non-profitmaking basis and consequently the only measure which they can adopt to contain cost increases which are outside their control is to maintain as high a level as possible of general efficiency. I would agree, therefore, with the purport of the Deputy's question that the efficiency with which the board operates is relevant to the level of charges which they must impose.</P>
      <P>I am in continuous touch with the affairs of the ESB and one of my primary concerns is to be satisfied that the board operate efficiently.  The affairs of the ESB were investigated in great detail by a special prices advisory body set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1966 and that body found no grounds on which to criticise the efficiency of the board.</P>
      <P>The board's efficiency may be examined under a number of heads. One head is plant margin because generating plant makes heavy demands on capital moneys.  An indication of the board's progress in this respect is that the generating plant margin has been brought down from a level of 25 per cent in the mid-1960's to a current level of 16 per cent.  This means a saving of about 60 megawatts in plant which is equivalent to a saving of £4 million in installed capacity.  The ESB margin of 16 per cent compares with a planned margin of 17 per cent in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another head to be considered is generating plant operating efficiency because fuel costs account for roughly <Col N="2529" /> 25 per cent of the board's revenue expenditure.  The board's efforts in this respect have resulted in the operating efficiency of all stations being raised from 88 per cent to 96 per cent over the past 15 years.  These two indices of efficiency which I have just mentioned have, moreover, been the subject of an examination by the World Bank teams which investigated the board's operations. These teams composed of economists and engineers made a detailed study of the board's utilisation of capital and of their operating efficiency. In their reports they expressed themselves satisfied with the ESB's conduct of its affairs and as a result of their reports the World Bank has to-date undertaken to finance the board's programme to an extent of 34 million dollars.</P>
    <P>Other indices of efficiency are growth rate and load factor and in these respects I am satisfied by reference to comparable performance in other countries and to the information published by OECD on electricity prices in the OECD Member States that the board's performance is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On the evidence before me which extends beyond the examples I have quoted, I am satisfied that the ESB operate at a high level of efficiency. Nevertheless, I consider it desirable that it should be demonstrated to the public that the board are operating efficiently and for this reason I propose to initiate an independent investigation into the efficiency of the board's operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1970 for a scheme of death grants which came into operation on 1st October, 1970 and increased social welfare contributions giving cover for these grants were payable from that date.  A contribution condition set out in the Act stipulates that the insured person in respect of whose insurance a death grant is payable must have not less than twenty-six employment contributions paid in respect of him from the date on which the scheme commenced. In the case of persons who have been ill or unemployed, transitional regulations provide that contributions credited in respect of such illness or unemployment may be reckoned in making up the twenty-six contributions mentioned.</P>
      <P>I have no power to alter the statutory provision so as to enable a death grant to be paid in respect of an insured person who died on a date before twenty-six reckonable contributions could have been accumulated.</P>

    <P> * The bulk of the tobacco revenue is derived from raw leaf imported for manufacture into cigarettes, pipe tobaccos or other products. As the duties on the leaf are collected without reference to end-use it is not possible to <Col N="2538" /> furnish accurate statistics of the total weight of tobacco contained in, or the revenue derived from, the separate products.  The figures given include estimates of the weight of tobacco used in the manufacture of cigarettes in this country and the amount of tobacco revenue attributable to such cigarettes for the years in question; the figures also take account of imported cigarettes.</P>
    <P>&dagger; In addition, turnover tax was payable, at the rate of 2½% up to 30th April, 1970 and 5% thereafter, on receipts from retail sales of cigarettes.  Separate figures of receipts of this tax in respect of cigarettes are not available. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will ensure competition among the commercial banks in the matter of interest rates on overdrafts to industrial and commercial concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to take action to ensure competition in regard to interest rates on bank overdrafts to industrial and commercial concerns.  This is only one aspect of lending business.  There has been, in fact, a considerable development of competition between the commercial banks generally for such business, including to some extent competition in regard to interest rates, and I am satisfied that this development is likely to continue in the future.  The Associated Banks hope to introduce term loans later this year.  Under this system there will be a variety of interest rates related to the purpose of the loan, the risk involved and the standing of the borrower.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the commercial bank overdraft rate operating as at 1st June in England and in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the overdraft interest rates charged by the London and Scottish clearing banks on 1st June, 1971, ranged from 7 per cent to about 9½ per cent.  The lower rate applies only to nationalised industries, export credit and a relatively small number of first class customers. The rates applied by the Associated Banks in the State at that date ranged <Col N="2539" /> from 8½ per cent to 9½ per cent.  The lower rate applies to agriculture, mining, construction, manufacturing, distribution and non-financial services. An export credit rate of 7 per cent for capital goods exports will be introduced as soon as arrangements are finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether under the PAYE system taxpayers are dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners' offices situated in the area where the employing firm is located rather than in the area of residence of the taxpayer; and, if so, whether steps will be taken to alter this arrangement so that the taxpayers are dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners' office in the area in which they reside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, the efficient operation of the PAYE system depends to a considerable extent on the employer being in a position to obtain readily from his local tax office guidance and instructions in any particular case.  If an <Col N="2540" /> employer had to deal with different tax offices, the smooth running of the scheme would be endangered.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that there is any great demand by employees for a change in the present system.  Advice and assistance can always be obtained by a taxpayer from his local tax office even though his affairs are dealt with elsewhere.  It is not proposed, therefore, to alter the present system.</P>

      <P>In answering this question I will deal only with the differences in concept between a community school and a comprehensive school that apply in this country.  As I have indicated in replies to previous questions our comprehensive schools are intended to serve as experimental schools in addition to their ordinary functions.  On that account the number will be strictly limited.  Otherwise the functions of the two schools are identical: they both serve a total community and are unrestrictive as to entry.</P>
      <P>One other difference between a community school and a comprehensive school is that I am represented on the board of management of the latter whereas it is proposed that the board of management of the community school should be drawn entirely from the locality served by the school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The incremental salary rules prescribe a minimum number of hours of teaching to qualify for the payment of incremental salary. The hours of duty specified in the contract which a teacher has with the school manager are those normally required of him.  So long as the minimum is not construed in any way as indicating the normal hours which a teacher should teach or engage in other school work I am prepared to allow it to stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that in the context of the ever-growing curriculum and the increasing numbers of pupils in secondary schools, many secondary teachers fear that the implication of the departmental circular about the recruitment of staff implies that they will be required to teach for a longer number of hours weekly than teachers have traditionally been required to teach?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The answer stated that the hours referred to were the minimum number of hours.  As the Deputy is aware there is a significant number of teachers who are teaching for the minimum number of hours, or not much in excess of the minimum number.  It is a principle that we cannot afford in any level of activity, in education or otherwise, to work shorter hours than may be necessary and economically feasible.  With the exception of some specialised areas, such as art <Col N="2557" /> or some other areas where it is not feasible to provide very many hours in the curriculum, it is desirable that each teacher should work as much as possible without over-burdening his programme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that the differential which will obtain in the summer and autumn months as between the British subsidy rate and the subsidy rate payable to beef exporters and farmers in the Republic will militate against such exports from the Republic and may cause unnecessary unemployment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion in the first part of the question.  As stated when the beef export subsidy arrangements for 1971-72 were announced at the end of March the graduated scale of the increased level of support for carcase beef is intended to encourage a greater proportion of marketings of fat cattle in spring and early summer, when the export factories are short of supplies and market prices are best.  At present exports are heaviest in the late autumn when markets tend to be over-supplied and prices are lowest.  It is therefore desirable to encourage more over-wintering of cattle here, especially with the increasing stock numbers in the country, and this will also assist the economy of throughput in the export factories by less seasonal fluctuation of their supplies and better continuity <Col N="2559" /> of marketings throughout the year.</P>

      <P>On Ireland's accession to the EEC the price for milk delivered to creameries here will be governed by the Community's regulations which provide for a target price for milk supported by intervention prices for butter and skim milk powder. These intervention prices are currently fixed at levels designed to support a common target price of about 20 new pence per gallon of whole milk of 3.5 per cent butterfat, delivered dairy. This targetprice, however, is not a guaranteed price as such and the prices which will be received by producers will depend not only on the level of the intervention prices but also on the ruling market prices for dairy products and on the efficiency of the creamery concerned.</P>
      <P>For the transitional period the arrangements proposed are that special intervention prices for butter and skim milk powder will be fixed for each of the applicant countries and that these will be increased gradually to the levels of the common intervention prices in six steps commencing on 1st April, 1973, and ending on 31st December, 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the gelignite used in the recent outrages in the Six Counties emanated from the Twenty-six Counties.  Certainly the gardaí are very conscious of the need to keep the closest possible watch on it and they <Col N="2573" /> do that, but there are obvious difficulties in having 100 per cent supervision.</P>

I am merely asking the Minister to ensure, while the situation is as it is in that area, that the precautions, which may have been adequate in the past to control gelignite, are tightened considerably.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are possible loopholes.  They have not come recently to the knowledge of the gardaí &mdash;the gardaí always had knowledge of them.  The main problem from the practical point of view is that if six sticks of gelignite are issued to an employee to do a particular job, unless there is a guard actually standing over him to count him putting in the six sticks and watching the explosion of them it is impossible to be certain that all six sticks were used.  It would be possible for the employee to use five sticks and put one in his pocket.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister not bring in regulations compelling the employer to report on the actual use of the gelignite?  A very strict Firearms Bill recently passed through the House but it could be suggested that gelignite can be far more evil.

      <P>Irrespective of the merits of this idea, the matter is too complex to be dealt with in the forthcoming Courts Bill.  It would be necessary to have a separate Bill to deal with all aspects of the civil rights and liabilities of State authorities.  The preparation of such a Bill cannot be undertaken in the near future because of the pressure of other and more urgent legislative proposals but it is my intention to have the matter examined as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the county council as road authority to determine what provision is needed for the improvement and maintenance of roads under their charge.  I have not yet been supplied by Laois County Council with full details of the provision for the current year and I am not aware that it has been reduced as stated by the Deputy.  In so far as Road Fund grants are involved there has been a reduction of £20,000 in the provision for improvement works on national primary roads.  The amounts allocated to date for the other categories of Road Fund Grant are substantially the same as last year.  Grants for the improvement of national primary roads have to take account of the needs of the network throughout the country and the allocations to individual counties are subject to variation from year to year according to the progress made with the improvement programme in the county.  Because of such unavoidable variations in the roads works programme it is not possible for the road authorities to guarantee regular employment for all road workers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state (a) the estimated life of a local authority house built in each of the years 1890, 1910, 1930, 1950 and 1960; and (b) how the value of such a house has been estimated in the case of sale to a tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no information in my Department which would enable <Col N="2592" /> me to reply to the first part of the Deputy's question.  The life of any house depends to a large degree on the quality of the materials and workmanship used in its construction and the level of care and maintenance it receives over the years.  Where a local authority decide to make a purchase scheme under section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966, they are obliged by law to base the selling price of houses in the scheme on either the market or replacement value of the houses.  Where replacement value is used, due allowance is made for the age and standard of the houses.  Whichever method the local authority used, therefore, the sale price will reflect the value of the house having regard to its age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that on the erection of a house there is an estimated life for the house? His Department should be able to give the estimated life of the houses for each of the years to which I have referred. Is he aware that houses which cost £70 to build are being charged for at the rate of a couple of thousand pounds now to tenants who have been paying rent all their lives, on the grounds that the replacement value of the houses would be £3,000 or £4,000? I am trying to get some further information from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is practical to request such information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that last week he gave me a reply to a query in this House by way of a long letter in which he said that differential rents would not be more than the cost of the erection of the houses to the local authorities?  If that is so, surely the information which I am looking for should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The differential rents schemes, as the Deputy knows, are devised in such a way that what the tenant pays relates to his household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the letter says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It also bears a relationship to the standard of the dwelling.  The economic rent or the maximum rent, <Col N="2593" /> in the main, relates to the cost of providing and maintaining these houses. All new local authority dwellings being constructed and all new tenancies in recent years are let on the differential rents system.  Some of the older houses to which the Deputy is referring would have been let originally on fixed rents and where there are new tenancies created the new tenant, of course, must now go on to the differential rent.  In these cases a reasonable figure is decided on as the maximum rent and this varies from house to house and from scheme to scheme, depending on such factors as the age, quality and size of the house.  The maximum rents vary greatly but in the main in new housing schemes now being constructed the rent schemes that are devised for them are based on the cost of providing and maintaining the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not trying to suggest that a house which cost £70 to build at the end of the last century and to which a new tenant has been appointed and in which the accommodation would be, perhaps, three bedrooms, one livingroom and a kitchen would, rentwise, be considered to be economic at £2 or £3 per week? That is what the Minister has said now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that in relation to some houses, higher maximum rents would apply because building costs have increased greatly.  The Deputy must bear in mind that local authority houses are built on a 50 year loan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because that was estimated to be the life of the house. The Minister is now saying something that, a short while ago, he said he did not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says something and associates it with a reply he gave to me.  The houses were built originally on 50 year loans.  Even though in some cases the construction costs were low, it must be remembered that local authorities and the State are still involved in paying off these loans and that at the end of a 50 year period perhaps three times the original cost of providing the house will have been paid.</P>

      <P>A tax disc is an effective means of indicating that motor tax on a particular vehicle has been paid, and that the vehicle is licensed <Col N="2595" /> to use public roads until the expiry date of the tax disc.  On the other hand, a motor insurance policy relates to the use of his vehicle by the policy holder, who must be named in the policy, for a period of time not necessarily co-terminous with the period for which his vehicle is taxed.  It may also relate to the use of other vehicles by the policy holder and to use of the policy holder's vehicle by persons other than himself.  Furthermore, the essential requirements of the law relating to motor insurance are of necessity complex and they could not easily be summarised in a small disc.  Having regard to all the circumstances, I do not accept the practicability of the idea put forward by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I assume that the local authority plans referred to by the Deputy are the development plans or the draft development plans which have been prepared by the planning authority for the area.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 26 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, I am restricted in dealing with an appeal to considering the proper planning and development of the area of the planning authority concerned, including the preservation and improvement of the amenities of the area, regard being had to the provision of the development plan for the area, the provisions of any special amenity area order relating to the area and various matters referred to in subsection (2) of the section. Appeals are determined on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that, while due regard must be had to the provisions of a development plan, these provisions state objectives and are not necessarily all or even in most cases in a rigid form and that it is possible to differ as to how best such stated objectives may be realised in dealing with a particular case.  Again, where the objectives in the development plan are for some reason inadequate in relation to a particular case for the overall purpose of securing the proper planning <Col N="2597" /> and development of the area it is then a matter to decide how best this overall purpose should be secured.</P>
    <P>I would also remind the Deputy that the Minister is entitled to take a decision on appeal in effect involving a contravention of a specific provision of the development plan, provided of course that such a decision is based on the proper planning and development of the area.  This power is used with the greatest of discretion and I would be very slow to give a decision involving a material contravention of a plan.  Such a decision would be taken only where it is clear that all the circumstances warrant it, for example, if they indicate that the strict application of the relevant provision of the plan would in the particular case cause unjustified hardship while the decision would not in fact be in conflict with the general criterion of the proper planning and development of the area and would not lead to a more fundamental departure from the plan.</P>

I have no doubt that if members of any authority wish to have copies of a particular circular letter they will be provided with them forthwith and, if required, my Department would be glad to co-operate by making additional copies available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that copies of the circular letters referred to by the Deputy have been circulated to members of the <Col N="2598" /> Tipperary (North Riding) County Council at a recent meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that circulars issued by his Department to local authorities in connection with planning are sometimes of an apparently contradictory nature and may be at variance with the development plans of local authorities; and if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's concern is with the effects on local planning policies of circulars on planning matters issued by my Department. Such circulars are of an advisory character and they are intended to assist planning authorities in the review of their development plans and in the operation of planning control under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>The most recent circulars of this kind were issued on 15th January, 1971. One of these dealt with the review of development plans and planning control problems, and the other with the control of development on national routes.  Far from being contradictory the circular letters were complementary. The planning circular encouraged planning authorities to improve the quality of their development plans and their planning control operations, to ensure that they would more effectively meet the needs of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning authorities were urged to examine their plans, and in particular the restrictions imposed by them.  They were asked to be critical in this examination, to establish the really important restrictions that were required and if necessary clarify and strengthen them, and see if others could be curtailed or modified.  This would give the public a clearer view of what is not permissible and should therefore eliminate applications for permission, and consequential appeals, that could not expect to be successful.  The whole of the planning process would thereby be improved, to the benefit of the public generally.  The circular letter generally encouraged planning authorities to co-operate to the maximum with the public in dealing with planning applications <Col N="2599" /> and to see if in cases of difficulty some mutually acceptable solution can be reached which will comply with planning requirements.</P>
    <P>One planning restriction which could be clarified and strengthened is that relating to the control of access on national routes.  This was dealt with in the roads circular, which asked planning authorities to review their policies in this respect in the light of a recent report presented to me by An Foras Forbartha.  That report clearly established that frontage development involving the creation of new access points on to main roads carrying fast and heavy traffic reduces the capacity of the roads for the purposes for which they are primarily intended, tends to negative the value of public money spent on their improvement, and has a severely adverse effect on traffic safety.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a matter for the planning authorities themselves to decide to what extent they will adjust their control policies or their general planning policies as expressed in their development plans following the issue by my Department of advisory circulars of the type I have referred to.  I would certainly hope and expect that the advice contained in such circulars would be very carefully considered by elective members of planning authorities and their officers; in particular, I expect that pending the legal transfer to me of responsibility for the national roads network planning authorities will discharge their clear duty to protect these roads from development which would be contrary to the public interest. On this point, I think it needs to be emphasised again that the primary criterion laid down in the 1963 Act for the appraisal of planning applications is the proper planning and development of the area concerned. Where the objectives in the development plan are inadequate for this purpose it does not relieve the planning authority of their statutory obligations.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also have in mind that in the circular letter of 26th April, notifying Road Fund grants for this year, councils were asked, when submitting a proposal for the construction <Col N="2600" /> or improvement of a national road, to confirm that the relevant planning authority have had regard to the general policy outlined in the circular letter of 15th January on the control of development on national roads. This is perfectly reasonable because, apart from my particular concern for the national roads consequent on the Government announcement as to their future administration, any money spent on the construction or improvement of a section of national road now could be wasted if access is not properly controlled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already had two meetings with representatives of this association to discuss their proposals about rents of local authority houses.  Their proposals would undermine the fundamental basis of differential renting, which is to relate the rent liability of each tenant as closely as possible to his financial ability to pay.  They would favour better-off tenants at the expense of the less well-off tenants and other persons, with about the same income as local authority tenants, who have borrowed to buy their own houses.  They would throw an extra burden of £2 million on the rates in the first year, rising annually in future years.  This would be additional to the subsidies of nearly £11 million which are being paid by the general body of ratepayers and taxpayers this year to keep the rents of local authority houses at their present low levels.  The proposals would also mean the use for subsidising rents of money which should be used instead to build houses for the many thousands of families who badly need them.</P>
      <P>In view of the attitude of the association in the discussions I have had with them and their efforts to disrupt the normal workings of local administration by encouraging tenants to with-hold rents due to local authorities, I have at present no intention of consulting them again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, however, point out to the Deputy&mdash;as I have informed the association on more than one occasion&mdash;that the management and control of houses in their estates is, by law, vested in the local authorities.  It is with these authorities, therefore, that the tenants must reach agreement on any issue relating to the tenants of the houses since <Col N="2602" /> the local authorities would have to raise the money through increased rates or adjustment of other rents for any concessions they grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that on last Sunday, at mid-day, there was a comprehensive and, it seemed to me, a responsible radio news programme on the current situation in Northern Ireland, more particularly, on an aspect of the current situation in Northern Ireland, namely, the activities of a small group of Irish people in certain parts of Northern Ireland, particularly Belfast, who resort to physical acts of violence in Northern Ireland.  Such a programme was prepared by Mr. Liam Hourigan of RTE, Belfast.  I am sure the House will admit that his objective and succinct reportage of events in Northern Ireland in the last 12 months has been an outstanding feature of the RTE news programmes and general reportage.  This particular programme was a serious and valuable contribution and was an essential matter of public communication and public education.  It exposed the philosophy, the attitude, the strategy and the violent tactics employed by a small, para-military, physical force in <Col N="2614" /> Northern Ireland known as the Provisionals.</P>
      <P>Lest there be any confusion about my attitude, let me state that I do not welcome contributions from any anonymous spokesman from an illegal or any other organisation, and I am sure this view is shared by most people. I have always had little respect for those who lack the moral courage to give their names in a public communications medium and I do not hold in high esteem those who defend their views or acts behind cloaks of secrecy, fear, or any romanticised guerrilla-style policy.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, such people exist and I submit that RTE and the reporting staff have every right and responsibility to present programmes on such matters without being subjected to political intimidation by the Taoiseach, as apparently happened.  They should not be subjected to intimidation by the political head of the Department, through his senior civil servant, the secretary of the Department.  Neither should they be subjected to political intimidation when the Minister for Justice again decides &ldquo;to do his thing&rdquo;&mdash;as he did when asked to appear on the programme.</P>
      <P>I can understand the repugnance of anyone in any part of the country towards the attitude of the Provisionals, that the acceptance of their political opinions depends on their imposing by means of the bomb, the gun or the booby-trap, their views on more than one million people in Northern Ireland.  The Labour Party hold no brief for such groups or activities and we made that abundantly clear in our contribution to the programme last Sunday, through the official spokesman of the party, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the deplorable absence of a Government spokesman on the programme, there was an adult discussion on a major topic of national interest. The Irish people, north and south, had the harsh situation and the harsh alternatives presented to them.  On that programme there were effective, coherent and courageous contributions, particularly from John Hume, MP. There was a complete rejection, on a clear and intellectual basis, of the <Col N="2615" /> philosophy, the strategy and the hopes of those who style themselves the Provisionals.</P>
    <P>This is what public communication is about.  I charge the Government with attempting to interfere with the expression of opinions last Sunday.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien exposed the contradictions in the actions of the Provisionals, for example, the rather Alice in Wonderland possibility of a fascist pact with Ian Paisley.  Does anyone deny that this programme was not in the public interest and was an adult contribution towards politics and their development in this country?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there was a brazen and gross interference with the functions of RTE.  There was a deliberate attempt by the Government to interfere and to dictate to the Director General and to the news staff of RTE regarding the people they should have on the programme, whom they should not have on the programme and how the programme should be arranged.  There was an insensitive attempt to interfere with the freedom of the press.  The fact that the Government, and the Opposition parties particularly, do not approve of illegal organisations cannot be used as an excuse.  If this were the excuse one could point out that the Government are fully aware that statements by illegal organisations are made <i>ad nauseam</i> and are published by the daily papers.  The Government are aware that groups assemble, parade, and carry arms throughout the Republic as the occasion demands.  Yet, the Government decide that RTE should be singled out and that section 31 of the Act should be invoked.  The Government did not have the moral courage to invoke it in writing directly to RTE.  Instead, there was the dreadful necessity of questions having to be put down in the Dáil; that the Taoiseach should have to say that he had been on to RTE and that he did not want this programme to be presented.</P>
    <P>I respect the right of any Minister or party spokesman not to appear on a programme; it is his privilege to refuse. I do not accept that it should be carried further than that.  That would <Col N="2616" /> mean that if a Minister were called on to make a statement on a programme and if he decided not to appear on the programme he would be free to contact the Taoiseach or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and put pressure on RTE.  I contrast the attitude of the Minister for Justice with that of Mr. John Taylor, who did not seem to have many inhibitions.  Even though I disagree with everything Mr. Taylor says, I admit that he had no hesitation in commenting extensively.</P>
    <P>In regard to the highly selective attitude of the Taoiseach in this matter, may I say to him that if he were to say the same thing to the editor of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> he would find himself in difficulty in trying to defend himself in his own constituency.  A grave responsibility rests on our communications media to present events in Northern Ireland in a balanced and relevant manner.  It is the responsibility of the news media to assess the situation objectively.  It is not the responsibility of this House to be judge and jury of the manner in which that responsibility is carried out.  We are not entitled to interfere.</P>
    <P>I submit RTE correctly discharged its responsibility on this occasion and I am pleased to note that the Director General was not prepared to scrap the programme simply because it did not suit the sensitivities of the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley.  It is a matter of profound regret that no public statement was issued by the Taoiseach or the Minister until questions were tabled here and the information squeezed out of them.  We still do not know what the reaction of the RTE Authority was.  Since the programme went ahead presumably governmental intervention was not successful. I deplore seeing a Government act in this fashion, calling into question the freedom of the communications media to report events within their competence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond has expressed the general substance of what we have to say on this but there are a few matters I should like briefly to emphasise.  First of all, there is the matter of interference with RTE <Col N="2617" /> in relation to programmes.  This is generally objectionable.  The Government have general responsibility&mdash;it is generally agreed that it should be a somewhat detached responsibility&mdash;for the conduct of radio and television broadcasting under licence here.  It is particularly reprehensible to interfere in the day-to-day working of an institution set up as an independent authority by this Government.  If we ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs a question on some detail of an RTE programme he will rightly tell us that he cannot answer because it is a matter for the authority.  If he is not answerable to this House, and not responsible, then he ought not to interfere because, if he interferes in a matter in which he has no responsibility to this House, he is essentially acting <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
      <P>This is not a merely formal matter. Governments have invoked the aphorism of &ldquo;He who pays the piper calls the tune&rdquo; and this has been the cover for a wide variety of encroachment by States in the field of news. Most modern democracies agree they should not interfere in this field.  The aphorism of he who pays the piper calling the tune is misleading, be cause it is not the Taoiseach and the Government who pay; it is the taxpayers. They do not want to pay licence fees and, along with that, pay for the right of Government Ministers to interfere.  That is the last thing they want.  This is an encroachment, therefore, on the rights of RTE and also on the rights of the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could understand it if a situation existed in which illegal organisations were being pursued so thoroughly that it was not safe for them to appear in that capacity in public.  If we had a situation here where a man speaking for either wing of the IRA were arrested, as the Government have power to do, if that were so they might well say also: &ldquo;Since that man appeared in public and the men said in public that they represent these organisations,&rdquo; then they cannot do that on RTE.  That is entirely acceptable. If it is the general law that we will not hear from illegal organisations that would, of course, apply to RTE, <Col N="2618" /> but it should not apply as something special to RTE only.  The various forms of IRA may, as they did, appear and speak and, in fact, quite openly without interference, but RTE is not to see or hear about it and it is not to be reflected by RTE.  We cannot accept that.  The spokesmen of these IRA have spoken recently, not quite simultaneously, with Government representatives at Bodenstown.  The peculiarity of Bodenstown, as distinct from the kind of programme with which the Government tried to interfere, is that at Bodenstown nobody can answer these people back.  Wolfe Tone certainly cannot answer them back.  It is interesting to think about the replies he might make to the different varieties of republicans who give harangues over his grave.  But these are contexts in which these people cannot be answered.</P>
    <P>RTE was trying on this occasion, and rightly so, I think, to set up a context in which these people would make their argument, be interviewed by very competent newsmen, and then there would be people there to answer their argument.  I believe this programme &mdash;it is very difficult to be sure&mdash;probably had a good effect publicly.  Hearing the chilling things that these people said may have shocked some of the young people who admire them.</P>

      <P>The strength of the appeal of these people is in emotional gestures, in inflammatory speeches, uniforms, parades, guns and, at a more sinister level, the actual explosion of bombs.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond's question asked if representations were made, directly or indirectly, to the Director General of RTE concerning the format of the radio news programme of Sunday, 20th June, and, if so, the content of such representations. <Col N="2619" /> When a Deputy raises a question on the Adjournment he does so normally because he has not, in his opinion, received a complete or adequate reply. I am at a loss to understand how Deputy Desmond can pretend that he did not receive a full reply to his question. Indeed, the Taoiseach in replying went beyond the direct requirements of the question to explain his views very clearly to the Deputy and the House.  The Taoiseach re-affirmed the Government's view that members of illegal organisations should not be given the opportunity to publicise their illegal activities over RTE, activities which are clearly against the public interest.  I take it Deputy Desmond is not suggesting that these illegal activities are not contrary to the public interest or that they should be given the wide publicity which the use of radio or television, in my opinion, would make available to them.</P>
      <P>Once the Government were aware that this programme was to take place the least they could do was to refrain from co-operating in publicising any illegal organisation by having a member of the Government participating in the discussion.  I am quite confident that many people would feel it would have been quite reasonable in the circumstances as known to the Government about this programme that I, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, would have been fully justified in issuing a direction under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, requiring the authority to refrain from broadcasting the interview which took place with members of an illegal organisation, but before any decision was taken I had inquiries made to establish the full content of the proposed programme and the Taoiseach indicated in reply to supplementary questions today what was learned in advance of the intended programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to censorship and to a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude, the meaning of which he did not explain in relation to the situation. The fact is that while statutory power was available which would have enabled me to direct RTE not to broadcast either their programme or <Col N="2620" /> part of the programme the decision reached was not to interfere in any way with the programme.  At no stage in the course of the inquiries made in advance was it suggested to RTE that they should desist from the preparation of the programme.  I do not know whether Deputy Desmond suggests that the Taoiseach, unlike every other citizen, should not be free to convey a reasonable expression of his views to the RTE Authority.  It seems to me that it is Deputy Desmond who is advocating censorship of the Taoiseach and the refusal to him of the right which every other citizen of the State possesses.</P>
    <P>I make no apology whatever on my own behalf or on behalf of the Government for having given the programme the consideration it needed or for having communicated the Taoiseach's views which were put before RTE for their consideration but with no attempt to enforce the application. As long as I have the statutory powers which I have under the Broadcasting Act, 1960, I shall continue to exercise them responsibly.</P>
    <P>Since television was established 11 years ago a direction to refrain from broadcasting any programme has never been given but if Deputy Desmond or any other Deputy thinks that I would accept the position that I could not put my views or the views of the Government before the authority I assure him they are living in a dream world.  Only a short time ago, a few months ago, perhaps, we had a very protracted debate on my Department's Vote and I heard speaker after speaker from all parties, and particularly those in the Opposition benches, voicing some criticism or other about particular programmes and in immoderate language at times.  I think Deputy Desmond himself was free enough in expressing his views on the subject at times but he now wants the Taoiseach and Ministers precluded from letting their views be known on the very rare occasions on which they do wish to communicate them.  I certainly cannot accept the efforts at censorship of Deputy Desmond, the censorship he wishes to impose on the Taoiseach or on me as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and I assure him that I, for <Col N="2621" /> one, will not be intimated by his efforts.</P>

Again, I should like to state quite categorically that no direction <Col N="2622" /> under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, was given to RTE.  No effort whatever was made by me to threaten RTE, asking them to cancel the programme, and there was no threat whatsoever to RTE that a section 31 direction would be issued. As has already been said, the Taoiseach's views were conveyed to RTE but no attempt whatever was made to impose them and when RTE decided to go ahead with the programme there was no interference whatever with that decision.</P>

A registered person will get full relief for any tax borne by him on his purchases and will be able to pass on a credit for the tax on his sales when he sells to another registered person.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the great majority of those engaged in the livestock trade will not opt to register.  Arrangements are being worked out whereby the producers, with a minimum of record keeping, will be fully compensated for the tax element in their purchases.</P>

    <P>Representations have been received (1) that livestock dealers and marts should be relieved of the obligation of accounting for tax on their sales; (2) that a zero rate of tax should apply to all farm inputs; and (3) that the introduction of the tax should be postponed for at least one year.  The methods to be adopted regarding accounting for tax on sales of livestock by unregistered persons are being discussed between the Revenue Commissioners and the interested parties, and it is hoped that a satisfactory arrangement can be worked out.  The zero <Col N="2611" /> rating of farm inputs is not feasible because it would change the tax from one of general application to a selective tax on a restricted range of articles. Such a system would not be feasible in the circumstances of this country; and it would not be acceptable in the EEC. It is intended to adhere as closely as possible to the proposed commencement date of January 1st, 1972, and I am not satisfied that the arguments put forward are sufficient to justify postponement for a year.</P>
