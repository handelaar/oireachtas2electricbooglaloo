    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to a recent editorial in <i>Liberty Magazine</i> in which it is stated that the trade union movement has not been informed as to the possible consequences on employment arising out of the application for entry to the EEC; whether he will arrange for an analysis of the employment areas which will be hardest hit in free trade conditions; and whether he will ensure that full consultation will take place with the trade unions on the basis of such analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the editorial referred to in the question. As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is involved in the examination of industries being carried out by the Committee on Industrial Progress which was established to assess the progress made by Irish industry in its preparation for free trade conditions.  Representatives of Congress participate also in the annual industrial reviews.  Employment is necessarily a factor in the issues arising in the course of these investigations in which there is continuing consultation with trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in any particular area of industry, there emerges evidence of a serious threat to employment, the Government will investigate the situation and do all in their power to ensure either that employment is maintained or that alternative employment is provided.  It is the aim of Government <Col N="352" /> policy to anticipate, so far as possible, problems of this kind by encouraging and assisting existing industries to adapt to free trade conditions and by providing increased employment opportunities through the establishment of new industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The same editorial refers to the fact that workers were not being helped one iota by the Government as to what they could expect in the EEC.  Would the Taoiseach agree that the main problem is fear of unemployment, unexpected unemployment amongst the trade unions, something like what happened in relation to Booth Pooles today?  They are not aware that any serious investigation has been undertaken by the Government to which they were party and which would alert them to the possibility of unemployment arising out of our application for entry into the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The kernel of the Deputy's question is the alleged lack of consultation with the trade unions. Apart from the examination through the Committee on Industrial Progress to which I referred, there was a briefing session in September between the Department of Finance and other groups on which the Congress of Trade Unions was represented.  An attempt was made again in December to reconvene another briefing session but the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions asked that this briefing session be postponed because they were pre-occupied with other problems.  Apart from that, there is ample scope within the Department of Finance and the Department of External Affairs for further briefing sessions for information. If the Deputy would care to suggest to his colleagues, or to his colleague who wrote that editorial, who is a former Labour TD&mdash;an editorial which has its undertones of sarcasm and politics&mdash;that this means of access is available if they want further information&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach has anything to say to the General Secretary of the Transport Union he may do so in writing.  Have the Government in their possession at this time any detailed figures as to potential unemployment <Col N="353" /> arising out of our application? The kernel of the fear of the Irish trade unions is that the Government are in possession of unemployment figures which they have at their disposal and are not sharing with the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. The Committee on Industrial Progress has already examined five industries and five more are under direct examination. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is represented at that examination. The purpose is to highlight the extent of unemployment and the possibilities of new employment.  They are involved partly through this examination. I cannot see what the burden of the Deputy's complaint is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach therefore saying that he is being completely frank with the Irish trade unions in respect of possible unemployment arising out of our application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are certainly not hiding anything from the trade unions or anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that one of our problems arises from the deficiencies in the Government White Paper in its industrial section which is in marked contrast to the agricultural section which is both full and supplemented by a separate publication?  Would he agree that it would be helpful if at this stage there were a publication on industry and the EEC which would discuss the problems of individual industries, using for that purpose the information coming from the CIO and the COIP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, a series of pamphlets will be issued and the Deputy's suggestion in so far as there has been any deficiency will certainly be considered to see if the deficiency can be made up.</P>

      <P>The retail sale of two of the preparations referred to in the question is controlled under the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, and the Poisons (Ireland) Act, 1870, respectively.  The preparations may only be sold by authorised persons such as pharmaceutical chemists and are subject to certain labelling requirements.</P>
      <P>The other preparation&mdash;the first mentioned in the question&mdash;is not at present subject to statutory control but, in practice, it is only available to the public through pharmaceutical chemists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider that at this stage <Col N="355" /> I would be justified in imposing more stringent controls on the distribution of the preparations.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount paid by the State to the Galway Bay Steamboat Company Limited in respect of the operation of the Galway/Aran service in the year ended 31st March, 1950, was £4,524.</P>
      <P>Between 1951 and 1969 the service was operated by CIE with the vessel <i>Naomh Eanna</i>.  A separate subsidy is not paid to CIE in respect of the losses incurred on this service.  These losses are included in the net deficit on the board's operations as a whole, towards which the annual grant payable to the board under transport legislation is available.  The operating losses incurred by CIE on the Galway/Aran service in the years ended 31st March, 1960, and 31st March, 1969, were £9,112 and £18,750 respectively.</P>
      <P>In addition to the service provided by the <i>Naomh Eanna,</i> CIE have for the past two years chartered the vessel <i>Galway Bay</i> during the summer season to help cater for tourist traffic to Inishmore. The operating loss incurred by CIE on the Galway/Aran service in the year ended 31st March, 1970 was £17,029.  In addition a special grant of £14,863 was paid to CIE by Roinn na Gaeltachta in respect of the losses involved in the charter and operation of the <i>Galway Bay.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he will arrange for the ESB to raise a loan themselves to defray the cost of supplying with electricity all new houses in rural areas in County Kerry, without demanding capital contributions of up to £1,000 in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital expenditure which the Electricity Supply Board may incur in any year on the rural electrification programme is, in common with other capital expenditure in the public sector, subject to the limitations imposed by the overall national demand for and the available supply of such capital.  In the current financial year the ESB are restricted to a capital expenditure of £3 million on the rural programme.  The money for this programme is provided in part by borrowings by the ESB and in part by the Exchequer contribution by way of subsidy towards rural connections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB must work within this limit and are carrying out the scheme on an area by area basis so as to keep the cost of the work to the lowest possible level and thus ensure that the maximum number of connections are made with the capital available.  The board are, on occasion, pressed to make connection out of turn and, in cases where this is physically possible and where it will not divert staff from planned work, the board will offer to extend supply but only on payment by the applicant of a substantial contribution to the cost of the work.  If, therefore, some rural householders wish to be connected out of turn, they will have to provide the capital themselves initially.  Otherwise, some one or more householders who are already <Col N="358" /> in the planned scheme must lose their place until a later date.  Persons who make capital contributions in these circumstances are reimbursed when the planned scheme reaches their areas.</P>

      <P>The rates of allowance payable under the scheme of deserted wife's allowances which came into operation on the 1st October, 1970, are the same as those payable to recipients <Col N="359" /> of non-contributory widows' pensions. The rates of these pensions as well as the rates of contributory widows' pensions were increased substantially as from the 7th August, 1970, and the 2nd October, 1970, respectively.  I am not aware of any abnormal increase in the cost of living since then and in any event the question of improvements in social welfare payments is a matter which must await consideration in connection with the Budget.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not aware of any abnormal increase in the cost of living, the poor certainly are. Would the Minister not admit that, with the abnormal increase in the cost of living, the allowance paid to these people is ludicrous?  Would the Minister also admit that, were it not for the voluntary organisations like the St. Vincent de Paul and others, these people would be on the starvation line? Would he not give these people an increase of at least £1 per month or, rather, per week before the next Budget to tide them over in the interim and enable them to live in ordinary frugal comfort?</P>

      <P>The person referred to applied for unemployment <Col N="362" /> assistance on 9th October, 1970 and was paid at the maximum appropriate rate pending re-investigation of his means, which had not been examined since 1959.  Following the re-investigation it was decided by a deciding officer that he was no longer entitled to hold a qualification certificate on the grounds that he failed to show that his means do not exceed £322 16s a year which is the means limit for obtaining a qualification certificate in his case.  This decision took effect from 18th November, 1970 and payment of unemployment assistance accordingly ceased from that date.  He appealed against the decision and the matter was referred to an appeals officer who requested further information in the case. I have asked that the final decision in the matter be expedited.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why a widow (name supplied), whose total income from invested capital is only £152 10s. per annum, has had her means calculated for a non-contributory old age pension under the Acts as exceeding the statutory limit of £247 15s. per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the actual income from invested capital which is assessable for old age pension purposes but the yearly value of capital, calculated in accordance with the rules as to calculation of means contained in the Seventh Schedule to the Social Welfare Act 1952.  In this case the means of the claimant, calculated on this basis, exceed the statutory limit for entitlement to pension.  These rules are designed to ensure that a person with capital will not be treated on the same footing as a person who has no capital. It would not be equitable to expect the taxpayer to support fully a person with capital who prefers to leave it untouched so that he may pass it on to relatives.</P>

      <P>The Estate Duty Branch, in common with other branches of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, has suffered, for some years past, from a considerable leakage of trained personnel.

      <P>I have no evidence that motor insurance companies have been increasing the basic motor insurance premium rates by more than the 17½ per cent allowed by me.  I am aware, however, that loadings are being applied to premiums for certain categories of risk, which are attributed to adverse claims experience in these categories.  I must accept the right of insurance companies to apply fair and reasonable loadings where they are justified by underwriting experience.</P>
      <P>The loadings applied by some companies, however, appear to be exorbitant and out of line with those of other insurers.  I have asked the companies concerned to justify their action in this connection and I am awaiting their replies.

      <P>Can the Minister do anything in the meantime to stop insurance companies from increasing premiums by over 100 per cent in many cases despite the ceiling of 17½ per cent imposed by the Minister?  Is he aware they are obliging many car owners to take out new contracts?

Are the companies to be allowed to put a premium of £108 on a mini-Minor where there has been no claim and the driver is over 25?

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Defence.)</P>
    <Col N="392" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say to the Minister for Defence how glad I am that he has at last decided to do something which people like myself have been asking successive Ministers for Defence to do for many years. He has decided to scrap the existing uniforms and to replace them with uniforms which soldiers and FCA men can be proud to wear.  The only regret I have is that I have been told by somebody who should know that because some particular manufacturer who has been manufacturing the bullswool for years has so much of it made that the unfortunate soldiers will have to continue going around like men from Mars for many years before the present supply is completely used.  I suggest to the Minister that he might get the two fellows who cut off the buttons from 5,000 new uniforms and burned them to burn the whole damn lot and he would be doing another good turn to the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I think it is ridiculous that anybody should suggest that this outmoded material should continue to be used for uniforms.  Perhaps I have been more critical than anybody else about it but, having worn it during working hours for almost six years during the Emergency, I learned a great deal about it. Many other people were in the same position.  It is ridiculous that in 1970 and in 1971, and possibly up to 1975, soldiers are expected to continue to wear it.  I appeal to the Minister that whatever he does with this material&mdash; let him put potatoes in it if he likes&mdash; he should not ask soldiers to continue to wear these potato sacks.  The FCA uniforms were out of this world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the design will also be changed.  We should get away from the blouses and pants worn by the FCA. FCA men had to go round, particularly if they were tall, like Indians wearing saris, with the centre of their torsos visible.  These matters are purely elementary. Can the Minister imagine any young fellow&mdash;most of them come out of good homes&mdash;who takes a pride in his appearance and in dressing up after duty hours, finding himself wrapped in this Army or FCA material which he is forced to wear, a dirty and uncomfortable thing which could not be called dress by any stretch of the imagination? <Col N="393" /> How could this encourage any young man to join the Defence Forces?</P>
    <P>On reflection, I might have known that Deputy Clinton was criticising the uniform rather than the people who wear them.  If he says that is what he meant I am prepared to accept it.  To be fair, he has not criticised our Defence Forces in that way but if you look at the type of material with which our soldiers have been clothed during the years and then at the spic and span appearance of the soldiers who appear on advertisements it is difficult to identify the two groups as the same young men.  I appeal again to the Minister to do something about the uniforms.</P>
    <P>In regard to Army boots, I have been told they are regulation type boots which are issued not only in this country but to other defence forces. They are of bad design and anybody who has had to march in them as soldiers have to do and as many of us had to do during the Emergency, 30, 40 or 50 miles in a period of 24 hours, will understand this.  Comfortable footwear should be provided and if the Minister wants hard-wearing boots for slogging in certain conditions, he can provide them but not as regulation kit. The supply of a certain type of fatigue dress is a good idea.  It will mean that soldiers will not have to wear the same type of outfit cleaning up around the barrack square and on parade.</P>
    <P>I am delighted Deputy Coughlan and Deputy Clinton visited our barracks. While they did not expect the red carpet, Deputy Coughlan said he was perfectly satisfied with the reception he got.  It is well that public representatives should see for themselves the conditions in our Army barracks.  The Minister went to Cyprus and is satisfied our troops there are being treated no worse than other troops there.  A few years ago, I complained that our troops were under canvas in snow while other troops were in wooden and concrete huts.  This situation appears to have changed considerably.</P>
    <P>Being a Limerick man, Deputy Coughlan was naturally interested in the type of ham and bacon issued to the troops.  The only complaint about <Col N="394" /> food one hears now from soldiers is that the bacon would seem to be well down the alphabet so far as grade is concerned. This may be due to how it is cooked but I do not think so.  While there might be an excuse for the bacon or ham there is certainly no excuse for inferior potatoes.  Cooking in the Army has improved immensely.  The same can be said about the way the food is served.</P>
    <P>Let me re-echo what has been urged in relation to central heating.  It is too bad that conditions have not improved in, for instance, the old huts in Gormanston and that they are still depending for heat on the stove in the middle of the floor.  Remarks were made about cubicles in places such as Gormanston where, at best there is a division in the middle so that the hut that held 24 men now has two compartments each holding 12 men.  Such conditions are far from the type of cubicles we have been hearing about. The Department should provide a decent type of cubicle for the serving soldier and the heating will have to be improved in Gormanston if that camp is to continue in use.</P>
    <P>The toilet and washroom facilities are unsatisfactory.  In all weather, the men have to go a couple of hundred yards in the open to some very out-of-the-way place either for washing or toilet purposes.  Hot water is provided but it is of very little use in the circumstances because, whether it is snowing or freezing, day or night, the men have to walk from the barracks out to these places.  Why can something not be done about this matter?  When the refugees were in Gormanston an effort was made to give them a certain amount of privacy but, despite that, no effort was made to improve the toilet facilities: it was a golden opportunity for the soldiers.</P>
    <P>I do not know if another influx from the North is expected.  The huts&mdash; which were an improvement on what the soldiers were using&mdash;are reserved: they were FCA huts.  Every effort should be made to put the soldiers in there, where they might be a little more comfortable than they are at present&mdash; at least for the winter.</P>
    <P>How much did the whole project <Col N="395" /> cost?  Was everything run as it should have been run?  Does the Minister know what happened down there?  Was there a check on items such as blankets, and so on, in Gormanston before the arrival of the refugees and after their departure? Like everybody else, I trust another problem will not arise in the North but, if it should arise, would the Minister make sure that Gormanston Camp will not be used ever again as a refugee camp.  It is unsuitable for this purpose.  To make matters worse, it is near the Border.</P>
    <P>We had more than our share of people who had not to come but who, for instance, came because the camp was only an hour's run in a car, people one would not like to see coming back again.  I am not referring to those who had to come.  There were a lot of very decent people who had to come and who tried to get back to the North, or elsewhere, as quickly as they could. However, there were some highly undesirable people who certainly should not have been allowed in.  I hope there will not be another crisis in the North but, if there is, there should be a stricter check on the people who are accepted as refugees.  When a lot of people come at the one time it is not easy to check but far too many people came who had a wonderful holiday at the expense of this State and of the people in the area&mdash;and of the serving soldiers who will not forget for a long time what had to be done in the way of cleaning and clearing out after those undesirable people left the camp.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned officers' batmen. I hold that able-bodied people should look after themselves and that people should be responsible for their children and look after them rather than expect our soldiers to do menial work for them.  Our soldiers in Gormanston Camp had to go with a four-pronged fork to clean some of the huts after some people had left.  I am not talking about the genuine refugee.  I am talking about some people who should have stayed where they were but who came to have a good time at the expense of this State and who went from the camp to the hairdresser, to the local supermarket, to the pictures, in <Col N="396" /> taxis at the expense of this State.  That is wrong and should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>If there is another crisis in the North we must ensure that the refugees are sent to a camp or to buildings suitable for them and, next, there should be a stricter check on admissions.  Maybe not immediately but, over a short period, it should be possible for the Garda to find out who is who.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the reply I received from the Minister about the strength of the Defence Forces.  My question was loosely worded and he took advantage of that fact.  He included, I suppose, our Navy, the FCA and everybody else.  This week, I hope to get the exact number of people in the permanent Defence Force&mdash;the normal Army personnel&mdash;in reply to a parliamentary question.  I should like to know the ratio of officers to NCOs and the lower ranks.  While a small number have been commissioned from the NCO and Private ranks, I fear the number of NCOs is too low.  An experienced Army man is of more value in an emergency than a highly-educated young man who gets a commission in a few months and has no idea of Army life.  There should be a <i>cadre</i> of fairly experienced officers at all times in the Army.  Whatever about gibes about a Chinese Army&mdash;more officers than men&mdash;it is important to have a high number of officers and senior NCOs because they are the people on whom the Army can be built.</P>
    <P>For years, some of us here have been arguing that our Defence Forces should be used to educate and train the young men who join.  It is unfair that young men leaving the Army should have very little training for any civilian job.  To some extent, this has been changed but I am not satisfied that enough is being done.  I ask the Minister to redouble his efforts to try to ensure that all the training that can possibly be given is given to soldiers to prepare them for their return to civilian life.  Because of the present retiring age, many men leave the Army while they are still young.  Therefore, it is important that these people are trained for some other job.  Admittedly, some of them have been receiving an education <Col N="397" /> that, otherwise, they would not have been in a position to receive, but it is all important that they be prepared to return to civilian life.</P>
    <P>The FCA have been doing an excellent job in protecting certain installations, particularly during the past 12 months, but what they are doing is not appreciated.  They are entitled to far more compensation than they are receiving.  There should be an increase in the rate of compensation paid to members of the FCA while they are serving.  After all, it is mainly at weekends and at night that they carry out this type of work.  It is possible to develop the FCA into a very important section of the Army, but this can only be done if an effort is made to ensure that only those who are interested in serving the country are recruited.  It is ridiculous that we still have the old system whereby anybody who happens to walk into a slua hall can become a member.  This is particularly noticeable coming towards summer time. Some people consider that it is quite in order for them to appear at that time, get into uniform, go away on holiday, as it were, for a few weeks and then disappear.  This happens time and again while the dedicated men who have been in the FCA for years and who show up for training as well as for camping, are treated as if they were not very important.  There should be greater consideration for those who are serious in their approach to the FCA.  There are some such people in practically every area but they are not being given enough encouragement.</P>
    <P>As well as appealing to public representatives, I would appeal to firms who are operating in the various areas to give encouragement to both the FCA and the Army by providing trophies for competitions.  This would be one way of encouraging young men to remain in the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Up to a few years ago, the various Army sporting teams were very popular in the country.  Practically every unit had their own football or hurling team and they had also athletic teams in the various sports.  However, these activities seem to have diminished.  I would suggest a return to competitions, first in the Army and, through the <Col N="398" /> Army to those outside it.  Such competitions would prove a real incentive to men in the Forces and would eliminate boredom.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Army housing.  I do not know very much about what are referred to as married quarters attached to barracks.  However, the Army are not accepting enough responsibility for soldiers in the various areas who require housing.</P>

      <P>An effort should be made by the Department of Defence to encourage local authorities to build houses that could be rented to soldiers; also, low interest loans should be made available to soldiers who wish to build their own houses.  The local authority of which I am a member cater to a large extent for soldiers.  If a soldier from the nearby Gormanston Camp applies for a house, every effort is made to ensure that he is provided with one.  The result is that there are quite a number of soldiers in the area. Naturally, a civilian who may be seeking the same house but who does not succeed in getting it, will ask why cannot the Army look after the soldier. I suggest the Army could do so and one of the best ways of doing this would be by providing low interest loans. Soldiers are no longer sent from one area to another at frequent intervals. Nowadays they are usually left with the same unit.  Every effort should be made to ensure that they are housed properly.</P>
      <P>I am aware that overholding in the city is causing a lot of trouble but to where can the ex-soldier be expected to go?  He cannot obtain a house outside and neither can he bring his wife and family to the side of the road.  While it is tough luck for the soldier awaiting a house, it would be much tougher luck if a man who had spent a lifetime in the Army were forced to leave his house to somebody else who, perhaps, had been in the Army for only a short time.  I am sure that the Minister has the initiative to make the changes that are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that pensions have been improved and that gratuities are now given to people who, formerly, would <Col N="399" /> not have been entitled to them.  These improvements were many years overdue. I regret, however, that there are so many soldiers who have left the Army during the past few years and who should have qualified both for the increased pension and for the gratuity but who were not so entitled because these were not brought into operation until 1970.  I may be told that, no matter what date one picks, somebody will be aggrieved, that if one goes back one year, there will be somebody who will have been out for a year and a day and so on.  However, an effort should be made by the Minister for Defence, working in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to try to ensure that there is parity between soldiers retiring now and those who retired in the past. The Minister will admit it is unfair that a man having 35 years' service but who retired ten or 15 years ago has only a fraction of the pension that would be paid to a man retiring now after 21 years' service.  I know of a particular case where the man in question found this to be so.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has caused a lot of dissatisfaction on the part of the serving soldier down through the years has been the question of the number of years he would be serving over 21 for which he got only a shilling a year. That has been changed but again it applies only to those who retired from 1970 on.  Even in this House we have oldtimers on the staff who are in receipt of a very small pension.</P>
    <P>During the last couple of months I have had correspondence with the Minister about an old place in County Kildare&mdash;the Deputy opposite me is probably aware of this&mdash;which the Rehabilitation Institute are looking for. I predicted, when I raised the matter first, that while it was being held up by the Department of Defence as a bargain against the Naas Urban District Council, if something was not done quickly about that old building it would be damaged by vandals and it would cost a fortune to repair.  At the time the Minister did not think it important and it was left until vandalism occurred and the building was badly damaged. I am glad the Minister has agreed <Col N="400" /> during the last fortnight that the transfer should take place without any further delay.  It is a pity it was not dealt with more quickly.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say what kind of liaison there is between the military intelligence and the police intelligence? During the Arms Trial statements were made that one section were doing something and the others did not know what was happening.  It may be that the Minister cannot say but I should be glad if he could say what exactly is happening.  Have we got people at the present time who are instructed to go on spying missions somewhere else?  It is wrong if they are and I would ask that this practice should not be allowed to continue.  It is ridiculous in a country as small as ours that a situation like that should be building up.  Is the Minister prepared to say to whom the Army intelligence are responsible?  Are they responsible to him, to somebody under him or are they responsible to anybody at all?  Are they just freelance people who can do anything they like and come out afterwards and write books about it?</P>
    <P>Our people who are serving in Cyprus and the Middle East are doing a great job of which we are all proud, but would the Minister not agree that Ireland, and I made this point last year, has done more than her fair share.  Apparently the United Nations are not very enthusiastic about paying the amount due and eventually payment is made, very much in arrears, after, to use the Minister's own words, &ldquo;pressure has been put on the United Nations to have payment made&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We were in a peculiar position last year because there was a great deal of unrest here and people were predicting that at any time an armed uprising might take place and yet the cream of our Army were in Cyprus.  They are now guarding certain important installations and the FCA, the members of which in nearly every case work for their living, are relieving soldiers at weekends and at nights in order to allow them some time off because there are not enough to do the job, although a considerable number of our Defence Forces are in Cyprus.  I am not opposed to the idea that we play our <Col N="401" /> part in peace-keeping throughout the world but I am opposed to the idea that anyone should get the impression that there is a more important place for Irish soldiers than in Ireland.  If there is trouble in this country the place for Irish soldiers is here.</P>
    <P>I was critical last year, and I am again now, about the type of equipment our soldiers are being supplied with and particularly the type of weapons.  I do not know whether the former Minister for Defence had his tongue in his cheek when he ordered that 500 .300 rifles be sent to Dundalk without any ammunition.  They might be useful if as some people, especially Americans, think, we fight with shillelaghs, but certainly they would not be much use either for defence or attack.  In 1971 we should have modern weapons and our men should be trained to use them.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for members of the FCA to be issued with weapons, whether old-fashioned or modern, without being given any means of protecting them.  If someone with a catapult stops a young fellow bringing his rifle home at night, he can take the rifle from him because he has no means of defending himself.  The rifles should be kept safely in a centre overnight or the people who are issued with them should be given something to defend themselves with.  It is not good enough to say to someone: &ldquo;Here is a rifle, you can bring it home, but you cannot have anything to fire out of it.&rdquo;  It may be feared if ammunition were issued they might do damage with it, but if they cannot be trusted with ammunition they should not be in the FCA at all. The present arrangement should be changed because it just is not good enough.</P>
    <P>With regard to our Defence Forces generally I was rather disappointed to read the reply to a parliamentary question which stated that despite the tremendous amount of publicity given to the recruiting drive the number who left the Army and the number who joined the Army were almost on a par, that there was no improvement in the numbers in the Army over a period of 12 months.  Something should be done, possibly the Minister is doing it now, <Col N="402" /> about the rates of pay and the uniform in order to encourage young men to come into the Army.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the Minister's notice one or two facts.  While PAYE as such does not apply to the Defence Forces, if somebody either through ignorance or for some other reason, does not opt for a voluntary deduction of income tax from his pay, he may find near the end of the financial year that he owes almost as much as he will get in wages and a substantial amount will be deducted from his wages.  Why is it not possible for those responsible for deducting income tax to deduct the same amount for the tax year commencing 5th April, 1971, as they deducted on 5th April, 1970? They should start off like that and if additional deductions are necessary because of adjustments it would be easy to rectify that in a couple of weeks. To say that because someone who has signed on for 21 years, and has served two out of his twenty-one years did not pay income tax from April to January he must pay all that tax before the 31st March, is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>When a fellow leaves the Army he goes on pension and gets a job outside. He gets three months pre-discharge leave, during which time he is drawing his pay plus his pay from the job as well.  If he is married he gets a gratuity which I am sure is looked after by the income tax people before he gets it.  He suddenly finds that everyone is looking for income tax.  A man who had £23 tax free allowance in the Army finds that under PAYE his tax free allowance is only £11 a week.  Out of his Army pension which amounts to £32 a month the Army takes £14 18s tax.  I have been trying to unravel this and occasionally I am able to find someone who says, &ldquo;A mistake has been made, we will adjust it next week.&rdquo; The only way they adjust it is to stop the man another 25s from his wages. He is wondering and I am wondering what system is operated.  It should be possible for those responsible for the deduction of tax to say to the Department of Defence or for the Department to say to the people deducting the tax, &ldquo;Look, this man is leaving now.  He is getting £X gratuity, his pension will <Col N="403" /> be so much, he is entitled to a tax free allowance and has drawn this amount up to this date.&rdquo;  They could easily straighten out the amount of tax due with his new employer.  As the system works at present it seems that the unfortunate ex-soldier is getting the worst of both worlds.  This is something which needs attention.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to a very hoary old question&mdash;that of the people who apply for special allowances.  Here there is the old story about whether or not the man was serving during the critical period.  I know of a number of people who have been told that they are not entitled to an allowance because they were not in the IRA up to July 1921. When it is checked the people in the Department say: &ldquo;There is no roll which shows that there was a Unit in that area.&rdquo;  Yet it is possible to find a half dozen other people, from the same area, who are drawing pensions and even if this man or woman gives the names of the people with whom he or she served, their rank, the engagements they took part in, it still seems that unless some people are prepared to come along and say they actually were present with him on some operation, and these people are recognised by the Department as having the right to say that, he is ruled out.  The thing I consider most ridiculous is the system which I understand still operates whereby the people in the Department write out to certain people and if they do not get a reply they take it that these people are too shy to reply because the applicant is not telling the truth, whereas in many cases the reason they do not reply is that they have been dead for about ten years.  This system has been going on for a long time and it does not appear as if there will be any change in it.  I hope there will be a change.</P>
    <P>Of all the Government Departments &mdash;and I contact, as a Member of this House, Departments of State at all levels, I usually do not bother the Minister unless I have to&mdash;I regret that the one set of people from whom I find it extremely difficult to get a courteous reply are the people in Coláiste Chaoimhín.  I am being quite plain <Col N="404" /> about it.  I may get, after many months a pretty short reply.  I regret to have to say this because I have great respect for civil servants; in most cases I find they are doing an excellent job.  I personally believe that the people in Coláiste Chaoimhín believe that they are a select body and that only a select number of people who were involved with them some time in early days are entitled to make representations or ask questions of them.  I want to make it clear that, as far as I am concerned, I consider I have a right and am entitled, as a Member of this House, to make an inquiry from the officials in Coláiste Chaoimhín, either by phone or in writing any time I wish to do so.</P>
    <P>I have on one or two occasions stated that if this continued I would raise it in this House by way of question to the Minister.  That I propose to do in future because it is just not good enough to wait three or four months and then get a stereotyped reply which says the person is being refused whatever he is looking for because he has not got the necessary information. I had occasion to make an inquiry in regard to 14 documents which I gave to the Minister's predecessor and which were lost for months and months.  Eventually the Minister dug them out himself; at least he sent them back to me and said they had been found.  This is the sort of thing which should not happen.  There are far too many people who would prefer to stick to the regulations as they see them rather than put a little humanity into their jobs.</P>
    <P>I am glad that an effort is being made to get new fishery protection vessels.  I live along the sea and while I would not recognise one type of vessel from another, from time to time people have pointed out to me foreign trawlers which have been anchored short distances from the shore during bad weather.  Apparently they are so satisfied that there is no way of interfering with them that they can come quite close to the shore and stay there. I am sure it is not for the good of their health they come that far down the Irish Sea.  It is good to know that an effort is being made to provide something to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> I am glad that full use is being made of the helicopters.  Things have come a long way since a Minister stood up in this House and said that the reason why all the helicopters were kept in one place was that it was only possible to operate from a &ldquo;nest of three&rdquo;. Those were the words he used. Obviously the helicopters have got out of the nest and are now operating all over the country and doing an excellent job.  If the Minister has a few pounds to spare he could do worse than to purchase some further helicopters because apart from the rescue and fishery protection services in which they can engage it would be excellent to train some of our young soldiers how to operate them and to operate from them.  The helicopter is a coming thing and the Minister might very well consider getting some more now that a helicopter does not get lonely when it is moved away from the other two.</P>
    <P>We have, throughout the country, quite a number of people who are doing an excellent job in civil defence. Like the FCA the civil defence service is a much-abused service because there are quite a number of people who are taking part in a very part-time way in civil defence.  The result is, in my opinion, that it is not up to the strength which the papers would try to prove that it is.  I believe that the actual strength of the civil defence service is much less than it should be.  Throughout the country and particularly in my own county there are a number of civil defence officers and many volunteers who are doing a tremendous job trying to educate people to the necessity for having a civil defence service.  I would suggest to the Minister that like the FCA if a smaller more select band were trained and treated more generously than they are by way of equipment and everything else it would encourage those services and make them much more effective than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the Defence Forces has changed very much in this House.  Many times in the past people have been critical of the amount of money being spent on defence.  There are those who say that as a Defence Force the Army we have <Col N="406" /> got is not very effective; that is a debatable point, but I always, when speaking on this Estimate, referred to one thing and I make no apology for coming back to it again.  During periods of emergency soldiers are respected in every country.  Unfortunately, during periods of peace people do not seem to think so much of them. There are instances where people do not encourage soldiers in uniform to attend certain functions in peacetime while in wartime or periods of any type of trouble they are prepared to allow them in free to various functions in this city and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The general public should respect the serving soldier who is doing an excellent job for his country.  Army service has something different to offer compared with any other type of employment or any other club.  I served during the Emergency with the 18th Infantry Battalion.  This battalion was demobilised finally in July, 1946.  Each year since then the members of the unit have met annually.  Last Friday we had our annual reunion.  Men came to that event from all over the country. These men help each other during the year.  A sense of comradeship which is not found in any other walk of life is developed in the Defence Forces.  Our young men should be encouraged to join the Defence Forces and when they join they should be treated as members of an honoured profession.  If we give young men the impression that they are joining such a profession it should not be as difficult to recruit new members into the Defence Forces of this country as it has been over the last few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make is that a more intensive campaign to recruit as many young men as possible for the FCA should be undertaken.  The FCA could provide a very valuable outlet for the young men of our towns and villages. It could be used as a means of organising the youth of our towns and could help them to develop a national outlook. More accommodation should be provided for the FCA in towns, villages and rural areas.  At present in many rural areas we see derelict FCA halls. These halls should be reconstructed <Col N="407" /> and Army officers should be sent into each district to recruit members.  More attention should be paid to the provision of good accommodation for FCA members and the Army officers in charge of them.  Such accommodation is of vital importance.  The Army officers on such work should also be provided with proper housing accommodation.</P>
      <P>My second point refers to the provisions of the Army Pensions Acts.  The Department of Defence and the social welfare officers interpret the law very strictly when considering applications for special allowances.  They put a very stringent interpretation on the provisions governing such allowances.  The household circumstances of the applicants are taken into consideration.  A more liberal interpretation of the law should be taken.  There are many people who would qualify for allowances were it not for the fact that their family circumstances are taken into account.  We all know how difficult it is for an unmarried son or daughter to keep a household going and to maintain such an applicant.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department should provide a scheme of pensions for the widows of IRA veterans.  Great hardship is inflicted on such widows, especially where the veteran was in receipt of special allowances or a military service pension before he died. There would be many difficulties in administering such a scheme.  The widows of veterans who were in receipt of special allowances or military service pensions should be covered by some scheme.  A free transport scheme for widows of IRA veterans should also be provided after the death of the medal holders.  The wives of medal holders should also be allowed to travel without their husbands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, a more intensive campaign for the recruitment of FCA members should be undertaken.  Proper accommodation should be provided for the training of FCA members.  Proper housing accommodation should be provided for Army officers in charge of such training.  A more liberal interpretation of the law should be taken by the Department of Defence in considering <Col N="408" /> applications for special allowances where there is a family income. There should be a pension scheme for the widows of IRA veterans, particularly in cases where the late husbands were in receipt of an IRA special allowance or a military service pension. I also think the wives of IRA medal holders should be allowed to travel free in cases where husbands cannot travel with them for numerous reasons.  If at all possible widows should also get free transport.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this is something to be proud of, but I cannot imagine that at present in any State in Europe, if not in the world, a debate on such an important estimate as the Estimate for the Department of Defence would muster such a small attendance of Members.  Because of our peace-loving nature we are not likely at any future date to attack somebody, and we are concerned only with maintaining a defence force, and perhaps that seems to reflect a lack of interest in this Department.</P>
      <P>I come from what is known as the short grass county but the only place in the county where the grass is short is on The Curragh, due to the neglect of the Department.  I will have more to say about that later.  It was also known as the county of the brass buttons. Coming from there I hope I will be forgiven if I concentrate my remarks almost entirely on The Curragh.  In his opening statement the Minister paid a very well deserved tribute to the men serving both at home and overseas.  He referred to the people overseas as ambassadors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to recall a little incident that happened to a friend of mine recently on a visit to Cyprus.  He had some Irish money in his pocket and he wanted to change it.  He had found extreme difficulty in his travels in changing Irish money and he was always charged very heavily for the exchange.  On going into a shop in, I think it was Limassol, in Cyprus, he was told: &ldquo;Certainly we will change it.  Your soldiers have been here.  They are doing a wonderful job and we are delighted to assist you.&rdquo; To <Col N="409" /> my mind that was a tremendous tribute to the men out there.  It shows that they were very highly thought of even by the traders in the towns when a person from Ireland was accommodated even on a simple matter like that.</P>
    <P>A couple of months ago Deputy Clinton and I paid a visit to The Curragh.  I should like to thank the Minister for making the arrangements for us.  It was said to me afterwards: &ldquo;Of course, you were only shown what they wanted you to see.&rdquo; I should like to refute that remark because the commanding officer, the officers and men who attended on us that day went out of their way not just to keep to the time-table they had arranged but to show us everything we asked to see. They treated us with every courtesy and gave us every help on our visit.  It was a very long and quite a tiresome day, but most interesting and informative. Even though I was born and reared in County Kildare it was my first visit inside the camp although I had passed through it.  I had heard a lot of both good and bad about it but I was able to see for myself, at first hand even in one day, much of the work that goes on there and the tremendous amount of good which the commanding officer, the other officers and men are doing on The Curragh.</P>
    <P>Of course The Curragh has long been associated with the Army.  A few years ago it was impossible to go into County Kildare without meeting many brass buttons, as I said earlier, but they are not to be seen now.  Why is this?  Is it related to the very fine exposition by Deputy Tully about the uniforms?  Is it because of the pay and conditions which prevailed up to very recently and which, indeed, are still not in line with other sectors of the community? We know that The Curragh is not now the training camp for the whole country and that training is done at other centres.</P>
    <P>Despite expensive and elaborate recruitment campaigns the numbers joining the Army must be a great disappointment to those in authority and those responsible.  Unless some better results are achieved in the not too distant future, many of our Army establishments must fold up.  It has been said <Col N="410" /> that at present we have more officers than men and, if this goes on, we will have more civil servants than Army personnel.  I am sure this is engaging the attention of those in authority and we hope it will be remedied.</P>
    <P>There were recent increases in pay and they were comparatively substantial but they do not seem to have been enough.  They are not bringing the people into the Army.  The greatest plum a soldier can get at present is a trip to Cyprus.  It has been described as a holiday in the sun but, as far as the soldier is concerned, the main thing is the money he gets when he comes back which he wants to spend on his house, to buy furniture, to pay bills and the 101 other things that such a little windfall can be applied to.  To my mind that should not be necessary. In this day and age, while we would all welcome a little bit on the side, a few extra pounds here and there, there should not be as much competition as there is in the Army to get a trip to Cyprus.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject, I should like to inquire about the system of selecting men to go to Cyprus.  It has been pointed out to me on a number of occasions that the same men seem to go overseas time after time while others, highly suitable, are passed over.  Why is this so?  There must be some reason for it.  I am sure the authorities pick the best men but, nevertheless, those who appear highly suitable to the ordinary layman are never selected.  This is, to say the least of it, unfair.</P>
    <P>During the visit to The Curragh by Deputy Clinton and myself I had an opportunity of noting with great satisfaction the facilities provided there for the further education of the soldiers. It was even more satisfying to see the numbers availing of the opportunity to further their education.  The authorities are to be complimented on this and I hope the facilities will be extended and availed of to the fullest possible extent by the men.</P>
    <P>The founding of the Army Apprenticeship School at Naas was one of the best things done by the Army in recent years.  I am not in a position to agree with anything Deputy Clinton said <Col N="411" /> about this school.  He, apparently, had a great many complaints about it; the accommodation and so forth leave much to be desired.  I have heard complaints, but I have had no opportunity of confirming them.  We shall have to pay a visit to the Apprentice School at Naas to see for ourselves whether or not these complaints are justified.  Irrespective of whether or not the complaints are justified, every year young men are turned out from this school of whom the nation can feel justly proud.  This was exemplified in no small measure on the day on which President Nixon visited Kildare.  The Army apprentices formed a guard of honour in the town of Naas and there was nothing but the greatest praise for them.  They were a credit not only to their officers but to themselves as well.</P>
    <P>On completing their course in Naas they go to The Curragh for three years. Their education is put to good use. Deputy Clinton and I saw for ourselves the highly skilled and intricate work they were doing especially in the Corps of Signals.  These young men are very much sought after in the private sector.  It is a good thing that the nation should train young men to take their place in the private sector.  The Army&mdash;I am not blaming them in this regard&mdash;could not possibly pay these young men the money they can command outside.  A great many of them do not finish their three years in The Curragh.  They buy themselves out.  It is pretty costly but they consider it worthwhile because of the good jobs they can get outside.  People in industry are delighted to employ these young men because of their training, their character building and their discipline.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Clinton said about transport.  Whatever numbers we have in the Army there seems to be very little means of transporting them.  This is something to which the Minister should give very serious attention because transport is not something that can be built up in 24 hours. If a crisis arises anywhere there must be the means of transporting the goods to meet the situation.  This is something that is not available in The Curragh, if it is available anywhere in the Army. <Col N="412" /> All the speakers who preceded me have spoken about the housing of our soldiers.  I am sure Deputy Power will agree with me that we have a particular problem in this regard in Kildare largely because of over-holders. Kildare local authority have played their part in housing quite a number but it would be virtually impossible to house them all.  The State should play a bigger part in this.  Generous allowances should be given to the Army itself to build houses.  The space is there in The Curragh.  The men need the houses.  The country needs the men. It is up to us to house them.  There is plenty of space.  The services are available. The land is tied up by legislation but I think the red tape should be cut and a little bit of Curragh land given to Kildare County Council to enable them to solve this very big problem of housing for Army personnel.  The married quarters on The Curragh are very well kept.  The accommodation for the single men leaves much to be desired. One sees a turf fire at the end of a dormitory.  One man is kept fully occupied piling on turf.  It is all very lovely to look at but the men at the other end of the room do not know there is a fire in it.  Central heating should be provided. Money spent on central heating would be money well spent.  The men will rough it when they are on manoeuvres but they should have a decent modicum of comfort when they are in barracks.  They are allowed to have television, which they supply themselves.  The whole idea is to get away from the camp when they are off duty.  That is understandable in the winter when they have only one turf fire between the whole lot of them.  In winter they can collect around this turf fire but if they sit back to play a game of cards or draughts they are away from the heat and the place would freeze the mice.  This is something that might be contributing to the drop in recruiting.  There was a time when the soldier with a family was always proud to be able to say afterwards that all his sons were in the Army after him.  I wonder how many families of soldiers would be able to say that now.</P>
    <P>Many improvements have been carried <Col N="413" /> out to the buildings at The Curragh but it would cost a small fortune to bring them up to the necessary standard. Even that amount, if spent now, would save a great deal later on.  They have the expertise to do the job.  Give them the money to get the materials and they will save the buildings.  We saw some buildings so decayed that the only thing to be done with them is to bring in a bulldozer and level them.  If the buildings there are not maintained and repaired The Curragh, in time, will fall.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in this debate to the soldiers' food.  I have read many letters in the papers about this and I got some letters myself, anonymous and otherwise, in regard to food. When we were at The Curragh we saw food being prepared.  Admittedly, it was Friday but the fish we saw being cooked appeared to us to be of the highest quality.  Despite the fact that there is no abstinence now they were still having fish and we were assured that since the removal of abstinence the soldiers prefer fish&mdash;I suppose that is human nature.  While the cooking facilities left much to be desired the food we saw about to be prepared left nothing to be desired.  We may have been lucky on this occasion to have been there when the food was about to be prepared; perhaps when it is prepared it is not so good.  There is a lot in the cooking.</P>
    <P>There is one recent development at The Curragh to which I must refer and which is causing some concern.  A number of traders both in The Curragh and in surrounding towns are doing quite good business in The Curragh. Those traders from the outside towns have now been informed that they may not go into The Curragh to collect debts or make deliveries.  I am personally aware of two who have been doing business on The Curragh for many years. Some of the people on The Curragh have established credit with these traders who now find they are to be prevented from going in to collect their debts or make deliveries.  When one of them recently made an application he was informed that he would be allowed to continue until some time in March <Col N="414" /> and that the business would then be phased out.</P>
    <P>That is just not good enough.  This particular trader is able to supply goods as cheap and sometimes cheaper than some of the other traders referred to. The soldiers and their families have been circularised and advised to deal with &ldquo;Welfare&rdquo;, an organisation which, I gather, pays no turnover or wholesale tax.  I am speaking from hearsay but if this is true it is the worst form of unfair trading.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this problem.  If it is regarded as a security risk to have these people going into The Curragh to carry on their business today that risk must have existed for a very long time. Why was it not mentioned up to now? It has never been mentioned before. There is something seriously wrong if this is allowed to happen.  I hope the Minister in replying will be able to assure me that he will stop this move and that civilians who have had trading passes up to now will have them restored at the first opportunity and that this crazy idea of phasing them out will be dropped so that business can go on as it did up to now and this will be to the benefit of the personnel on The Curragh.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by referring to the grazing on The Curragh.  The Minister was good enough to receive a deputation some time ago from The Curragh Sheep Grazers' Association.  They put a number of proposals before him and while some progress has been made the real kernel of the problem has not even been touched&mdash;their hope to have new dipping baths for the sheep for the next dipping season on The Curragh.  The local authority are making provision for water there for the sheep but there is still the problem of reclamation, of fertilising and the problem of making it a more viable holding&mdash;to use a word commonly used in regard to farming nowadays.  The problem of touching even one acre on The Curragh involves one in extinguishing grazing rights and so on and is tied up with legislation going back 100 years or more but these are problems to which the Minister gave a very sympathetic hearing. I hope before we come back for the next Defence Estimates these problems will be solved.  The association to which <Col N="415" /> I have referred and the Claim Owners' Association which is an equally important body are meeting very soon.  I have no doubt that from that meeting will go to the Minister proposals for the necessary improvement and I trust that he will act on them as soon as he receives them.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the matter of motor-cycle escorts.  The old days of ceremony and pomp with horses seems to have gone from every country in the world and we have replaced that here with what I would like to regard as one of the finest bodies of men one can see anywhere in the world.  They are a source of pride to all who see them and I would like to pay them tribute and to thank them for adding colour to occasions which otherwise might have been drab.  Again I should like to thank the Minister for his co-operation in arranging for Deputy Clinton and myself to visit The Curragh and I hope that if Deputy Clinton is visiting other military establishments I will have the honour and pleasure of attending there with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for having, during his short term of office, secured such wonderful improvements in regard to the better pay and conditions which Army personnel now enjoy.  I should like to thank him particularly for the interest he has shown in the men.  This was exemplified particularly during his recent visit to Cyprus when he spoke to every Irishman there.  Friends of mine who are serving there assured me that this was greatly appreciated and it bears out the opinion of the entire Defence Forces that Fianna Fáil are a party who have the interest of the Defence Forces at heart and that the Minister, through his visit and through the improvements he has brought about, is only keeping up the good work of his predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps at this stage I should mention a small bone of contention which exists in regard to Cyprus.  It concerns senior NCOs and BQMs who up to now had enjoyed a slight privilege over other NCOs in that they had a five year advantage in the upper age limits for visits to Cyprus but the other NCOs <Col N="416" /> have now been brought up to that age limit and the seniors no longer enjoy this privilege.  There are not very many involved and I suggest that the upper age limit be extended in the case of the senior NCOs and the BQMSs to a further five years, to 55 years.  It might be argued that at that age they would not be able to carry out their duties properly but NCOs in this position would not have very onerous duties; while they may have responsible ones they would not be very onerous ones and they would be well able to carry them out.</P>
    <P>Another incentive in this regard is that the lump sum of some £500 for NCOs which would accrue from their visit to Cyprus would be a wonderful asset to men who might be thinking of purchasing their own house and this would be a very fine down-payment for them.  One of the reasons I have heard for the non-inclusion of men in this age group is that for medical reasons they might not be able to put up with the climate in Cyprus.  These very same men have been on active service near the Border and they have put up with Arctic conditions up there and I am sure a visit to Cyprus would not be a very great burden to them. The Minister should have another look at this matter.  Deputy Malone mentioned that the same people seem to go to Cyprus, or the same people seem to be picked, that many have made a number of visits while others have made none and he quibbled over the method of selection.  I am sure that within reason the best men are sent and possibly the same reasons could be advanced for the same people representing the Kildare team when they play&mdash;that we see the same people appearing on the team year after year.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy Malone that it is essential to keep up the numbers in the Defence Forces.  While the recent recruiting drive was not too successful it did bear some fruit.  It is essential to keep up the numbers because if we have no men we have no Army and men are much more essential than equipment or anything else.  At all times nothing should hamper the free flow of recruits into the Defence Forces.  There is a tendency to put on a <Col N="417" /> big show and to look for recruits but then Finance becomes worried that the numbers will go over the limit and they cut back.  We should not worry if the number exceeds 7,300 or 7,500 because what normally happens is that a young man leaves a street in a village and joins the forces and when he comes home another chap meets him and inquires about conditions and pay and so on and in due course he follows too, that is provided that recruits are being accepted and that there is a free flow of recruiting at all times. If word goes out that recruiting has stopped or that they are no longer anxious to have recruits this will hamper things.  The matter would level off if recruiting was allowed to go on unhampered and we would have the required numbers.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I have raised with the Minister without success, and which I feel he should consider further, is the question of allowing married men enlist in the Army.  At present they may enlist only if they had previous service.  Contrary to what Deputy Malone has said, the improved conditions in the Army mean that people are being enticed to leave industry&mdash; this has happened in Newbridge which is highly industrialised&mdash;and go back into the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the industries are starting to rock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are rocking around the clock all right, on three shifts.  I have been told there are reasons why married men should not enlist but if they were allowed to enlist you would get a better, steadier and a more disciplined and responsible man. I know of a man who enlisted on a Friday, was accepted, and was married the following day.  There is a demand for married men to enlist and the Minister should look at the matter again. Another reason why numbers should be kept up is that if the numbers are down people must perform extra duties, which is unfair and demoralising.  It is essential to have as full a muster as possible in every unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Malone mentioned traders on The Curragh and the curtailment of <Col N="418" /> their privileges.  Only yesterday I visited The Curragh and the OC assured me that this position was much worse than anyone had anticipated.  I do realise that two of Deputy Malone's colleagues on the county council were very much involved in this and I realise that they are fine people, but there are other people, too, people coming from far afield.  Since there has been a clamp down on their activities 56 of these travellers, or bloodsuckers, have been flushed out.  Recently Army pay has been given to the soldier alone; before this his wife used to get an allowance but now the man gets the full allowance. These people have been waiting around the corner for their payments, waiting to offer them a credit cheque for which they will charge an enormous amount of interest.  They will follow a man 50 yards across a barrack square offering him this credit cheque.</P>
    <P>There was one case where the wife of a private, whose allowance would have been about £5 per week, had entered into commitments up to £700. There is a reason, apart altogether from security, for the action of the OC in The Curragh.  I know that traders have been given until March next to put their accounts in order and that anyone who has entered into commitments and has to collect payments after that time will be allowed to do so, provided they do not enter into further commitments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone referred to unfair trading.  There are traders on The Curragh who pay rent and rates; they have other overheads.  They are subject to unfair trading from people who come in from outside and there must be a security risk involved.  I am well aware that while this clamp down on traders coming into The Curragh may cause a certain amount of hardship, it was not done without grave reason and I consider that the OC was fully entitled to act as he did.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Malone said regarding housing.  Most of the problems that are brought to our notice by Army personnel deal with this matter.  I compliment the Minister on the plans to provide another block in The Curragh for married quarters. However, there is the constant problem <Col N="419" /> of over-holders.  There are many of those and the number is increasing because we have reached the stage where many men are due to retire from the Army.  While these people are over-holders they cannot enjoy their pensions or they are not eligible for a Government job.</P>
    <P>Greater liaison is necessary between the county council and the Department of Defence to provide a purchase scheme, similar to that operated by the NBA, whereby a serving soldier can buy out his house.  I do not altogether fault the Department of Defence because a site on The Curragh was offered in 1968 but it was not acceptable to the county council at that stage. I have been in touch with the Minister in the last few months and he has now agreed to provide another site.  I am hopeful that something will come from this because a soldier is entitled to buy out his own house.  When he retires after 40 years of service to his country that is not the time he should have to look for a house of his own. Sites are available on The Curragh and the implementation of such a scheme would not interfere with the landscape or amenities.  I was born on the edge of The Curragh, I know the area well and I am satisfied the scheme could be implemented quite satisfactorily.  The fact that sites are available free should ensure that the price is reasonable and it would be an incentive to soldiers who return from Cyprus and get a considerable lump sum to purchase their own homes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone referred to the heating facilities in The Curragh, which are turf-fired.  I suppose there would be a considerable outcry from the opposite benches if we attempted to use any other type of heating because turf is the native fuel and the most easily available fuel in Kildare.  However, I do not think it is very efficient or economic and now is the time to look ahead.  In the next 20 years many of our bogs will be worked out and we will have to look elsewhere for fuel.  A single central heating system, worked off a master boiler, would be a worthwhile proposition. I have gone into the economics with a qualified person and he has <Col N="420" /> assured me that it alone would save £18,000 a year on The Curragh.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Clinton regarding transport. There does not appear to be any annual scheme for renewal and replacement of transport in the Army.  What is happening is that any new transport is driven to death for four years or thereabouts and the old vehicles&mdash;some of which have been in use for 15 years&mdash; are being serviced for about half or one-third of their working time.  The fact that they are capable of being put on the road is a tribute to the dedication and work of the fitters and the technical people but I am sure if one went into the economics of the operation it would be obvious that it is a costly practice.</P>
    <P>During last summer the Army put on a display in Droichead Nua.  Armoured cars that had been in use for 25 years were displayed and while that is a tribute to the people involved I do not think it is very beneficial to the Army. The matter of transport is vital in any army.  In the event of a calamity or catastrophe it is essential to move men from place to place very rapidly and in a case, for example, where a bridge collapsed, where there was a train disaster, or an epidemic such as foot and mouth disease, it would be essential to move the Army to the affected area as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and the Army authorities on the educational facilities now available in the Defence Forces.  Last year a start was made in conjunction with the vocational education committee and a class was formed of men who had done a certain amount of post-primary work prior to joining the Army.  This was most successful; 19 people started the course, 18 passed the group certificate examination and one dropped out.  This year the scheme has been somewhat changed.  Another class of 17 was formed and I spoke with them yesterday. The people involved got very little opportunity to pursue any educational training past the primary stage.  They are doing a full-time two-year course of Irish, English, maths, mechanical drawing, art and bookkeeping.  This is a success.  I believe some of them would <Col N="421" /> have been capable of taking the group certificate examination after a year but they are abiding by the timetable and will take two years.</P>
    <P>We should compliment the Army authorities on the fact that they are the only body in the county&mdash;so far as I know&mdash;who grant full-time release to their men.  The men are very grateful for this wonderful opportunity and I consider it would be worthwhile to extend this scheme.  It should become part and parcel of Army life.  The results achieved to date are most encouraging. The personnel availing of these educational facilities carry out a certain number of duties at the weekend but if the scheme is extended it may mean that those not availing of the educational course would be aggrieved that extra duties were being left to them, and for this reason numbers should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Army Apprentice School at Naas is turning out some wonderful personnel and I hope that, as promised, they will soon get the new block because it is badly needed.  They are doing excellent work in conditions that are not very good.  The some can be said about Baldonnel.  It is a tribute to the educational facilities available that the Defence Forces train people properly and that the finished product is a good one.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made by some of my own colleagues, I think, that the Minister should look into the question of selling some of the barracks in Dublin.  Perhaps this is a good idea, but we would still, I am sure, have to keep Collins Barracks and some of the others.  If there is a plan to rationalise or centralise our Army the Curragh-Naas-Kildare complex will offer everything to such an Army.  There is plenty of room for expansion on The Curragh. Land is available there, which I doubt would be available anywhere else, for manoeuvres and other tactical exercises. All Army personnel, no matter where they are stationed, would agree that The Curragh is the only place for such a project should the Minister decide to follow that line.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sale of the barracks in Dublin, there is an opinion among Army people that if these buildings <Col N="422" /> are sold the money will never find its way back to the Defence Forces, that anything that civil servants get their hands on will never return.  As an example I quote the consignment of Land Rovers that went from Mullingar to Cyprus.  They were sold to the United Nations Forces and paid for, but up to this they have not been replaced. Army personnel think the same thing might happen if the Dublin barracks were closed.</P>
    <P>There should be a definite policy in relation to our Defence Forces.  For instance, what is the Air Force expected to do?  Are they to be regarded solely as a group that carry out mercy missions, that engage in photography with the aid of helicopters or that provide technical training for Aer Lingus personnel?  If that is the policy in regard to the air force it should be stated.  In any case sufficient money should be made available to provide the equipment and schools required for this purpose.  Baldonnel school, as I have said, is only a cluster of huts. Great work is being done there, but they are not being given a fair chance.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on planning to provide three vessels that are capable of guarding our waters.  If fishery protection is to be the work of our navy in future, it should be done efficiently.  The ground work has been laid well with the three vessels which are on order.  If foreigners find it lucrative to come thousands of miles to fish in our waters, it should be to our advantage to guard those waters for our own people.</P>
    <P>I would not agree at all with Deputy Malone on the question of morale. Army morale is high and this is contrary to the statements of experts who have gone to great length to write articles in newspapers explaining why it should be low.  The people in Kildare see our Army every day and hear our Army band perform.  They have seen the Army gymnastic group perform on sixteen different occasions in twelve consecutive weeks last summer.  They were privileged to see a helicopter display and artillery exhibition in Droichead Nua which the Minister for Local Government opened there last summer.  The Minister was impressed <Col N="423" /> as also were the people of Kildare. They know full well what our Defence Forces are capable of and are proud of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone remarked that there was a time when Army men's sons went into the Army.  That custom is still prevalent, and I doubt if you would meet many Army men who have not at least one son in the Army.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his interest.  I would ask him to keep up the good work and he will have men that will not let him or the country down, because they realise the country believes in them, that the Minister believes in them and is prepared to make provision for them.</P>

      <P>The officers of the regular Army, the members of the FCA, those engaged in civil defence, the members of the marine service and the Air Corps deserve a tribute from the members of this House.  During the past 12 months, which was a unique period in our history, the loyalty of these people to the State enabled us to uphold the morale of the nation.</P>
      <P>Our Army should be properly equipped and properly housed, and we as Members of this House could ask ourselves have we always given our attention to the requirements of the Army.  The first thing that should be done would be for the Minister to instruct the Corps of Engineers of our Army to make a survey of military installations, the different barracks, and assess properly what accommodation is required and then set about modernising the buildings.  Efforts have been made to modernise the buildings of different Departments of State, but how slow the effort has been in relation to the Army is only known to those who have served for years in the Army or those who have gone for annual training as members of the voluntary services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recruiting and maintaining an effective strength are by far the most important problems facing the Army.  If we were to go into the different reasons why so few are inclined to remain on in the Army as in the early years of its formation, we would find that boredom <Col N="424" /> is the principle reason.  Too many have to do fatigue duties, duties in the messes and so on.  In the British and American armies those fatigue duties are performed by civilians.  An effort should be made to have that work done in the different barracks by civilians.  Other aspects should also be examined to find out why men are not prepared to remain in the Army over longer periods. There are possibly several reasons why we do not get more recruits.  A five-day week would be an innovation, something which is being demanded by all our people in civilian life.  Is there any good reason why we should not attempt to reduce the number of hours which serving soldiers have to give within the barrack area?</P>

During the discussion on that motion the former Minister for Local Government left the House in protest against something or another, alleging he had not been allowed to speak on the motion which, of course, was not correct. I might put on record that the same Minister left the House permanently under protest a few months later for an entirely different set of reasons.</P>
      <P>At any rate, in those circumstances this measure, the Offensive Weapons Bill, 1970, was introduced by Deputy Cosgrave and myself and Deputy Cosgrave explained the general provisions of the Bill.  Deputy Thornley spoke on behalf of the Labour Party and the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran, spoke on behalf of the Government.  I had begun to conclude and, therefore, I do not intend to speak at any length on this occasion.  It is a fact that since I last spoke five new Members have been introduced to the House and I may, therefore, be pardoned for saying briefly a few words about the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill was introduced by Fine Gael in the light of many crimes of violence in the years immediately preceding its introduction&mdash;crimes of violence involving the use of knives and other lethal weapons, particularly in this city.  In 1967 there were 31 assaults involving the use of knives, in 1968 there were 31 such assaults and in 1966 one death resulted from an assault involving the use of a knife. The people of the city of Dublin and the people of the country in general were very perturbed about the number of crimes involving the use of knives which had been committed in this city and throughout the country, and the Fine Gael Party campaigned very strongly for legislation which would put an end to this type of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, when the infamous Criminal Justice Bill was introduced away back in 1967, the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice at that time offered to the Minister that we would give him several provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill <Col N="426" /> dealing with the use of knives and other offensive weapons in a short Bill in this House in five minutes, but the Minister for Justice then did not agree to accept that offer and the matter dragged on, the offences continued. In order to deal with the matter, this party put down the Bill with which we are now dealing.  It remained on the Order Paper for quite a time and was reached, as I have said, on 25th February, 1970.</P>
    <P>Very briefly, the Bill proposes to outlaw the use of knives, flick knives and other such offensive weapons.  It makes it an offence for any person to produce a knife or other article capable of inflicting serious injuries, in a dance hall, marquee, cinema, club or any premises in which food or drink is served, or at any sports festival, carnival or bazaar, to produce any knife other than an ordinary penknife.</P>

It makes it an offence for any person to have a flick knife or any article made or adaptable for use for causing injury to the person.  Generally speaking, the purpose of the Bill is to outlaw the use of flick knives or similar weapons.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Dear, dear, I would have thought this brand new young Minister would not have followed in the lines of the old warrior who was there before him.  He treated us to an exhibition of that on 25th February, 1970, but he also gave us an undertaking, which I will come to in a few minutes if the present Minister for Justice will bear with me.  I have told the House the general purpose of the Bill is to make it illegal to carry certain weapons in restaurants, public houses, dance halls, at race meetings and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was a Bill that had the general approval of the House on the <Col N="427" /> last occasion.  Even the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Moran, did not quarrel with the Bill but he did abuse me at considerable length for having stolen these particular sections of this Bill from his precious Criminal Justice Bill.  I concede that, at all times, this Party said there were some good provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill but that there were some mighty objectionable sections and that we refused to accept it as a package deal&mdash;that we would accept the sections we approved of but oppose bitterly the undemocratic jackboot police state provisions contained in other sections of that measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran who was Minister for Justice at that time did not find fault with this Bill&mdash;as his recorded speeches will prove.  He claimed it as his own. He alleged I had stolen it from the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>

Subsequent to that, there were many stabbings in the city of Dublin and some deaths but the Government did not seek a Second Reading until 18th February, 1969.

There was a general election on 18th June, 1969.  When we discussed this matter before on 25th February, 1970&mdash;nearly 12 months after that general election&mdash;the Bill had not been re-introduced or re-activated. <Col N="428" /> The Minister's predecessor in office, Deputy Moran, attacked me for larceny and all sorts of things, for taking this Bill, section by section, out of his Criminal Justice Bill.  As reported at column 1642 of the Official Report of 25th February, 1970, he went on to give this undertaking to the House:</P>
      <P>We will be dealing with the Criminal Justice Bill in this House within the next couple of weeks and I will deal with it in my own way.  I am dealing with a particular portion of it that was lifted out of it by my friends opposite.</P>
      <P>He went on further to give an undertaking to this House that, whatever was removed from his Criminal Justice Bill or however it would be dolled up to satisfy the Fianna Fáil Party or the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, it would certainly have the sections which I had written into the Bill we are now discussing.</P>

The Minister said he was aware of pressure groups, various organisations, but he said that there was no dissatisfaction among the tenants and he said there was no other scheme of which he knows or which had been suggested to him that could be operated more fairly in relation to the tenants than the scheme which operates.  He said he is completely satisfied with the terms of it, especially the new scheme.</P>
      <P>We in the Labour Party are not opposed to the principle of differential rents because we believe that differential rents can operate fairly and equitably and in the interests of people who by virtue of sickness, unemployment or other things can be suffering hardship.  What we are opposed to, and very much opposed to, is the system of assessment which came into operation in the Housing Act, 1966, and that is the assessment on overtime, shift work, incentive bonuses and wages on which income tax had already been levied and where social welfare payments and superannuation payments had already been taken out of wages.  We are concerned about this and we object very strongly to the differential rent that applies in cases such as this&mdash;assessment on wages for overtime, shift work and the others.</P>

      <P>If this Deputy has been sent in to interrupt he will not succeed.  I am stating a fact here; that we are opposed to the present system. The city and county manager has the power to revise the maximum and the minimum rent whenever he thinks fit. This is another principle which we fight because, due to the power the city manager has, the city council is merely a rubber stamp.  He can change rents as he sees fit.  We deplore this and we do not think any city manager should have the power to do this.  It should be left to the council to decide whether there should be any increases in minimum or maximum rates.</P>
      <P>We are also opposed to the fact that houses which have been built from November, 1970, onwards will have new differential rents of £7 and £8 plus per week.  This is a fantastic rent to pay out of the income of any man. We are very much opposed to this. I cannot see how the Minister can say the people are satisfied or that he is satisfied with a differential rent of £7 or £8 plus, maximum, on houses built since November, 1970, or indeed flats built since November, 1970.  This decision to impose a new differential rent on houses built since 1970 was a <i>fait accompli</i>, nobody knew anything about it until a small news item appeared in the newspapers to the effect that this had already taken place.  This is the power of the city manager to which we are opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also opposed to these ancillary charges which Dublin Corporation impose in respect of central heating and things like that because the tenants have no control over the central heating, cannot regulate the cost to suit their own household and they must pay for central heating all the year round whether they use central heating or not.  Outside Dublin, even in Cork city, there is a maximum rent of £8 plus <Col N="436" /> before rates are added and if the Minister thinks that the tenants are satisfied with that he had better look at his figures and search in his Department and discuss it with his city and county managers, or perhaps he should have more frequent discussions with the officers of NATO who represent the council tenants of this country.</P>
    <P>Prior to February, 1969, any increases were subject to the sanction of the Minister for Local Government but the former Minister for Local Government, Mr. Kevin Boland, sent a circular to city and county managers in February, 1969, and in this he gave them power for any alteration in rent structure.  He told them they could increase the maximum rent by 5s in any one year without sanction even from the Minister for Local Government. This is what we are opposed to in the differential rents scheme.  In fact, the manager does not have to go to the council at all for discussion on increases: he can increase the maximum rent by 5s per week in every year.  He has full power to do so.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that Dublin Corporation tenants are second-class citizens because they are being treated like second-class citizens by the Dublin Corporation and their officials. I see evidence of this every day of the week.  Corporation tenants are obliged, at 13 weekly intervals, to furnish particulars of their income and the income of members of their household.  This is the way they treat their tenants.  If they do not furnish the particulars in time the differential rents section puts them on maximum rent and will not inform them until such time as the arrears have accumulated to the extent that a court order is issued to these people and they are threatened with immediate eviction unless the arrears are paid forthwith.  I have many dealings with the differential rents department of Dublin Corporation and I find that there is not the co-operation forthcoming that should be forthcoming in relation to these people.  They must be treated as citizens who are deserving of the same consideration as the occupants of other houses.  These people, by virtue of the fact that they were not able to purchase <Col N="437" /> their own houses, are being victimised; they are not being given the treatment they deserve.  I say there should be immediately an investigation into this to see if we can eliminate the injustices of the 1966 Housing Act so that we can have a proper differential rents system applying to these tenants.</P>
    <P>Scale B applies to all new dwellings. A four-room dwelling is 85s per week, maximum rent, plus rates.  This four-room dwelling can be a skyscraper flat in Ballymun or it can be a scheme house in Ballyfermot, Drimnagh or Crumlin.  If it is a five-room dwelling the tenant pays 95s a week.  They decide to take £1 off, based on the combined family income.  This is another source of irritation.  We all know that grown up sons and daughters in a family merely pay in enough to keep them in the household, but the entire income is taken into consideration despite the fact that already income tax has been taken out of it, superannuation, social welfare and other deductions.  Despite that the total income is taken into consideration by the differential rents section.</P>
    <P>These are the penalties.  They must sign a form authorising the corporation to approach the employers or the labour exchange.  Unless they sign that form they are obliged to bring a form to their employers every 13 weeks and ask them to fill it up, because it must be sent to the corporation.  The embarrassment, degradation and humiliation of these people is beyond words. If they fail to give notice that the family income has increased immediately they are put on maximum rent; the arrears then accumulate and court orders follow. Hundreds of court orders have been given where people have been told that they have arrears which must be paid immediately or they will be evicted.  If a member of a family is employed after an illness he must immediately get a form signed for the corporation.  A man may be asked to attend at the corporation office.  His wife's attendance is not accepted; the man must attend despite the fact that he has to take time off from his job and thus lose money.  We object to this differential rent system; it is most unacceptable.  The system is a source <Col N="438" /> of dissatisfaction and should be investigated at once.</P>

      <P>I second the motion in the names of the Leader of the Labour Party and the nine Dublin Labour Party Deputies.  The Minister told us that he finds tenants are not dissatisfied with the working of the differential rent system.  The Minister says there is no dissatisfaction among tenants.  Perhaps that is so in the Minister's constituency but I do not know how any Dublin Deputy could corroborate that statement.  I am sure that Deputy Dowling can corroborate that there is dissatisfaction.  Is the Minister telling us that the tenants who complain about the working of the system are imaginary tenants or that their grievances are imaginary?  How can the Minister take it upon himself to speak for such a large body of people? How can the Minister say they have no grievances when they themselves tell us every day of their grievances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion calls for an immediate examination of the problems associated with the working of the differential rent system.  We are not asking the Government to commit themselves to condemning the differential rent system. We do not condemn or attack the principle of a differential in rents.  All we are doing is calling on the Government for an urgent investigation and an immediate examination.  This matter affects hundreds of thousands of people in this country.  I do not wish to attack the Minister but, with respect to him, I do not think he should take it upon himself as Minister to say that he knows best what the tenants think and feel.  The Minister's predecessor was inclined to do that sort of thing; he always knew best.  He is not here now and the present Minister has shown in many respects considerable sensitivity. We do not think it enough that one man should say what the tenants think and feel.  It is not enough to have a piecemeal look at each individual case or for the Minister or an official to say in regard to a particular case: &ldquo;There is hard luck there&rdquo;.  We submit that such an approach would not be an adequate way of examining a question which affects many parts of this country and will, eventually, affect all local <Col N="439" /> authority tenants.  This matter affects the lives of people in our cities as well as in other parts of the country.  The pressures are felt particularly in the cities.  In recent times there has been an increasing tendency in the world to feel that the problems of the cities need to be carefully examined before they get out of hand.  There is a certain pattern in the great housing estates of the cities which needs close and careful examination.  Such an investigation could well begin with a study of how the rent system is experienced by corporation tenants.</P>
    <P>We suggest that a panel of competent people should be set up comprised of economists, social scientists and social psychologists and that these people should conduct open hearings into the question of rent.  Such a body should be prepared to hear individual tenants and representatives of the tenants' organisations.  The Minister should try not to follow the example of his predecessor in dismissing the tenants' organisations simply as groups of agitators. These organisations now represent a great many people.  The National Association of Tenants' Organisations have now a network throughout the country and are in close touch with the tenants.  This organisation may be in closer touch with the tenants than the Minister is.  This problem is too complex and delicate to be left to a few civil servants.  This is a case where there must be social sensitivity.  Intelligence is needed in dealing with this large scale problem.</P>
    <P>I have tried to explain what we mean by &ldquo;examination&rdquo;.  I should also like to stress the need for urgency.  This matter cannot be left on the long finger. It is not a matter which need take an immense amount of time to examine. This is a small country.  The position could be ascertained and analysed comparatively quickly.  We are asking that this examination on an adequate scale by adequate methods be set in train now.  An early date should be fixed for an examining panel to report back.  The policies should be urgently reviewed in the light of this examination.  This is not an unreasonable request.  It would be hard to convince a gathering of local <Col N="440" /> authority tenants that it was an unreasonable request.  Any Dublin Deputy could, and would with pleasure, take the Minister into many places where he would hear people, who are just ordinary tenants and not agitators, express their feelings about this subject. It is time that the problem was examined. We realise that the people on whom the situation bears heavily are not necessarily the best people to devise methods for handling the problem, but such people can tell where the shoe pinches and they need to be heard.</P>
    <P>There are certain questions that should be looked into and form part of any such examination.  A basic question is: how can the differential principle, the equity of which in theory is clear, be applied in practice with the minimum of hardship and uncertainty?  I should like to emphasise that this is the kind of question we here are asking. We sometimes find that we get an answer which is not dealing with the question we are actually putting.  We are answered as if we were saying there is no basis in equity for a differential system.  We are agreeing that there is such a basis.  What we are challenging is the working of the present differential system.</P>
    <P>What we are asking for&mdash;and surely it is a fair request at this late date, when this has been in operation for a good many years, in its present form for five years&mdash;is that this should be looked into now.  Among the specific questions that could be put is: should overtime be included in the calculation of differential rent?  Is that fair? Where a man in full-time employment chooses, in the interests of his family, to undertake extra overtime work, is it socially desirable or justifiable that he should both be taxed on his extra earnings and have his rent raised on the basis of these earnings?</P>
    <P>What again are the effects of including teenage earnings in the calculation of a differential?  What are the effects of that on the family relations in households paying rents of this kind? What are the effects in a family if a given teenager becomes a tenant for the purpose of the differential system for a certain time and is, perhaps, then <Col N="441" /> replaced by another teenager, while the father is reduced under this system to a secondary role in his own house? What is the effect of that on a father's authority?  What is the effect of it on his self-respect?</P>
    <P>Are these trivial questions?  Are they questions to which a Minister or a civil servant can say he knows the answer without further inquiry or are they not questions that should be looked on as affecting the whole social climate of our cities?  Is it right that a city manager, say, and the Minister, should have the ultimate decision on the introduction of a differential rent scheme? At present, once a manager's scheme is sanctioned by the Minister, the elected council have no recourse to alter such a scheme.  That brings us back to precisely the bureaucratic principle we come up against all the time which has been expressed, of course, in the abolition of the Dublin City Council, and it brings us back to the point where a Minister can say &ldquo;I know there is no dissatisfaction&rdquo; and close&mdash;if he has finally closed and I hope he has not&mdash;his ears and mind to the evidence of dissatisfaction that is all round him.</P>
    <P>Here again on that aspect of the whole matter generally, I would hope that in particular the Dublin Deputies who are here and who know that the dissatisfaction exists which the Minister denies will be heard from in this discussion and that they will urge on the Minister, not necessarily the various propositions which we here would maintain, but at least the desirability of an inquiry into this matter.  I hope that if they believe there is no need for an inquiry they will tell us and tell their own constituents exactly why they think that.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister have the power to revise the maximum and minimum figure whenever he sees fit?  Just as the question of the ultimate decision being in the Minister's hands raises questions about democracy and about engaging citizens in the operation of their society, so this really raises questions of contract.  Here the Minister, or the local authority guided by the Minister, representing one side of this, has the power to vary it upwards. Despite the fact that the tenant enters <Col N="442" /> an agreement with a local authority on tenancy to occupy a dwelling on a rent scale with an agreed maximum, that maximum is never binding on the local authority.  It can be altered at any time they see fit.  Can a one-sided contract of that kind be termed an agreement, and is it the kind of document that will really bind people together as they should be bound with a recognition that this is a fundamental and equitable thing?</P>
    <P>We do not believe, we here do not accept, the idea that local authority tenants are, by definition, unreasonable people.  We disapprove of and reject the faintly contemptuous tone sometimes used by Ministers in relation to tenants.  We believe that they know their rights and that they are responsible if they are dealt with in a reasonable way, but provisions of this kind, many of the provisions and practices of the differential code being unreasonable themselves, are of a nature to raise an unreasonable spirit in those whom they affect.  This is again a matter which we think could be looked into.</P>
    <P>The tenants' objections, like our objections here, are not to differential rents as such, but rather to the scheme as it has existed since 1966.  The Minister has stated that, in cases where hardships suffered as a result of this scheme are proven, he will see that such hardships are eliminated.  Again there seems to be here a recognition that in part at least there is dissatisfaction or could be dissatisfaction, but it is only accepted in a sort of retailed piecemeal way.</P>
    <P>The city manager of Cork city, Mr. Patrick Clayton, whose approach to this matter deserves, in a considerable degree at least, to be commended, speaking of modifications he intended making in the rents and rates structure of corporation tenants in Cork said &ldquo;I am satisfied that these charges can inflict hardship on families in these areas.  The abatement suggested will, to some extent, alleviate this hardship.&rdquo;  In the approach of the Cork city manager there is at least the kind of spirit that we should like to see adopted more generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is a relatively new Minister, has the power to set a new <Col N="443" /> tone in this matter.  He can help the tenants of this country and, through them, our society generally by agreeing to the kind of immediate examination we propose here.  We very much hope that during this discussion he will intimate he is prepared to move in that direction.  We believe that, if he does so, he will elicit a very great degree of affirmation from public opinion generally in this country.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party gladly endorse the request in this motion that the Government should undertake an immediate examination of the system of differential rents, particularly in relation to the hardships and injustices caused by the implementation of the B Scheme in operation in the Dublin area.  The moderate language of the motion is such that no reasonable person dare vote against it. It asks for an examination of possible hardships and injustices and to refuse to conduct such an examination into such allegations would be to foment still further the discontent that already exists.  To suggest, as the Minister does, that there is no dissatisfaction in the operation of the differential rent scheme is to deny the experience of mankind over thousands of years.  What causes most of the unrest in relation to differential rents is the very same issue as caused the dispute in the biblical vineyard; people are required under the differential rent scheme to pay different rents for the same accommodation.  We know what happened in the vineyard; the workers received the same pay for doing varying amounts of work.  No matter how just the scheme may be in principle, so long as people are called upon to pay varying amounts for similar accommodation so long will there be dissatisfaction, and to suggest otherwise is to be unrealistic.  There is a great deal more in the dissatisfaction than the mere biblical dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the happiest growths, I think, in our society has been the organisation of tenants, of residents and of people in their own localities in their own interests.  Equally fortunate has been the manner in which the various tenant and residents' organisations have extended their interests far beyond their <Col N="444" /> own selfish concerns and have involved themselves in helping their fellow citizens throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The national association of tenant organisations has been, I think, a very, very happy development in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a danger&mdash; it still exists&mdash;that our society would be organised in such a way that you would have a super-structure above the ground without adequate foundations and an artificial growth with insufficient roots.  Any structure of that kind, whether it be contrived by man or whether it be the product of man's application to nature, will tend to be overthrown, tend to fall over in times of stress and in times of storm.  We are very lucky in that the principal development in our society in recent times has been the manner in which the roots have been extended and the way in which our society has taken on greater security by the growth of tenant and residents' organisations because the roots of our society have now gone down and our society can, therefore, be better nourished, better governed and more secure than it would be if we merely had a bureaucratic growth imposed upon it.  To treat such organisations as arrogant, as selfish, as pressure groups without merit, which is what the Minister has done, is to do a grave disservice to our society.  I would urge the Minister to listen and, having listened, to consider the merits of the representations and to endeavour to achieve a rent scheme which will be more acceptable than that which at present operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that much of the disincentive to working overtime, one of the disincentives to the increase in productivity in industry, is the immense taxation which is taken off earnings, partly by income tax and partly by differential rent schemes.  The knowledge that up to one-third of one's income will be taken off in tax and a further one-sixth in differential rent is a serious disincentive to people endeavouring to increase their earnings. What is particularly unfair in relation to the assessment of overtime earnings is the fact that quite frequently <Col N="445" /> in our industrial society overtime is but a temporary experience.  The differential rent scheme is such that a person's rent is more often than not assessed in arrear and a person is, therefore, called upon to pay a higher rent at a time when his income is reduced. If overtime is seasonal the increased rent is not paid during the time of increased earnings and, in the pattern of our society, in which savings are not engaged in to the extent to which they should perhaps, there are very few people who have sufficient put aside to meet the increased differential rent which is assessed at the time when overtime is discontinued.</P>
    <P>Quite often the reason for the cessation of overtime may be due to domestic circumstances, not to the fact that overtime is not available but because the ill-health of the earner, of the worker, prevents him working overtime or because the ill-health or the domestic circumstances of some particular member of the family may make the earning of overtime impossible.  At such times, when the income is reduced and there are extra burdens upon the family fortunes, we have the unfair practice of charging a higher rent than that which obtains when the income is greater.  These are samples of the kind of elements within our existing system which give rise to dissatisfaction and it seems to me only appropriate that the Minister should endeavour to have such changes made in the system as would obviate these difficulties.  We know that there are certain allowances deducted from earnings before income is assessed for rent purposes.  It is very proper, I think, that we should now consider the adequacy of the allowances.  The current allowances were fixed five years ago after a delay of 17 years from the time the previous allowances were fixed and, when they were fixed five years ago, they were totally inadequate. Whatever inadequacy they had then has been multiplied in the passing years.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest failings of the differential rent scheme is the fact that it does not give adequate allowances in respect of necessary family expenses. We know in the Dublin area, for instance, that 82 to 84 per cent of the people are not entitled to the medical <Col N="446" /> card and are, therefore, deprived of free medical services for ordinary home medical expenses, but such expenses are not taken into consideration in the calculation of a family's means and there are many cases in which serious hardship occurs, in which weekly health bills can be from £2 to £5, and more, per week.  No consideration is given to that aspect in the assessment of means for differential rent purposes even though such necessary payments are made from the family income.  This seems to me to be a very serious difficulty. Mark you, people who are fortunate enough to have sufficient to pay income tax are allowed, but only in recent years, health expenses.</P>
    <P>We listened for many years to Fianna Fáil Ministers saying it would be impossible to have a scheme under which health allowances against tax could be given in respect of necessary medical expenses but, in the long run, the simplicity of the proposal and the fairness of it won out and such allowances are now permitted for income tax purposes.  I would urge the Minister to amend the differential rent scheme so that necessary medical expenses, which are not covered by the local authority through the medical card system, or otherwise, are allowable before the assessment of income for the purpose of calculating differential rent.  As has already been mentioned, hardship occurs quite frequently because of delays on the part of the local authority in the assessment of a person's means with the result that even thrifty tenants who discharge all their obligations under the scheme of notification of income to the local authority find that considerable debits are charged against them in bulk with instant demands for prompt payment and with embarrassing and expensive legal proceedings if prompt payment is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>To argue this way is not to criticise the unfortunate officials who are called upon to operate the differential rent scheme.  It is, of course, where people have small incomes, a reasonable scheme because it allows them to pay a much smaller rent than is economic and than they would otherwise have to bear but it can be a very harsh <Col N="447" /> scheme because it is so inflexible, because it does not adjust itself rapidly enough to family fortunes and because bureaucracy, being what it is, inevitably delays occur with consequential injustices and big debts being imposed upon unfortunate families.</P>
    <P>We concerned ourselves a great deal last year, here and elsewhere, with the social problems that arise out of money lending.  Although the matter was inquired into we are not all happy that the full truth is yet known or that our society is sufficiently protected against the danger of money lending. But, let it be said here, that quite often one of the causes for people going to money lenders, licensed and unlicensed, and paying to them tremendous rates of interest is these debits that are applied against them under the differential rents scheme.  Where such people are faced with the alternatives of eviction or paying their rents they must, in most cases, go cap-in-hand to the money lenders in order to get their money.  Great praise is due to the credit union movement for coming to the rescue of many people who find themselves, through no fault of their own, faced with considerable debits under the differential rents scheme but, as is only human, people look with suspicion upon tenants in any sector, whether public or private, who have considerable rent arrears to pay and it is not always possible to get advances from the credit unions to pay differential rents.</P>
    <P>So, here we have this evil, this cause of dissatisfaction arising out of the operation of differential rent schemes. To identify these things as we are doing is not to say that in principle the scheme is wrong but it is to remind the Minister that there are matters which deserve immediate examination and that there are possibly several remedies or better schemes which could be introduced.  Our request, sincerely made, is that the Minister would endeavour to adopt a scheme which would meet some of these particular problems.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, responsibility for every differential rent scheme lies with the Minister for Local Government.  One <Col N="448" /> of the great drawbacks of the so-called system of local government that operates here is that it is in most cases little more than a distribution of responsibility or blame or an instrument for confusing the people as to whole is ultimately to blame for any act of any local authority or public authority. But no differential rent scheme may be applied by any local authority which does not conform with the requirements of the Minister for Local Government, his general requirements in the first instance and his particular permission in the final analysis.  Therefore, each of the differential rent schemes in operation in Dublin or elsewhere, A, B or C, or the scheme in operation since 1st November, 1970, for houses let since then, has the <i>nihil obstat,</i> the <i>imprimatur</i> and approval and blessing of the Minister and therefore whatever variations local authorities may suggest to the Minister, he cannot escape from the fact that any scheme is his scheme and that he is totally responsible for it, and if the scheme does not meet with his approval it is open to him to decline to give his consent to it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to deal with one particular aspect in regard to housing rents of local authorities and that is how he can justify making a change of, say, £5 per week under a differential rent scheme for a house which was built 30 or 35 years ago at a cost of £500.  Applying a rent of such dimensions to such a property means the local authority can recover within two years the capital cost of a property which was built 30 or 35 years ago.  The theory, of course, is that the cost of replacing such a property today has to be related to present-day or potential cost and not to the cost at the time of building.  This is a matter which causes grave dissatisfaction to tenants and before the Minister blithely assumes that everybody is content and that nobody is unhappy he should apply his mind to these things which certainly are a cause of unease and upset.</P>
    <P>Dublin is a vast and growing area and one of the principal causes of complaint on the part of tenants is that they have to travel so far at such great inconvenience and often at such cost in order to have their appropriate rents <Col N="449" /> assessed by an official in the corporation office in Jervis Street.  I ask the Minister to urge Dublin Corporation. to open at various convenient places throughout the city local rent offices so that assessments could be made without requiring the breadwinner as happens in many cases to give up a half day's employment or more and then on presenting himself at the differential rent office having to join a long queue of people before his particular problem is dealt with.  This is not fair.  This imposes a burden of inconvenience on tenants which we must endeavour to discourage so that tenants will be treated as they are entitled to be treated: with all the respect which is theirs as citizens of no mean city, tenants who are good breadwinners, good family people, good members of society and who have genuine grievances and are not looking for the earth, not expecting the Minister or the corporation to give them free accommodation.  They are not looking for gifts.  All they are asking is that their reasonable complaints receive sympathetic consideration, and their experience in the past shows that they have not been receiving that consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to return briefly to the question of the allowances that are to be given.  Any working man in one of the large corporation estates who uses the bus to go to and from his place of employment and works a five-day week will pay not less than 14s 2d and in many cases up to 18s for making one journey to his work and one journey home per day.  That is on the basis of present-day bus fares and I am talking about the minimum payable from places like Ballyfermot, Finglas and Ballymun and, as the Minister knows, the new housing estates are being built more and more remote from the city centre.  In many cases, because of the unsatisfactory pattern of building, people who work on the south side of the city, perhaps on the outskirts of the south side, at Tallaght or Clondalkin, are being housed in Coolock and Ballymun.  On that account their bus fares can go up to £1 10s or £2 per week.  What is such a person allowed as a necessary deduction before calculation of means for the purpose <Col N="450" /> of determining the differential rent he should pay?  £1 is the figure although even at the time this was fixed bus fares were about 50 per cent of what they are today.  This clearly indicates that these basic deductions must be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, the principal income earner is allowed a deduction of only £1 but other earners of income in the house are allowed deductions of £3 a week.  I would urge on the Minister that the allowance of the principal earner should not be less than £3.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this Bill last week I was reminded by several Opposition Deputies that this is not a Housing Bill but one to prevent forcible entry of premises, vehicles and waters and to prevent such things as fish-ins.  Housing is definitely mentioned in the interpretation section of the Bill and I make no apology for speaking very often in this House as forcefully as I can on housing.  The housing problem in this city is the biggest problem facing us here.  The Minister stated in regard to the size of the housing problem that it was not so great as some critics would have us believe and this is quite true.  On numerous occasions we have heard the hoary statement being trotted out that we have 10,000 homeless families in the city.  Once again I want to refute that figure.  We have not even 10,000 applicants for housing.  The number of homeless families is very small, for which we are thankful, but the number of badly-housed families is a different matter and we have quite a few of these.  The only way to house every family and every person who qualifies is to provide an adequate number of dwellings for them.  This is and always <Col N="451" /> has been the policy of the Government, to use all their energies so that within a reasonable time the fullest possible number will be housed.  The time will never be reached when it can be said of any city that there is nobody in need of better housing in it.  Such a situation can never be brought about in any country.  I am saying this in order to try to bring some proportion into our views on the housing problem and to show why there is need for new legislation in regard to housing, buildings, land and water.</P>
      <P>I suspect that many Deputies opposite have a kind of love-hate relationship to the housing problem in this city.  They speak about what is being done in England and in other countries in regard to housing; there is nothing wrong with this if we really examine what these countries are doing and what we are doing here.  In proportion to our resources and our manpower we are making progress just as fast as other countries, bearing in mind the greater wealth of most of the other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years the housing drive and the housing of people in this city have been the target of several agitation groups.  To my mind they have always been suspect because I believe they were much more interested in political agitation than in housing the people.  The hypocrisy of these people was shown up in regard to one housing scheme in the city, that was in regard to Sarah Place which is near Phoenix Park.  Many people may not have heard of this place in which the houses were very run down.  Indeed, they were condemned by the city medical officer and the planning staff of the corporation. The corporation offered the tenants houses elsewhere and sought to demolish the old houses but the agitators moved in, they squatted there, they fought the corporation workmen and they did everything possible to prevent re-development, without, I may say, the wishes of the residents.  Thanks to the good sense of the people of this city and to Dublin Corporation the people were re-housed elsewhere and these very old dwellings were demolished. If one is passing by the Phoenix <Col N="452" /> Park, near the Islandbridge area, it is well worth visiting these modern flats in which many families are happily housed despite the actions of the agitators.</P>
    <P>I accuse those agitators of trying to make political capital out of the misery of badly-housed families.  When we need legislation like this there is something wrong with a section of our society who would stoop to using these people who are not properly housed, not in the hope that they will be housed but in the hope that they themselves may cause some trouble.  Indeed, through their agitation they cause a lot of suffering to people who become involved unwittingly in their scheme. As a public representative I want to say that there will always be people who will show up the hypocrisy of these agitators.  If they want to indulge in political agitation let them pick on some other section of the community rather than on those who are badly in need of re-housing.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will prove to be a deterrent in regard to those who break the law for their own political ends. It is not enough to criticise agitators and we should show what is being done in the housing line.  The latest figures show that Dublin Corporation have 2,377 dwellings actually under construction and a further 2,400 are either being developed, or the sites are being developed, or the preliminary steps are being taken to ensure that these houses and flats will be built with the least possible delay.  This gives us a total of almost 5,000 dwellings. If one remembers that the official housing application list is for about 4,000 one might well say that in two years time we will have enough houses; but unfortunately this is not true because in a growing city the demand will always grow.  In a growing city it may only take one hour or two hours for a whole family to arrive back from the States or from England but it takes a much longer time to build a house or flat for them.</P>
    <P>We know today that the population is increasing due to a rising birth-rate and to the fact that there is practically no emigration.  We know also that there is full employment in the building trade <Col N="453" /> in the city so that even if we had all the money and land we needed we might still have a problem that we would not have an adequate labour force.  I rejoice in the fact that our building workers have full employment. My party have always given top priority to workers in this industry to ensure that dwellings are available and that craftsmen and their helpers do not have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>One Opposition speaker suggested that the episode regarding the Georgian houses in Hume Street and the abolition of the city council were connected. This is utter nonsense because there is no connection whatever.  The speaker mentioned several well-known citizens who had taken part in the squatting at Hume Street.  In that episode the owners of the property eventually took action.  To my mind both sides were wrong because both broke the law.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the rule of law must obtain and if a group or section have a grievance they can have recourse to the courts of justice.  If our laws are inadequate to protect the interest of one group or the other, provided it is a legitimate interest we should amend the law.  In fact, this is what the Minister is doing in this Bill because there is a need for legislation in this matter.  I do not care if people squat in a Georgian building, in private property or in a local authority house.  If they break the law the law must take issue with them.</P>
    <P>The only squatters with whom I would have sympathy are the homeless family who cannot get accommodation. At the same time, I want to state my attitude in this respect.  Squatting is wrong and, therefore, the law must act.  However, my sympathy is with those families who are made the scapegoat by agitators who urge people to squat in every house and on every piece of property but who soon put a stop to any squatting on their own property.  I should like to see the time when we will not have any need for legislation such as this or for other legislation that throws the onus on the resources of the State to prosecute and to uphold the law.  I suggest to the people who are interested in the re-housing of the homeless or of those <Col N="454" /> who are badly-housed, or the people who wish to preserve the architectural gems of the city, that there is a way of doing it.  The proper way is through the law; fewer people get hurt and more progress could be made.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been condemned by some of those whom I have accused of using the misery of a badly-housed family for their own political ends. This is to be expected but, perhaps, it is not too late to appeal to them, if they are sincere in their interest in this matter, that for once they would back the Establishment.  In this way the housing drive could be pursued with greater intensity and thus gain in momentum until we reach the stage that the housing problem is reduced to minimal proportions.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for speaking as if this were a Housing Bill.  I should like to bring home to those who take the law into their own hands&mdash;whether they are members of the affluent society or members of a political group&mdash;that if our society is to prevail they must work through the law.  If political parties are not satisfied with the present state of affairs they can go to the people; if they are returned to office they can take what steps they consider necessary to achieve their ends.</P>
    <P>In his brief the Minister commented that in our society we have got no permanent majorities or permanent minorities, and this is true.  What we must understand is that if democracy is to survive this will only be achieved by respect for the law.  If the law is wrong, unjust or ineffective we must change it. Surely that is the whole point of this Bill&mdash;that the Government have seen that some changes for the better are necessary.  If the people whom I have criticised tonight want to show that their interest is sincere and deep in re-housing of the needy, let them follow the example of groups such as the Catholic Housing Aid Society, the Dublin Central Mission of the Methodist Church, the Soroptimist Club or the Legion of Mary who have provided housing and have shown their interest in alleviating suffering among the homeless.</P>
    <P>I admit that some squatting is caused by the scarcity of dwellings but to subscribe <Col N="455" /> to the view that squatting is right will result in chaos and the first to suffer will be the weakest section.  This has happened already in the case of the blind man, whom I mentioned last week.  He was deprived of a good flat by some adults&mdash;not a young family&mdash; who occupied his flat.  There was also the case of the young lady whose flat was occupied by squatters while she was in hospital.  The weaker section will suffer unless we realise there is need for a change in legislation.  This legislation is introduced in the interests of the people as a whole and not for the benefit of the large property owners.  I would refer to a question put to me by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  He asked me did I not believe that this Bill was weighted on the side of the property owners as against the homeless or those in need of housing?  I do not believe this is so. I hold no brief for many of the property owners but unless we have an ordered society those who will suffer most are the poor.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will give a greater measure of relief to those who are seeking houses.  The letting conditions for houses were not drawn up by this Government or even by an official of the corporation but were drawn up by members of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party in the council. We drew up these letting regulations to the best of our ability and in the belief that they were fair and equitable, and until the council or the commissioner alters these letting regulations I certainly shall uphold them at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill have, rightly in my view, aroused feelings of suspicion and dismay among Deputies.  Nobody doubts that if a situation exists in which property rights are endangered and people are intimidated by violence or threats of force, the Government should and must take action.  The question is whether such a situation now exists, whether what is complained of or pointed to at the moment is sufficiently serious to warrant the wide provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy Moore and other Deputies referred to the many <Col N="456" /> incidents of squatting in unused or temporarily vacant houses and it has been suggested that these incidents constitute a justification for this Bill. I do not think there would be many Deputies who would disagree with me when I say that squatting is or can be in certain circumstances a very grave social ill.  Not only is it an unwarranted interference with property but if organised by groups of cynical and callous men it can lead to a complete breakdown of law and order.  I for one would have no hesitation in condemning and taking action against those who organise such activities, not only because they act in open defiance of the law but because by their actions they may deprive genuinely deserving people of benefits or rights to which they can, with reason, aspire.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I doubt very much whether this problem is so serious and so widespread as to justify the provisions of this Bill.  There has been organised squatting I have no doubt, organised by people who were prepared to fight to the last drop of the other man's blood.  We have often had that kind of pseudo bravery in certain times in this country, but in my view that kind of organised squatting has now disappeared, and I believe it has disappeared chiefly because it aroused no sympathy among the ordinary people. If I am right in that view&mdash;and I detect in the Minister's speech some confirmation of what I am saying&mdash;I, first of all, question the wisdom of directing public attention in this way to a problem which is no longer serious.  In so doing misunderstanding can be caused and there is a grave prospect of engendering a sense of grievance among people quick to take affront.  Therefore at this stage in relation to this problem, I question the wisdom of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, I want to raise the question whether, if squatting is really a problem that this Bill purports to deal with, there are not at the moment sufficient powers available to the executive forces of this State to deal with this problem.  I believe there are.  The Minister himself referred to a section which we passed last year, section 13 of the Housing Act of 1970.  That section made it an offence for an unauthorised <Col N="457" /> person to enter, obtain possession of or to occupy a local authority house.  It was not a question of force. That need not be proved.  All that was required was the lack of authority. That section is there.  It is an offence for anyone to enter without authority and to squat in a local authority house. This House passed that section of the Housing Act of 1970, and what more is required from a local authority point of view than to operate and enforce the law as it is?</P>
    <P>I should like to know why this section so recently written into our Housing Act is now to be regarded a few months later as inadequate, not sufficient, and why we are to be invited to pass the Draconian provisions of this Bill.  Section 13 of the Housing Act, 1970, of course, deals only with local authority houses and does not necessarily deal with the general problem of forcible entry and detainer or occupation of lands or premises.  Needless to say, this problem of forcible entry, this problem of detaining a house, premises or land against the wishes and will of the owner, this problem of forcible occupation of something which does not belong to the person exercising the occupation, has been known to the law for hundreds of years, if not for over a thousand years.  It is well to state that forcible entry and detainer of land is an offence at common law.  It requires no statute to make it an offence.  It is a common law misdemeanour punishable with fine or imprisonment or both, and that was so before ever any statute was passed.</P>
    <P>Again, why has that not been recognised, why has the law not been enforced?  Poynings Law brought common law into force in this country and the plain fact is that this offence of forcible entry or detainer of land is there and has been there through the centuries, known and recognised as a common law offence.  It is true that in relation to the common law offence of forcible entry or detainer there had to be proof of such force as constituted a public breach of the peace, a riot or unlawful assembly.  Unlawful assembly is an assembly of two people or more. A public breach of the peace can be <Col N="458" /> committed by one man on his own, but to constitute the common law offence of forcible entry it was necessary to prove a public breach of the peace, a riot or unlawful assembly.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that away back in 1351 the Statute Fifth of Richard II, Chapter 7, dealing with forcible entry, was passed.  It provides:</P>
    <P>And also the king defends that none from henceforth may make any entry into any lands or tenements but in cases where entry is given by the law and in such cases not with strong hand nor with multitude of people but only in a peaceable and easy manner, and if any man from henceforth does to the contrary and thereof be duly convicted he shall be punished by imprisonment of his body and thereof ransomed at the king's will.</P>
    <P>That is a statute passed in 1351 enforcing the common law, making it crystal clear that the forces of the Legislature and the Executive would be available to protect people against forcible entry or the forcible usurpation of their lands, houses or other premises.</P>
    <P>That Act was reinforced and confirmed by another statute passed in the 15th year of Richard II, Chapter 2, the Forcible Entries (Amendment) Act, which gave added powers to enforce the rights of people to be protected against this type of forcible entry. Then, in 1429, by the Statute Eighth, Henry VI, Chapter 9, it was declared to be an offence if a person having entered land peacefully, without force, without strong hand, as has been referred to in the Richard II Act, sought to retain possession by force.  That was deemed to be an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>So that by 1429 it had been declared by statute that either forcible entry or forcible detainer of lands, premises or house property, or whatever it may be, were criminal offences punishable accordingly in the interests of the custodians of the law.  Then, in 1786, by a statute of the Irish Parliament, Twenty-sixth, George III, Chapter 24, added powers were given and forcible entry or detainer was made a felony punishable with penal servitude not <Col N="459" /> exceeding seven years or less than three years or by imprisonment not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>They are the powers now at this moment available to the Executive, to the Garda, to every person who has responsibility for executing the law, of seeing that it is enforced and of protecting the rights of the people.  One extant statute of the Irish Parliament provides that forcible entry or detainer is a felony, and on information in relation to the committal of a felony it is the bounden duty of any member of the Garda to effect an arrest.</P>
    <P>The first point I wish to make is that, in my opinion, at the moment ample powers both at common law and under statute exist to deal with the problem of squatting, if squatting exists as a problem.  In those circumstances I question with absolute sincerity why this new measure, these new powers, should be sought.  If there was reluctance to act under laws merely because they are old laws, is there reluctance to act under the common law merely because it arises from the good sense and the conscience of the people?</P>
    <P>Why should we come in 1971 into this Parliament to ask for precisely the same powers to brand as a criminal offence precisely the same act?  Why should this be done?  There must be some reason.  If there is not a reason clear to be understood, then one's suspicion must be aroused.</P>
    <P>It is true that this Bill deals with more than lands and premises.  It deals with aircraft not in flight, with trains, with omnibuses, with boats, yachts, ships and vessels.  Is that the real reason for this Bill?  If so, why was it not so stated, or are these powers necessary to prevent a group of misguided people going into a CIE depot and boarding and refusing to leave an omnibus, or going to Dublin Airport, climbing aboard and refusing to leave an Aer Lingus plane?  If these are the real reasons, why has it not been so stated?  It is true to say that in the Minister's opening statement scarcely a reference was made to any problem arising in relation to the occupation of vehicles as defined in the Bill.  If there is a problem in relation <Col N="460" /> to vehicles it would seem to me that in order to take possession of an omnibus or aircraft, or any of these other objects mentioned in the section, a person would in fact have to make forcible entry into land.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot see that the addition of these particular objects or articles could justify the Bill.  In any event, there the Bill is.  The Minister says it is necessary.  He has the right to propose it here and has done so.</P>
    <P>What does this Bill provide?  Assume the Minister rightly believes that squatting is a problem, that it has got to be dealt with, that existing laws are inadequate and that he wants this Bill &mdash;and assume one could travel with him the road so far&mdash;what does he ask for here?  In section 2 he asks us to legislate that any person who forcibly enters land or a vehicle shall be guilty of an offence unless he is the owner or, if he is not the owner, he does not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the land and leaves when asked to leave.  Let us leave aside the trimmings.  Here, we are asked to pass, without any refinement, a section which says:</P>
    <P>Any person who forcibly enters land shall be guilty of an offence</P>
    <P>and &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; means</P>
    <P>using or threatening to use force in relation to person or property.</P>
    <P>Now, let us pause and think where we are going.  That section applies generally to all cases.  There is no refinement, qualification, proviso.  It applies generally to all cases.  The Minister says, as reported at column 78 of the Official Report, Volume 251, words to this effect: &ldquo;It will not apply to private disputes.&rdquo; Now, there is an old saying in the courts that what the soldier says is not evidence&mdash;and what the Minister says is not legislation. There is no good in the Minister's coming and telling us here that that section will not apply to ordinary private disputes between landlord and tenant, mortgagor and mortgagee, and so on.  That section is a general section which lays down that anyone who forcibly enters&mdash;and, with section 3&mdash; who forcibly seeks to retain possession or occupation shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Now, between here and Dalkey, there are a lot of tenants living in a particular estate.  They have found, quite recently, that a <i>lacuna</i> existed in legislation passing through this House. I am sure it will not come, but it could come to a situation in which, in all rights under the law, the owner of that estate might seek to eject a tenant or tenants from a house or houses which they have occupied, in the case of some families, for over one hundred years, from houses which in respect of which they have genuinely believed they have acquired, or are entitled to acquire, statutory rights. If such an effort were made I imagine that, to put it mildly, threatening language would be used; putting it mildly, the other cheek would not be turned; putting it very mildly, everybody commonly affected would organise to frustrate such an effort. These people would be guilty of a criminal offence under section 2 because, either collectively or as individuals, they were doing something that, in their conscience and morally, they believed they were entitled to do.</P>
    <P>What is the justification for a section of that kind?  It applies even though a person may have a genuine belief that he has a right to enter or remain.  No matter what his genuine belief may be, no matter how <i>bona fide</i> his action may be, no matter how right he thinks he is, this piece of legislation says he is guilty of a criminal offence.</P>

      <P>I will look after <i>alia:</i> the Minister can look after the <i>inter</i>.  Section 5, which relates to a claim or shade of right, merely provides <Col N="462" /> that, in any proceedings under sections 2, 3 or 4 of the Act, unless the defendant shows to the satisfaction of the court that he has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership of the land, it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to prove ownership.  That is all that section provides. It merely excuses the prosecution, where there is a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right, from the onus of proving ownership.  But it still leaves the position that, the prosecution proving ownership, the holding of a <i>bona fide</i> conviction that he has a claim of right is no defence.  Now, will the Minister perhaps deal with that?</P>

      <P>If he has a tenancy, he has the right to possession.  I am asking the Minister to assume&mdash;nothing very improbable&mdash;a situation in which a person believes <i>bona fide</i> that the landlord's agent was authorised to grant him a monthly or a weekly tenancy of this particular house or premises and, acting on the faith of that, he puts in his furniture and brings his wife and family along there and proceeds to go in and his entry is barred by the true owner.  He asks: &ldquo;What do you mean by seeking to prevent me?&rdquo;&mdash;and he forces his way in.  It transpires that the person who gave him the tenancy&mdash;let me take an extreme example&mdash;was an impostor: the tenancy agreement was a forgery.  Under the Minister's section, that unfortunate person has committed a criminal offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it is an impossible position.  All right, there is not an impostor and there is not a forgery but if I am given a monthly tenancy of my house I understand, perhaps wrongly, that unless something happens at the end of that month, I am entitled to stay there for another month.  The Minister will concede that that is not a very unreasonable belief.  However, it may be legally false if, on the first expiration of my <Col N="463" /> monthly tenancy, my landlord tells me to get out, to take my wife and family and belongings and go out on to the street.  I may react to that and may react without any lawful right whatsoever but I may genuinely believe that I am entitled to a continuing tenancy in that house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has sufficient experience as a lawyer to know that what I am saying is right. This is a rushed piece of legislation brought together and patched together by people who did not think before they wrote it.  It is perfectly clear from sections 2 and 3 that a person acting in accordance with a belief which he holds honestly, but which is in contravention of the bald wording of the sections, will be branded as a criminal.</P>
      <P>I am sure it is not necessary to remind Deputies that even in the worst of times when stealing was a capital offence and when a young boy who stole a loaf and ran away was caught and, irrespective of his age, was strung up, when the law to anyone with a conscience and a belief in charity must have appeared a tyranny, if one was able to show that he believed genuinely that he had a right to what he took or what he sought to take, that was accepted as and still remains an absolute defence to a charge of larceny.  So it should be.  Would it not be utterly wrong if the mere act of my picking up and taking from here a briefcase that was similar to my own and, perhaps refusing to hand it over, should constitute a criminal offence whereas, in fact, I took it genuinely believing that the article in question was my own?  Of course, it was not, nor is the house that the disappointed tenant sought to reenter his own.  He may have no rights in law but he is acting genuinely in possession of a <i>bona fide</i> belief that he has a right to do what he is doing, but section 2 says he is a criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the justification for this kind of legislation?  It is the type of legislation of which we have had far too much emanating in recent years <Col N="464" /> from the Minister's Department&mdash;legislation that is threatened, brought in, withdrawn and all the rest of it.  Is there any thinking on the part of anyone there?  Do they balance the social need against the proposal that is being put forward?  Are we to have a situation in which half the defaulting tenants throughout the country are to be branded suddenly as criminals?  I do not understand this kind of legislation.</P>

      <P>I pointed out that what the Minister says is not legislation, just as what the soldier says is not evidence.  I have now convinced the Minister that sections 2 and 3 of this Bill are of general application and can apply, by reason of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, to the innocent action of many people who intended no wrong but who merely intended to do what they thought was right.  By his intervention, the Minister has indicated clearly that I have made a lodgment and he has now offered to bring in an amendment which alters drastically this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister say that and I look forward with interest to the terms of his amendment.  I do not wish to discuss section 4.  This has been discussed already.  It is a section that should be dropped.  It is another measure of the length to which this Bill could go.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that I have spoken for longer than I intended but it is now my belief that, in view of what he says, the Minister may go some way towards dealing with the objections to the Bill. The neatest thing to do, the easiest thing to do and the best thing to do would be to withdraw this Bill and come along with another.  To the extent the Minister asks for definite powers to deal with a definite problem, I am sure he will find the House not ungenerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party is opposed to this Bill.  The Minister would have done well to listen to the detailed exposition by Deputy O'Higgins who has a legal knowledge of the implications of it.  The Minister should withdraw the Bill and the sooner it is withdrawn the better for <Col N="466" /> all legislation relating to property, landlord ownership and general tenancy.</P>
      <P>The Bill is symptomatic of the thinking which exists within the Cabinet.  It is also symptomatic of the Minister's authoritarian concept of mind which relies solely on legislative force and statutory implications to ensure that his concept of law and order is observed by all sections of the community.  As such he is being provocative and unworthy of the support of this House.</P>
      <P>The civil authorities already have ample powers, which have been outlined by previous speakers, to deal with any incidence of squatting, forcible occupation of property and vehicles that may arise from time to time.  The implications of this Bill have not yet been appreciated by the public at large.  Many of the sections are destructive of some of the basic freedoms we have and the Bill dangerously weakens many other elementary civil rights.  The only thing for the Minister to do is withdraw the Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I can see any court interpretation of the sections of the Bill deteriorating into a morass of legal technicality, whereby the onus of proof falls on the defendants.  This will put the Garda authorities and the judiciary into an impossible position in terms of implementing the criminal offences outlined in the Bill.  It is depressing that a Minister should introduce such a stupid piece of legislation, which has dangerous overtones and indeed some ridiculous legal conditions.  The Government must withdraw the Bill.  The sooner they do so the sooner they will regain what little public credibility they have in terms of the introduction of new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is notable that the defenders of this Bill on the Government side have been sparse.  We have heard Deputy Dowling and Deputy Moore, and with due respect to both Deputies, they are not noted for the persuasive depth of their approach to supporting Government legislation.  Deputy Gallagher was the third defender of the Bill, and with due regard to him, he cannot be classified by any stretch of the imagination as having an objective and disinterested <Col N="467" /> Gallagher would be better employed trying to amend and improve the planning and development statutes, in which he has considerable interest at the property end.  His approach is more than just partisan in relation to this Bill.  Charity does not permit me to say much more in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister's opening speech was clumsily worded, and I exonerate the public servants who drafted it, because I do not think their heart is in this Bill.  I think they see the grave anomalies in many sections of it, but they are, as usual, being browbeaten by a Minister, who, I feel sure, could be truculent to deal with if one dared to question his approach to legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government defence on the Second Reading has been very weak and this is an added reason why the Bill should be withdrawn.  I doubt if the Fianna Fáil Party have had anything more than a cursory discussion about the contents of this Bill.  If they had, there are sufficient lawyers in the Fianna Fáil Party, and there are sufficient public representatives at local council level, who would have ensured it would be brought before the House in a different manner.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a negative approach to the problem by the Government.  It is not an effective or a constructive solution to the housing problem, which seems to be the main cause for squatting, particularly in the greater Dublin area.  As a representative from South County Dublin, which is one of the most self-conscious constituencies in the Republic in regard to domestic property values, property ownership and the related rights of private property, I oppose this Bill and I oppose squatting by either individuals or groups in either public or private property.</P>
    <P>I accept that squatting is an unjust and undemocratic practice and in many cases it can be anti-social.  I cannot support the authoritarian and stupid provisions contained in the Bill which are an effort to deal with the practice of squatting which, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out, had been on the wane particularly in the greater Dublin area. One of the reasons for the growing <Col N="468" /> practice of squatting now is the absence of 45 local councillors, which has meant that many people in grave and urgent need of rehousing have had nobody to go to except the local authority itself.  There have been cases where quite wrongly, but through sheer frustration, some families, a very small minority of families, have taken to wrongful occupation of local authority property.</P>
    <P>I think, and I have not the slightest hesitation in stating it here, that the abolition of Dublin Corporation some years ago was in many ways an incentive to this particular development. Local councillors, in their own respective areas, on a day-to-day basis, would have been able to advise citizens particularly those on housing application lists.  They would have been able to advise them and guide them and give essential information to them and bring them to the local authority to discuss their housing needs and in that way squatting would have been substantially diminished.  I have always thought, equally, that the active self-immolation which Dublin city councillors brought upon themselves when they, in effect, abolished themselves, was a very wrong thing for them to do politically and in terms of local authority representation.  I considered it to be entirely negative at that time and something which they and the citizens of Dublin must genuinely regret.  Irrespective of that, I believe that the absence of an elected public authority of 45 councillors in the Dublin city area is one of the reasons for a lapsing into squatting.</P>
    <P>There has also been, and I do not think that one can in any way condone it, the growth, vocal growth, minority growth, very unsophisticated growth in many ways, of some alleged so-called housing action groups and so on who have provoked some people and who have encouraged others to squat in either public property or in private property.  Naturally the Labour Party do not support such groups but that in no way takes from the complete opposition of the party to the provisions contained in this Bill.  I see no justification for provisions whereby members of the public can be arrested <Col N="469" /> by members of the Garda Síochána without warrant under four sections which admittedly have got to be fulfilled but which certainly are not beyond the imagination of any garda who wants to arrest somebody without a warrant.  Section 4 shows the kind of thinking which is in the mind of the Minister.  Section 9, the section relating to arrest without warrant, reads:</P>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrant where (a) the member knows or has reasonable cause for suspecting...</P>
    <P>This Bill is riddled with this kind of <i>non sequiter</i>, with undefined comments. Where is the legal definition of &ldquo;reasonable cause&rdquo;?  According to the Bill if a person does not take reasonable steps to dissociate himself from the contents of a statement of a group he, too, is committing a criminal offence.  The concept of reasonableness apparently is purely a concept of arbitrary interpretation by the prosecution of the State and interpretation by a judge.</P>
    <P>The Minister, therefore, has made an opening speech on the Second Stage of this Bill which reflects very little credit on him and, generally speaking, he is one of the few members of the Government who bother to come in and seem to be reasonably well briefed.  I am appalled at any Minister coming before this House and trotting out glib phrases such as: &ldquo;mainly at the instigation of quasi-political groups&rdquo;.  Why does he not name such groups?  Why does he not state his facts on the introduction of such Bills before this House?</P>
    <P>We had the Taoiseach careering through the Christmas on statements which the House had no option but to accept in terms of armed conspiracy, in terms of armed bank robberies, planned and unplanned, and we get no information of particular groups, political or otherwise, who were alleged to be involved.  I am sick and tired of coming into this House and having legislation put to the Members of this House by general political innuendo. Either one states one's facts, either one names such groups, if they are or are <Col N="470" /> not involved in the practice of forcible entry and illegal occupation of premises, and if one cannot state the names of such groups within the privilege of this House then one should not expect any sympathy from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>There is the other kind of sweeping statement.  In the Minister's opening speech he said:</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen a growing tendency on the part of individuals and groups within the community not only to behave as if they were outside or above the law but to claim that they are entitled to act in this way.</P>
    <P>If there is any group of people in this country who regard themselves as being that little bit <i>ex cathedra</i> in terms of their attitude towards the law, in terms of being slightly outside the law, and behaving as though they were above the law, it is, indeed, many members of the former front bench of the Fianna Fáil Party and, indeed, many members at general level within the Fianna Fáil Party.  When it suits the members and the senior hierarchy of the Government party they have very scant respect for the law of the land but because some maverick group decides to take over a particular premises or a particular property or some unfortunate family in Dublin, out of sheer personal frustration, having been on a housing waiting list for five or ten years, decides to take over and live in a particular property, either public or private, automatically as a total priority in the opening of the year 1971 we have the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970, brought before us.  This is the kind of lack of perspective and lack of almost political sensitivity which we have come to expect from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; and &ldquo;forcible&rdquo; are defined in section 1&mdash;they include unspoken threats of force caused by the weight of numbers...</P>
    <P>I frankly do not see in section 1 this particular definition.  If one takes this Bill and if one takes the introductory statement of the Minister there are so many qualifications, so many interpretations, so many general comments <Col N="471" /> made by the Minister as to what this Bill does or does not mean, which are not in any way defined within the Bill itself, one boggles that he would have the nerve to introduce a Bill of this kind.  For example he said:</P>
    <P>Since the Bill is not designed to deal with such forms of occupation as, for example, where a &ldquo;wandering minstrel&rdquo; sleeps in a disused outhouse, or an itinerant or other homeless family seeks temporary shelter in an abandoned farmhouse, an exception is made in section 2 for a person who, having forcibly entered...</P>
    <P>With due respect to the Minister there are approximately ten or 12 lines in section 2.  It makes no reference whatever to wandering minstrels.  The example given by the Minister to this House, of those who would normally get exemption apparently by ministerial decree, not by judicial interpretation, not by Constitutional entitlement, are certainly not included in section 2.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins is perfectly correct when he points out the sweeping, global nature of section 2 of this Bill. With due respect to the parliamentary draftsman, I am sure even he must have put it in with his tongue in his cheek.  I think it must be withdrawn in whole or in part.</P>
    <P>I also resent section 4 of the Bill. The Minister has here an amazing piece of double-thinking in terms of endeavouring to explain away section 4.  The Minister says:</P>
    <P>A member of a group is not being held responsible for what other members say unless what is said was said by or on behalf of the group.  Here I would point out that whether a statement has been made on behalf of a group is a question of fact which the prosecution would have to prove and, accordingly, the provision could not apply to a statement purporting to be made on behalf of the group which was actually made by some outsider.</P>
    <P>Limerick people are known to be sharp and shrewd but this legal jargon from any self-respecting Minister for Justice in any self-respecting Republic on the <Col N="472" /> introduction of legislation frankly boggles one's mind in terms of the future interpretation of the Law Courts.  The Minister goes on, full of sympathy, and very gently lets everybody out by saying:</P>
    <P>Even though the provision is limited in this way, it might be unfair to individual members of a group to allow them no line of retreat.</P>
    <P>Now we have law and order in terms of prohibition of forcible entry and occupation on the basis of &ldquo;you can commit an offence and if you are conscious that you are committing an offence and subsequently change your mind you can say &lsquo;I am terribly sorry. I was not committing an offence.  I really want my line of retreat&rsquo;&rdquo;. One can say &ldquo;Under section 4 I demand my line of retreat.  Now that I know I made a mistake, and I made a very bad statement in the heat of the moment, I want to retract.&rdquo;  If all this is said to a local garda, at a stage when one may not have been formally charged, one has a line of retreat.  The Minister should withdraw this as quickly as possible before he becomes the laughing-stock of the legal profession and of any self-respecting barrister in this country.  This type of statement is bringing the legislative ability of this House into very serious public disrepute.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that the Taoiseach, who is close to the Minister for Justice these days, and who has 25 years of law experience and of Parliament, and who is a barrister himself, should allow the Minister&mdash;I am not sure of the Minister's standing in the hierarchy or whether he is a senior or junior Minister in the analysis of Fianna Fáil &mdash;to bring this kind of nonsense before Dáil Éireann.  He should do his homework a little better in terms of concern for the House itself.</P>
    <P>One must challenge the Minister again in relation to section 4 to define what precisely he means by &ldquo;a group&rdquo;. This is apparently the top secret of 1971.  We have had a statement referring to quasi-political groups in this country.  The word &ldquo;agitator&rdquo; has been used.  Now reference is made to statements made by or on behalf of <Col N="473" />&ldquo;a group&rdquo; of persons.  Would the Minister define what he means by &ldquo;a group&rdquo; of persons?  Do a husband and wife together, standing in front of the town hall in Dún Laoghaire, with their furniture and children, saying &ldquo;we are in dire need of housing&rdquo; constitute a group?  If a brother-in-law and a father-in-law join them, and they walk up and down in front of the housing department of the local authority, do they constitute &ldquo;a group&rdquo;?  Does the Minister mean such persons as would or would not have a set of rules or a constitution?  Would such a group be an incorporated body or not?  Are they any group of people one might meet socially?  Is this to be decided solely at the discretion of the Department of Justice, The Minister or a garda who may be walking along the street and may say: &ldquo;You are a group of people who made a statement and who encouraged this, that or the other and I am going to formally charge you with a criminal action&rdquo;? Is the Minister serious in incorporating into the legislation a statement in section 4 which reads: &ldquo;encourages or advocates the commission of an offence&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I can walk down the main street of Dún Laoghaire and say to someone: &ldquo;You are one of 530 housing applicants in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire who are listed and approved for rehousing.&rdquo; I can go to Ballybrack and say to someone: &ldquo;You are one of 300 families in the area listed for housing in that area.  I am only talking to you.  I am not encouraging or advocating anything. I am merely saying that you might occupy the house down there.&rdquo;  I would point out that it would be illegal occupation on their part.  I have never done this and I have no intention of ever doing so.  Apparently for anybody to do so in the terms of the word &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; or &ldquo;advocacy&rdquo; automatically means that he commits a criminal offence.  This is the kind of statement contained in legislation which must inevitably bring the law courts in this country into general disrepute in terms of application, interpretation and prosecution.  Section 4 of this Bill contains weak and ridiculous phraseology, and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I am equally impressed by the total <Col N="474" /> concern of the members of the Government Party for the housing situation in Dublin.  their sudden concern and crocodile tears touch me.  We are all opposed to squatting.  No Member of this House sees squatting as a solution to the housing problem.  Progress has been made in the provision of houses over the past decade in the greater Dublin area.  The facts must not be denied.  On the basis of the official review there are now 5,500 families on the approved waiting list for houses in this city.  A great deal of statistical flexibility is being used by various people as to how many families are in need of houses.  The official number, according to the approved list of Dublin Corporation in November, 1970, is 5,000 families.  To be exact there are 4,550 families on their waiting list.  This is not an inconsiderable number of families.  If one adds the 1,500 families in Dublin county who are on the official waiting list of the Dublin County Council the total is 6,500 families in the greater Dublin area.  Add to that the 500 families in Dún Laoghaire Borough who are on the waiting list and you have a total of 7,000 families on record as of 1st January, 1971, in need of housing in the greater Dublin area.  I will be very conservative and very circumspect in stating the total number of persons concerned.  I will take an average family of four persons, a husband and wife and two children.  Multiply your 7,000 by four and you get the simple figure of 28,000 persons in the greater Dublin area in need of rehousing.</P>
    <P>It is a fact of life that 95 per cent, 98 per cent, of those families have never thought about, or contemplated, or indulged in any form of squatting. In the constituency which I represent, in Dún Laoghaire, I can count on the fingers of my hand the number of cases taken by Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation for forcible occupation or entry into a house in the local authority area, and in Dún Laoghaire there are 3,600 local authority houses.  The number of incidents has been very low, less than a dozen over the years.  They were all dealt with by the housing department, by the law agent, by the members of the local authority, and by <Col N="475" /> the TDs in the constituency.  They were handled very competently and effectively in terms of resolving any issues that arose.</P>
    <P>This sledge hammer of legislation that has been introduced, viewed in its normal and proper perspective, is a gross over-expression of preoccupation by the Government with the rights of private property as such.  Before any such legislation was contemplated the Minister should have brought in the Landlord and Tenant Bill which he promised us for the opening session. He told us today that because it contains about 150 sections he has had difficulty in getting it drafted as expeditiously as possible and brought before the House.</P>
    <P>It is preposterous that the Government should announce that they were bringing in legislation dealing with forcible entry and occupation and then a few months later bring in substantial amendments to the Housing Bill of 1970 which in effect dealt with illegal occupation of local authority houses in a section which is familiar to members of the House.  We are now discussing major legislation relating to forcible entry and so on, and we must wait for further legislation in relation to landlords and tenancies.  To my mind this shows the Government's confusion in terms of legislation coming before this House and I do not think it reflects any credit on the Minister.</P>
    <P>I detected no note of sympathy in the Minister's attitude towards, for example, the problem of illegal action on the part of landlords.  I know of cases in the constituency I represent where landlords illegally and forcibly occupied flats contrary to their tenancy agreements and contrary to any normal social arrangements which landlords usually enter into with tenants.  They interfered grievously with the rights of their tenants.  Is there any protection against that?  Is there any sudden concern on the part of the Minister because a small minority of landlords decided to perform an illegal action? Not a word.  Not a comment.  Not even an amendment contemplated to this Bill.  Therefore, the Minister's attitude must be suspect in this regard. <Col N="476" /> I detect a determination on the part of the Minister to come to grips at all costs, in his almost Napoleonic conception of his future role as Minister for Justice&mdash;the staunch upholder of total law and order&mdash;with what he calls the noisy minority in this community. There are a number of ways of doing this.  One can do it by creating self-appointed martyrs.  There is nothing more destructive of the rational development of law and order in any society than for a Minister for Justice to overreact to any particular group and introduce legislation which will be a Godsend to those who welcome social martyrdom and political martyrdom and who will use it on every occasion to make themselves self-appointed spokesmen and martyrs for whatever cause they may espouse. This is one of the dangers in this type of legislation.  The Minister has fallen into temptation in this regard.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister dealt extensively with illegal occupation of and forcible entry into property as such, in terms of housing property, and so on. It was a bit hypocritical for the Minister to point out that included in this would be illegal, in his definition, fish-ins which have gone on from time to time. The other evening when this was raised in the House the Minister very blandly said that the commission would be looking into this.  I am amazed that a Minister of a party which profess such total preoccupation with republicanism and the rights of the Irish people to have access to their own property in this State, should single out such an expression of social protest.</P>
    <P>Quite rightly it was pointed out to the Minister by Deputy Cooney that, while up around Ballybofey the Minister was making very questionable civil war style of speeches in the Donegal by-election&mdash;I remember reading a report of one which rather shocked me, thinking of what one might expect from the younger generation&mdash;in the Finn valley those who were voting gaily for the Minister were quite unaware of the fact and quite unprotesting about the fact that on some 15 miles of a river there, apparently nobody had any right whatsoever to fish in it or have direct access to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> I see an amazing concern on the part of the Minister for absentee landlords who are alleged to have substantial inland fishery rights and so called property rights, and a determination in this Bill to make sure that no Irish citizen ever has access to such inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>There is not a word about what the commission might or might not bring in in terms of its investigation.  It has all been neatly shelved and anyone who, in future, crosses a ditch to fish in an Irish river will be charged with a criminal offence.  No more and no less. It is a sad day when an Irish Parliament should become so preoccupied about a thing like this.  It is a sad day when a Minister of State should become so vindictive and decide that, if he cannot get a hold on those who organise campaigns he will get at them through the medium of this piece of legislation. We should have an inland fisheries Bill as a matter of urgency.  If that is done there will be no need for this kind of legislation.  It will certainly not have the urgency it seems to have in the Minister's eyes now.  In the interests of the effective operation of normal law and order, and remembering that squatting has not been the kind of escalating phenomenon the Minister sought to suggest it was, this Bill should be withdrawn.  I shall vote against it and so will the other members of my party.  We are encouraged in our attitude by the fact that some Fine Gael Deputies have clearly indicated that they too are opposed to certain sections of the Bill or to the Bill as a whole. We, in the Labour Party, are pleased to join in that kind of general opposition. I think the Minister got a reaction from the Opposition that he did not anticipate to this rather stupid piece of legislation which should never have been presented to the House.</P>

      <P>Like most speakers I have a certain degree of sympathy with those who squat because they find themselves without a roof over their heads.  People may find themselves in that position because of a variety of circumstances.  In the main these people are catered for by the local authority and I must put on record here the humane way in which the Dublin Corporation officials have handled this <Col N="478" /> most difficult and delicate problem.  To my knowledge they have endeavoured to provide accommodation for a husband, a wife, and two children. They have managed over a period of time to provide homes for families squatting in local authority houses.</P>
      <P>While we have sympathy with these people, there are those who are politically motivated.

      <P>The distinction between those who urgently need a roof and those who are disaffected must be carefully gauged.  We all know we have not achieved perfection.  We all admit the housing problem is not yet solved. It will be with us for some time to come.  We must recognise that, despite all our difficulties and despite our limited resources, we have made considerable progress.  We have made that progress despite the period of political instability when the Labour Party joined with the Fine Gael Party to form a coalition, a coalition which resulted in a drastic cut back in the housing programme because of the economic policies they pursued.  Despite that, since Fianna Fáil returned to power, we have made considerable strides in the field of housing.  It is probably no consolation to say that wealthy countries like Britain and Russia have also failed to house all their people.  They cannot cope overnight with the housing problems they have, any more than we can, despite what some Opposition speakers would seem to suggest.</P>
      <P>Other speakers on our side have given the figures and the amount of capital invested in housing.  The relentless rise in the cost of goods and services connected with the building industry has put a powerful brake on any rapid expansion in housing.  These are factors that cannot be controlled. There has been talk of a crash programme. We have been asked to declare a housing emergency.  No one has defined this crash programme.  Do we want shanty towns or mobile homes?  They have been tried elsewhere without success.  What exactly is in the mind of the Labour Party when they talk about a crash programme? A definition would be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien told us here about the sections of the Bill that <Col N="480" /> were unconstitutional.  We can only assume that he sees a housing emergency as a means by which local authorities can trample on private interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>A discussion on housing <i>per se</i> would not be in order.  We are dealing with forcible entry.  While a reference would be allowed, a discussion on housing is certainly not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy advocate, for instance, that the local authority should take over all houses? My reason for intervening in the discussion was to point out that while we have sympathy with squatters we have none with those who encourage them openly.  We have no sympathy for those who are politically activated and want to jump the queue.  Judging by the speeches I have heard in this debate I should say there are certain people in the House who condone what has gone on and are prepared to continue to condone squatting particularly in houses built at the expense of the taxpayers and ratepayers of our city.</P>
      <P>We must realise that a Bill of this sort must be brought before the House. I suggest it brings no gain to the homeless poor but if it serves to keep wrong-footed agitators out of trouble it will serve a purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may not be very relevant I should like to refer to the plight of some people who are being exploited by landlords in this city.  These landlords are causing frustration and difficulty in home life.  I have seen advertisements in the papers from landlords inviting applicants for what they describe as &ldquo;bedsitters suitable for married couples&rdquo; and I have personal knowledge of two houses where there are 16 families in occupation.  They took up the accommodation on the basis of bedsitters, when newly-married, and now some of them have one child and others, two children.  I received a deputation from these young women who are concerned about the conditions in which they live.  I wish to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice to the fact that there is a <Col N="481" /> wide area for investigation.  The particular houses I have in mind have flats not independently valued; the valuations were fixed many years ago and the houses have evolved into this type of accommodation exploited by unscrupulous landlords.  In due course, I hope the Minister will introduce some measure to curb this trend which is leading to the gradual deterioration of houses.  We got rid of the slums of the past which causes this city to be known as having the worst slums in Europe.  We do not want to see this situation developing here again.  I believe that perhaps through legislative action associated with a building programme such a bad social development would be arrested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the fortunate position of being able to speak in this field without the inhibitions which some of my colleagues have had in that I am not a lawyer and therefore I do not believe, perhaps, so wholeheartedly in the administration of the law here as some of them do.  In the arguments against this Bill several speakers have gone back 500 or 600 years to quote legislation. Some have gone back 150 years and other 120 years.  I should be inclined to take the view that we live in a different age now and in different circumstances and therefore I cannot help feeling that some sort of legislation is necessary to deal with the situation we face today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is generally in society to-day a revolt against constituted authority and the real point at issue in this Bill is whether the law as it exists is sufficient to deal with that specific type of revolt.  I believe that an individual who owns private property is entitled to be defended in the right to own that property, whether he lives in a labourer's cottage or in a castle and for the purpose of defending that right some form of legislation seems to be necessary to ensure that if his private rights are invaded he can take immediate action to rectify the situation.  To that extent I go with the Government on this Bill.  I fully realise that one of the functions of an Opposition Deputy is to be vigilant and to oppose anything he conceives to be not in the <Col N="482" /> best interests of the people as a whole, but I must accept as I think people generally accept, that we live in rather unusual circumstances to-day.  That is not peculiar to us.  All over the world there is revolt against constituted authority.  The point is: is existing legislation sufficient to deal with that revolt or not?  In my opinion&mdash;and I think it represents an opinion which is possibly very widely held within my own party&mdash;it is not.</P>
    <P>I have heard arguments by various speakers who endeavoured to point out that we should follow recently-introduced British legislation.  I stress very much that a Conservative Government brought it in and surely this country could follow that line if the legislation introduced there was sufficient to safeguard private ownership but it transpired in the course of the debate that the cross-Channel legislation brought into effect some&mdash;the Lord Chancellor, I think, had made the law: I speak subject to correction by my legal colleagues&mdash;legislation whereby within seven days, action had to be taken.  It does not seem to me that that fully meets the case.</P>
    <P>If my house is occupied&mdash;or Deputy O'Connell's or that of the Minister for Justice&mdash;on a Saturday night then if we accept and implement the British law&mdash;and we generally follow everything the British do&mdash;I am as sured that I can get these people out within seven days.  I should like to point out that if my house is occupied on a Saturday night&mdash;or anybody else's house, as perhaps I am suspect by some of our left-wing thinkers here as I live in a fairly big house, so we will say a labourer's cottage or a council house &mdash;then the person involved has to wait until the law can be put into effect. I am not aware that lawyers work over the weekend, like doctors and some of the other professions, and the person concerned would have to wait until Monday at least, to make the law effective and still seven days can elapse which means that the house can be occupied for ten days before the law can be made effective.  This would be the case if we accepted the British line of thought and any dwelling, be it a castle or a cottage, can be occupied for <Col N="483" /> ten days before the occupiers can be ejected.</P>
    <P>My reading, as an ordinary layman, is that if this Bill becomes effective it will be possible to have those people ejected straight away.  The line of legal argument may be that at present where somebody occupies a house he commits a felony&mdash;I think that is the correct legal term&mdash;and you can get the superintendent of the Garda Síochána&mdash;we have gone back over the centuries referring to different laws, laws going as far back as 1400, 1700 or 1800 when there was a sheriff who was responsible for enforcing the law&mdash;but the superintendent may not be available and therefore you will still have to wait a certain period before you can make the law effective.  We are dealing with the situation at the moment in which there is a reaction against constituted authority and therefore the ordinary laws, such as they are, are not sufficient to protect the rights of private property. I have always maintained, and I think 90 per cent of the Deputies here would agree with me, that private property has the right to be protected, be it the private property of the rich or of the poor.  For that reason some extraordinary laws are necessary to defend the situation that exists today.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made about the Stephen's Green case.  I know something about this case because the person whose property was occupied happened to be a constituent of my own.  I understand that the property was occupied by students in a protest against the destruction of Georgian Dublin.  Now, I would go all the way, and I have gone all the way, and I have argued with all the force I could command, against the destruction of Georgian Dublin.  The greatest rape ever perpetuated against Georgian Dublin was not necessarily in Stephen's Green but in the destruction of the entire facade of Lower Fitzwilliam Street, which was perhaps one of the finest Georgian monuments in Europe. That was destroyed and there were no public demonstrations against that but there was certainly constitutionally and legally all the opposition which was necessary used against it.  I should like to point out that it was the Fianna <Col N="484" /> Fáil Government who were responsible for that destruction.  The then Minister for Transport and Power had within his power the opportunity to save that Georgian facade and he did not use it.  The Stephen's Green case was the same.  The argument being used is that as they failed in their constitutional opposition to it more drastic methods must therefore be taken.  I am afraid I cannot go all the way with that.  If we are going to accept and behave within the law we have got to respect the law. If the laws are not sufficient to meet the particular problems of the day there is some justification for this Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to fishing-in, a very distinguished colleague of mine whose views I respect and whose ability I admire mentioned the case of the Finn River and the Donegal by-election.  I was not in Donegal myself then but I know the county pretty well.  He mentioned poor people who lived on the banks of the Finn River and the fact that the fishing rights of that river were held by people who are described in this House as landlords because landlords are supposed to be the be-all and end-all of everything that is wrong and unjust and, shall we say, contrary to national feelings. That may well be.  They have been superseded by the Land Commission. Anybody who lives in rural Ireland knows what the Land Commission have done to help eradicate the landlord system then existing.  The Minister said that a commission is sitting at present to deal with the question of fishing rights, perhaps to eradicate the predisposing cause of fish-ins.  May I say in regard to the findings of the commission that if it is a question of abrogating the rights of those who have fishing rights at the moment, the matter is likely to be turned over to the Land Commission and from what I know of the Land Commission the people would nearly be better off with the existing system.  However, to return to the Finn River I understand that the people living on the banks of this river have only the bare means of existing and have no right to fish in the river.  I know a great deal about Irish life and about rural life and I am certain that those who live on the banks of a river do occasionally throw in <Col N="485" /> a worm, a fly or a minnow, or whatever it is, and I would like to assure my colleague who is so worried about it that an odd trout is taken from the river from time to time.  Everyone is sympathetic to a poacher, even a stalwart upholder of the law such as myself.</P>
    <P>However, the fish-in question is something that is dealt with in this Bill.  There may be justification for the public ownership of fishing, that is a question for the future, but there is no justification for people taking the law into their own hands.  Neither is there any justification for people occupying houses, as is happening.  The case that comes to mind is the case, unfortunately, of a duke which I am sure will arouse the indignation of all our left thinkers in this House.  The Duke of Devonshire was one of the people chosen for a fish-in and his house was occupied.  As far as I can read the law, which is supposed to be so effective, his house was occupied for about ten days before they could get them out.  Whether the Minister for Justice was moved by the misfortunes of the Duke of Devonshire to introduce this law I am not in a position to know.  Even though this man happens to be the Duke of Devonshire, he is a property owner in this country.  I understand he gives considerable employment and he is entitled to his rights just as anyone else.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, this Bill purports to stop people squatting.  Much play has been made about squatting and the lack of housing.  I am not here to defend the Government on their housing policy.  It has been utterly disastrous from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; and I think the Minister when he introduced this Bill was perhaps bringing a lot of trouble on his head when he was foolish enough to mention housing.  There are very many people waiting for houses and anyone who squats in a house is depriving another person who is on the waiting list.  One must deprecate squatting as the only means of getting into a house as unjustifiable because it prevents others on the waiting list from being rehoused.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Minister, I <Col N="486" /> thought his opening speech was singularly puerile and uninformative.  In fact it read to me like an apologia&mdash;it appeared he was not quite happy about the matter himself and was trying to tell the House that he was forced to introduce a Bill on account of existing circumstances.  Can the Minister tell me if this Bill applies to the stealing of motor cars?  I do not know my colleagues' views on this subject but I think the stealing of cars is one of the lowest forms of theft imaginable.  At least 50 per cent are for the purpose of larceny, of raiding post offices and so on.  The term &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; is included in the Bill and I should like to know if the theft of motor cars is included in this measure?  In addition, can the Minister state if forcible entry applies to mobile houses and caravans?  These facts should be made clear to the House.</P>
    <P>The major part of this Bill is acceptable to me and to many people with whom I have spoken on the matter.  I have not received from any constituent any letter of complaint in regard to this Bill; in fact I have heard from many that they are glad such a measure is being introduced.  That does not mean I have not a duty to say what I think is wrong in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I consider it to be badly drafted.  I assume the draftsman drafts the Bill but I suppose he is briefed by the Minister or his officials to prepare a Bill that will produce the effect intended by the Government.  The Bill appears to be quite vague.  I am not a lawyer and I am speaking without any inhibitions but I am convinced a Bill is necessary to prevent a pack of hooligans breaking into private property and staying there until such time as the law can catch up with them.  It is more than probable when the law gets moving that the case will be adjourned for six weeks or six months or the court may not even be sitting.  In the meantime private property&mdash;be it a labourer's cottage or a castle&mdash;and furniture may be interfered with by a crowd of dirty hooligans.  That is the right name to call them and as public representatives we ought to have the guts to stand up here and state this.  I have no hesitation in voicing my views <Col N="487" /> and I should like to hear other Deputies do likewise.</P>
    <P>I want to see the law respected in this country.  I want to see the law upheld&mdash;not that I have much time for it because it appears to be a sea of frustration and procrastination that enables any lawbreakers to get away with wrongdoing.  I can understand the feelings of my colleagues who, while they do not exactly administer the law, argue the law in the courts. They believe that the ordinary individual is getting justice.</P>
    <P>There are poor people as well as rich people in this country.  There are poor people who will be protected by this legislation and this seems to have been completely overlooked here.  All the talk has been about landlords and tenants and housing problems.  I read into it that the Bill is not intended for that.  As I said, the opening statement of the Minister did not help me; perhaps I am slightly unintelligent and do not grasp things as easily as anyone else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill should be for the purpose of stopping in the name of democracy any hooligans from breaking the law.  Democracy is the sovereign right for which people fought and died in this country. It is the sovereign right of people to have title and to hold land and property and not to be interfered with by a pack of hooligans.  I cannot accept the argument of those who go back over the centuries to prove that the law is here to protect the people. It is not sufficient or it is not being administered.  Whether the fault is with the district justices or the judges of the circuit and High Courts I do not know.  If I go home tonight and find that my house is occupied I should like some lawyer to stand up here and tell me what redress I have to get rid of the people who occupy my house. I know that I have no redress.  Under this Bill I take it that the Garda will be in a position to go in on the demand of the owner of the property, to eject the people and prosecute them for breaking the law.  On my reading <Col N="488" /> of the law, at the moment they have to go through the full ramifications of the law.  They must make a statement to the superintendent and the latter must take action.  If the superintendent is not available they must wait.  Often it is necessary to take the case to the court and very frequently a considerable amount of time elapses before this can be done.  In the meantime their property may be destroyed by the pack of hooligans who have broken in and this applies whether the owner is rich or poor.</P>
      <P>We are a free, sovereign and democratic State.  We struggled for many centuries to make and frame our own laws.  Public representatives have been sent here by the people to defend their rights.  Why should we be intimidated by a pack of hooligans?  The Minister says the situation is not active at the moment.  Possibly not, but it could very well start to-morrow morning.  There could be a holocaust to-morrow with a whole lot of people breaking into houses, that sort of thing, and everybody then would be yelling from the housetops for this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that I have supported him on his Bill.  Perhaps it is not a popular thing for a Fine Gael Deputy to support a Fianna Fáil Minister in legislation he may introduce.  However, there is one section in this Bill he can get rid of as quickly as possible, that is, section 4. I have no legal training, but I believe section 4 is unconstitutional and that if it is tested in the courts it will probably go down.  Undoubtedly the lawyers will test this Bill because they do not like it.  Section 4 really embroils people who are not responsible in any way.  I am sure we are all law-abiding people here, but if any one of us in a political party does something illegal under this provision other Members are to be held responsible.  I would hate to see Deputy Dr. O'Connell having to go to jail if Deputy Dr. Cruise-O'Brien kicked up a row somewhere.  Under section 4 he would be fully implicated as well.  The Minister shakes his head.  He is a lawyer.  I am not a lawyer but some of the lawyers who have spoken here so far have said it is unconstitutional and others have said it is impracticable. <Col N="489" /> I believe it is impracticable and should be deleted.</P>
    <P>The object behind section 4, as I read it, is that the Fianna Fáil Party believe that political organisations are going to stimulate people into taking illegal action.  Shall I say in a loud whisper that in the dim and distant past Fianna Fáil themselves were responsible for breaking the law on many occasions here.  That was before the Minister for Justice entered the arena of public life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was forcible entry, too.  In my own family we have had the flames of a conflagration burning the roofs over our heads in the past for our political convictions.  The object of section 4 is to prevent any political organisation taking any forcible action.  In other words, instead of having the courage to ban the political organisation of which they are afraid, the Fianna Fáil Party have brought section 4 into being so they can jump down their throats and so that the Minister for Justice can simply say: &ldquo;The whole lot of them are implicated.&rdquo;  He can arrest all of them and run them into jail. That is not democracy.</P>
      <P>I think I have said enough here tonight to show that I am in favour of law and order.  I shall probably be accused by subsequent speakers of being a reactionary.  That does not cost me a thought one way or the other. However, if you seek to do anything you ought to make it clear in legislation what you are doing.  The object of section 4 is to embroil what Fianna Fáil consider to be illegal organisations. It also embroils the individual.  It is detrimental to the rights of the free citizens of this country.  Therefore, I ask the Minister, when he is replying, to fully explain section 4, because this he has not done.  In fact, I would ask him to fully explain this Bill because he has not really explained it.  Anyway, I would ask him to withdraw section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should make clear what he actually means.  Is this Bill for the purpose of stopping the larceny of cars?  Is it for the purpose of stopping illegal entry into houses?  Is it for the <Col N="490" /> purpose of giving the State or the legalistic section of the State the right to act immediately when these illegal acts are committed?  Will he also explain what he means by &ldquo;a vehicle&rdquo;, what he means by &ldquo;a house&rdquo;, whether he means by &ldquo;a house&rdquo; a caravan which people live in, or whether he means one of those movable residential houses as well?</P>
    <P>The Minister has many things to explain. No doubt he will get this Bill in spite of the votes that may be shown against him.  I do not know whether the Labour Party intend to vote against the Bill, but whether they vote against it or not the Minister is likely to get it through.  However, in justice to the country and to the people who are concerned with law and order, he ought to give us a far wider explanation than he gave us in his opening speech.</P>

      <P>Certainly, Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde had a great deal to say in support of the property owner.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>He certainly gave me food for thought.  Let me say here and now that the Duke and his like have no right whatever in this country.  They have taken it by force and they have no right to be here.  To think we should punish people for protesting against him and his like&mdash;the landed gentry&mdash; convinces me that I should walk the streets.  Property owners have rights. Rowntree-Macintosh took over a road of houses and demolished them.  They took over a road of houses in which people had lived for 45 to 60 years.  I met these people.  They were compensated all right by Rowntree-Macintosh. I will tell you what happened to a man of 72 and his wife of 68.  They got £600 compensation from Rowntree-Macintosh. Rowntree-Macintosh told them they could buy a house and that £600 would be a deposit.  Of course, age was <Col N="491" /> against them.  He lived in the Iveagh Hostel and she lived in a hostel in Cork Street.  Every morning they met at the corner of York Street and strolled the streets of Dublin together.  Then at 8 o'clock that night they departed and said good-bye to each other.  He went to the Iveagh Hostel and she went to Cork Street.  Of course, property owners have rights, and Rowntree-Macintosh have rights to bulldoze.  Motor Manufacturers of Ireland moved in last week or the week before with their bulldozers and demolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It does not specifically mention vans or caravans.  I am talking about squatting.  If I find people like those being sent to jail I will go to jail with them.  That is telling the Minister something.  We talk about rights.  I will read Article 41 of the Constitution:</P>
      <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Read Article 43 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope you have digested that.  The family are antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Go on to Article 43.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says that Article 43 contradicts Article 41 then we had better abolish the Constitution. Article 41 goes on that the State guarantees to protect the family in its Constitution and authority as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.  If the Minister says that is not right, we can scrap everthing we have on our Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I say the Bill must be withdrawn.  The Minister said he would <Col N="493" /> be glad to hear the views of the House and to consider any suggestions for the improvement of the Bill.  My suggestion is that the Bill be withdrawn. In the first place the Act would be unconstitutional.  If a man finds a deserted house and his wife and children are roaming the streets in the winter in the snow and he can take refuge in a little old deserted house, can we imprison him for that?  A man has an obligation to his wife and children. Which are we to imprison him for&mdash;fulfilling his obligation to provide shelter for his wife and children or for failing to do so?  I would condone the man providing for his wife and children because I have seen children and their parents walking the streets under the elements, the children cold and hungry, the parents with nowhere to cook.</P>
    <P>If I were homeless I know that my first obligation would be to my wife and children.  Deputy Gallagher said that the homeless man who squats has as much right as the hungry man to steal food.  That is the quote of the week from Deputy Gallagher, a man of no mean wealth, whose dealings in property are well-known, a man who knows property rights.  I wonder does he know the right of a human being, the rights of a family.  Deputy Gallagher will go down in the records of this House for the wonderful statement he made last week to the effect that a man who is hungry has no right to steal food.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have taken over where the British left off. I wonder what our people in 1916 in the GPO would have thought had they been told that this Bill would be introduced against the rights of the people, if they had been told that a future Government of this free country would bring in repressive legislation. If that is the new republicanism of Fianna Fáil then I am ashamed to be a Member of this House.  Is that what Pádraig Pearse and Connolly fought and died for&mdash;so that these dictators can bring in repressive legislation?</P>
    <P>I would feel ashamed to be associated with this House if I were to be involved in the passage of legislation <Col N="494" /> of this kind which strikes at the very heart of freedom.  There were great heroes in Irish history who fought against repressive measures of this kind.  Had we not better change our history books?  Had we not better change everything, because there is no purpose in teaching our children about the Land League, about Isaac Butt, Parnell and Connolly, who preached the rights the people had above everything else?  There is no purpose in having history books if this kind of legislation continues to come from a Government of this free country, a freedom bought in 1916. If I were involved or if I participated in any such Government, if I were to find myself a member of such a Government I would resign from the House and walk with the marchers through the streets.</P>
    <P>We have seen the threat of internment without trial.  There is fear abroad. Now there is a threat to the Housing Action Committee.  I can say something about that committee.  They were formed in my house in 1965 to agitate for proper housing for homeless people.  Deputy Timmons said agitators had not the interests of the people at heart.  I am one of those agitators.  If people agitate they do so because they care.  We have a housing emergency in this country.  Contrary to Article 41 of the Constitution, families have been forcibly separated.  I was one of the agitators against this: I am proud still to be one.  I will agitate inside or outside this House when I see injustice and when I see the unity of families destroyed as happened in 1965 and as is still happening today.</P>
    <P>When I read the article in yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> by Mary Kenny and Rosita Sweetman, I just shook my head because everything they say there is true.  The barbed wire is still at Griffith barracks.  I see it regularly as I pass nearby.  The husband says goodbye to his wife and children at the gate.</P>
    <P>I had a letter about a man and his wife who were separated.  In times of stress there will be frayed tempers. They were arguing at the gate.  The Dublin Health Authority decided to punish him.  They would not let him&mdash; a Mr. Peter Geraghty&mdash;visit his children. <Col N="495" /> That is what they do to you in this free country of which we speak. If a husband works overtime or is late home from work sometimes he is not allowed in to visit the children.  I saw this.  You have to see it to know what it really is like.  &ldquo;Griffith barracks&rdquo; is merely a name.  Go in and visit it and see how they live.  Read some of the agonisingly pathetic letters these people write pleading for a house somewhere so that the family can be reunited.  The barbed wire is still there over the gate. I do not know whom they are trying to keep out.</P>
    <P>In Britain, squatting is legal.  They take rent.  In particular, Lewisham Council in London have made arrangements about old houses that may lie disused.  They have an arrangement with the squatters and they take rent from them.  There is a Squatters Group. These people move on according as the old houses are required by the Lewisham Council.  There is a healthy recognition of and respect for each other between the Lewisham Council and the Squatters Group.  It stops people from lying in the street.</P>
    <P>There is often overcrowding in houses.  Just imagine 17 persons in a two-bedroomed house.  Imagine two families sleeping in one room.  Imagine brothers and sisters of 18, 19 and 20 years of age sleeping in the one room. In some cases, some members of the family wait until other members leave their beds so that they can then get into them.  As a doctor and as a Teachta Dála, I have seen this type of thing. I have had to cross over the beds in order to get to children who are ill. In the course of normal human behaviour, there will be a row now and again.  Then the child starts crying: they are crowded in.  The next thing is a row and the son-in-law is told to get out.  He walks the streets.  He asks for advice as to what he should do.  I point out to him that he has one child and that he has no hope of getting a house. I then say: &ldquo;Get a furnished room.  Do not tell the woman you have a child. Go in, first, and then bring the child. Then the woman will try to get you out because you have a child.  If she tells you to get out just tell her that <Col N="496" /> she will have to get you out by court order.&rdquo;  That is how to get into these furnished rooms and furnished flats.</P>
    <P>If homeless people say to me that they want to squat in an empty room or an empty old house, what can one say to those people when one finds them walking the streets?  I cannot say to them: &ldquo;Do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do that&rdquo;. They make up their own minds.  We should be bringing in Estimates for the purpose of providing money for essential housing.  We should introduce proper systems.  We should have building permits rather than allow the erection of luxury office blocks.  Let us get our priorities right.  I will vote all the time for any Government that introduces constructive legislation but all I have seen since I have come into this House is repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>Last week, I told people: &ldquo;This anti-squatting law is coming in now. I do not know what you will do.&rdquo; There is no hope at all that the corporation will at present house families with one child.  There is no hope for families of three.  In 99 per cent of these cases, the family consists of a husband, wife and one child.  No matter what the City Manager or the deputy City Manager may say, we have a very serious housing problem. The corporation will not allow on their list at present a family consisting of a husband, wife and one child. It is obvious, therefore, that we are not getting accurate figures of the housing situation in this country.  If homeless people see a disused room and move into it from the cold, are we to shove them into jail?  Maybe it is a good idea, in a way, because they would have some shelter there: the only problem is that members of the family are separated.</P>
    <P>Our laws are peculiar.  I had the case of a man, his wife and their two daughters aged 16 and 13 years: they were hungry.  They stole 7/9d from a poorbox and got six months in jail. I thought I would do the Good Samaritan and bail them out, when I read the report in the newspaper.  In fact, I did them a disfavour because they had nowhere to go.  We tramped the streets of Dublin to get a room for them but failed.  I tried to get <Col N="497" /> them into Griffith Barracks.  People have to go to the relieving officer for the area&mdash;an area in which they might not be living&mdash;whoever he may be, to get a note from him.  The husband must part with the wife at the gate of Griffith Barracks.  Is that human?  No wonder they run off and skedaddle over to Britain: they want to get away from such conditions.  I am ashamed to be associated with this.</P>
    <P>If we have sit-ins or squatting by students&mdash;all right.  To get away from the housing problem&mdash;it is depressing &mdash;we have our hippies and our students.  They are preventing war: I shall always tolerate them for it.  They are agitating against and condemning a system.  If they sit in or squat as a protest against what they consider injustice&mdash;all right, they do no harm. They stop wars.  That is something we did not do when we were growing up because we were repressed but things are different now.  There is mass-media communication now: we all know what is going on in the various countries.  I consider that these people play a very useful part in society.  They will change things.  They will not tolerate certain conditions.  They will not allow dictatorship to develop, the kind of dictatorship that developed under Hitler when Europe was overrun.  More luck to them.  They march in the streets in protest against repressive legislation, Hitlerlike legislation, that comes before this House.  The Minister has a habit of placing his hand like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a high regard for the Minister as a man but, in his role as Minister, he has forgotten that he is a human being.  I was moved by Deputy Timmon's contribution.  Of course, property is always on his mind. When one becomes obsessed with property, <Col N="498" /> it supersedes everything else but one should never think that it supersedes the rights of human beings.  It must never do that.</P>
      <P>During Deputy Timmon's term as Lord Mayor of this city, I took part in a march to the Mansion House in defence of the homeless.  When we knocked on the door, Deputy Timmons was not there.  I have never been a member of Dublin Corporation and should I ever become a member, I am sure I would be thrown out because I should agitate so much to ensure that they might get their priorities right.  If the Minister is saying that those who agitate on behalf of the homeless are destructive in their thinking, he is far off the mark.  It does not matter whether they be from TCD or UCD or whether they be from the Sinn Féin Headquarters in Gardiner Place, they are genuinely interested in the plight of the homeless.  The Housing Action Committee&mdash;this quasi-political body of which the Minister speaks&mdash;are not destructive. They are trying to highlight the problems of the homeless and they do not advocate breaking the law.  They did so only to highlight the problem here.  This committee are nothing more than a pressure group and it is good that we should have such a group.  In his speech, the Minister says that protest and pressure for change are not in themselves bad.  Reluctantly, he admits this.  Although he says that in themselves they are not bad, he condemns this Housing Action Committee and says:</P>
      <P>... On the contrary, human progress can be measured by the extent of man's questioning of himself and his environment and his willingness to adopt new concepts when the old ones have proved inadequate or unsuitable.</P>
      <P>It was due to the Housing Action Committee of this city that Dublin Corporation were forced to put housing on their priority list.  The Minister continues:</P>
      <P>... there are democratic processes for dealing with grievances and, where necessary, altering laws and policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Council are non-existent at the moment so I do not know what he <Col N="499" /> means when he says there are other means.  Those other means have been taken away in this city.</P>
    <P>What can a man do here if he is homeless?  He can neither find a bit of land on which to build himself a house nor accumulate sufficient money to put a deposit on a house.  At the moment any house would cost at least £5,000 and if one is lucky enough to be in the £35 a week income bracket and to have a deposit of about £1,500 one will get a house.  He will not be able to get a bit of land because land speculators have gone to work in this city and have bought up every available bit of land. I spent a number of years in America and I noticed that a man could acquire a bit of land there very easily.  He would be readily facilitated by the bank so that he would have no difficulty in building a home for himself.  There is no such hope for anyone here within the average income bracket even with such things as bonuses and overtime pay.  There are hypocritical tears from the Government who say that legislation must be introduced to stop speculation. They say this after their cronies have moved in like locusts and gobbled up all available land.</P>
    <P>In England squatting is legal.  It is accepted in Derry city where the housing problem is being solved.  I know of one case of squatting in which the father of three children was involved. This man broke into an empty flat in Keogh Square.  To break into Keogh Square is similar to going into a rat hole but the man did this because he wanted to have a roof over his children.  Rent was accepted from him for some time but eventually he was evicted forcibly.  However, he was put on a list for housing and some time later he was sent back to the flat in Keogh Square from which he had been evicted.  This flat was in the old Army barracks and the poor man was really down and out when he squatted there.</P>
    <P>In relation to furnished flats, the Minister tells us there is adequate protection for tenants.  In most cases when a person rents a furnished room or flat, there is no agreement whatsoever. Very often a table and chair constitute the furniture and the tenant will buy <Col N="500" /> odd pieces of furniture to make up the deficiency.  However, if he is told to leave that place what would happen to him under this legislation if he had to go back to collect his own pieces of furniture and his clothes and so on? Would he be put in jail?  What would happen if he should fall into arrears of rent for a week or two?  He would be thrown out.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I visited Mountjoy Jail with the permission of the Minister for Justice.  One of the men there asked me to look into his particular case.  I wrote in this connection to the Leas-Chlarathóir and I received a letter in reply to say that the man knew about the case and that he could tell me.  I wrote again to the Leas-Chlarathóir telling him that the man had asked me to act on his behalf and I received another single line letter in reply.  If this is the sort of thing we have in our courts, we might as well give up.  This second one line letter read:</P>
    <P>I am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 29th ult. and to state that the furnishing of the information required is not within the scope of my duties.</P>
    <P>It was signed &ldquo;David Monroe, Leas-Chlarathóir, The High Court, Four Courts, Dublin 7&rdquo;.  That man was very helpful.  If another Government take over, a lot of these people should be got rid of because there is something wrong when one receives a letter like that from Mr. David Monroe.</P>

I visit him in jail and I write to the Leas-Chlarathóir of the High Court, not mentioning this man's name, but saying, &ldquo;I am instructed to act on his behalf.&rdquo;  The reply I receive states: &ldquo;I am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter and state that the furnishing <Col N="502" /> of the information required is not within the scope of my duties.&rdquo; Meanwhile that man can rot in jail.</P>

    <P>(c)  As certain benefits, i.e. Nos. (1) and (2), will bring in categories of workers who have not heretofore been covered by the Act and as the other benefits will be affected by the inclusion of these additional categories, the estimates made must be regarded as very approximate.</P>
