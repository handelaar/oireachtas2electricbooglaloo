    <P>The Dáil, according to order, went into Committee on Finance and resumed consideration of Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31st March, 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £36,732,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate of £36,732,000 for Posts and Telegraphs for 1971-72 shown in the Estimates volume is £1,725,990 greater than the corresponding figure for 1970-71, including Supplementary Estimates and the amount transferred from the Vote for increases in pensions, <i>et cetera</i>.  The increase is made up of extra provisions totalling £3,317,990 under eight subheads offset by reductions totalling £289,990 under three subheads and higher receipts amounting to £1,302,010 under Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2436" /> By far the biggest increase is under subhead A where an extra £2,259,990 is needed mainly to meet the extra cost for a full year of the 12th round and other pay increases which were granted during 1970-71.  The following comments are offered on the other subheads which show substantial variations from last year's provisions:</P>
    <P>Under subhead C an additional £323,000 is required mainly to meet the cost of additional leased accommodation including a new telecommunications headquarters at Marlborough Street, Dublin&mdash;and of higher expenditure on sites and buildings.  The decrease of £162,000 under subhead D is due to the incidence of presentation and clearance of accounts for air mail conveyance.</P>
    <P>Under subhead G an extra £175,000 is being provided to meet higher telephone capital repayments to the Exchequer arising from continuing capital investment in the telephone service. The increase of £258,000 under subhead J is mainly due to higher pensions and gratuities following increased rates of pay.  Under subhead K there is only a nominal provision of £10 as against £35,000 last year for commissions and special inquiries.</P>
    <P>Under subhead L an extra £250,000 has been provided so that this year's grant-in-aid to Rado Telefís Éireann will reflect the receipts for a full year from the higher broadcasting licence fees which came into operation as from 1st July, 1970.  On the receipts side the increase of £1,302,010 under subhead T&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash; arises mainly from the recovery of higher amounts from other Government Departments and from telephone capital funds.  The staff costs incurred on agency services provided for other Departments and on telephone capital development have, of course, increased substantially as a result of the 12th round and other pay increases which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The total number of letters handled in 1970 was about 456 million representing a decrease of 1.3 per cent on the previous year.  The volume of air mail correspondence rose, however, by over 6 per cent, mainly as a result of a substantial growth in second class <Col N="2437" /> mail.  The number of parcels handled in 1970 increased by over 2 per cent as compared with 1969.</P>
    <P>As might be expected postal traffic fell following the increases in charges introduced in October, 1970.  Traffic in the Christmas period, for example, was about 20 per cent down on the previous year.  The British postal strike which lasted from 20th January to 7th March, 1971, resulted in a considerable loss of traffic.  Nevertheless the traffic figures for the first nine months of 1971 are only slightly below those for the corresponding period in 1970, that is before charges were increased.</P>
    <P>There has been a continued increase in the volume of business at post office counters.  This business covers a wide range of agency services on behalf of other Government Departments, apart from those required for purely post office purposes.  A high standard of mail service continues to be given. Over 90 per cent of internal letters posted in time for outward despatches are delivered on the next delivery day.  The standard of service for parcels and second class mail is well above that normally given elsewhere. The bulk of outward mail is despatched by air on the day of posting, and, with few exceptions, letters received from abroad are delivered on the following working day.</P>
    <P>During 1970, 49 new motorised delivery services were introduced in rural areas and a further 38 were added in the first six months of 1971. There are now about 480 motorised rural services in operation and about one-third of the total route mileage has been motorised.  An additional 167 postmen posts were created in 1970, mostly in the Dublin postal district where they were needed to cater for expansion as a result of housing and other development.</P>
    <P>On 25th February last I gave particulars of the special postage stamps issued in 1970 and of the stamps which had been or would be issued during 1971.  I also mentioned that in 1972 a special stamp of symbolic design would be issued to honour the many leading figures on both sides who died during the period of the civil war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2438" /> A special open competition has been held for the design of this stamp.  It will be issued on 1st June, 1972, and kept on sale until 31st May, 1973. Six additional stamps are also planned in 1972.  These comprise the Europa stamp, a stamp in the series on contemporary Irish art, a Christmas stamp, a stamp to mark World Health Day, 1972, which is sponsored by the World Health Organisation, and stamps to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Olympic Council of Ireland and of the issue of the first Irish postage stamp.</P>
    <P>The Departmental committee which I set up in September, 1970, to consider the structure, operation and finances of the postal services, including counter services, have been meeting regularly.  They expect to be in a position to furnish an interim report shortly and hope to furnish a final report about 12 months from now.</P>
    <P>In 1970-71 the number of telegrams handled, 1,198,000, was almost 6 per cent lower than in the previous year. The fall in traffic was greater than normal mainly as a result of the British post office strike in the latter portion of the year.</P>
    <P>The telex service, which is carrying more and more messages that would formerly have been sent as telegrams, continues to grow steadily.  In 1970-71 over 2,000,000 telex calls were originated as compared with about 1,500,000 in 1969-70.  At the end of March last the number of subscribers had risen to 1,150 having grown by 25 per cent approximately in the previous year. In this regard our current rate of growth compares favourably with that in any other European country.  It is clear that the usefulness of the service, particularly in connection with export activities, is being recognised and availed of and that we can look forward confidently to further large-scale expansion.  Planning is going ahead on this basis.</P>
    <P>A new satellite telex exchange was opened in Waterford in September last. Contracts have been placed for further satellite telex exchanges in Limerick and Galway.  Arrangements for the further extension of existing exchanges and for the installation of a new international <Col N="2439" /> exchange are well advanced.</P>
    <P>To cater for traffic growth, additional circuits were provided in 1970-71 on the routes from Dublin to Belfast, London, Frankfurt and the USA. Further circuits have since been provided and more are planned.</P>
    <P>Automatic telex service was introduced in the service to the USA in April last.  The arrangements enabled the minimum charge of £2.25 for three minutes to be abolished for automatically selected calls and replaced by a rate of 2½ pence per two seconds. I am glad to report that the level of traffic has jumped in the meantime, the number of calls made in the six months beginning in April being approximately one-third greater than the total in 1970.  Over 99 per cent of telex calls are now connected automatically.</P>
    <P>The provision of telecommunication facilities for data transmission is a service with considerable scope for expansion. Data may be transmitted to computers either over rented circuits or over the public telephone and telex networks.  There are nearly 50 data transmission units, known as modems, in service and such units are now being supplied and maintained by my Department.  Developments in data communication generally are being kept under close review.  My Department have recently joined with other European telecommunications administrations in a special study of future prospects and developments in this field.</P>
    <P>Telephone business was as buoyant as ever in 1970-71.  The number of telephone calls handled was about 327 million.  Trunk calls at about 42 million were some 11 per cent higher than in the previous year; local calls at 285 million were up by 8.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Applications for telephones again reached a record level.  The number of connections was 23,000 but this was not sufficient to match demand and the waiting list increased by over 2,000 to 15,000 at the end of March last.  It is now over 18,500.  I shall return to this matter later.</P>
    <P>During the year 49 manual exchanges were converted to automatic working, as compared with 29 in 1969-70. <Col N="2440" /> In addition, 162 exchanges&mdash;51 automatic and 111 manual&mdash;were extended by the installation of additional equipment to provide for further growth of subscribers' lines and traffic.</P>
    <P>Over 160 new telephone kiosks, including 129 in rural areas, were provided. The trunk service was expanded by the addition of over 1,300 circuits comprising over 125,000 circuit miles. Among the more important trunk works completed were: coaxial cable schemes between Athlone/Castlerea/ Claremorris / Castlebar / Ballina and Portlaoise/Birr; extension of the Dublin/Portlaoise and Dublin/Belfast/ cross-channel microwave links, and expansion of the capacity of the trunk cables serving Killarney.  Numerous other routes on which extra circuits were provided are listed in the notes which I circulated recently to Deputies to assist them in discussing this estimate.</P>
    <P>In the current year high capacity microwave links have been brought into service between Dublin and Cork and between Limerick and Shannon.  I should also like to mention the completion in August last of a radio link to provide additional trunk lines to Inishmore.  The two other Aran Islands are each served by single channel radio link to Galway.  The telephone operators at Kilronan, Inishmaan and Inishere exchanges can dial one another through the Galway trunk exchange. They can also dial Galway numbers and call directly to a number of manual exchanges in the vicinity of Galway.</P>
    <P>Works at present in progress include major trunk schemes, coaxial or microwave, between Shannon/Ennis, Portlaoise / Athlone, Dublin / Dundalk, Athlone / Ballinasloe / Loughrea / Galway, Tralee/Killarney, Killarney/Kenmare/Sneem, Dundalk/Carrickmacross, Drogheda / Navan / Ceanannus Mór, Fermoy/Cork, Galway/Clifden and Ballina/Belmullet.</P>
    <P>Contracts have been placed for coaxial schemes between Waterford/ Clonmel, Tralee / Cork, Portlaoise/ Limerick and Portlaoise / Waterford. The Dublin/Belfast coaxial cable needs to be re-equipped; in order to enable this to be done and to increase substantially <Col N="2441" /> the capacity of the cable without adversely affecting service over the route, arrangements have been made in collaboration with the British post office to provide another microwave link between Dublin and Belfast.</P>
    <P>Traffic over the transatlantic route to America has been increasing at a remarkable rate.  The number of circuits was increased from 14 to 22 in 1970-71 and a further two have since been added.  These 24 lines are made up of satellite and submarine cable circuits.  Arrangements have been made to have further circuits in service before next summer.</P>
    <P>Within the past few months direct circuits have been set up between Dublin and Paris and Dublin and Madrid.  These have enabled a much improved service to be given to France and Spain.  Substantial extension of direct circuiting must, however, await completion of the new international exchange, the equipment for which is on order and due to be installed in 1973.</P>
    <P>Subscriber trunk dialling (STD) between Dublin, Belfast and London was introduced on 1st October (London) and 1st November (Belfast).  I am glad to say that from the start about 80 per cent of non-coinbox calls were being dialled and the proportion is increasing.  Concurrently with the opening of the direct service to London the three-tier tariff for cross-channel calls based on distance was replaced by flat rates of charge without regard to distance.  The new rates would result in a sizeable reduction in call revenue if the level of traffic remained the same.  We are confident, however, that the increase of business stimulated by the direct dialling facility will more than offset the reduction.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that a major programme of capital works is in train.  I have outlined only the bigger and more important schemes.  Various other works are going ahead throughout the country. Unfortunately, we still have a number of areas where, owing to over-loaded exchanges or trunk lines, service is not as good as it should be and in some areas connection of additional <Col N="2442" /> telephones must be restricted because of shortage of plant.  Our resources of skilled staff and capital are just not sufficient to cater quickly for all the works that need to be carried out.  In most cases improvements are on the way&mdash;sites for exchanges have been or are being acquired, buildings are being erected, contracts for equipment have been placed.  Orders already placed for exchange and trunk equipment alone, some placed a considerable time ago, add up to over £9 million.  Deliveries are subject to unavoidable long delays owing to world demand in this field.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the question of cost, the programme of new works for last year had to be curtailed to conserve capital.  Nevertheless, it cost about £9.5 million.  The original allocation for the current year was also fixed at £9.5 million, approximately but this was far below requirements and efforts to keep to it have reduced the rate of connection of new telephones.  The Government have recently agreed to increase the allocation to £10.73 million and I hope to get more next year when heavy forward commitments for exchange and trunk plant will mature.</P>
    <P>Many people may perhaps be surprised at the order of cost I have mentioned but it should be remembered that the use of the system, firstly, by the general body of existing subscribers and, secondly, by new subscribers is expanding rapidly and one just cannot hope to eliminate either delays on calls or delays in getting telephones unless the necessary plant has been provided on an adequate scale in advance.  This means having sufficient spare plant&mdash; installed and ready&mdash;in exchanges, on trunk routes, in the local distribution network, underground and aerial cables, in every exchange area.  This in turn requires extremely heavy investment. Unfortunately, so long as the supply of capital available for the public services as a whole is limited we have little prospect of getting our full requirements and a choice has to be made as to what kind of works must be deferred. In such circumstances priority must be given to providing a good quality of service throughout the system and in meeting the expanding needs of the general body of subscribers <Col N="2443" /> even if this means in the short term a growing waiting list.  Expansion of the exchange and trunk system on a large scale is necessary in any event to provide the base for substantial increase in the intake of new subscribers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that a radio link telephone call system is expected to be introduced early in 1972 at Valentia coast station.  Ships within a radius of about 200 miles from Valentia will then be able to make telephone calls to subscribers here and in Britain and the subscribers will in turn be able to make calls to the ships.</P>
    <P>Within the past 12 months a new post office and manual telephone exchange was provided at Cahirciveen and a new district sorting office was completed at Ballyfermot, Dublin. New telephone buildings and extensions were completed at many centres including Rathmines (Dublin), Birr, Clifden, Cobh, Ennis, Kenmare, Loughrea, Nenagh, Thurles and Tramore.  Improvements in manual exchanges and postal accommodation were carried out in Castlebar, Cavan, Boyle, Gorey and Dun Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The new building at Marlborough Street, Dublin, is now virtually completed and is already being used as a telecommunications staff headquarters. It will also house an international telephone trunk exchange which is expected to be ready by the end of 1973.</P>
    <P>Works in progress or contracted for includes a new post office and telephone exchange at Cavan, a new post office at Portlaoise, a new district sorting office at Glenageary (Dublin) and new telephone buildings or extensions at Crown Alley, Shelbourne Road, Nutley Park, Phibsboro and Dundrum (Dublin), Castlebar, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick, Longford, Monaghan, Newcastlewest and at 26 rural centres.</P>
    <P>Accommodation problems still exist at certain post offices and exchanges. Efforts are being made to find solutions to these problems and it will be appreciated that the extent to which improvement schemes can be effected is limited by the money available.</P>
    <P>The estimate provides for 20,888 posts for the current financial year, <Col N="2444" /> an increase of 388 posts over the corresponding provision for last year. Most of the additional posts are required for the telecommunications services, but, as I mentioned already, some are needed for postal delivery work, particularly in Dublin because of housing and other development.</P>
    <P>In previous years the House was given some details of recruitment of professional engineers for telecommunications work and of the Department's scholarship schemes designed to supplement the intake of professional engineers.</P>
    <P>Recruitment of engineers is proceeding with reasonable success and the scholarship schemes are also going well.  The Department at present employs some 190 professional engineers. Since 1964, 38 scholarships have been awarded and further scholarships will be awarded this year.  So far, ten students have graduated and are serving as engineers in the Department.</P>
    <P>Some 700 telephonists were recruited to meet operating requirements during last summer's peak traffic period and the recruitment and training of staff to meet requirements for next summer has commenced.</P>
    <P>The Department's welfare officers, of whom there are six in the Dublin area, one in Cork and one in Limerick, continue to provide a most valuable service to the staff and to the Department.</P>
    <P>Turning now to staff relations, I would like, first of all, to pay tribute to the staff for the way in which they carried out their work during the last year.  We have come to expect a high standard of service from post office staff and may perhaps tend to take it for granted.  It is only right, therefore, that I should place on record my appreciation of their efforts during the past year.  In the current year, and in the years ahead even greater effort will be needed from them in view of the present tight money situation and the need for the post office to break even financially.  I feel sure that the Department will have the understanding and the co-operation of the staff in this situation.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Estimate last year I mentioned that management and staff representatives have been examining <Col N="2445" /> together how staff can be given a greater sense of involvement and participation in the affairs of their offices, and with this object in mind it had been agreed to set up consultation councils at some of the major staff centres.  Since then further consultation councils have been established.  Such councils are now functioning at almost all the major centres.  The question of extending them to the remaining offices will be considered by the management and staff representatives after some further experience of their operation.  While nobody expected that consultation councils would solve all the problems in the post office I feel sure that they must have contributed, at least in some measure, to a better understanding all round of many of these problems.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the employment on an experimental basis of consultants using the behavioural sciences. While the pilot assignment has not yet been completed the indications are that the use of these sciences can be helpful in isolating causes of dissatisfaction and suggesting ways in which work can be made more satisfying.  The question of carrying out a further test is at present being considered.</P>
    <P>Because of the demands that training in decimalisation made last year, training of supervisors and other staff had to be curtailed somewhat.  Now that the decimalisation hurdle has been cleared, the provision of training courses internally by the Department and the attendance of staff at selected courses conducted by the Civil Service training centre, College of Industrial Relations and other outside bodies has been resumed.  My Department are keenly conscious of the need to keep abreast of modern thinking in supervision and human relations, and staff will be released from their normal duties for training of this kind so far as our resources permit.  The standard entry training schemes provided by the Department have also been under review during the year and certain changes which it is felt will help in turning out better qualified engineering technicians have been agreed between the Department and the union concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2446" /> The use of work study and other techniques aimed at raising the efficiency of the various services was continued during the year, and satisfactory results continue to be achieved. I mentioned last year that the Department had ordered a computer which is expected to be delivered in 1972. Staff for systems analysis and programming work for the computer have been recruited, and preparatory work in the first area to be processed by computer is well advanced.  In the meantime use is being made of computer bureaux where there is advantage in doing so and where the necessary preparation work is not extensive.</P>
    <P>A subject that has been raised repeatedly by Deputies on this Estimate over the years is that of pensions for temporary and part-time staff.  A staff claim on this has been before the General Council under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for some time past but a report of the discussions has not yet been issued.  Under a separate agreement on the claim however, it was agreed to recommend a very substantial improvement in the retirement gratuity for part-time staff, and this improvement has been in operation for some time past.</P>
    <P>Pay is such a major part of post office expenditure that it obviously calls for comment.  Post office staff were parties to the 12th round agreement in the Civil Service, which in turn was based on an agreement for the public service generally. That agreement remains in force until the end of December, 1971.  The 13th round national agreement will then come into operation.  The £2 a week increase provided for in the national agreement as from 1st January next will cost the post office £2.4 million a year; the 4 per cent which will come into effect on 1st January 1973, will cost a further £1.3 million, and as Deputies are aware the national agreement provides for a further increase on that date should the cost of living rise in 1972 by more than 4 per cent.  Moreover, the Department have had to concede increases in respect of certain claims for restoration of traditional pay relativities with other classes, and other similar claims are under discussion at <Col N="2447" /> the Departmental Council under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>It will be evident from what I have said that rising staff costs will make it very difficult for the Department to maintain present standards of service unless charges are increased further.</P>
    <P>Deposits by members of the general public in the post office savings bank amounted to £57 million during 1970 and withdrawals to £43.4 million.  At 31st December, 1970, the total balance due to depositors, including interest amounting to £5 million, was approximately £139.4 million, an increase of £18.6 million on the figure for 31st December, 1969.  During 1970 the volume of the post office savings bank business was abnormally high because of the banks dispute.</P>
    <P>During the first few months of 1971 the volume of savings bank business continued at a high level, the number of transactions being 18 per cent above that for the corresponding period of 1970.  The unexpected increase in business during the banks dispute, and since then, strained the Department's staff and ADP machine resources at headquarters and resulted in heavy arrears of work.  These arrears led, regrettably, to considerable delays at times in dealing with correspondence from the public and in returning savings bank books to depositors who had forwarded them for the addition of interest.  Special efforts are being made to bring the work up-to-date.</P>
    <P>Net deposits in the post office savings bank by the trustee savings bank amounted to £5.4 million in 1970.  The total amount to the credit of the trustee savings banks at the end of 1970, including £12.3 million in the special investment account, was £33.9 million, an increase of £7 million over the previous year.</P>
    <P>Sales of 6½ per cent Investment Bonds in 1970 amounted to £1.8 million&mdash;a decrease of £3.5 million compared with 1969, the year of their introduction.  Repayments in 1970 totalled £0.4 million, an increase of £0.2 million compared with 1969.  The balance to the credit of investors at the end of 1970 was £6.5 million compared with £5.1 million at the end of <Col N="2448" /> 1969.</P>
    <P>Sales of savings certificates during 1970 amounted to £4.2 million, and repayments, including interest, came to £5.8 million.  The net outflow of £1.6 million was almost the same as in 1969.  The principal remaining invested at the end of 1970 was £46.6 million, approximately the same as at the end of 1969.</P>
    <P>A new issue of savings certificates, the eighth, was launched on the 14th June this year.  The yield from this issue is 35 per cent over a period of five years, which represents a compound interest rate of 6 per cent per annum free of income tax.  This is equal to 9¼ per cent per annum for a person paying income tax at the standard rate.  The comparable yield from the previous issue was 50 per cent over a period of eight years, a compound interest rate of 5¼ per cent per annum free of income tax.  Sales of the new issue for the three and a half months ended 30th September, totalled £3.6 million.</P>
    <P>The national instalment-savings scheme was introduced by the Minister for Finance under the management of my Department on the 1st September, 1970.  Under the scheme a person agrees to save 12 monthly instalments of £1 or any number of pounds up to £20, and to leave the total so saved on deposit for a further two years.  At the end of that period, the saver will receive a tax-free bonus of 25 per cent of the amount saved.  In the 12 months ended 31st August last 36,000 agreements and instalments totalling £4 million were received in my Department.</P>
    <P>The aggregate result for 1970 for the savings media with which my Department is directly concerned was a net increase in savings of £20.9 million exclusive of interest compared with £4.8 million for 1969.</P>
    <P>I should like to record my appreciation of the excellent work done by the National Savings Committee in promoting small savings.</P>
    <P>The value of money orders issued in 1970 was £86.2 million as compared with £37.7 million the previous year. The value of postal orders issued in 1970 was £14.2 million compared with £8.9 million in 1969.  The abnormal <Col N="2449" /> increase in both money order and postal order business in 1970 can be attributed to the banks dispute.</P>
    <P>Agency service payments made by the Post Office, mainly on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, increased from £64 million&mdash;in 1969 to £81.5 million in 1970.  Post offices took part as usual in the sales of prize bonds, handling about 33 per cent of the total collected in 1970.</P>
    <P>The Department publish commercial accounts which present their position as a trading concern.  They are compiled in accordance with commercial practice to show the expenditure incurred and income earned in the year of account.  Thus items like pension liability, interest and depreciation are included in the expenditure before arriving at the surplus or deficit.  The accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>It is largely on the basis of these accounts that financial policy, including the fixing of charges, is determined. The policy of successive Governments has been that the post office should pay their way, taking one year with another; otherwise the deficit would have to be met by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Appendix C of the Book of Estimates provides a summary of the results for the four years 1965-66 to 1968-69 and provisional figures for 1969-70.  The commercial accounts for 1969-70 have now been laid before the House and show an overall surplus of £512,756.  The surplus of £892,857 on the telephone service was partly offset by deficits of £361,373 on the postal service and £18,728 on the telegraph service.  In the three previous years there were overall deficits of £823,000, £467,0000 and £430,000.</P>
    <P>The accounts for the year 1970-71 will not be available for some time yet but it is expected that they will show an overall deficit of about £1½ million. In this connection the 12th round and other pay increases made very heavy additions to the Department's costs, as also did movements in prices.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, charges for postal, telegraph and telephone services were increased in the second half of <Col N="2450" /> 1970-71 towards meeting these extra costs, but it was realised at the time that they would not be sufficient to take the Department out of the red.  I have already referred to various pay awards which will increase the Department's costs still further in the current and in future years.  It seems at present that the overall deficits in 1971-72 and 1972-73 will be even greater than the present estimate of £1½ million for 1970-71.  In these circumstances, the question of a further adjustment of post office charges will have to be considered shortly but I am not in a position to say any more than that at present.</P>
    <P>As has been the practice, my remarks on broadcasting will be confined to important issues and developments affecting the television and radio services and to matters in which, as Minister, I have a statutory function.</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Éireann's accounts for 1970-71 are not yet available.  They are expected to show an estimated overall surplus of £3,000.  This compares with an overall deficit of £21,383 in 1969-70 and an overall surplus of £144,312 in 1968-69.  The very small surplus in 1970-71 illustrates the authority's continued difficulty in making ends meet, notwithstanding the increase in licence fees which came into effect from 1st July, 1970, and which increased the authority's revenue in that year by about £400,000.</P>
    <P>In this situation the authority found it necessary to make application for a further increase in licence fees during the current year.  It was decided, as Deputies know, to increase the combined licence fee from £6 to £7.50 with effect from 1st September, 1971, and also to abolish the separate radio licence fee of £1.50 as from 1st September, 1972.  The abolition of the separate radio licence will mainly benefit the less well-off sections of the community.  The number of such licences has, of course, been steadily diminishing with the spread of television, and at the present time almost 80 per cent of licences issued are combined licences.  With the abolition of the radio licence, which I am sure will be welcomed by most Deputies, the present &ldquo;combined&rdquo; licence will <Col N="2451" /> become a television licence, though, of course, part of the licence fee revenue will continue to be allocated to the sound broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>These licence fee adjustments will, it is estimated, provide RTE with net additional revenue of £550,000 in a full year.  The extra revenue from licences should enable RTE to show a modest profit during the current year.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the printed volume of Estimates for a grant of £2,785,000 to the authority in respect of the net receipts from licence fees during 1971-72.  This does not, of course, include the estimated additional revenue which will be brought in by the recent changes in licence fees.  The supplementary estimate which will be introduced later will make provision for the appropriate extra grant, £420,000, to Radio Telefís Éireann in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that evasion of payment of licence fees continues to be a problem.  A special campaign was mounted by my Department this year and it met with a good measure of success.  A feature of this campaign was the use of the television detection van in several areas.  Indications are that it had considerable effect in persuading defaulters to take out licences.  As I foreshadowed in my speech on last year's Estimate, I expect shortly to introduce a Bill providing for the compulsory registration of purchases and rentings of television sets to facilitate detection of licence evaders, and for heavier fines for possession of unlicensed sets.  It is in this Bill that I propose to provide for the abolition of the sound only licence.</P>
    <P>In March, 1970 the restrictions on wired television systems relaying external programmes were relaxed.  Since then Radio Telefís Éireann have been providing such systems in competition with commercial firms.  It is too early yet to make a reliable forecast of the effect which this development will have on the authority's finances generally. The use of these multi-channel systems is confined to the area in which external programmes can be received directly &ldquo;off the air&rdquo;.  There is no change in the position that authority cannot be given for the use of special <Col N="2452" /> technical means, such as microwave links, to extend the range of external programmes.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, RTE were authorised to spend up to £700,000 in 1970-71.  Including the outlay on communal aerial television systems, total capital expenditure on new works amounted to £682,000.  In the present financial year, the authority have been authorised to spend up to £1,200,000. This is considerably higher than in recent years, and reflects the added demands for capital presented by the Radio na Gaeltachta project and RTE's development of wired television systems.  In addition to these two items this capital allocation is intended to cover expenditure on the Radio Centre and equipment, and on general television and radio requirements.</P>
    <P>The provision of studios and technical facilities for Radio na Gaeltachta has been put in hands by Radio Telefís Éireann, and it is hoped that preliminary transmissions will commence in spring, 1972.  To ensure that programme planning for the service could proceed, I have appointed a Council&mdash; Comhairle Radio na Gaeltachta&mdash; under section 21 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>The council are broadly representative of the Gaeltacht areas and interests. They will be concerned with the whole range of Radio na Gaeltachta activity and will exercise close surveillance of the general policy and operation of the service.  They have already commenced their meetings. The service will be available initially on medium frequencies in the main Gaeltacht areas, and also on VHF in those areas covered by the three western VHF transmitters, that is roughly west of a line from Cork to Derry. It is intended to extend this area by providing VHF transmitters at Kippure and Mount Leinster to carry the service.  The capital required for Radio na Gaeltachta is being provided by way of an Exchequer grant and, provision for £200,000 to meet the estimated expenditure this year will be provided in a supplementary estimate for my Department.</P>
    <P>The position regarding colour television <Col N="2453" /> is that experimental transmissions are continuing.  These experimental transmissions consist of programmes&mdash;mainly of sporting events &mdash;produced by means of one of the authority's outside broadcasting units, live relays from abroad and imported films.  I would like to stress, however, for the information of persons who may be thinking of buying or renting a colour set, that regular or studio transmissions in colour from RTE cannot be contemplated for several years ahead.  This is because of the heavy cost which would be involved for the authority and the effect such transmissions would have on the general economy through stimulating the purchase of expensive imported colour television sets.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on my Department's Estimate for 1970-71 reference was made to a short-wave radio station for this country and I promised to have the question reexamined. The reasons for not proceeding with the short-wave service in the early 1950s were the difficulty of getting a suitable wavelength, the negligible amount of international shortwave listening throughout the world because of poor listening conditions, the general absence of short-wave bands on receiving sets in America and the appeal of television. I am advised that the position remains substantially the same.  The cost of providing a shortwave service would be very heavy and in all the circumstances I have come to the conclusion that the provision of such a service could not be justified at present.</P>
    <P>On the 28th September, 1971, members of an illegal organisation were interviewed on a television programme &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; in a way which I, and the Government, considered to be prejudicial to the public interest. Following full consideration, and with the approval of the Government, I issued a written direction to the authority on 1st October, 1971, &ldquo;to refrain from broadcasting any matter of the following class, i.e., any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages <Col N="2454" /> or advocates the attaining of any particular objective by violent means&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was the first time any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs used the powers of prohibition conferred on him by section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  I need hardly say that it was with great reluctance that I came to the conclusion that it was necessary in the public interest to invoke that section of the Act.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I set up the Broadcasting Review Committee last June with terms of reference which require them &ldquo;to review the progress of the television and sound broadcasting services since the enactment of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, with particular reference to the objectives prescribed in that Act, and to make any recommendations considered appropriate in regard to the further development of the services&rdquo;.  The committee have been actively pursuing their studies and I look forward to their report when their deliberations have been completed.  I have already indicated my intention of laying the committee's report before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is, of course, too early to give a reliable estimate of when the report is likely to be available.</P>
    <P>The term of office of the authority expired on 31st May, 1971.  In view of the establishment of the Broadcasting Review Committee, it was considered inappropriate to appoint a new authority for a full term.  I am glad to say that the chairman and members accepted an invitation to continue for a further year, and were appointed accordingly for a new term which ends on 31st May, 1972.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrigidHoganOHiggins" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the notes we got some days ago and also for his Estimate statement.  It is a very comprehensive and a very complex one.  I should like too to make an apology. I had no idea until late last night, or early this morning, that this Estimate was being taken today so I have not got a lot of homework done.  I shall work on the Minister's speech as I go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech is very complex but full of red lights.  I mean red lights with <Col N="2455" /> regard to increases here and there.  This whole Department have become very large and in many ways very unwieldy, I appreciate that on the whole the Minister's staff are excellent and give a very good service to the large numbers of the community.  There are exceptions and while some of them must be mentioned here I do not want the Minister to get the feeling that we are perpetually cribbing about postal services.  Nevertheless, it is our duty as an opposition to keep a watchful eye on the service.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that the number of people using the ordinary letter mail has decreased.  A charge of four-pence is quite substantial.  I can understand why there has been a decrease.  On the whole, the delivery of letters throughout rural Ireland is good but the same cannot be said for Dublin city.  Although we have been given an assurance that letters posted on, say, Friday morning, will be delivered that afternoon, this has not been the case.  I have posted letters from Leinster House to my home in Rathfarnham on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning but they have not been delivered until Monday evening or Tuesday morning.  Deputies have complained to me that their post is not being treated as first-class mail. While one might wonder if all our mail deserves to be treated as first-class, nevertheless we are elected by our constituents to look after their problems and I think our post should be treated as first-class mail.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there has been a considerable improvement in air mail post.  I get very few complaints about this matter and this is how I judge the situation.  Last year we were flooded with complaints about delays in this service.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that motorised delivery services were introduced in rural areas.  I have always considered it unfortunate that postmen in rural Ireland had no transport other than bicycles.  The uniforms of the postmen could be improved.  They are drab and dreary and some complaints have been made about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that special postage stamps were issued in 1970 <Col N="2456" /> and that more will be issued in 1971-72.  On the whole our stamps, from the point of view of design and quality have improved.  It is 50 years since the signing of the Treaty and I think the Government should be adult enough to have a commemoration stamp for Arthur Griffith.  He can hardly be termed merely a civil war figure.  To my mind, he was the foremost person in this country in the fight for freedom and we should be generous enough to recognise this fact. However, this is something we must wait for until a later date.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is a matter of national importance.  If we get into the Common Market we will certainly have to improve our telephone service. I have always maintained that this service should be taken away from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; it should be an autonomous body with power to raise its own capital and run its own affairs.  The telephone service is the only one that is making money and yet not enough capital is provided for the extra cables, installations and equipment needed.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is chaotic. The lines in Dublin are completely overloaded.  Rural Ireland might be in outer space instead of, at most, 150 miles away.  It is much more difficult to get a telephone call to Lisdoonvarna than to phone London, New York or Amsterdam.  Late last night I received a phone call in my home from Galway and I was told by the callers that they had been ringing my phone number for more than a few hours.  They told me they could hear the phone ringing but they could not get an answer.  In fact, the phone did not ring in my home during that time.  This must mean overloading of the cables.  This phone call I received was merely a quasi-social call but it could have been an urgent call from a constituent.</P>
    <P>Business people have made numerous complaints about our telephone service.  They say that business is being ruined because of lack of proper telephone communications.  What is the use of the Industrial Credit Company, the Industrial Development Authority or any other body spending much time <Col N="2457" /> inducing foreign industrialists to set up west of the Shannon, or in remote regions, when they cannot make a telephone call to Dublin?  This will discourage industrialists from coming here.  The Minister points out that much capital has been spent in improving the service.  It is not enough and much more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the waiting list for telephones increased by more than 2,000 to 15,000 at the end of March last and that presently it is more than 18,500.  Even though more money is being spent on this service, the waiting list is increasing and the situation is becoming more chaotic.  The Minister should make an all-out effort to raise extra capital and clear this baclog.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that a number of automatic exchanges have been completed. In my constituency the exchange at Gort has been completed for a number of years and in Loughrea the building is completed, although I do not know what it is like inside.  These exchanges appear to be completed but they do not seem to have been put into operation.  Can the Minister state the reasons for the holdup?</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the condition of post office buildings is deteriorating and the staff are working under difficult conditions.  Tempers are becoming frayed and the customers are getting a worse service.  In my constituency I have had complaints about a certain exchange, about which I have spoken to the postmaster.  I went to see the girls in this exchange; I found they were working in appalling conditions and I wondered how they were so polite to the customers.</P>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister about a new exchange at Cahirciveen, County Kerry, which I consider is giving very bad service. This is a tourist area and this bad service is not helping tourism.  Tourists do not understand when there is a long delay in getting a telephone call&mdash; although I admit French tourists might understand this as they are used to a very bad service.  Such service tends to give a bad impression of the country. The Irish subscribers in Cahirciveen also think they are getting a very raw <Col N="2458" /> deal.  I have spoken to the Minister about this matter and I know he took it up but the service has not improved. I would be grateful if the Minister would take up the matter again.</P>
    <P>The telex communication service appears to be going ahead satisfactorily and I have received many appreciative letters from users of this service.  We should use this facility more frequently and thus lighten the load on services such as those catering for telegrams, and so on.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the staff of the Department are now in line, or nearly in line, with the staffs of other Departments with regard to pay.  It is very important that we should pay our civil servants a decent wage and give them a decent standard of living.  They are the most abused, perhaps, of all the people in the country.  We are inclined to blame civil servants.  On the whole, they are an excellent body of people. I note that the Minister says that because of the 13th round increase it will be necessary to increase charges. I wonder what charges does the Minister intend to increase.</P>
    <P>The people now feel that Post and Telegraph charges generally have reached saturation point.  Yet the staff must be paid.  If there is an increase in the cost of living their salaries will have to be increased.  The Minister can be assured that the cost of living is rising more rapidly than anyone has anticipated and that he will have to pay increased salaries in 1972-73.  I cannot see the Minister getting increased revenue from the postal services because, the higher the price of the stamp, the more the customer will start to have second thoughts about writing letters.</P>
    <P>I note that there are six welfare officers in the Dublin area.  This is very necessary.  Young girls coming from the country very often need advice and help.  This welfare staff should be readily available to them.  I hope these youngsters are made aware that these welfare people are available to them to provide them with advice and assistance.  The post office employ young staff and when they come to the city from the country they are bewildered and need advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2459" /> I am glad that the Minister has gone ahead with the arrangements to provide a closer liaison between management and staff.  In this way a great many problems can be overcome without going to arbitration and without involving strikes.  If there is a close liaison between management and staff many small problems can be ironed out to the satisfaction of all.</P>
    <P>The small savings scheme continues to prosper.  I am glad to see this.  In rural Ireland young people are inclined to put money into the post office. They find it convenient and, generally speaking, they know the sub-postmaster or the sub-postmistress.  The banks are big and impersonal and they do not like to go into a bank with a few pounds.  They feel that it is <i>infra dig</i>.  They do not mind going into the post office with small savings.  The small savings scheme, from £1 to £20, is an excellent one, and one that we should all encourage.</P>
    <P>There will have to be a change of heart on the part of the Department with regard to telephone kiosks in rural Ireland.  They should be supplied as a social service and not on the basis of whether they make money.  They are vitally important in rural Ireland. Deputy Desmond will probably be talking about the large housing estates in Dublin but in those estates if you knock at somebody's door you will find he has a telephone, whereas in rural Ireland a telephone kiosk can make the difference between life and death.  In my constituency doctors live as far apart as 20 to 30 miles.  A telephone kiosk provides a vital link between the people and the doctors.  Saying to Deputies and other people that a telephone kiosk will not be provided in a certain place because it would not make money is not good enough. It is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The telephone directory was improved last year.  I think the printing is getting smaller or perhaps my sight is getting worse as I get older.  It strikes me that the binding could be better.  At present the backs fall off the directories.  Even the ones around the House here are in bits in no time.</P>

      <P>It should be possible for the Department to punch a hole in the directories so that we could put a piece of string through them and hang them up.  It is very irritating to find the telephone directory thrown here and there.</P>
      <P>To get back to the kiosks.  I sometimes go into public kiosks in Dublin to see if they are working.  I notice that on the outskirts of the city many of the telephones are out of order.  This is probably pure vandalism.  I do not know how we can overcome this problem. Possibly more could be done in the schools.  The Minister and the Minister for Education might arrange to have talks given to the children to teach them that telephone kiosks are public property and as such they must not be destroyed.  They should be told that these telephones are very important. There should not be so much vandalism in the city.  There is a lot of it and it frightens me.  It is a bad sign.  I suppose parents have a responsibility, too, but much could be done, and should be done, in the schools.</P>
      <P>I see that money orders are increasing. I find that the post office are very careful about money orders.  If there is any question about one being lost they are very quick to look into the matter and replace it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he had a small surplus but that he expects to have an overall deficit of £1½ million. I do not know what to advise in this situation.  That is not my job.  I suppose his officials will advise the Minister. Postal charges and telegraph charges cannot be further increased. If telegraph charges are increased that service will go out of business. I have always felt that it is the policy of the Department to discourage people from using the telegraph service. Whether or not this is so, the charges are such that one would imagine that the Department were trying to make them prohibitive rather than to encourage the use of the service.  I would not advocate increasing telephone charges although I imagine the Minister will be tempted to do so because of the increasing use of the telephone and because of the absolute reliance of business people and, indeed, all subscribers on the telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2461" /> The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the question of a further adjustment of post office charges will have to be considered shortly but I am not in a position to say any more than that at present.</P>
    <P>I suppose that when the Minister is in a position to do so he will tell us and we can discuss it further.  We could be guessing here all day and wasting our time and the Minister's time.  I do not think that would achieve anything.</P>
    <P>The Minister has in his Department, if I may say so, a very sticky section, that is, the broadcasting section.  It is becoming a big thing.  It is becoming the most important influence in our lives.  Of all the media television is the one wielding the greatest influence. For that reason it behoves us here to keep a very close eye on television.  I appreciate that the people in Montrose regard us as mere politicians, knowing nothing about the workings of television. They are inclined to be a little bit temperamental, shall I say, about criticism or even about advice.  They are now ten years in operation and some of the news commentators and some of the producers seem to feel they are practically omnipotent.  They are not omnipotent and it is, perhaps, no harm to remind them of that now and then.  In saying this, I am not advocating that we should perpetually interfere with the working of Telefís Éireann.  That would not be a good thing but there should, I think, be a close check kept on the working of Telefís Éireann.  After all, we are elected by the people and, whether the people in Telefís Éireann like it or not, we represent the views of the people.</P>
    <P>Last year, on the Estimate, I made a remark about a certain programme and, as a result, my telephone never stopped ringing for two days; they were abusive calls, some of them obviously from Telefís Éireann.  The calls were obviously set up because those speaking all used the same phraseology.  Then the man whose programme I criticised &ldquo;had himself a ball&rdquo; for 30 minutes, or so, on <Col N="2462" /> television, saying anything he liked about me, and he then went into three or four columns of print.  Fine.  He is entitled to do that.  But my advice to the people in Telefís Éireann is to listen to criticism.  While nobody likes criticism, one can always with advantage glean a little truth from it.  We should be free to raise our voices here without calling down upon us a tirade of abuse.</P>
    <P>On the whole, Telefís Éireann is very good.  I believe, though I have not discussed this to any great extent with my party, that the Minister was quite right in the stand he took about illegal organisations.  Over the past year I have been increasingly worried at the amount of time and coverage given to members of these organisations by Telefís Éireann.  I did not think it was a good thing.  I can understand their point of view; they say these organisations exist and people should be aware of their points of view.  I do not agree with this.  We should give absolutely no encouragement, or even any sign of encouragement, to illegal organisations and, as the main moulder of public opinion, Telefís Éireann should be very careful.  The Minister gave this directive and most of the programmes behaved excellently about it.  Notice was taken of it by the newscasters and by those who run &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;. One Irish programme still gives a little too much coverage and the Late, Late Show is not completely free from blame.  Occasionally, coverage is given in that programme to a member of an illegal organisation.  Those responsible for these programmes should be alerted and, if the great danger inherent in doing this sort of thing is pointed out to them, I am sure they will act responsibly about it.</P>
    <P>We have either become sophisticated or blasé, but the standard of the programmes in Telefís Éireann seems to be going down.  Perhaps it is because they are short of money.  I just do not know.  The &ldquo;current affairs&rdquo; programmes are still good, but not as good as they were.  Even the presentation has deteriorated.  I have noticed a certain sloppiness, bad grammar and poor presentation.  Drama is non-existent. The canned American and English programmes are getting worse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2463" /> The schools programme is excellent and the more time given to this programme the better it will be.  It is one way of visually educating children. They seem to learn from television when they cannot learn or, perhaps will not learn, from their teachers and their parents.  The more time and money Telefís Éireann spend on schools programmes the better.</P>
    <P>Sports coverage is excellent.  I have seen it in colour and it is really very good.  Music is non-existent.  I do not know what has become of our orchestras. We are quite a musical people as a nation, but the only music seems to be traditional music and &ldquo;pop&rdquo;.  The younger generation like &ldquo;pop&rdquo;.  I do not understand it at all.  Surely we could have more light music.  We are rearing a generation of children and we are doing nothing to expose them to any cultural influences.  Television and radio have an important part to play here and they should play it.</P>
    <P>As far as radio is concerned, one listens to it not at all, or only in the car, or when one is doing one's household chores.  On the whole, the radio programmes are good but, for £7 10s, Radio Telefís Éireann are not giving the customer a good return.  On the east coast one has access to other wavelengths but in areas like south Cork, Kerry, Galway and all along the western seaboard the only wavelength one can get is Radio Telefís Éireann.  People ask me: &ldquo;Can you not do something about Radio Telefís Éireann?  We are sick of it.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, in that area we are stuck with it and for £7 10s Radio Telefís Éireann are not giving us a good service.</P>
    <P>We used to have a number of continuity girls.  Whether Women's Lib went wrong, or what, I do not know, but we see less and less of these girls now.  I think that is a bad thing.  I think girls make quite good announcers. I know the BBC does not use them, but girls are very pleasant to look at and they have pleasant voices. I do not see why a great deal more use is not made of them.</P>
    <P>The report about the shortage of video tapes has disturbed me.  I understand Telefís Éireann have wiped off <Col N="2464" /> Jimmy O'Dea and Seán Ó Riada.  This is a tragedy.  A few years ago I saw a full hour of Jimmy O'Dea and it was the funniest programme I ever saw. Seán Ó Riada was one of the finest musicians this country produced.  His death was a sad blow.  It is a tragedy that his tapes were not preserved.  This shows a shortsightedness on someone's part.  These tapes should be preserved. Why not wipe out the politicians? Posterity will not rely on politicians but it will rely on Seán Ó Riada.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo;, after an absence of three years, has returned to the screen.  I was on the first programme. In my opinion it is too late at night and it is too short.  It is not possible to have a decent discussion in 25 minutes. The form in which politicians sit in a V shape is not suitable and as no desks are supplied there is nowhere for them to put their notes.  If one has notes in one's hand it is obvious one is reading. Telefís Éireann should try to facilitate politicians in order to get the best out of them.  I had nowhere to put my notes when I was on television and I found it rather disconcerting.  I know the Minister who appeared with me was quite agitated that he had nowhere to put his notes.  I mentioned it to the authority at the time but when I saw the programme last week the position was exactly the same.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to have politicians on the air now and then as it gives constituents a chance to see Opposition Deputies because as Telefís Éireann is set up at the moment all one seems to get are pictures of Ministers opening factories, Ministers making speeches and so on, but one never sees an Opposition Deputy and one wonders if there is any Opposition at all.  In point of fact we are labouring away on behalf of our constituents but we never get on television.</P>
    <P>My view on advertising is well known.  Advertisements should be informative and educational; they are certainly not educational and very often they are not informative either.  The Telefís Éireann advertisement about TV spongers irritates me although I understand it is very effective.  A number of the advertisements for articles such as toothpaste and washing powders <Col N="2465" /> are made by English firms and the fact that the actors have English accents immediately puts me off buying the product.  I am sure English accents have the same effect on other people as well.  Surely we have good actors who would be able to make television advertisements.  In general I loathe advertisements although I appreciate the authority have to get money from somewhere but I do believe we could get a better standard of advertisement than we get at present.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we had an Estimate debate in March of this year.</P>

      <P>For that reason I do not intend to speak for very much longer.  I would, however, like to ask the Minister what has happened to the Devlin Report because last year he promised us more information about it. The Devlin Report made far-reaching recommendations for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but nothing has happened.  The Minister is inclined to make these promises.  He also said last year that he was going to introduce a Bill but I do not think it has come before the House yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case we shall have a full discussion on it in a few weeks time.</P>
      <P>During the last ten years a number of rural post offices have closed down and this has meant that the paying of social welfare benefits at rural post offices is not as easy a matter as it used be.  CIE have withdrawn practically all their services in rural Ireland and as a result people have to hire taxis in order to collect their pensions. There should be some arrangement whereby pensioners could have their pensions posted out to them.  I am sure it could be done with very little adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The services provided by our sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses are second to none.  I should like to compliment them for the services they give.  I do not know any other person in rural Ireland to whom one can say, <Col N="2466" />&ldquo;Ring the vet, ring the doctor, take a message for me, tell the person who is arriving on the 6 o'clock bus such-and-such&rdquo; and he or she will do all these things with a smile.  They work long, long hours for very little remuneration, as the Minister knows. I worked out that my own postmistress works on a Sunday for 2s an hour. She is an elderly woman and she gives a tremendous service.  Our sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses give a better service than the young telephonists in the new exchanges.</P>
    <P>I do not know what sort of training telephonists are given but they should be given a crash course in basic geography.  I find myself arguing with the telephonist that there is such a place as Kinvara.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">

    <Speaker pid="BrigidHoganOHiggins" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is one in Clare/South Galway.  I can understand a telephonist mistaking Castlerea for Loughrea&mdash;that is probably due to the subscriber's mispronunciation&mdash;but to have a telephonist tell one there is no such place as the place one is trying to call is neither good for the telephonist nor the subscriber and does not make for general harmony.  It is also bad for tourism. This is one of the little ways in which we let ourselves down.  The girls in the exchange cannot help the shortage of lines but they can be polite and on the whole they are.  As I get older I seem to become more short-tempered and like many subscribers I am probably more at fault than the telephonist, but the end result is very unhappy. Generally, I would say the Minister's staff are second to none.  I am glad to see they are being reasonably well paid.  I can assure the Minister that the cost of living is going to go up 4 per cent.  He should make an estimate in his budget for an increase in salaries to which his staff will be well entitled.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Minister's Department on the overall way they are handling services.  His Department is one that every member of the public comes into contact with at some stage.  I should like to thank the Minister for his detailed speech and for all his assistance during the year.</P>

      <P>May I also thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement and for the detailed background information given by his Department to every Deputy.  I notice most Departments do not make available general background information to assist Deputies.  I find myself in a slightly cynical frame of mind facing the Minister this morning.  I never thought I would see the day when the protégé of Deputy Neil Blaney, already in a ministerial seat, would have voted him out of that party.  The Minister perhaps more than anybody else in Fianna Fáil owes his seat to that Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the ways of politics and this is my way of making a friendly opening comment to the Minister.  It is important to point out that the Estimate for this Department is one of the major Estimates to come before the House in recent years.  One might regard the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as being one of the major growth areas of the development in this country. There are now almost 21,000 persons employed in that Department.  This is a larger number of people than are employed by CIE and that comparison alone indicates the immense importance of the Department in the development of an effective national communications system and in the provision of a major public service.  As a fellow trade unionist, I can say that in my experience the staff of the Department are second to none and that the growth in staff is both necessary and welcome.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects of the Minister's speech with which I wish to deal although I do not propose speaking on this Estimate at any length because a number of the matters involved were dealt with here in February and March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is notable and, indeed, becoming increasingly disgraceful that in all of <Col N="2468" /> the Estimate speeches there is evidence of a complete absence of Cabinet discussion on the reorganisation of the various Government Departments.  Last week the Minister for Lands told us that he would have wished to have seen the recommendations of the Devlin Report implemented in respect of his Department.  Obviously, all is quite well in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because there is no indication of any desire on their part to implement the Devlin recommendations. I do not blame the senior departmental staff for this because the blame rests with the Cabinet.  The Devlin Report suggested that there was need for the establishment of a new Government Department, a Department of Transport and Communications of which the entire postal and telecommunications service would form a part.  The recommendations raised many complex issues relating to the Department not the least of which was the question as to whether there should be a separate Government Department but since April, 1970, the Minister has been telling the House that these matters are under consideration. However, from information available within the Department there is no evidence of any work being done at Cabinet level on the rationalisation and reorganisation of Government administration affecting the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Therefore, I wonder why we should bother to ask men of eminence to help compile reports and why we should spend a great deal of public money on such reports when they are consigned at departmental level and, particularly, at Cabinet level, to the wastepaper basket.  It is a measure of the failure of Fianna Fáil to come to grips with building an Ireland of the seventies and eighties that we are trying to run the country on a departmental structure of the twenties and thirties.  I will not labour that point further but we must continue to hammer it here because nothing has been done in respect of the Devlin Report and its implications for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I might add that there are very extensive and clear-cut recommendations in the report relating to this particular Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the information that the <Col N="2469" /> Minister intends planning a further six postage stamps in 1972.  These are to comprise the Europa stamp, a stamp in the series on contemporary Irish art, a Christmas stamp&mdash;I am not sure what that one is all about and whether it is designed to boost sales after the 20 per cent fall of last year&mdash;a stamp to mark World Health Day, 1972, stamps to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Olympic Council of Ireland and one to mark the issue of the first Irish postage stamp.  Generally, these are welcome.  Without any intention on my part of adding further fuel to the flames, I would like to mention a suggestion made during the year to the effect that it might be appropriate to issue postage stamps commemorating Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith.  A country which saw fit to issue stamps commemorating Jack B. Yeats, stamps marking the elimination of racialism at international level, stamps in respect of European Conservation Year and a country which could find time to issue a stamp commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Royal Cork Yacht Club and a country which, appropriately, issued stamps commemorating Terence MacSwiney, Tomás MacCurtain and Kevin Barry, might have considered it appropriate to issue, without further ado, stamps commemorating Michael collins and Arthur Griffith once such a request had been made.  It might be appropriate to commemorate these two leading political figures who were involved in the gaining of political independence for this country and who made contributions to this country that were distinctive in their own way despite the limitations that the Government Party might attach to these contributions. It was politically immature and, historically, rather vindictive that there was such smallmindedness within the Cabinet, and particularly on the part of certain members of the Cabinet, that the request was not acceded to. Neither the Minister's father nor mine were on the side of Michael Collins in the Civil War but nevertheless I do not think that either the Minister or I would wish to spend political time and energy in having to discuss this matter further because I am sure that he would accept that when there was a feeling within the country that such a <Col N="2470" /> stamp should be issued, this should have been done.</P>
    <P>I share the public concern and alarm at the deterioration of the public telephone service, over which very considerable frustration is being experienced at two levels.  Due to lack of capital, due to the failure of the Government to plan effectively for capital investment in the telephone service, the standard of general maintenance and of equipment has fallen off notwithstanding the tremendous work done by post office technicians and by the postal engineering staff.  I do not think they are to blame in any way.  The money is not being given to them, the equipment is not being given to them and the maintenance expenditure, which is now of a very high order with the growing telecommunications network, is not matching the growth of installation.  As a result existing subscribers frequently complain of lack of service which can simply be traced to lack of effective maintenance particularly on the eastern seaboard area.</P>
    <P>The second level of frustration is one with which most Deputies are familiar. There are now in the country 18,500 people looking for telephones, they cannot get them and many of them are not likely to do so for several years. Many Deputies, including the Minister, are slowly but quietly going out of their minds answering correspondence &mdash;I have this experience&mdash;from constituents who are looking for telephones. One says: &ldquo;There is not much point making further representations to the Minister when the exchange is grossly overloaded and when essential equipment has not yet been put into X area and it looks as if what the telephone contract manager says, that you will be waiting for six or 12 months or two years, is in fact the position.&rdquo;  I do not think that in the public service it is good enough that there should be a situation where the waiting list is growing rather than diminishing.  I know this is a reflection of the improvement in living standards in the country. All to the good.  With the growth in industrial development, particularly outside Dublin, there is an extensive demand for telephones from the business community and from private subscribers. An increasing number of <Col N="2471" /> farmers throughout the country are installing telephones.  This is a measure of the increasing wealth of the nation. All to the good.  There will be no political objection to it on our part.  I do think it is very serious though that a Government Department, in an area where people pay for the service and if you do not pay for it you do not have it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This demands very urgent attention on the part of the Minister.  While I appreciate that he personally is doing his best I think the capital allocation by the Government is not sufficient.  He must kick up holy hell at Cabinet level and make sure that the money is allocated in the Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement means that we could find ourselves in two or three years time with a waiting list for telephones of up to 20,000, 23,000 or 25,000 people.  Nobody wants to inherit the Minister's job in any future administration and find himself with 25,000 people looking for telephones. The original allocation of capital expenditure was £9.5 million.  Now the Minister informs us that the allocation is up to £10.73 million but, bearing in mind the general inflationary trend and the increasing cost of exchange and trunk equipment, we are very much in the situation of running fast only to remain where we are.  I would strongly urge the Minister that the priority of the Department must be to increase the number of connections in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that if the service deteriorates&mdash;I am using that word in a relative sense&mdash;because of lack of maintenance, lack of money to replace equipment and to build new exchange and trunk plant, there will be in the community a ripening demand for the setting-up of either a State-sponsored body for the telecommunications system or there will be the usual comparisons made with the private enterprise systems of America and so on.  I do not know to what extent <Col N="2472" /> the Minister has been under pressure in the political field for that kind of development but it is true that the international telecommunications consortia would dearly love to get their hands on a <i>bloc</i> of 20,000 or 25,000 people looking for telephones.  The proposition may well be made to the Government in the years ahead that this should be piped off.  I would be completely opposed to this but it is in the interests of the public, in the interest of confidence in the public, that we get to grips with the growing demand for telephones.</P>
    <P>On the buildings question I welcome the decision of the Minister to proceed with work in progress for the new district sorting office at Glenageary in County Dublin.  That is very much needed and will be a considerable improvement in that growth area.</P>
    <P>I would query the Minister's statement in relation to the decision of the Department to order a computer which is expected to be delivered in 1972. At Department of Finance level perhaps there should be a questioning of the extent to which individual Government Departments are tending to order separate computer systems.  I have a feeling that in ten years time we will have quite a considerable duplication of computer equipment both in the private and public sector. In view of the enormous cost of this equipment perhaps the Minister would advise the House if there has been an investigation within the Department prior to the ordering of the computer equipment and the employment of staff and whether the available computers have been utilised to the full. I have considerable faith in the expertise of the staff of the Department and I realise they would not go ahead with this project unless it was necessary. However, where such equipment is installed in Government Departments there should be an assurance given to the House that there was liaison and consultation with other Departments who are using computers to ensure that duplication does not arise.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the campaign with regard to evasion of payment of television licence fees.  I do not know the number of persons who <Col N="2473" /> are not paying their licence fees but I should imagine that the figure of 40,000 would not be far out.  Certainly there is a considerable number involved and I would have no great sympathy for them if they were caught.  They are getting a free ride and we have had enough of that in the country already without it being extended to radio and television services.</P>
    <P>I am worried about one aspect of the decision of the Minister with regard to the wired television system. Where RTE have been putting in the multi-channel system it is found that people no longer look at RTE.  With the installation of this system there has been a substantial switch over to BBC, to UTV, to Harlech, and so on. While welcoming the introduction of the wired television system and the relaying of external programmes, this development has considerable implications for RTE.  I have found that when many people in Dublin speak to me about political or other reports more often than not they are speaking about BBC or UTV reports.  Except for major programmes with a high TAM rating, such as the Late Late Show, people are switching over from RTE.  I know that away from the eastern seaboard people have not got a multi-channel choice but it is ironical that one of the outcomes of the wired television system sponsored by RTE is the decline in viewing audiences for RTE.</P>
    <P>There is another major difficulty in this matter also.  RTE relays must adjust and readjust continuously in a complex system, anticipating the multiplicity of channel distortions and changes made in Britain.  We are trying to provide a multi-channel relay system from stations over which we do not exert any control.  I am worried that following the installation of this system and the purchase of expensive equipment, policy changes could abort completely the work and the preparations already made.  This has happened in recent weeks in respect of one channel beamed from Wales.  One had the experience recently of looking at a BBC programme which was accompanied by a <Col N="2474" /> sound track from Madrid.  This kind of odd situation could develop increasingly in the future.</P>
    <P>While I support fully the work of RTE relays, nevertheless the Minister, in consultation with RTE, might have technical working parties set up in order to investigate the extent to which there could be consultation between him, those responsible for RTE relays and the external interests so that we will not find ourselves with very expensive connections that might not be worth anything in two or three years time.  Certainly in my constituency this wired television system is developing rapidly.</P>
    <P>One question I would ask the Minister in relation to the postal service is to what extent the Department have ensured that the lodging of mail from major business undertakings and Government Departments has been staggered? When mail is dumped in a pile at the sorting office on a Friday afternoon, major bottlenecks and difficulties arise, particularly in view of the five-day week.  I would urge business undertakings and those firms with heavy mail to co-operate more effectively with the Department by staggering their post and handing it in in sufficient time.  This would be of major benefit to the staff and increase the efficiency of the delivery system.</P>
    <P>At the risk of being repetitive, again I wish to raise the question of the political rights of the 21,000 persons employed in the postal services.  We know they cannot join a political party or be officers of a political party and that the rank and file postmen and clerks throughout the country are discriminated against grievously.  I understand with regard to the claim for civil rights by the Post Office Workers' Union and the other postal unions that they have received an offer they do not regard as satisfactory and that negotiations are proceeding.  From statements made by the Minister for Finance I am aware that the claim is still under consideration at conciliation level.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to expedite the completion of this claim.  The introduction of elementary civil rights for public servants should be granted.</P>
    <P>It is all very well lecturing and hectoring  <Col N="2475" /> the Northern Ireland Unionists about civil rights, but a postal clerk in Northern Ireland has far greater and more extensive civil and political rights than a postal clerk in the Republic. We still have the farcical situation in 1971 that an ESB employee who goes up a pole and fixes a light, can stand for Dáil Éireann, or become a local councillor, and get leave of absence to do so, and then go back to the ESB, but if a postman, or a post office employee, who goes up a pole to fix telephone wires, is caught canvassing for a political party, or attending a party political meeting&mdash;not that that has inhibited some Government Deputies, as Deputy Haughey can confirm&mdash;he can lose his employment under the departmental regulations.</P>
    <P>While I do not presume to know the political allegiances of the post office staffs, nevertheless it is time that this terrible anomaly was removed by the Minister.  It would be generally welcomed and it would open up political life in the country more effectively. Naturally the situation in regard to the higher echelons of the postal service is different, because they are involved in policy formation at executive level and understandably there has to be some restraint.  The Minister should put the screws on the Minister for Finance to do this.  This is the current pastime of the Cabinet, I gather.  There should be no difficulty in doing this since the Minister for Finance is currently putting the screws on everybody else.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister and the Minister for Justice have succeeded in having the position reversed in regard to Standard Time.  I am sure this will be a considerable improvement.</P>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins said about the telephone directory.  To use a word which a colleague of mine, Matt Merrigan, uses now and again, the directory is diabolical. That is about the only word which effectively describes it.  A six-year-old child would put a better cover on his school book than the cover on the directory.  It is dreadful.  It should be harder.  The binding is also terrible. There seems to be a craze for built-in obsolescence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2476" /> Vandalism and the lack of public spirit which affects our telephone kiosks cannot be excused.  In many areas directories have to be replaced almost every week.  In many respects the directory could be better laid out.  The Minister should give his attention to this matter.  The Department should also arrange to have a hole bored in the directory so that it can be hung up properly.  This would involve a danger of its disintegrating more quickly but still it should be done.</P>
    <P>While the Minister was interested in the possibility of having a shortwave radio system he did not give us much hope for it.  I do not think he has accepted the viewpoint of the Opposition on this matter, which I hold strongly.  I welcome Radio na Gaeltachta and I hope it will be of great benefit to the Gaeltacht areas.  I commend the Minister for the work he has done in the establishment of Radio na Gaeltachta during the past 12 months.  I still think we should have local radio systems.  I do not think the capital expenditure would be all that immense.  On the continent of Europe, in America and in Britain there are many local radio stations providing a public service, as opposed to local commercial radios.  They give a sense of identity to the local community.  This would be of major benefit to this country.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see local radios becoming local advertising media for supermarkets or something like that. We will have Radio na Gaeltachta in the Galway area but we should have radio systems in operation in Cork, Dublin and Athlone to serve those regions.  There is sufficient expertise within the RTE system and sufficient goodwill on the part of the authority to provide this service.  The local stations should be under the supervision and control of the RTE Authority.  I would hope to see in the future Radio Cork, Radio Dublin, Radio Athlone, RTE and Radio na Gaeltachta.  In many respects our communications system is rather embryonic and not very effective.</P>
    <P>With regard to RTE and their involvement in the communications system, we should take a hard look at this House and do two or three things. <Col N="2477" /> The RTE studio facilities provided in Leinster House are a disgrace to the national Parliament.  I hope that Harold Wilson is not interviewed in the RTE studio in this House tomorrow because, if I may forewarn him, there is a terrible danger that he may break his neck.  That would be a major political problem facing RTE and they would get a ministerial directive arising out of that one.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that we spent £2 million or £3 million on this place we might as well direct the Office of Public Works to provide two RTE studios here.  RTE have not got the capital.  I know that the RTE staff are part of the general Press Gallery of this House and will remain an integral part of the Press Gallery.  The facilities in the Press Gallery are already marginal in terms of decent facilities for those who have to work there.  Some members of the staff of the Press Gallery are here more often than some Deputies.  The provision of extra facilities in this House for RTE would be of major benefit.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy for the RTE staff who seem to suffer periodically from a wide variety of ear diseases because they are constrained to appear on programmes wearing earphones which link them to the station.  They are transfixed to a television camera. In the interests of their sanity and our concern for their future, they should have a decent RTE studio here.  I wish them well and I think they should get this facility immediately.  It would be of major benefit in the presentation of programmes from Leinster House itself.</P>
    <P>I would also strongly urge the Minister to consider the introduction of television into Leinster House.  There will always be the lunatic fringe admittedly, even in Parliament, who at the mere sight of a camera or a microphone will do all in their power to get into the picture as it were, and make, if they are permitted, a non-stop verbal contribution.  However, there are major occasions in this House which should, I think, be televised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <P>I accept that, but unless we initiate something ourselves it will not happen.  I have discussed this with the Labour Whip and he is very much in favour of major debates being televised.  The particular areas could be defined.  Some of the lunatic fringe might try to cash in but RTE, with their expertise, could well cope with these.  Nonsense would be cut out.</P>
      <P>There is at the moment a certain devaluation, as it were, of Parliament. There is a growing public disenchantment with Parliament.  There is also a wider gulf between the electorate and Dáil Éireann.  This is evidenced by people continually asking what exactly is going on inside here.  There are the daily newspapers and they perform a valuable public service, but we cannot run a proper parliamentary democracy effectively now on the communications system of the 1930s or the 1940s.  It is high time steps were taken to televise proceedings in this House.  I make the suggestion seriously.  The people are entitled to know what exactly is going on here.  They are entitled to see what is happening here.  That is their fundamental right in the modern communications and technological system of the 1970's.</P>

Television should be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The party political programmes are dire.  That is the only word that describes them.  This is mainly due to failure to have effective public discussions between the political parties. The ratio is one Labour Party Deputy, one Fine Gael Deputy and two Fianna Fáil Deputies.  The programmes are put <Col N="2479" /> on too late on Monday night, so late that it is almost gratuitiously insulting to the political parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are now five political parties and how RTE will work out the proper ratio for the next general election remains to be seen. There are some politicians who literally disgrace themselves on television.  They use it for party political propaganda and they make the most determined efforts to get their propaganda across. Actually they destroy themselves and their party in the process, but it all makes for very bad television.  I have the greatest respect for the chairman of the programme.  He is an agreed chairman.  As I say, the programme is put on too late and not enough time is given for a proper discussion.  A very sharp look will have to be taken at the programme and its effectiveness.  Even if it is a political party programme there is no reason why it should always be manned by Deputies.  Non-political people and public personalities should be asked to make their contribution on matters of public importance, such as bringing jobs to regions, environmental pollution, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the prime objective of our television service is to reflect, as far as is practicably possible, distinctive characteristics of the Irish way of life. The authority has not been successful in doing this.  There is still an excessive amount of Anglo-American canned trash designed to cater for the lowest common denominator of public intelligence. I do not find programmes with dubbed laughter amusing any more.  In a very titillating sense some of these programmes are amusing and help to fill in one's leisure hours but certainly the moronic conception of life, humour and contrived domestic situations which one sees on the imported material is terrible.  RTE should make a determined effort to broadcast fewer such programmes.  I understand the present director-general of RTE is aware of public criticism in this regard &mdash;I do not go along with the point of view that engineers know nothing about cultural values&mdash;and intends to <Col N="2480" /> improve the general standard of such programmes in a cultural sense, in its truest form rather than in the form of any intellectual cultural obsession.  Irish heritage and music north and south could be effectively portrayed on RTE and there could be liaison between UTV and RTE in this field.</P>
    <P>It would be improper to allow this debate to pass without paying a tribute to the staff of Telefís Éireann and the newspaper correspondents who have brought us news coverage about the tragic affairs in Northern Ireland during the past 12 months.  The staff of RTE have played a major part in putting before the people in the south the events which have occurred during the past 12 months in the North of Ireland. Men such as Liam Hourigan, John McAleese, Paddy Smith and the camera crews have been working in Belfast under extreme difficulties and have been very often in danger.  They have succeeded in providing an effective service.  The thanks we must give them and the newspaper reporters covering the Northern situation should be recorded.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the ministerial directive.  I wish to separate the work done by the staff in Belfast from that done in relation to some programmes in Dublin.  I have already expressed my concern and worry about certain aspects of the directive.  I am not sure there was much point in doing it the way the Minister did and certainly if I was in the Minister's position, it would not have been the way I would have gone about it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see any glorification or glamorisation on any national communications media.  Those responsible for news and feature programmes on RTE must ensure that the advocacy of violence does not become the norm of coverage.  Likewise, I do not want to see privileged positions given&mdash; I shall define what I mean by &ldquo;privileged positions&rdquo; later on&mdash;either in news slots or in interviews to members of illegal organisations.  Where people advocate violence on television RTE should ensure that there is somebody present on the same programme to give a counter-balancing point of view. For this reason I am concerned about exclusive interviews of members of <Col N="2481" /> illegal organisations or, indeed, with politicians who might advocate violence because the advocacy of violence can very easily become the norm.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months we have become attuned to the various manifestations of violence.  We accept that a soldier is shot, a housewife is shot, a child is shot, an RUC man is shot, a worker on his way to work is shot, a factory plant is blown up, a pub is blown up or a welfare office is blown up.  The public are becoming blasé about violence in the same way as the Americans, who, after seeing the horror films about Vietnam for the past three years, regard it now as so much general boredom.  There is a major responsibility on the staff of RTE to ensure that the public will not be infected by any casual approach to violence.</P>
    <P>During the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>On the 28th September, 1971, members of an illegal organisation were interviewed on a television programme &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; in a way which I and the Government considered to be prejudicial to the public interest.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to advise the House in what way and in what manner he and the Government considered the particular method of interviewing on &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, which is the one programme which has given rise to the directive, to be prejudicial to the public interest? The reason I put the question to the Minister is that this is the first time any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has used the power.  Therefore, he should define the reasoning behind the Government's decision and should let us have the information that is available to the Government.  In the interests of RTE staff, and in the public interest, and as a right of Opposition Deputies we should be told what transpired between the Minister and the director-general of RTE.  I am not asking for the exact memoranda but the views of the Minister on this matter should be elaborated in the House.  I say that to the Minister in good faith.  It is my opinion that once the RTE authority give an assurance that they will abide by certain views of the Minister, and in this particular <Col N="2482" /> case such assurance was given by the authority, the Minister should then advise the authority that he no longer wishes the directive to apply. We cannot have a national television system operating under a continuing directive, a directive which in this case appears to be going to last for all time. I considered the directive to be vague, extremely generalised and rather sweeping in content.  To my knowledge there has been considerable difficulty in the news section and features programme section of RTE in the interpretation of the directive.  The Minister should clear the air in this regard.</P>
    <P>By and large I do not favour intervention of this kind by the Government but where there is such intervention it should only happen after extensive public discussion of the matters involved.  Whether it was necessary to issue the directive is, in the long-term view, very much open to question. Regardless of whether there is a directive in force, I prefer the system whereby the sense of public responsibility of the journalists themselves is relied on to give a balanced presentation of news.  These are the men on the spot who have to make instant judgments&mdash;judgments that are very often subjective.  I do not think we could ever reach the stage at which the Minister would have his own private censor in Montrose indicating what could be presented and the way in which any programme should be presented.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement to the House.  I wish him well in implementing the measure he has outlined.  I thank him in particular for giving us background information before the introduction of the Estimate.  This was very helpful and I can only express the wish that his colleagues in the Cabinet would follow his example.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is becoming more important each year particularly in so far as the most powerful medium of communication in the country is under the aegis of the Minister's Department.  It is only right that Deputies should devote a large part of their contribution to the affairs of this particular medium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can all concur completely with <Col N="2483" /> Deputy Desmond's desire for a balance in programmes and for objective reporting. However, I must strike an unhappy note and say that Telefís Éireann present some programmes that are neither balanced nor objective.  One such programme is &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;&mdash;a programme that is masqueraded as a programme in Irish but half of which is presented in English and one chairman of which was an unsuccessful politician who has a lot of political bias.  When we get this opportunity of talking on this aspect, we should speak out as strongly about subjects as he seems to speak, subjects about which, in my opinion, he knows very little.</P>

      <P>However, the most obvious example of what I have in mind and which I saw being perpetrated by the &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; programme was an interview with a certain member of an illegal organisation.  This interview was in English but in the Irish news bulletin that went out before the programme, this man gave the interview in Irish.  I am merely wondering why the interview in Irish could not have been used on the &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; programme. I am suspicious about the motives of &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;.  I do not think they have the Irish language or the interests of the Irish language at heart. They are much more concerned with propounding the views of a few off-beat radicals who are responsible for the design, production and presentation of the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond was rightly concerned that there were more and more people tuning in to BBC and ITV.  The only reason they are doing this is because they are getting better value, better programmes, from these two channels.  Otherwise they would not be turning over to them.  I cannot see how Deputy Desmond on the one hand defends RTE and on the other says that they are losing their viewing public.  The reason why they are losing their viewing public is they <Col N="2485" /> are not putting on programmes of sufficient quality to hold the audience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <P>There is no doubt about it, Deputy Desmond does his utmost to play to the gallery at all times.  He is a hypocrite in his heart. He can never help it.  He would change his hat and change his coat 100 times a day to get on any bandwagon that might get him a headline.  I hate saying that but it is quite true.</P>

      <P>Another worry I have as a public representative, as a person representing people who pay taxes, is the squandermania that seems to be prevalent in RTE.  I counted on one night here, not so very long ago, a very important occasion, 27 people from Telefís Éireann representing &ldquo;Report&rdquo;, &ldquo;Féach&rdquo;, &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, the News Room and various other programmes.  If we are being serious about producing the best possible programmes and getting value for money, surely anybody in his sane senses would not send 27 representatives to report one item here in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>At the same time, we must give credit where credit is due. We must give credit to the people who are doing a good job in Telefís Éireann and I name the Newsroom people who give objective and balanced reporting at all times.  I cannot see why the other current affairs programmes cannot be balanced and <Col N="2486" /> objective.  We, as taxpayers, are entitled to demand that our money is spent on giving the best possible value and I regret to say that we are not getting that value from Telefís Éireann. I think too that the station is Dublin-orientated. I think there are too many Dublin people involved in RTE.</P>

      <P>Even in the audiences on these programmes the vast majority are from Dublin.  I will agree on one thing with Deputy Desmond&mdash;we should have more local stations because there is too much Dublin-orientation creeping into the programmes.</P>
      <P>For some time here I have been advocating that we stop the discrimination against the southern part of the country which cannot receive a second channel.  There are in the region of 500,000 licensed television sets in the country of which nearly half are receiving multi-channel television.  We in the rest of the country are entitled to demand that we should not be discriminated against&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that we should be given the opportunity of changing from Telefís Éireann when they are putting out some of the trash they are putting out and selecting our own programmes.  The Minister must, as a southerner, be in sympathy with our demands.  In fact, I know he is in sympathy with them.  We, as public representatives, should bring all possible pressure on him to ensure that our <Col N="2487" /> request is met.  I do not think it is an unreasonable request.  I do not believe, as some people seem to think, that there will be a dramatic deterioration in our morals, in our culture and cultural appreciation.  I do not see that happening in the rest of the country where they have been receiving BBC and ITV for many years, some of them receiving it long before Telefís Éireann came into existence.  I do not think that argument stands up.  It is of the greatest importance that we should have a competitor in the rest of the country for Telefís Éireann and I think then that Telefís Éireann will not be able to afford the luxury of the few off-beat characters that seem to control the current affairs programmes.</P>
      <P>To digress for a moment.  I was looking for a second or a third channel but in parts of my constituency we have not yet got one channel because the reception is too weak for anybody to receive the television signal in certain areas.  It should be a matter of priority with the Minister to ensure that the whole country starts by receiving at least one channel.  We look forward very soon to having booster stations erected in parts of west Cork to ensure that we do get a proper reception.  However, we may be saving them a certain amount of mental pollution by not having the signal strong enough for them to receive it but they are entitled to decide for themselves whether they want to be polluted or not.</P>
      <P>We should consider seriously the introduction of a second RTE channel. It would have many advantages and it would ensure that we would be able to give a better selection of programmes to gain as much as possible of the viewing audience so that they will not turn over to other channels. This could be especially true of sport. While we do a good job on sport I think that for a country which is so sports-minded we are not really tapping the vast potential that there is for the viewing of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of getting television into the Six Counties. I do not think it is a great problem. For a small expenditure we could <Col N="2488" /> ensure that more people could receive RTE programmes.  This is important in view of the fact that there is tremendous pressure on the BBC from the Tory Government to censor the news coming from the Six Counties, to give a distorted view of the news from that area and to give a purely Unionist viewpoint from that part of our country.  The Minister should not delay in ensuring that as many people as possible in the Six Counties can receive programmes from RTE so that they will get an objective presentation and description of events.</P>
    <P>Having visited the radio and television studios at Leinster House on a number of occasions I agree with Deputy Desmond that something should be done to improve the facilities available here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy sure he does not mean the people taking part in the programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>They might be improved also.  However, this colossal weapon we have at our disposal&mdash;the communications medium of RTE&mdash;is something we should be concerned about and interested in.  Perhaps I am biased, but I am afraid we are gradually drifting into a situation, especially in our current affairs programmes, in which there is a constant imbalance.  Perhaps I am looking at it through different spectacles than those who present the programmes but I am giving my opinion and this view is shared by many people who have discussed this matter with me.  It is important that when we get the opportunity of speaking on this Estimate that we voice our opinions as strongly as possible regarding the manner in which these programmes are conducted. I am disappointed with the approach adopted by RTE.</P>
      <P>I wish that RTE could be operated more economically.  I think there is a certain amount of squandering of money in RTE and to illustrate this I should like to quote from a debate in the Seanad on 24th February, 1971. Senator Quinian mentioned that he had been invited to appear on a programme in commemoration of UN Day.  At column 903, Volume 69, of the Official Report of the Seanad he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2489" /> I raised the objection: &ldquo;I have a very important meeting in Cork the following morning that I must attend.&rdquo;  No trouble at all to send me home by taxi from Dublin.  However, I was not going to allow the taxpayers to pay for that, neither would I let myself in for that for a mere two-minute part in a programme.</P>
    <P>For a two-minute contribution RTE were prepared, I presume, to pay a Member of the Oireachtas his fee and for a taxi home from Dublin to Cork. If that is not an example of the type of spendthrift policy adopted by RTE I do not know what it is.  I hope a much tighter rein will be held on the purse strings to ensure that money is well spent.</P>
    <P>A major problem in my constituency is the opposition we encounter from the Department in regard to the provision of telephone kiosks in remote areas.  People living in such areas are entitled to certain concessions and I do not think the only criterion that should be adopted in regard to the provision of telephone kiosks is the number of people who may use the phone. A telephone service is vital; it is essential when people wish to phone for a doctor, a vet, or a priest that they should have access to a telephone.  I would urge the Minister to do all in his power to ensure that telephone kiosks are erected in remote areas and I would ask him to make a statement on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the installation of telephones and the backlog that exists and I should like to associate myself with his remarks on this point.  All avenues should be explored to ensure that as many people as possible who apply for phones receive them.  The post office are losing revenue each week by delaying the installation of phones.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his statement which gave us the full facts and figures regarding the operations of his Department.  It is important that we have available to us all the statistics and data relating to any Department which is being discussed because only then can we have a constructive debate on the various <Col N="2490" /> subjects we wish to raise.  I know that the Minister has listened with attention to the request I made regarding multi-channel television services.  I realise that he is interested in having these services available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate those responsible for the anti-smoking advertisements that have been displayed on television.  They are well presented and are having an influence on young people and are ensuring that at least they are old enough to decide for themselves before they start smoking.</P>
    <P>We could very well start an anti-drinking campaign as well.  As we all know, drinking is glamorised to make it appear to be the most natural and normal thing to do and to make it appear that a person is neither &ldquo;with it&rdquo; nor normal if he does not have his glass of whatever branded product is being advertised.  We could very gainfully start an anti-drinking advertising campaign.</P>
    <P>This is a very important Estimate and every Deputy shall have the opportunity of contributing to it.  It affects us all.  I hope that what I have said will have the effect of producing a better and more balanced television service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Crowley said, this is a most important Estimate involving £36 million for a Department which is, I believe, the second largest employer in the State.  It demands a very close scrutiny by all Deputies. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs invades the life of all of us through letters, telephones, saving stamps, television and radio.  We are all conscious of the Department every day of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that it is the second largest employer in the State places a tremendous responsibility on the Minister for the people who are employed by the Department.  The wages there must be at least as high as those paid in comparable industries outside the Civil Service.  Introducing the Estimate last year the Minister said that his Department were not leaders in wage claims. This is possibly true.  Labour relations in the Department, so far as I can judge as an outsider and without <Col N="2491" /> having available to me the details that are available to the Minister, are extremely good.  The postmen employed by the Department&mdash;and there are more of them this year&mdash;have a most difficult job.  They have to work under most difficult circumstances and in clothing which is pre-first World War.  The heavy beige uniform they wear is out-of-date and out of fashion.  Something lighter and more attractive made with modern materials should be provided for them. We are inclined to get caught up in the details of presenting images.  I suppose what I have just said could be interpreted that way, but there is also the point of view that, if the postmen were more comfortable and better dressed, the style of uniform would not matter too much from their point of view.</P>
    <P>For the past 12 months there has been a new symbol on the post office vans.  A new colour scheme has been designed and the &ldquo;P &amp; T&rdquo; are in the very &ldquo;with it&rdquo; lower case lettering rather than the Gaelic capitals to which we are accustomed.  This will not improve the efficiency of the post office one iota.  To use another bit of current jargon, it will not improve the &ldquo;job satisfaction&rdquo; of the postmen.  It is important that post office vans should be kept clean but the contentment of post office staff in the work they are doing is much more important.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn that the telephone service made a profit of £892,000.  This is the only paying part of the Department, so far as I can see.  A capital investment of £9¼ million is needed this year for telephones, and again next year, and the year after.  The Minister said that because of the lack of trained personnel and the lack of capital resources, he cannot go ahead and install new phones.  It might be possible to raise capital outside the Estimate for the Department for the installation of extra telephones and to go to the public for a loan as the ESB do.  They are profit making and the interest rate involved could be paid.  This would increase the revenue of the Department and the profitability of the telephone service and it should contribute generally to the more efficient <Col N="2492" /> working of the Department.  I am not sure if this is possible having regard to the present composition of the Department. Probably special legislation would be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is suggested every year that the telephone and telegraph services should be taken from the Department and that they should be an independent body.  If the capital could be raised outside the Department and if they were successful in providing much needed capital for the installation of telephones, this should be tried, or the possibility explored.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy will be familiar with the problem of damage to telephone kiosks in his constituency.  The Department repair them as quickly as possible but there is usually a delay of three to four weeks.  Telephone kiosks are very important in rural areas.  If the telephone is out of order people feel cut off from doctors, dentists, the ambulance and other emergency services.  I should like the Minister to consider where these telephones are sited.  Perhaps they could be put somewhere else, even into private houses, or some place like the old sub-post offices.  An arrangement might be made with private householders that their telephones would be available, and known to be available, rather than having the telephone out in the street. One telephone kiosk in Cork was damaged and it was a few weeks before it was repaired.  Within 24 hours it was completely wrecked.  All the glass in it was broken.  The fitting was torn from the wall and the telephone directory was set on fire by savages or vandals.  I do not know what satisfaction they get from doing this.  It was repaired and, within 24 hours, exactly the same thing happened again.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is a public service.  The people who use these kiosks have not got the convenience of having their own telephone and therefore the public kiosks are for their use, particularly in an emergency.  It is not good enough to have them out of commission because some crowd of brats have nothing better to do at night than break them up.  The Minister should try to find some way in which they could be protected.  Perhaps they <Col N="2493" /> could be put some place where they could be more easily watched and would not be so readily available to the vandals.</P>
    <P>When he was speaking last year the Minister referred to a committee and he referred to it again this year.  One of the depressing things I find in the Minister's speech is how almost exactly similar it is to the speech he made last year.  The figures are changed but the order in which he refers to different points and the words he uses are the same.  I will give another example of that later on.  He referred to the committee which was set up to consider the structure, operation and finances of the postal services.  I am disappointed the report is not available but I suppose, since it is such a complex problem, it is better that these people should take their time and come up with the correct answers for rationalising the service as against rushing it and giving us a half-baked solution.  I am convinced the Department could be run at a profit and I believe it should be contributing to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a 6 per cent drop in telegrams and he blamed the postal strike in Britain for the drop. The extraordinary thing is there was a drop the year before also.  Telegrams nowadays are sent mainly in the case of weddings, bereavements and births. A telegram sent on Saturday morning is not delivered until Monday and, if Monday happens to be a bank holiday, it is not delivered until Tuesday.  If there is a bereavement in a family and a telegram is sent to a relative in Dublin on Friday night, and Monday is a bank holiday, the dead relative will be buried before the telegram is delivered on Tuesday morning.  Even at some extra cost some effort should be made to deliver telegrams more punctually than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister listed commemorative stamps, but there was no reference to a Griffith/Collins commemorative stamp.  Last year the 250th anniversary of the Royal Yacht Club in Cork was commemorated.  Far be it from me to say anything about this club, but Tomás MacCurtain and Kevin Barry never saw the inside of it, and never would, because the outlook of those <Col N="2494" /> running the club at that particular point of time was not sympathetic to the cause for which they died.  There was a commemorative stamp for Synge and Yeats.  The Minister told us this morning that six additional stamps are planned for 1972&mdash;a Christmas stamp, a stamp to mark World Health Day and the 50th anniversary of the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The 50th anniversary of the deaths of Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith will have no commemorative stamp. Events and people can be commemorated but not the founder of Sinn Féin and not Michael Collins.  I was not born at the time of the civil war and I do not think it has any place in politics in 1971, but these were men who were recognised as cornerstones of this State and the pettiness of the Government in refusing to commemorate them is incredible.  Apparently the civil war on the Government side of the House is not dead.  This is regrettable.  The Government's action is at once petty and stupid.  There should be no necessity for us to have to talk like this in our national Parliament. These men should be commemorated. More will be heard about this until something is done.</P>
    <P>To come to a purely local matter, the stamp vending machines outside the GPO in Cork have not been altered and one cannot buy a 4d stamp at these machines.  If the post office is shut one has to insert 5p and postage is costing 25 per cent more if one has to post a letter after the post office has closed.  This naturally annoys people.</P>
    <P>As far as television is concerned, there are 144 different opinions in this House as to how the service should be run and there are probably close on 3,000,000 opinions outside the House as to how it should be run.  We all put emphasis on different things.  We all have our favourite programmes.  It is the head of the authority who has the final word and, until the Minister or the authority are dissatisfied with what is being done, we will have to accept what Tom Hardiman gives us.  We may, of course, criticise the offering.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond is quite satisfied with the &ldquo;current affairs&rdquo; programme. Deputy Crowley is quite satisfied with <Col N="2495" /> the news.  The &ldquo;current affairs&rdquo; programme has a slight bias towards the Labour Party and the news has a slight bias towards the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not know where Fine Gael comes in.</P>

      <P>I suppose we come in under advertising for cornflakes or something of that kind.  I really do not know where we come in.  Every Sunday, without fail, we are treated to some Government Minister laying a wreath or attending an anniversary Mass or performing some other patriotic duty.  As I said, Deputy Desmond likes &ldquo;current affairs&rdquo;, Deputy Crowley likes the news; it is proFianna Fáil and Deputy Crowley thinks it is very fair.  I suppose our day will come.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Crowley about multi-channel television.  This is a sore point.  It is ridiculous that people in one part of the country, paying exactly the same licence fee as others, should be deprived of this.  In his speech last year and again this year the Minister used almost exactly the same words when talking about the restrictions on multi-channel television.  At column 2135 of Volume 251 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The use of special technical means, such as microwave links, to extend the range of external programmes cannot however be authorised.</P>
      <P>This morning the Minister said:</P>
      <P>There is no change in the position that authority cannot be given for the use of special technical means, such as microwave links, to extend the range of external programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That refers to multi-channel viewing for those outside the east coast and apparently they are not going to get it. As far as I understand, RTE picks up cross-Channel television stations and pipes them into Ballymun.  This means that the people in that area have a choice, through RTE, of several channels.  I cannot understand why RTE cannot pipe cross-Channel <Col N="2496" /> stations to other parts of the country. It seems to me to be a simple technical matter.  I should like the Minister when he is replying, to explain why it cannot be done and what the cost would be.</P>
    <P>Multi-channel TV has been causing some concern in Cork and so has the question of damage to telephone kiosks.  One will see a headline in the evening paper which states: &ldquo;Minister promises to look into damage to Telephone Kiosks.&rdquo;  The paper then reads: &ldquo;At a Fianna Fáil meeting last night Deputy French read a letter from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs saying he was not going to have any more telephone kiosks damaged.&rdquo;  When the Minister had to turn down the provision of multi-channel TV the paper states: &ldquo;We have received a letter from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs saying that they cannot provide multi-channel TV.&rdquo;  When the news is good it comes through Fianna Fáil and when the news is bad it comes from the Department.  I am sure the Department are able to look after themselves.  They will not have to stand for election in Cork and Deputy French needs all the votes he can get.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the concern felt by some people that advertisers could dictate the contents of a programme. The ideal situation would be to have enough money to be able to run a television station without having to rely on advertising but we should set standards.  The quality of most advertisements is high.  However, one frequently sees what are obviously English-made advertisements advertising products on sale here.  There was recently an advertisement on RTE for English biscuits, which was English made.  The manufacturer of Irish biscuits had to pay not only to have the film shown but to have a film made as well.  This meant the advertisement was much dearer for the Irish manufacturer and put him at a disadvantage. I feel that either manufacturers who have their advertising material made here should get some financial consideration from the authority or manufacturers using English-made advertisements should be fined for using them.  It is wrong that some manufacturers should have the advantage <Col N="2497" /> of getting what are virtually secondhand films.  It is a form of unfair competition for Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The only television programme I get to see is &ldquo;Tarzan&rdquo; on a Sunday evening but from what programmes I saw during the summer I must say the quality of the home produced programmes is as high as it ever was although there seemed to be far fewer of them.  There are more canned programmes than there used to be.  Probably the cost of producing a programme at home is very much higher than buying an American film, but if the television service is going to be of real benefit to the people we shall have to have many more home produced programmes.  I am always struck by the amount of social consciousness displayed in &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;.  It gives city people an appreciation of what rural life is like.  Irish music programmes have improved a great deal during the past few years.</P>
    <P>When the Cork Opera House was built seven or eight years ago it was equipped for use as a television studio. As far as I know, it has been used only twice, once for the opening night and on a second occasion for a series of Seán Dunphy shows last summer although I understand it is to be used next April for the National Song Contest. Much more use should be made of the Opera House and though I do not want to sound parochial, there are a number of gifted amateur dramatic groups in Cork.  There is the Cork Ballet Company which last week came to Dublin without a subsidy from the Abbey Theatre and performed here on Sunday night.  It is the only ballet company in the country.  If they were filmed in the Opera House in Cork, I am positive there would be an audience for them and this could be done very cheaply.  I should like to see the authority produce more programmes in the Cork Opera House and, indeed, in any other available centres outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that radio listening is coming into its own again although I am afraid it is a reflection on present-day living conditions that a programme such as &ldquo;Music on the Move&rdquo; has to be broadcast every <Col N="2498" /> evening in order to stop us getting frustrated when stuck in traffic jams on the way home.  The voices of Gay Byrne, Valerie McGovern and Joe Linnane keep us semi-sane as we drive home.</P>
    <P>This Estimate involves £36 million for the second most important employer in the country.  Last night Deputy Kenny said that to present Deputies with a copy of the Minister's speech as he is reading does not give Deputies sufficient time to prepare a speech.  I would repeat Deputy Kenny's plea that if we had a copy of the Minister's speech even 24 hours beforehand we might do a better job than I feel I have done today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate has been fairly fully debated by those who have already spoken and I shall, therefore, be touching on matters in which I have a particular interest.  For that reason I may not spend as much time on this Estimate as I spent on last year's Estimate. I have commented before on the fact that the Minister has succeeded in getting many things done and succeeded also in getting much co-operation both in the House and outside it.  This is because, unlike many of his colleagues in the Cabinet, he is able to smile and adopt a pleasant manner.  One can accept a &ldquo;no&rdquo; much more readily when it is given with a smile rather than when it is given with a growl, as is the case with some of the Minister's colleagues.  Therefore, I commend the Minister on his general attitude.  I would not say that he is not unflappable but he is the sort of person who is able to give and take and whose officials are in the same mould.  The result of all this is that dealing with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has become for most of us a much more pleasant exercise than dealing with some of the other Departments and, indeed, much more pleasant than what it was to deal with that same Department some years ago. Having said that, I have some criticisms to make but because of the detailed manner in which Deputy Desmond has dealt with the various matters, it will not be necessary for me to go into detail to the extent that I normally would.</P>

      <P>The only way to get the Department to continue to live up to their high standards is by pointing out where they are slipping because if the standard drops the Department would find themselves, like the Fianna Fáil Party, in serious difficulties.  On previous occasions, and as recently as last night, I had some harsh words to say about the people who planned, designed and built the sorting office at Sheriff Street.  Again, I take this opportunity of pointing out that this sorting office which was supposed to be one of the most modern in Europe has a serious defect in that after the building had been started the experts who did not have to work there decided it was necessary to make economies and found that the only economy that could be made was to omit the dust extracting equipment.  The back of the building and the roof consist almost completely of glass with the result that the heat in the building is almost unbearable but the windows cannot be opened because of the dust that blows in from the back. A few minor efforts were made to remedy this defect but nothing concrete has been done.  I can only hope that somebody will deal with the matter before the workers in Sherriff Street decide they have had enough and do what is usually done by workers to employers who do not cooperate&mdash;go outside on the street and walk up and down until their complaints are heeded.  If they were to do that, we would have many complaints from people who would tell us they could not do without the postal service.  When I look at allocations being made in this Estimate and at the allocations mentioned in the Estimate that was before the House last night, where not only thousands of pounds but in two cases mentioned, millions of pounds are being spent.  I wonder why the relatively small sum required to instal a dust extractor in Sheriff Street is not provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the sorting office was being built the Post Office Workers Union, who represented most of the <Col N="2500" /> staff employed there, requested that a parking site for motor cars, motor bikes and bicycles be provided but in their wisdom, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs decided not to provide such facility.  There have been many complaints about this.  Only today I received a letter concerning a man who is employed in that sorting office and because there are no car parking facilities available he must park his car some distance from the building. His car has been damaged on four occasions within two weeks.  Last Thursday it was stolen and when recovered, it was found to be practically wrecked.  This is not an isolated incident.  One man complained to me that he was unfortunate enough to have to use a car to get to his work and the vehicle he was using was what could be described as an &ldquo;old banger&rdquo;.  The doors of the car did not lock but bad as it was, it was stolen eventually with the result that this man had to lose some days work.</P>
    <P>I understand that at the rear of the CIE station at Amiens Street there is a space that could be rented and used for parking facilities.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good office to ensure that this space will be rented.  Almost everybody who has had to park a car in Sheriff Street has complained that the vehicle has been either damaged or stolen.  Some people seem to take a delight in defacing cars.</P>
    <P>Last night I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance about the position in relation to the post office at Ballsbridge.  Has the situation suddenly remedied itself and are there now adequate facilities there for both the staff and public or is it the position that the population has declined to such an extent that a new post office is no longer required?  There is a reference to it here.  I was interested to note that there is proposed a new post office for Donegal town and also one in Mullinagar.  The allocation in each case is £1,000 whereas the cost, respectively, is £44,000 and £50,000. Is it to take 44 and 50 years respectively to build each post office?  What is the significance of allocating £1,000 <Col N="2501" /> towards the cost in any one year?  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the matter when he is replying because the people who have to work in the existing premises are interested in this information.</P>
    <P>I was interested in some of the comments that were made concerning telephone kiosks.  It is my opinion that some of the large amounts of money being allocated by the Government towards matters that are not very important, should be allocated to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to enable that Department to deal with important matters such as the provision of telephone kiosks.  For instance, money that has been provided for sites in Castlebar for the Department of Lands and in Athlone for the Department of Education is waste because these moves will never take place.  Perhaps the Minister would use his influence in the Cabinet to have some of this money directed towards his Department.  In country districts where people may live in groups but where they may be some distance from a priest or a doctor, a public telephone is almost essential. I am aware that telephone kiosks have been damaged in the cities and towns and in the villages, too. There is a telephone kiosk near to where I live and I am appalled that a small number of vandals have been damaging it consistently each week.  I cannot understand how those kiosks can be damaged not only at night but in broad daylight without anybody seeming to see the vandals at work. Could it be that these vandals have the invisible man formula?  Somebody must see them.  Public spirited people should insist that those responsible for damage of this kind are brought to justice.  If it is done once or twice the parents&mdash;because in most cases they are youngsters who should be controlled by their parents&mdash;should be compelled to pay for the damage done to the kiosk. We might then have fewer kiosks damaged.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister last year &mdash;the suggestion was not taken up&mdash; that the type of telephone kiosk which is put up seems to be an invitation to people to see how much damage they can do to it.  Is it not possible to put up a simple kiosk with concrete <Col N="2502" /> blocks, plastered on the outside and looking fairly respectable but substantial enough not to be knocked down unless somebody takes an axe to it? Can this not be done?  The cost would be very much less than the cost of the present ones.  I do not see any other answer if the public will not face up to their responsibilities and report to the authorities the people they see damaging kiosks.  On more than one occasion I have stopped at kiosks and chased away people who were damaging them.  They usually take on an air of injured innocence and say they are making a telephone call but it is easy to distinguish between the vandal and the user.</P>
    <P>In country districts or in villages the kiosk should be placed, if possible, in such a position that somebody can see what is happening and may be inclined to stop people damaging it. One of the weaknesses is that kiosks are put in places where it is easy to do damage without being seen. I have suggested over the last two years that kiosks should be placed outside post offices.  I can see no good reason why a telephone which is inside a post office and not being used from closing time until opening time and not being used at all at weekends could not be put outside.  It would be a great addition to any district.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter.</P>
    <P>I raised quite a substantial number of items last year and to give credit where it is due most of them have at least been looked at and quite a number of them have been rectified.  I thank the Minister because it does appear that he and his officials have done their homework.  Even if many of them are still hanging fire it appears that something is being done about most of them.</P>
    <P>There is something which is not the Minister's responsibility though his action can have a bearing on it.  It is the question of having housing estates, one after the other, getting the same name.  It is absolutely senseless to call one estate Vale Park, the one beside it Vale Road and the one beside that Vale Glen.  It is bad enough for those of us who must go once in a <Col N="2503" /> lifetime to select one &ldquo;Vale&rdquo; from the other but the unfortunate postman must go there every day.  If he is new to the district it is too bad.  Quite a number of these estates have recently been adopting separate names.  The Department of Local Government might be encouraged to facilitate people when there is a request for a name change and not, as I understand is being done, put it on the long finger and ask for impossible conditions.  If people want to name their houses that can be recognised but if they do not there should be no objection to putting a number on them.  The postman should be in a position to know whether he is giving a letter to John Jones in No. 25 or John Jones in No. 45.  This is a great difficulty.  I mentioned letter boxes last year and I understand some little progress has been made.  It is wrong that the manufacturers of letter boxes should make them in such a way that the postman who puts in his fingers with the letters may leave his fingertips inside.  This is stupid.  People who are doing a job should get as much co-operation as possible.</P>
    <P>The uniform has been referred to. Improvements have been made but we are still a long way from the ideal and we should still aim at the ideal.  It is no use to do as they did in the Army. They said that they had so much of the old cloth left that they had to use it up.  Then they got the bright idea of destroying old material and dumped quite a lot of new material in with it. I would not suggest that the Minister should do that sort of thing but it is possibly one solution.  We get a reasonably good summer and I think that some lighter material should be made available.  The postman is the public face of the Department.  He should be trim and neat and look comfortable. He should not be issued with a uniform which was made for somebody who was not too well made himself. The uniform does not fit anybody well and postmen look badly in it.</P>
    <P>I am glad an investigation is being carried out into Christmas overtime. I spoke again and again on this Estimate about postmen being badly treated over the amount of overtime <Col N="2504" /> they do at Christmas.  The Minister might now appeal to people to send Christmas cards early.  The number of Christmas cards dropped last year due to the high cost of cards and postage. A Christmas card received a week before Christmas is appreciated much more than one received two days after Christmas.  People send cards at the last minute and do not seem to understand that others must sort them, frank them and deliver them.  If we could have the big rush a week before Christmas it could be spread over a few days instead of expecting all cards to be delivered on Christmas Eve.  That is just not possible.  I notice that additional staff have been taken on.  I hope it is not proposed to adopt the system they are at present adopting in England &mdash;this work is not done by a Government Department there any longer&mdash; of reducing the number of deliveries rather than increasing them.</P>
    <P>Telephone staffs are doing a fantastic job.  People who have not had experience of working a telephone switch do not understand what the staff have to put up with.  I operated a telephone switch for a period during my Army service and I have the greatest sympathy with those who are now operating them.  It may be bad enough to be delayed getting a number but if you get plugged in to somebody else's conversation it is a different thing. When the automatic exchanges were introduced the Department made a mistake in attempting to reduce the number of manual operators in the areas that are being serviced by the new system.  The result is that while it might be relatively easy in some towns to dial the exchange and get a local number, if anything goes wrong it is not so easy to get the operator now and if you are in a non-dial area there can be a considerable delay. Usually the operator is blamed but it is the Department who should be blamed.  They should ensure there is sufficient personnel retained to deal with calls coming through the manual exchanges.</P>
    <P>Some years ago areas like Navan were put on the automatic exchange. When the exchange at Navan was erected it was supposed to be large enough to cover the area and also to <Col N="2505" /> cater for any expansion.  For some reason all the outlying areas have been hooked on to this exchange, starting at Nobber, Athboy and Trim.  The situation now is that it is impossible to get an extra line in Navan because that exchange is overloaded.  I do not blame the Minister but it was a very shortsighted policy to build an exchange five or six years ago which is now overloaded.  Perhaps it was intended then to deal only with Navan or maybe someone decided that it was all right to add in the outside areas but, no matter what the reason, at the moment Navan exchange is unable to cope with all the demands made on it. I would ask the Minister to ensure that when the new exchanges are built provision will be made to allow for expansion.</P>
    <P>We see the same thing happening in the national schools.  Practically everything that is built is found in a few years time to be too small and inadequate.  Perhaps the fault is that we think too small.  I realise costs have something to do with it but it would have been cheaper to have built the Navan exchange twice as large than to carry out a small extension now.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the Aran Islands have an excellent telephone service to the mainland.  I am sure the small population there appreciates that fact but it is a pity that the highly populated areas do not have a similar service.  I am not taking from the necessity to give the Aran islanders a service but we should have some kind of priority whereby those who are using the service extensively should have an adequate service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the subscriber trunk dialling to Belfast and London&mdash;although it shows things up in a peculiar light when we realise that the service to London was available one month before the Belfast service.  It is easy now to get a number and it saves much trouble.  I am sure the telephone operators sang a <i>Te Deum</i> when this service was provided.  When people could not get a cross-channel number quickly, frequently they thought something was wrong and for that reason it was a good idea to have subscriber trunk dialling in operation.</P>
    <P>I notice the arrangements the Minister <Col N="2506" /> referred to last year for more co-operation between the staff and the post office have been going on and I welcome this.  It is an excellent idea and the Minister is correct when he says that at the moment there are better staff relations than existed for some time.  There are one or two other reasons for that but if people get an opportunity of discussing their problems with their immediate superiors when those problems arise it is much better than waiting until they are aggravated and people who are not connected with the problems become involved. I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted the idea that we should be represented on international bodies.  I shall not go into detail about it; I did last year and I would ask the Minister to give the matter further consideration.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bring to fruition as soon as possible the matter of political rights for post office employees. It is ironic that a teacher who can shape the lives of the children he or she teaches can take an active part in politics but a postman cannot do so. This does not make sense.  I do not know how high up the grade the Minister is prepared to go.  I understand he is thinking of granting limited political rights to post office employees and I would ask him to go as far as he can in this matter.</P>
    <P>An instance was pointed out to me of one ESB linesman who has full political rights but another linesman has not got any such rights.  Perhaps if the Minister gave the good example other Departments who are similarly restricting their employees might make up their minds and give their employees the right to be members of a political party.  The suggestion that people are non-political because they are not allowed to be members of a political party is nonsense and the Minister knows this.  It would be a pity if we erected a barrier so that certain people were not entitled to join a political party.  I believe every person is a politician and it would be a pity if that were changed.  I ask the Minister to ensure that employees of his Department are given political freedom.  Discussions on this matter have been going on for some time and it is time they concluded. <Col N="2507" /> If we are going to have a general election fairly soon, there are a number of them I should like to see on my side and I am sure the Minister is in the same position.</P>
    <P>It is annoying that the Minister has fallen into the old trap of trying to co-relate the cost of his Department with the wages and salaries paid to employees.  No more than any other Department, why should the Department for Posts and Telegraphs be asked to take responsibility for increased costs in that Department?  If the Department of Finance, of Agriculture and Fisheries, or of Lands, do not incur odium when costs increase, why should the Department of Posts and Telegraphs be singled out?  Why should the Minister say that increased costs are mainly due to increases in the costs of wages and salaries?

Dr. McQuaid, who has made it clear in a recent statement (details supplied) that he will not permit these hospitals to take part in an agreed system based on professional merit alone for appointments in the consultative grade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report of the statement referred to by the Deputies, which was a report in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 12th November, 1971, but I could not agree that it is clear from it that it is the system of appointment for consultants which was in question.  However, on that question, I have already made clear the steps which must precede the introduction of a common selection procedure for consultants.  First of all, I must await the establishment of Comhairle na n-Ospidéal.  Section 41 (I) (v) of the Health Act, 1970, clearly provides for consultation with the comhairle, and with the bodies engaged in medical education, before any common selection system is settled. In view of this, it is premature to debate the question of introducing a common appointment system for hospital consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to circulate to voluntary <Col N="2512" /> hospitals within the next week my detailed proposals for the establishment of Comhairle na n-Ospidéal and after consideration of any further views they may offer, to bring the relevant draft regulations before the Dáil and Seanad in February next, to become effective on 1st April if they are approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister last July not give an undertaking to the Dáil that Chomhairle na nOspidéal would have the right to establish a recruitment system based on special qualifications and, indeed, with the proviso that, if the particular hospital did not wish to have the particular person, they had the right to reject him on reasonable grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I made it clear during the passage of the Health Bill that Comhairle na nOspidéal when first formed will have only the power of recommending sanction of consultants in voluntary hospitals and health board hospitals, that is to say, consultants paid for directly or indirectly out of public funds.  When Comhairle na nOspidéal have been established, I made it clear that they would examine and have consultation with everybody concerned&mdash;the latter possibility is embodied in the Health Act&mdash;on a selection procedure for the appointment of consultants in voluntary hospitals.  I made it perfectly clear that Comhairle na nOspidéal from the time of their inception, when the Resolution was passed in the Dáil and Seanad, would have power only of sanction or withholding sanction and the selection procedure would come at a later stage.</P>

They are receiving State moneys to meet deficits and there are capitation grants.  I suggested there should be given to them certain rights, but none of this will arise until Comhairle na nOspidéal, some time, not earlier, I should think, than the latter part of 1972 or early 1973, will be given the powers of selection procedures.  Before that I have to consult the voluntary hospitals and the medical teaching bodies.  It will be difficult to have the voluntary hospitals abandon the right to appoint their own consultants and it will take long negotiation.  Because of that none of this is of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to introduce legislation to exempt part-time firemen from income tax, I would find it extremely difficult to resist demands by many other groups who could make a case for similar treatment with effects of a most damaging nature on the structure and yield of the tax.  Accordingly, I cannot see my way to introduce legislation which would grant the exemption sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I might add that it seems to me that what is involved, fundamentally, in this case is the appropriate level of remuneration paid to part-time firemen as they do not appear to consider that the existing level reflects adequately the value and nature of their services.  The Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in regard to the remuneration of part-time firemen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is particularly unfair that firemen who perform such an essential national service on a voluntary basis should be taxed and taxed doubly in the sense that they are taxed on their ordinary earnings and taxed again on the earnings that accrue from fire-fighting? The Minister is aware that the question of increased remuneration is not the issue, since income tax will continue to be deducted, but what is the issue is that income tax should not be deducted from earnings accruing from fire-fighting operations? In the light of that, will the Minister agree to reconsider his decision on this important matter and so avert the possibility of a withdrawal of services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with that.  The real issue appears to be the level of remuneration for the services rendered.  If this were to be accepted, it would benefit some firemen far more than it would benefit others, depending on the level of their remuneration.  It seems to me clearly to be an issue on which any difficulty should be dealt with by way of examination of the level of remuneration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that practically all of those who are employed as part-time firemen are people who have other jobs and who are already assessed for income tax and therefore he can take it that the amount of tax being taken from each of them would be approximately the same?  It would be at the standard rate of 7s in the £.  A man whose retainer amounts to £66 would get less than £40 after income tax had been deducted.  Therefore, if the Minister can do nothing about this on the income tax level would he request his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to increase the rates for firemen? Is the Minister not aware that his predecessor was able to allow exemption from income tax in respect of special artists?  Surely this could be done, too, in the case of firemen.</P>

      <P>I regret that is the only way I can ask the question.  In view of the fact that the cost of printing an extra few hundred copies of the Official Report would be relatively small and would be a major public facility, may I put that to the Minister for his consideration?</P>

      <P>It is important.  Will the Minister take steps to ensure that Dáil Debates are kept in print?  One fully understands that it is difficult at times to anticipate the demand and sometimes the anticipation is inevitably incorrect and they go out of print. Would the Minister agree that it is undesirable that any copy of the debates should be out of print, unavailable, and would he take steps to ensure that where the requirement was underestimated there will then be a fresh printing to ensure that there are enough copies available and that they are on sale at all times?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education why no competition was held for the appointment of the architect for the new College of Art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it was felt that such was not necessary.  The holding of a competition would not be warranted where it was apparent that there was an Irish architect available who possessed to a high degree that knowledge and experience in the fields of architecture and art as would make him eminently suitable to design a new College of Art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as we admire the architect in question, does the Minister hold the view that there is only one architect in this country capable of doing such work and that no competition was warranted?  Is that the gist of the Minister's reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The gist of the Minister's reply is that the person appointed is a top calibre Irish architect and a man who occupied one of the principal administrative posts in the country, namely, Dublin city architect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2539" /> Also, his knowledge of art and art education is well known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that if a person is of such eminence&mdash;I have no reason to dispute it&mdash;in a public competition which would stimulate competition among architects he would have no difficulty in coming out on top in such a competition? In the public interest it was most undesirable that the Minister should unilaterally take it on himself to appoint an architect for the preparation of a major public architectural work when he did not give other architects in the country any opportunity of being considered for that appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept anything the Deputy has said.  In fact, in the case of a college of art in another country of which I am aware, an architect was appointed without competition because he was an eminent man and was known to have knowledge of art in general and art education in particular. These are very important requirements.  I might say that this particular architect took the trouble to get first-hand information of the design of art colleges in other countries and much of what he did was done before he was appointed as architect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was he took the trouble to make himself aware and get first-hand information of college designs in other countries. An architect does not necessarily wait until he has a particular project to design to make himself aware of matters such as this.

    <P>As I have stated before, our financial commitments in relation to education generally are now so high that for the present, at any rate, I could not contemplate adding to them, nor is it <Col N="2541" /> apparent to me that, the establishment of an open university could rank among our immediate priorities in education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will give details of the costings used to arrive at the estimate of £7 million as the cost of implementing the proposals of the Union of Students in Ireland for a comprehensive grant scheme for higher education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure provided by the students as the cost of a comprehensive scheme was calculated on (a) 47.9 per cent of qualified students getting grants, (b) an average grant of £329 per annum, and (c) an average course duration of three years.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the modified means test suggested by the Union of Students the percentage qualifying for grants would greatly exceed 47.9 per cent; the average grant under the student's suggested scheme would be far greater than £329 and the average duration of courses would exceed three years.</P>
      <P>Going on the rates of grant suggested by the Union of Students, £416 plus fees for those residing away from home and £320 plus fees for those residing at home and taking the number that would qualify for grant into account an estimated cost of £7 million per annum would be a conservative one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the question as to how the figure was arrived at.  He has told us how the USI arrived at their figure but that was not my question.  May I ask the Minister to explain what he means by the percentage of 48 per cent being higher if that is being applied?  Surely that percentage would be lower, because if you lower the standard of qualification the proportion taking it up is likely to be lower although, of course, it would be a proportion of a bigger total?  Would the Minister clarify that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If the means test level is raised the level of income is raised and obviously a greater number will avail of the grant, particularly if <Col N="2542" /> it refers not only to universities but to other higher education institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has missed my point&mdash;I am afraid I phrased it badly.  Given that as well as changing the means test and that you are lowering the standard of qualification to two honours to get the grant, would the Minister not agree that the proportion of those entitled under the means test would fall because if you bring it down to two honours there would be a higher proportion of people who are not very much orientated to university than at the four honours level.  Has the Minister taken account of that important factor in his criticisms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible from available statistics to provide figures of student numbers on which the estimates sought could be based. As I indicated in the House recently, I do not propose at present to extend the higher education grants scheme.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister produce an estimate of £7 million on Question No.33 if he cannot produce any estimate on Question No. 37?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question here is not whether he intends to do it but what would be the cost of it.  The Minister was able to give an estimate of the cost of the USI scheme, a figure of £7 million.  Here we have a part of the USI scheme.  How can he give an estimate of the whole and not produce an estimate of the part?  That is a contradication in terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure I gave in relation to the USI scheme is a rough estimate of the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It was much easier to make a rough estimate of total costs than it would be to make an estimate on the basis of the type of question put down by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that he does not know the total number of students attending courses of three or more years duration? Has he not even got that fact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education (a) the number of students holding maximum grants while living at home and the number holding maximum grants living away from home, under the higher education, grant scheme; (b) the total number of students holding such grants under each heading and (c) the average amount of such grants under each heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In the academic year 1970-71 the number of students holding maximum grants under the higher education grants scheme while living at home was 701 and the number holding maximum grants while living away from home was 2,194.  The total number of students holding grants under each heading was 1,001 students living at home and 2,561 students living away from home.  The average amount of grant was £152 for students living at home and £281 for students living away from home.</P>
      <P>In addition to the grants, a direct payment amounting to £46,399 was paid by my Department to the universities so as to hold the fees for grant holders in the academic year 1970-71 at the level which obtained in the year 1969-70.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of students holding higher education grants in (a) each faculty in each university college, by year, (b) in each <Col N="2548" /> of the teacher training colleges, by year, and (c) in each of the other third-level institutions covered by the scheme.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the form of a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will have circulated with the Official Report.  Higher education grants are not tenable in the teacher training colleges.</P>

      <P>The scheme was approved by County Dublin Committee of Agriculture on 6th July, 1970 and my Department was, of course, informed at that stage.</P>
      <P>On 16th September, 1970, the Federation of Rural Workers requested that a number of my Department's farm workers in County Dublin should be allowed to participate.  The scheme commenced on 14th October, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question on 4th November, 1970, the matter of participation was then under consideration.  The committee of agriculture informed my Department on 11th November, 1970, <Col N="2552" /> that the first course had been filled. On 11th December, 1970, I authorised participation in future courses and, as indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question on 28th October, 1971, two employees are attending the second course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On 16th September the Federation of Rural Workers requested the Department to allow a reasonable number of agricultural staff.  There were, however, certain aspects of the scheme which had to be fully considered before a decision to participate could be taken Deputy Tully raised the matter on 4th November, 1970.  My note has not got that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Was any effort made on receipt of the communication from the trade union to find out if there were vacancies then because it appears that it was a month after the start of the course?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the difficulty rather than any innate reluctance on the part of the Department to allow their workers to participate.  The fact of the matter is that they were late when they applied.  I think there were 14 places available and they were all gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked how soon it was after the 16th because it was around that time that the course started.  On 14th November the Minister got a reply saying there were no vacancies. It would appear as if the application was not made until after the course started although they knew before-hand. It should not have happened but we can do nothing about it now.</P>

      <P>I think the idea is <Col N="2554" /> to separate the two, drug abuse generally and dangerous substances used in agriculture, such as pesticides and insecticides.  I do not think they are related subjects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that legislation deals with the use of dangerous substances in industry. Why should agriculture not be included or are agriculturists supposed to be second- or third-class citizens? We have too much of this kind of thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so at all.  Agricultural chemicals are different from industrial chemicals.  Broadly speaking, the kind of chemicals we are talking about in agriculture would be mercury-based seed dressings, organic phosphorous-based insecticides, chemicals like DDT, which affect not only the workers who use them but the quality of the produce.  It is a very specialised field and it differs from the general protection of workers in industrial employment.  I accept Deputy Tully's point completely; we have got to take all the care we can exercise in the use of such very potent and stable organic drugs in agriculture and we must get on with it.  I accept that.</P>

They have, of course, been taken into account in the shaping of agricultural policy generally during the last two years.  However, as the Deputy is aware, the report was prepared at a time when there was no early prospect of this country becoming a member of the EEC and many of the recommendations  <Col N="2555" /> made by the committee have now to be viewed in this different context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will comment on the increase of over 70 per cent in the value of imports of cereal and cereal preparations in the first half of 1971 over the first half of 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Stocks of native grain at the beginning of 1971 were much lower than those at the beginning of 1970.  This was the result of the increased use of native grain in the second half of 1970 and restricted imports in that period arising from the high level of grain prices on the world market.  As a result the quantity of grain imported in the first half of 1971 was greater than the quantity imported in the same period in 1970.  This, in addition to the fact that the average prices per ton of imported barley and milo were £8.50 and £3.50, respectively, higher in 1971 than in 1970, accounts for the substantial rise in the value of imports of barley and milo. I may mention that this is partially offset by a reduction of almost £1.1 million in the value of imports of other items of animal feed.  The net increase in the value of imports of cereals and animal feed combined, for <Col N="2556" /> the period in question, was 30 per cent above the figure for the corresponding period in 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to speculate on that.  The acreage of barley is likely to increase.  That is a personal speculation.

      <P>The increase in the value of the net imports of fruit and vegetables in the latest 12 month period for which figures have been published, 1st September, 1970&mdash;31st August, 1971, as compared with the same period in 1969-70 amounted to £900,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2557" /> The export figure for the 1970-71 period at £6.4 million was up by some £300,000 on 1969-70 while the import figure at £16.3 million showed an increase of £1.2 million on the previous year.</P>
    <P>The relevant statistics refer to a wide range of products and various factors related to supply, demand and price would have contributed to the end result.  For example, an excess of imports over exports to the extent of £1,280,000 arose in 1970-71 from the items, seed potatoes, £280,000, edible nuts, £300,000, oranges, lemons and other citrus fruit, £130,000, hops, £190,000, and canned fruit, £380,000. The reduced exports of seed potatoes were largely attributable to reduced supplies resulting from abnormal weather conditions during the 1970 growing season in County Donegal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the drop in the value of exports of metal ores and concentrates so far in 1971 <Col N="2559" /> has been due to a number of factors, including a fall in world market prices of lead and copper, difficulties in marketing certain copper concentrates, industrial disputes, and an explosion at one mine which halted activities for some time.</P>
      <P>In general, the value of metal scrap fell in 1971 because of a fall in export prices due to substantial surpluses abroad.</P>
      <P>The exports of unwrought and wrought metals fell principally into two groups: (i) iron and steel bars, rods, rounds, angles, shapes and sections and (ii) aluminium bars, rods, angles, <i>et cetera,</i> and wire.</P>
      <P>The fall in the case of the first group was due to reduced exports in the early months of 1971, because of a very high home demand in the latter part of 1970 and a recession in the world market for steel products from March, 1971, onwards.  The main factors responsible in the case of the second group were a drop in demand on the world market, a recession in the building trade in Britain and an industrial dispute.</P>

      <P>While there may be provision for a presiding officer to cast his vote at a polling station within his constituency, even though he may not be on the register of that station, is there any provision whereby a presiding officer who is in a constituency other than his own constituency can vote?  This problem may not exist in country areas but after the last redrawing of boundaries the problem arose in Dublin.  In my constituency I know of two presiding officers who have presided in the same areas for years but due to the redrawing of the boundaries they are not now within their own constituency and therefore cannot cast their votes.  Could the Minister not devise some scheme whereby a presiding officer, even if he is outside his own constituency, can cast his vote?</P>

Even if he is in a constituency in which he is resident, he very often gets his appointment a day or two before the election and he cannot, therefore, make arrangements to cast his vote in a particular booth even if it is in his own constituency.</P>

      <P>I should like to help the Deputy if I could.  I should like to see a swimming pool in Rathmines and also in all other large centres of population.  The programme for the provision of swimming pools in Dublin is very satisfactory.  This programme <Col N="2568" /> was adopted in 1967 when it was proposed to build swimming pools in nine centres.  These were to be at Townsend St., Crumlin, Finglas, Cabra, Coolock, Ballymun, Ballyfermot, Rathmines and in the Rathfarnham-Terenure area. Some of these pools are already in operation.  These are at Townsend Street, Coolock and Crumlin.  A loan of £100,000 for the Ballyfermot pool has been sanctioned.  Tenders are at present under examination by the corporation in respect of the Finglas pool and of the remaining four I want to tell the Deputy that Ballymun is next on the priority list.</P>

This has happened ten times weekly on average.  More recently still telex trouble was experienced between here and Toronto and extreme difficulty was experienced in trying to contact South Africa to which this firm has large exports.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little else to say about the post office end of the Estimate.  As Deputy Power has just illustrated, the shortage of equipment which is the main trouble is chronic. We cannot blame the Minister for this. Apparently it was the practice for a <Col N="2573" /> number of years that if there was a shortage of money in the Government the money which had been given to Posts and Telegraphs was taken back, or they got very little for that year, with the result that the service suffered. Much needed equipment which should have been ordered within the last ten years has not been ordered and we are now getting into a line with other countries looking for equipment which apparently cannot be produced.  Is there any good reason why we should not attempt to manufacture some of this equipment here?  Surely it is absolutely ludicrous that £7 million, £8 million or £9 million worth of equipment per year is required and we must wait in the queue until some other country finds it convenient to release the equipment we need?  We have manufactured more intricate items than those required for the telephone service.  The Minister should stress this to his colleagues in Government. There is a demand for this equipment and there will be a continuing demand. If he wants to know where to site such a factory I will be only too glad to tell him.</P>

      <P>West Limerick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Not West Limerick.  The Minister referred to pensions and retirement gratuities.  We have been talking for years here about auxiliary postmen.  The auxiliary postman was the man who did all the work, got very little pay and when he came to retire went out without a pension or gratuity. Recently a pension and gratuity was introduced in the public service and I understand that the Post Office Workers' Union are negotiating with the Minister's Department for a different type of scheme for the postmen concerned.  One of the difficulties is the number of hours.  When is a man an employee of the post office?  I know people who never worked for anybody except the post office.  Their standard of existence must not have been very high.  How they existed I do not know but they did so and they were indispensable in their areas.  It is not easy to get anybody to take this kind of work in rural areas now.  If a man who has been doing this type of job gets a <Col N="2574" /> better one, which is not very hard, it is common to find the unfortunate postmistress looking for somebody, even a woman or a schoolboy to carry out the work.  The Department should make some arrangement whereby there would be more encouragement to keep these people employed.  There is a kind of vacuum between those who will be pensionable in future and those who are about to retire within the next year or so.  The Minister should make a special effort to give something decent to those.  He does mention retirement gratuities for part-time staff and that there has been a substantial improvement in this.  It would need to be a very substantial improvement.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty for some of these people is the question of stamping an insurance card.  Sometimes when the cost of the insurance card is taken out of the temporary, part-time postman's wages, particularly if he is a student, or a woman who has been doing it for a short period, a person who will never be able to benefit from it, it makes the wages look terribly small.  I do not know whether there is any way of dealing with this but the Minister might have a look at it.  I had a case about 12 months ago of somebody who was employed by CIE and they were stamping his card.  The post office insisted also that he should stamp a card for them when he was doing a part-time job for them and it took a lot of untangling to get it straightened out and to get a refund.  After it had caused expense to everybody it was eventually straightened out.  There should be a more reasonable approach to the matter.  I hope it will be possible to make the life of the rural postman more comfortable in the matter of wages, retirement pension and gratuity and also the matter of uniforms.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that with the national wage agreement coming into operation on 1st January this would mean an increase of £2.4 million.  He also stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the 4 per cent which will come into effect on 1st January, 1973, will cost a further £1.3 million, and as Deputies are aware the national agreement provides for a further increase <Col N="2575" /> on that date should the cost of living rise in 1972 more than 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have to spell that out because for each 1 per cent increase there is a 15p increase.  If the Government are allowed to remain in power for 1972 I am afraid the increase will be much more than £1.3 million.</P>
    <P>Again, I suggest, as I have done previously, that saving certificates, and particularly the post office savings bank, could be improved if there was a reasonable rate of interest paid.  The Minister must accept that the rate is not attractive.  I see no reason why the post office must keep the rate down. People are not encouraged to invest their savings in the post office when they can get higher rates of interest elsewhere.  I realise there is no element of risk involved, but it is not right that people who have small sums to invest should get a lower rate of interest than those who invest large sums and can shop around for more attractive rates. The Minister has gone into detail on the various saving schemes and I do not propose to continue on this point or to try to improve on what he has said.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have a view on broadcasting which is different from that of many people.  I think it is a good idea to dispense with the additional licence that was charged.  The actual cost of providing it was greater than the amount of money collected.  People who have a car radio and who were paying television or radio licences in addition felt aggrieved that they had to pay this extra licence and the fact is that many people did not bother to pay if they could get away with it.  The number of people who do not pay their television or radio licence fees appals me.  Quite frequently people brag that they have never had a television licence.  They are not the poor people and usually could afford to pay for these licences.</P>
    <P>The matter of television has been discussed by previous speakers.  It can be approached in many different ways; it depends on where one comes from, and the stratum of society to which one belongs.  Having looked at some of the programmes, particularly political <Col N="2576" /> programmes, on RTE, I sympathise with those people who can get only one channel.  I live in an area in which four channels are available and if we wish we can have a fifth or sixth channel. Nevertheless, it is amazing that notwithstanding this selection, my family spend a considerable time viewing RTE.  This is an answer to those who say the standard set by RTE is not high enough.  I think Telefís Éireann do excellent work in many fields.  They fall down occasionally, but so do the other statations.  When viewing some of the material on television one is tempted to ask what is the purpose of screening these programmes. I suppose there are people who would take an interest in practically anything; there must be a market for this material because otherwise it would not be shown.</P>
    <P>With regard to the standards set by RTE, I consider we are entitled to criticise here if we think this is necessary but, at the same time, there is no point in engaging people to run the service if we do not allow them to get on with their jobs.  Everyone thinks he is an expert and this is a trap we all fall into.  We think we could do the job better but I wonder if this is so.</P>
    <P>Whether an effort has been made to muzzle RTE, or whether they should be muzzled, is a question I should not like to answer.  From time to time I have seen people on Telefís Éireann and on other stations and I wonder what was the purpose of allowing them on. Those who presented the programmes were entitled to put them on and we must not forget this point.  The same thing applies to the matter of news. What I consider news might not be what the Minister considers to be news.  I may be riled if I see what I consider to be a slanted picture on UTV or BBC, but I am the last person to consider I am entitled to criticise how they put across the news. Similarly, it has been suggested that RTE are slanting the news.  My answer is that these things should not happen because if they did not happen they could not be filmed.  However, if they are filmed the public are entitled to see them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2577" /> I do not see much television, but I try to see the late news on more than one station and the similarity between the pictures shown is remarkable. Occasionally when some news item is flashed on&mdash;perhaps of an event in Derry or Belfast&mdash;whoever is manipulating the camera does not switch it quickly enough and when the BBC announcer is heard it rather spoils things.  However, I suppose the television authorities must cut their cloth according to their measure and people who are running the television services must take what they can pay for.</P>
    <P>There are excellent programmes on the radio.  Anyone who drives a lot and who has a car radio tends to be selective about the programmes they listen to.  It was mentioned today that an increasing number of people were listening to the radio and I can understand this.  Although the visual quality of pictures on television is improving, the quality and variety of programmes that can be picked up on RTE radio and some of the BBC stations are amazing.  We can go further afield particularly at night if we want to.</P>
    <P>One of the things which keep people from turning on Radio Éireann in the afternoon and night more often is that if you switch on the radio without picking the station and you find that there is some kind of highbrow music being relayed, you can be sure it is Radio Éireann.  I think they are overdoing that.  I do not know what the market for this type of music is in Ireland.  I do not think it is as large as the radio people seem to think it is. We are not all music lovers to the extent that we would prefer to listen to Bach or Beethoven rather than a band playing Irish dance music.  We have different tastes.  I feel this has been slightly overdone or even more than slightly overdone.  This is a fair criticism.</P>
    <P>Another thing that irritates me, particularly when I am in company with people who have little or no Irish, is the fact that when there are important items of news&mdash;we do not notice it so much at other times&mdash;the news comes on in Irish and they are left wondering <Col N="2578" /> what the dickens is happening.  I am asked: &ldquo;What was that about?&rdquo; Perhaps it is their fault for not being able ot understand, but Radio Éireann in particular should try to understand that about 90 per cent of the people would rather hear a news item, particularly if it is a hot news item, in a language which they can understand.  This is one of the mistakes being made by that station.</P>
    <P>I have grave doubts about the new Gaeltacht radio station which is being set up.  No doubt Irish enthusiasts will pour vials of wrath on my head for saying that but I honestly believe that even Deputy Tunney, who is so often mistaken for me in many ways, will find that the number of people who will make use of a very expensive gadget, which is what it is, will be very small. In view of the fact that everyone in this country understands English, so far as I know, and a very small proportion of the people understand Irish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as you can afford it you can give the minority as many rights as you wish.  I believe the setting up of a radio station for the Gaeltacht areas was achieved by a pressure group who have not done badly out of Irish and who would like to give the impression that everybody in the country wants this station.  I do not think the demand is so great.</P>
      <P>On television and radio sport is very well catered for.  An excellent job is being done by the people who look after these programmes.  The value that people who have colour television can get from looking at games or races is extraordinary.  I do not believe the Government would be entitled to spend the necessary money to provide a colour television service.  It would cost far too much.  They are providing an experimental service.  They are doing very well and the quality is exceptional. It is rather a pity that we cannot afford it.  We cannot afford it and we might as well face up to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of extending a multi-channel service throughout the country it is a shame <Col N="2579" /> that the Government do not allow it. It is disgraceful that they should ask anybody to pay what they are asked to pay for a television licence and then tell them: &ldquo;You have the licence but we do not approve of your looking at anything except the one station.&rdquo;  There is neither sense nor meaning in that if we could have four or five or six stations for the same fee.  The Minister should try to encourage the Government to branch out.  After all, if travel broadens the mind surely the opportunity to view what is happening in other lands would be an advantage. I do not want to give a plug to BBC 2 but they put out some wonderful programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister knows about it at second hand only.  It is a mystery to me why some of the geniuses who invented television have never invented a television aerial which would not spoil the skyline as it is spoiled by the forest of television aerials to be seen in every city and town.  I cannot understand why something small, about three inches long, was not substituted for an aerial long ago, and why it has not been possible to get some type of aerial which could without much trouble pick up the signals which apparently are travelling around all the time.  I do not think the Government would make it illegal for people to look at these programmes. They have not made it illegal for us to look at them so far.</P>
      <P>People have said that children see too much television.  While this may be true, it is also true that the children of today who have been reared with television are far more intelligent and up-to-date than the children of the generations who were not reared with television.  Many people disagree with that.  I see Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins shaking her head.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the next point I am coming to.  I am a member of a library committee and we found that when television first became popular the demand for books decreased.  However, within two years we found that the demand for books which were unheard of before this, particularly by children and young adults, was astonishing.  There has been a complete reversal and there is more reading of worthwhile books than ever before.  That is a complete answer to those who say people do not read if they look at television.</P>
      <P>The student riots in America and in Paris which have been screened and have been shown again and again although, in my opinion, they have not got news value, were responsible, in my opinion, for spreading that type of thing around the world and particularly in this country.  That is my one criticism about the choice of material.  I believe that those who are expert at the television game should decide what should be shown.  That is a comment which I think I am entitled to make.  I believe it is wrong that that type of thing should get the amount of publicity it got.  It did not do anybody any good.  In fact, I think it caused a lot of trouble.</P>
      <P>I raised quite a number of matters in great detail on this Estimate last year.  I have already congratulated the Minister in his absence on the fact that an astonishing number of them were attended to, or a start was made on attending to them.  I will not throw bouquets at a Minister of the present Government.  I am rather surprised to find that there is even one efficient Minister in the Government.  That is all the more reason why I should say that I consider he is doing fairly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned further increased charges.  Increased charges are resented by everybody.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that if charges are increased at a later date they will not be linked by him, and by those following them, with increases in salaries and wages.  Increased salaries and <Col N="2581" /> wages are coming.  It is terribly unfair that, in relation to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and no other Department, people should say that the costs of various items had to go up because of increased salaries and wages.  Every other Department must give the same increases as those received by people employed by the post office.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a start was made on painting the post office vans a bright colour Some people disagreed. I said I thought it was right and I still think it was right.  It is all very well to be so Irish that you will not wear anything except green, but I am afraid we overdid it in a way.  We have this dirty dark green.  Recently someone asked why the &ldquo;VR&rdquo; and &ldquo;GR&rdquo; were not removed from pillarboxes.  If we try to do that we shall probably knock holes in them and the cure will be worse than the disease.  But the pillarboxes are painted a very dull green.  In the country districts it is very hard to see them when they are buried in green hedges. Having started on a new colour scheme, I suggest to the Minister we would not object too much if he added a little splash of colour to these pillarboxes.</P>
    <P>Would he also try to persuade the Department to keep post offices bright? Apart from the staff who have to spend their time in them many members of the public have frequent occasion to use them, particularly old age pensioners and people like that.  There are a great many sub-postoffices throughout the country.  Would the Minister pay those who run them some allowance to enable them to paint and keep the post offices clean?  Some go to the trouble of growing flowers and shrubs outside.  When asked why the inside is not painted the answer is that, if they spent all the money they get for a month on paint, without saying anything at all about the cost of labour, they would have nothing left to live on.  The Minister should have a look at that particular aspect to see if something could be done to brighten up the scene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's <Col N="2582" /> speech and I congratulate him on the manner in which he has run his Department.  I shall start by complimenting the Department on the stamps we are now using.  Our stamps have become very colourful, very imaginative and very attractive.  They are a credit to those who select the designs.  I am sure the Minister can take some of the credit.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with the direct dialling system between Dublin/Belfast and Dublin/London.  It is working very well indeed.  Telephone operators are, on the whole, very polite and very courteous.  If an operator is trying to obtain a number for a caller, very often the operator does not come back to say to the caller: &ldquo;One moment, please.  We are still trying to connect you.&rdquo;  Sometimes the caller gets the impression that he has been forgotten about or cut off.  It happens rarely but I just throw out the suggestion.  Those who train operators might take note of it.  Generally speaking, the standard is very high.</P>
      <P>With regard to RTE, sports coverage is of a very high standard.  The commentators are excellent and the presentation is of a very high standard. I should like more outside broadcasting units.  There are not enough at the moment.  This would be a worthwhile investment.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention specially one particular programme.  It was an interview between Jack White and the writer &ldquo;John Brennan&rdquo;.  I rang Jack White next day to congratulate him but I was unfortunately not able to reach him.  It was a very interesting programme.  They spoke about people like Tom Clarke, Seán MacDiarmada, MacDonagh and so on.  She knew these people personally.  For the first time they became flesh and blood human beings for me.  It was a new experience. It was different.  They were brought into one's home and one felt one knew them.  I hope this programme will be repeated.  There is a demand for this kind of programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme is better balanced now.  It tended to be, perhaps, too controversial. Generally speaking, Members of this <Col N="2583" /> House do not mind criticism if it is balanced.  Many more of the programmes being shown lately are better balanced.  This shows a greater sense of responsibility and I certainly welcome it.  I know that some people will not agree with me but I think the selection of films shown every Saturday and Sunday is very good.  The &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; radio programme affords listeners an opportunity to meet people from different walks of life and to learn about what they do.  I was surprised to learn the other day that a programme which can be put out on television can constitute a public meeting.  What constitutes a public meeting to me is when an announcement is made that such-and-such a meeting is to be held on a particular day and that anybody who wants to come is welcome, depending on the availability of seats.  If a station is going to hold a public meeting an announcement should be made as to what the public meeting is about and members of the public should be free to attend; there should be no question of the selection of audiences.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the new colour scheme for the post office vans.  It makes them look much brighter.  I should like to support everything Deputy Tully has said about the increased amount of reading which has resulted from television. I have had this confirmed to me by the chief city librarian in Dublin.  Any time there is a programme about some historical figure in Irish history, or otherwise, there is a tremendous increase in the demand for books on that particular subject. Such programmes have aided people's desire to read.</P>
    <P>I have no suggestions to make other than to say I hope the director-general of RTE will keep an eye on the question of balance within the station.  This is very important and I have no doubt that this will be his policy while he is head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister this year and last year announced with justifiable pride, if the announcement is correct, that the post office are run as <Col N="2584" /> a commercial venture, with commercial criteria and are a profitable undertaking when considered in that light. I find great difficulty in considering them in that light and in applying normal commercial criteria to them because we would have from a normal commercial undertaking at the end of their financial year a profit and loss account, with details of income and expenditure, and a balance sheet. While these financial documents may be available there is nothing like it in the Minister's statement or the very useful notes provided for us and no such detail is contained in the Book of Estimates.  It is therefore not possible to examine the Minister's claim to see if the post office are a viable commercial undertaking.  If the Minister persists in that claim he might introduce the provision of these things into his Department.  Apart from giving information to the House at this time of year they would in themselves be an excellent form of control.  It is a basic control for any business to have detailed accounts.  I have no doubt there are detailed accounts but it is very difficult to assess the commercial viability or otherwise of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because of the form in which they are presented.</P>
      <P>If the claim is made that this Department are a viable commercial concern it constantly amazes me that the most profitable part of their activities&mdash;telephones&mdash;is starved of capital.  If any industrialist or businessman has a concern operating under several headings and one of them has a built-in profit he will ensure that part of his operation will get all the capital it requires to expand so that he can take the fullest possible advantage of its particular profitability.  The telephone system which is consistently profitable is starved of capital.  What makes it profitable is use by telephone owners and yet there are 18,500 people waiting to be connected to telephones.</P>

    <P>The Minister gave the figure of £9.5 million as being this year's budget on works in connection with the telephone system.  This sum is obviously inadequate and the fact that the Government have made available <Col N="2585" /> another £1.25 million is somewhat belated recognition of that, even though I understand only a certain proportion of that money will be available this year because in fact the total additional Estimate sought is only £623,000.  If I am mistaken about those figures I should like to be corrected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the money available this year is being spent mainly on capital works.  It is understandable that before the telephones can be provided cables and equipment are necessary.  If enough money was provided I see no reason why extra works to give a telephone to everyone who wants one could not be undertaken, particularly when it is guaranteed to show a very handsome return.  The return on capital last year in percentage terms was 8.9.  Precisely how that percentage is calculated I do not know&mdash;it is stated to be on net assets.  It is not a bad figure, but it is not a great figure, particularly, as I say, when this service is in growing demand and that it is a monopoly service.  Any businessman with a monopoly in a public utility would turn it into a very high profit indeed. The Minister has fallen down in that he has not been able to persuade or to bully his colleagues in Government into making more money available for this profitable part of the operations of his Department.</P>
    <P>Again the lack of ordinary accounts makes it difficult to comment on the analysis, provided with the Minister's notes, of each £1 income, but there are two figures in it which I find odd.  On the expenditure side, it shows in graph form the breakdown of each pound of expenditure involved in the telephone service and shows that of that £1, 4/-, that is 25 per cent, of the expenditure is set aside for depreciation.  It seems at first sight to be a high figure and I would like the Minister to comment on why such a high depreciation figure is arrived at.  It seems that with the type of capital equipment used in the post office and again bearing in mind that it is a State body with a monopoly, it is a peculiar depreciation figure. Perhaps there is a very high depreciation in telecommunications equipment <Col N="2586" /> and that with technological advances, it may become obsolete very quickly and that is probably one reason for it, but I suspect, too, that it may be a hidden means of saving Government investment, and that it is not so much depreciation as another way of &ldquo;milking&rdquo; the cow of profit-making capital.  Would it not be better to show that the system is more profitable within itself than to show it in that way?  I note that the total amount allowed for depreciation is £3,764,000 in relation to the total expenditure of £9.5 million.  It is a very substantial sum.</P>
    <P>The other large part of the expenditure, apart from wages, is on interest which is shown to be 4/3d. in every £1 spent.  I worked out this expenditure for 1970-71 at £4,705,000, but yet somewhere in the Minister's statement, I read that the interest payable is 8.5 per cent and I cannot equate that 8.5 per cent with that sum.  I do not know on what the 8.5 per cent is calculated. It is not obviously calculated on expenditure and it must be calculated on Government investment.</P>
    <P>These are difficulties which I see and which confront me in trying to analyse the financial position of the Department, and particularly the telephone accounts, in connection with this Estimate.  It adds point to what I was saying, that if the approach is to be commercial, employ all the commercial documentation, so that we can see the whole operation as any company or industry would present their affairs at the end of their year.</P>
    <P>It is very disappointing that there is not, and that there is no sign of, vastly increased investment in the telephones to take advantage of the huge and growing demand.  The Minister pointed out that the use of the telephone system is growing rapidly, and Deputy Tully pointed out, as did Deputy Desmond, that as standards of living and sophistication increase, more and more use is being made of telephones.  In the more sophisticated and advanced countries, they have reached the stage where local calls can be free because the volume of other use is so high.  We are a good bit away from that yet. but nevertheless it is a target we should <Col N="2587" /> be aiming at.  We have no possibility of achieving it unless capital investment is vastly increased.</P>
    <P>In February this year, I put a suggestion to the Minister by way of Parliamentary Question about the possibility of hiving off the telephone engineering section of the Department so that they could be run as a separate entity on a purely commercial basis, and I understood that the matter was being considered by the public services organisation review group, but that they had recommended against a change of this nature.  I do not know if there has been any fresh thinking on the matter, or indeed if hiving them off would improve the position, whether if they were a separate commercial entity, their capital structure would be improved in many ways.  If they were a separate body, they would be in a position to go to normal sources of finance for capital they would require, like any State body, such as the ESB, and go on the stock market and borrow abroad.  Certainly if they were providing a monopoly service which had been profitable up to now and which in a more streamlined organisation could be assumed to be even more potentially profitable, I do not think there would be any doubt that such a separate commercial entity would get all the capital they would require.  What is wrong at the moment is that they are starved for capital because they have to take their place in the queue because of the other calls on the Exchequer.  I suggest that the Minister ask this review group to reconsider the position of the telephone section of his Department because unless they are reorganised as a separate commercial entity, they are going to be continually starved of capital and the growth of which they are capable will not take place.  This is something which should be considered urgently.</P>
    <P>I understood from the Minister's speech last year that professional staff for the telecommunications sections were difficult to recruit, that private industry was proving more attractive and that this was met by the provision of scholarship schemes.  I am glad to <Col N="2588" /> see that a number of graduates under these schemes have now joined the Department.  It would be important, if there was any hope of extra capital becoming available, that the professional skills to manage it and to apply it and to design the works for spending it would be available.  If there was any danger of graduates not coming in sufficient numbers to the Department, I would urge the Minister to expand these scholarship schemes which seem to be the only way to recruit the technical personnel, but, of course, the demands of industry on the pool of graduates are very heavy.</P>
    <P>In addition, the rates of pay would have to be made competitive because you get your scholarship graduates who do whatever service they have to do, to pay back the scholarship, and then depart.  A constant changing of the professional staff in that highly sophisticated engineering section would not be a good thing and would also inhibit growth.  This is a factor that might not be troublesome if the telephone section were to be a separate commercial semi-State body.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid tribute to the post office staff and I would like to endorse that tribute.  He mentioned also the provision of welfare officers and that these had been of considerable assistance in securing harmonious staff relations.  I am glad to hear that such officers have been provided, but it is a pity that they are not more widely spread.  At the moment there are six in Dublin and one each in two provincial centres.  If one could be in the midlands, he would be able to take in a large area and deal with a big number of staff in an area which is not catered for in this regard.  It shows a humane approach on the part of the Minister and the establishment officers to staff problems to have such an officer there for the welfare of the staff. I have no doubt that such consideration will be reciprocated by the staff, and indeed, as the Minister said, this has happened over the past year.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that consultation takes place between the Department and those working within it, and if there is any room for expansion in this regard, I would urge the Minister to <Col N="2589" /> see that such expansion is achieved. The more involvement that there can be by workers, whether they be in the Civil Service or in commercial firms, the more harmonious will be relations generally and the less likelihood will there be of strikes.  Also, this involvement leads to greater productivity.  I commend the Minister on his efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the amount of money that is being made available this year for post office buildings, I suppose the Minister is in the queue to the Exchequer; many of these buildings are very old.  In some towns they are being replaced while in other towns they are not being replaced although they are in urgent need of replacement. About two years ago the Department of Posts and Telegraphs purchased a fine premises and site in Longford town.  It was accepted that this was for the purpose of providing new headquarters for the Department's operations in that town.  However, this building which happens to be in the main street has been allowed to stand unusued since then and Deputies will realise that any building so left becomes derelict and shabby and a derelict building takes from the appearance of a country town.  In view of the fact that this town is growing fast and that it has expanded rapidly, particularly during the past couple of years, perhaps the Minister could have this matter of the post office moved to the top of the priority list and that by next year work will have commenced on the building.</P>
    <P>The next matter I wish to deal with is that of the operations of the post office savings banks.  Potentially, this branch has tremendous possibilities for the whole economy.  We are being urged constantly by economists to save and we are told that our savings are two-edged weapons against inflation in that they take purchasing power out of the economy and that they provide capital for Government investment.  There is no doubt that this is so.  Perhaps it is a section of the Department in which there has not been enough propaganda work.  For example, the Minister has told us that the interest rate on the Eighth Issue <Col N="2590" /> of saving certificates amounts to 9¼ per cent to persons who would be paying income tax.  At the moment, that is an excellent yield.  Granted, the certificates must be held for five years in order to gain this yield but, nevertheless, they are a good investment for anybody who wants security and a good yield for his money.  I do not think that very many people are aware that in the post office they can have as good an investment as they will get elsewhere.  If they invest in one of the national loans there is a danger that they will be affected by inflation and perhaps that there will be some loss of capital.  That danger is obviated by purchasing saving certificates.  We are told that the sales of saving certificates for the three and a half months ended September 30, totalled £3.6 million.  It is obvious, therefore, that quite a number of people are aware of this particular investment but I wonder if there is a tapering off of sales after new issues are introduced.  Perhaps some of these were purchased by way of transfer from other issues but I would like to think they were actually new cash to the post office.</P>
    <P>The national instalment savings scheme was very imaginative and was geared to encourage small savings regularly.  After its initial impetus, it seems to have fallen off.  At least I am assuming it has fallen off because I do not hear very much about it.  During the 12 months ended 31st August, we are told that there were 36,000 agreements and that instalments totalling £4 million were received.  However, if the figure for saving certificates represents actual sales, in three and a half months £3.6 million was taken in. Perhaps the instalment savings scheme could be pushed.  I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;glamorised&rdquo; but perhaps this is what could be done in respect of the scheme.  Very often the advertising of a branch of a Department of State has not the same impact that private commercial advertising might have.  The savings branch might review their advertising policy with a view to giving to their savings schemes a glamour image, if that would be possible with regard to something as mundane as saving money.  This particular branch has so much potential <Col N="2591" /> for the economy that gimmicks should be employed without any hesitation so as to boost savings.  I have no doubt that a considerable budget is set aside for advertising, both newspaper and television advertising, but it might encourage more saving if that budget could be increased or if the type of advertising were to be changed.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that difficulties and delays arose in the post office savings bank as a result of the increased business to them because of the prolonged bank strike.  There have been complaints about the difficulty of withdrawing money from the post office.  That was a pity because if the post office had been geared to cater for the business that would be transferred to them from the commercial banks, many people might have transferred altogether from the commercial banks to the post office.  Difficulty in withdrawing money whether it be from the bank, post office or anywhere else is something that inhibits people in saving.  I suppose this is one of the reasons why so many people keep money in banks on deposit accounts at ridiculously low rates when they could be earning decent rates with the post office.  We can appreciate, of course, that the demands on the post office savings bank as a result of the bank strike were unduly heavy but the bank strike lasted for almost 12 months so there was a falling down in that the post office did not gear themselves for the heavy volume of business that went to them.</P>
    <P>In dealing generally with the financial position of his Department, the Minister ended on a rather peculiar note when he said that the question of a further adjustment of post office charges would have to be considered shortly but that he was not in a position to say any more than that at present.  Earlier, the Minister gave details of impending wage claims and we have had also the provisional accounts for the year ahead.  Therefore, I am surprised that at this stage the Minister is not in a position, while on the Estimate for his Department, to say how he intends dealing with the estimated deficit of £1,500,000.  This is a large sum and indicates a serious <Col N="2592" /> trend.  He has indicated his projections for the year.  If he is to claim that this is a commercial undertaking, the shareholders&mdash;these are the people we represent&mdash;will be very surprised to hear the chairman of the company say: &ldquo;we will possibly have to make an adjustment in charges in the near future but we will say no more than that now.&rdquo;  There will be blue murder. The Minister owes it to the House to give some indication of how these financial problems may be tackled.  Is he going to surrender to inflation or is there to be some novel thinking, some new form of management control to see if anything can be done about the sectors that are costing more?  It is disappointing and it is a serious gap in the Minister's speech.  It makes nonsense of his claim that this is a commercial undertaking.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to analyse the figures that were given but I noted in the summary of financial details under the heading: &ldquo;Surplus or Deficit after Charging Interest on Capital&rdquo; for the year 1969-70, presumably the final account therein, the deficit under the telegraph section is given at £19,000. Yet in the Book of Estimates in Appendix C at page 139 the deficit is given at £180,000.  Happily the deficit is £19,000 instead of £180,000 but there is such a huge discrepancy between those two figures that I find it very difficult to understand how when the Book of Estimates was being prepared it was not known to the Department, that this discreapancy would occur.  There is a note that there was an improvement in the telegraph position due mainly to changing telex income from receipts to an accrual basis but that could be in German for all it means to me or to anybody else.  Surely the knowledge that this dramatic change in terms of charges was contemplated should have been known to the Department?  It seems extraordinary that there could be this discrepancy.  It is a pleasant surprise but it it a disturbing discrepancy and makes one look at the Book of Estimates with rather a jaundiced eye as to how accurate these things are, or are all these figures just to fill pages?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to that. After a few hours there is very little left to say on this Estimate.  The Minister must be the most bored man in Ireland at this moment but it has to be said because repetition can often get an idea across where a single utterance of it might fail.  I should like briefly to deal with the broadcasting section although I hesitate to do so. Last year the Minister gave us figures for the cost of VHF radio.  I think that service is in operation.  It has often struck me as being an extravagance by the Department because the difference in quality is apparent only to a person with a very highly educated musical ear and the numbers of such persons in this country must be comparatively small and the number of receivers to receive that type of service must be comparatively small.  I suggest that the cost of providing this service was out of proportion to the numbers availing of it.  I would be interested to know how many receivers there are capable of receiving VHF radio. There possibly was not enough investigation before this was set up.  It is an extravagance that is unnecessary for this country.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies have spoken at length on television broadcasting and what they like and do not like.  I suppose it is difficult to resist the opportunity this platform provides.  I should like to recommend to Telefís Éireann that when they are purchasing programmes from other stations, as indeed other stations purchase programmes from them, there is nothing reprehensible in it, they should consider buying selected programmes from the BBC series called &ldquo;Omnibus&rdquo;.  It would be a pleasant change from American domestic comedies about which Deputy Desmond spoke so scathingly and I agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with the question of multi-channel systems.  He stated that there is no change in the position, that authority cannot be given to the use of special technical means, that is to extend the range of external programmes when <Col N="2594" /> they cannot be taken off the air.  Why cannot that authority be given?  Is it an international convention or are we bound by treaty not to pirate other people's broadcasts?  If that is so, it is unfortunate.  If it is a question of the equipment being expensive perhaps the Minister would have a look at it because I think Deputy Tully put the case very well when he indicated that some people, because of an accident of geography, have a wonderful selection while others in the far south and south-west have to depend on one station only.  Again, what does &ldquo;off the air&rdquo; mean?  In Athlone we can get quite good reception from stations other than RTE at certain times and in certain climatic conditions, and sometimes it is fringe.  If multi-channel were to be extended to Athlone would the quality of the other channels be as it is now or could it be improved by reason of the multi-channel?  If it could then I would recommend that multi-channel be extended to such fringe areas because I think multi-channel has a great commercial future for Telefís Éireann.  It might help solve some of their budgeting problems, although one does not have much sympathy for them with their budgeting problems when one sees some of the extravagances they indulge in.  One thing that particularly exasperates me is when a sports commentator is sent many thousands of miles to give a comment on a particular sporting event that is already being well commented upon by a person from the station putting out the broadcast.  However, that is a niggling, personal complaint.</P>
    <P>One rather disturbing matter that came to light during the year was the policy of the television authority in destroying film in that their archives can be very inadequate.  It was mentioned that several programmes made on the life and works of the late Seán Ó Riada had been destroyed.  As some of his music was on tape it was felt that these television programmes did not need to be kept.  We know now because of his lamented and early death that the lack of these programmes is a serious loss in our television archives.  Lack of finance to keep adequate archives was the reason for this destruction.  Because of the <Col N="2595" /> seriousness of this, the Minister might consider making a special grant-in-aid each year or devise a financial system for the broadcasting authority to enable them to keep original programmes in store for future generations.  It would be a pity if programmes of this type were destroyed because of lack of finance when one considers the amount of money spent in buying material that can only be described as nonsense.</P>
    <P>The most serious development in broadcasting during the year was the necessity for the Minister to issue a directive to RTE, serious because it was, in effect, State censorship of the broadcasting authority.  I accept it as being true when the Minister states that he took this step with great reluctance but it is unfortunate that the circumstances arose in which that notice or direction had to be given.  It is a matter of subjective opinion whether it was necessary.  I am not dodging the issue but I do not see sufficient television to be able to pass any comment on that point.  I read afterwards that it was a form of censorship and that professional journalists should not be censored, that their own sense of integrity in their profession is, in effect, censorship to ensure that what comes forth from their pens or their productions is balanced.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the conscience of individual journalists to ensure that this is so.  Certain events have taken place in this country in the last 12 months with a high emotive content and it is possible that individual journalists have allowed their emotional involvement to blur their sense of professional judgment. Obviously, the Minister thought this had happened and perhaps the fact that he did and that he took action may serve to restore the balance.  It is a delicate area and one in which politicians must be loath to move.  I shall not say any more about this matter but I am glad that the Minister took this action with reluctance and I take it from that it will be a long time before the like will have to be done again.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to repeat what I said at the outset.  If this <Col N="2596" /> Department is presented to this House as a commercial undertaking, all that goes with that should be by way of facts and figures.  It would be of tremendous assistance to us in the House to have these facts and figures presented in that way because we could make a more accurate analysis. I have no doubt that I have misinterpreted some points and, if so, the Minister will be able to correct me.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister and I wish the Department a successful year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is an odd Department in some ways.  Usually, when the Estimate passes through the House, people criticise it mildly and in general praise is given for the successes achieved by the Department. There is an important principle involved in relation to this Department. The principle here is the question of commercial viability in an organisation of this kind, an organisation which has a social content.  The analysis Deputy Cooney has gone through in relation to the Estimate has been thorough.  We have a responsibility to be inquiring and inquisitive about every penny that is spent by the Department and I hope the Minister will be able to answer the pertinent questions put by Deputy Cooney.  I was interested in Deputy Cooney's contribution, and this kind of objective assessment of the cost of running a Department is important.  I tend to be concerned about the fact that it provides an important social service and in those circumstances it is difficult to look at it from a profit and loss point of view.  It is important that this is done by someone competent to do so and I hope the Minister will be able to answer the questions put to him by Deputy Cooney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a matter of this kind it is difficult to attempt to provide in certain circumstances a service that cannot pay for itself.  Earlier today Deputy Crowley spoke about the provision of telephone kiosks in rural Ireland.  These kiosks cannot pay their way but the people in rural areas have a right to this service.  Similarly, the person who lives in a very remote area has the right to <Col N="2597" /> have his letters delivered.  All this is self-evident but it means we are faced with the possibility of carrying a loss because of the social content of the service in question.  So long as that expenditure is justified to the satisfaction of the people who are capable of assessing these things, we must accept that the social content has a certain primacy and that the community must pay for it.  I understand that in the United States many of these services are provided by private enterprise and that they attempt to make them pay their way, but in fact, the telephone and postal services are most inefficient.  I do not think we should lose sight of that fact in deciding on the efficiency or otherwise of such services.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would tell us why he has not considered more seriously the idea of the Post Office giro system.  As Deputy Cooney pointed out, the existence of an alternative banking system during the bank strike might have had a most salutary effect on the bankers at that time in coming to a more rapid conclusion to that very inconvenient and economically damaging bank strike, which went on for so long and did so much damage to the economy. Why is it not possible for us to introduce the Post Office giro system?  The Minister is aware that it is used in some of the Scandinavian countries.  In every town in Ireland there is a post office and the giro service could be competitive with the commercial banks, it could provide fair interest rates and it could provide the Government with a large amount of capital for expenditure on housing and for other social spending.  Has the Minister examined the post office giro system and the likelihood or the desirability of introducing it here?  If not, why not? What are his objections to the system?</P>
    <P>To a limited extent the Minister is responsible for the television service. We know what the limitation is.  At the same time, I understand that on this Estimate we are allowed to contribute a point of view on the service.  Like Deputy Cooney, I do not see very much television.  I think we all know well that most of our comments on <Col N="2598" /> programmes of one kind or another are essentially subjective and for that reason are not particularly valuable. This is a very expert and specialist problem.  To comment on individual programmes is not of any great help.</P>
    <P>There are a number of general principles in relation to television.  In view of the fact that the Minister has set up a broadcasting review committee to consider the whole problem of television in Ireland, it is worth our while to give our own views on the subject.  I take the view that, above all others, this service has an extraordinarily complicated function and not simply a social function, which it has as everybody knows.  It has a very much broader effect on the wole structure of our society.  It would be very interesting if somebody made a comprehensive social study of Ireland before television and Ireland three or four years later, to try to assess the extraordinary changes that have taken place in our political attitudes and our cultural attitudes, in our ethical and social values, and in our whole process of community living.</P>
    <P>Remarkable changes must have taken place in rural Ireland because of the very fact that this wonderful scientific evolution has given people the advantage of a television service. With all its defects it has a number of valuable components.  Changes have already taken place and I believe that, in order to help the committee that is to advise the Minister upon what his future strategy is to be in relation to television, it would be well worthwhile to have a comprehensive social study carried out to see how dangerous and how valuable, and how potentially dangerous and potentially valuable the television service has been and is likely to be.</P>
    <P>Most working politicians know that it has completely revolutionised the whole science of politics.  Most of us know that the public meeting is finished as a means of communicating with people, or virtually finished anyway, from the point of view of attempting to talk to any group of people.  That is simply no longer of any value in public.  Most of us have had the experience of going around <Col N="2599" /> canvassing and finding that there is a good programme on and that we are most unpopular because we are intruding on that television programme.  This is something which other groups have found as well.  We know that it has made an extraordinary change in the size of cinema audiences.  Many cinemas have simply had to close down.  The Churches have also found that there have been very great changes in the social pattern both in the urban and the rural areas.  They are having their own difficulties in distracting audiences from the attractive convenience of the television set in the corner.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the trend has been towards political and social enlightenment because of the fact that the green curtain has been completely shattered by the advent of television.  For that reason, questions which could not be discussed and subjects which could not be debated are now being debated and talked about in half a million houses throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  Many of the views now being put forward in all parts of Ireland are not the heavily censored views which were put to the people before the coming of television.  They are views, good or bad, right or wrong, prejudiced or unprejudiced, from the North of Ireland, from the BBC and from various independent channels in Great Britain.  We have the various canned television programmes from the United States as well as the latest development of the satellite service.</P>
    <P>The situation in which our society lived, a rather tightly encompassed, concooned, isolated, inward-looking, somewhat smug and complacent society, with the very self-satisfied conviction that everything we believed and held and everything we stood for was right and that there was very little better anywhere else, has changed and is changing.  Many values have changed and are changing fast.  We are evolving into a completely new society predominantly because of the influence of television.  While this has probably been good in many cases&mdash;I am not competent to say whether or not it has been wholly good&mdash;I would imagine <Col N="2600" /> that there have been certain great advantages. But there probably have been and could be certain great disadvantages as well.</P>
    <P>The last annual report is a very gloomy one in which they talked about the year being the most difficult in the history of RTE.  They went on to deal with that problem in a way which I believe is likely to be, to use the new &ldquo;in&rdquo; phrase, counter-productive in so far as they appear to have decided to retrench, to reduce the service, to reduce the quality of the service.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the <i>rationale</i> of that and I should like to know whether the Minister can explain it to us.  It seems to me Telefís Éireann is facing much the same dilemma as Aer Lingus. I refer to the formidable competition from wealthier countries, a competition which is beginning to provide very great problems for our tiny, very efficient little airline.  Aer Lingus is quite likely to run into very serious financial trouble.  I think there is a reasonable comparison between the problems Aer Lingus is facing and the problems Telefís Éireann is facing.  I refer to the multiplicity of alternatives. I doubt if anybody could improve on the Americans in the production of rubbish.  Nobody could do that better than the Americans do it.  There are alternative programmes from Britain and Northern Ireland and, unless RTE is prepared to reconsider its attitude, it is very likely that the only people who will look at our television programmes will be the producers looking at the monitors in Montrose.  There is a distinct possibility of this.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Tully's view on the quality of programmes generally.  My experience is somewhat limited because I do not look at television very much.  On the whole I do not think Radio Telefís Éireann is any worse than any of the other channels.  There are some excellent programmes on all channels.  There are also some appalling programmes on all channels.  Faced with financial difficulty there is a possibility that the authority may decide to reduce the quality of the programmes and, if they reduce the quality still further, it will simply mean that they will not be looked at any more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2601" /> Telefís Éireann should stop trying to compete with these wealthy countries. They should devise a system different from that of other countries.  I know it is easy to say this, but I believe this is the only likelihood they have of any success.  They cannot spend money at the same rate as the BBC, ITV or the United States.  Even if they wanted to do that the money is just not there. Appalling damage can be done by the wrong kind of television programmes. The general impression one gets&mdash;I have not seen many programmes myself&mdash;is that American television is completely moronic, devoted to a mixture of advertising and horse opera. Most of the programmes we take from the United States deal with violence of one kind or another, people killing one another, shooting one another, beating one another up.  It is extraordinary that we should continue to tolerate the level of violence that is portrayed on our television screens. Telefís Éireann is no worse than the others, but why we should buy this kind of programme puzzles me.</P>
    <P>Violence is glorified.  We were discussing this recently; we were discussing the cult of violence.  Part of that cult is the persistent exhibition of violence on our screens.  Generally speaking, it is accepted that the whole process of education is an imitative process of one kind or another.  If that is true, and I believe it is true, the child is learning to believe in violence as a solution to problems.  For that reason these programmes can only do harm to children.  I believe we should get the best brains we have to consider the whole subject and try to protect our society from the ill-consequences of these programmes.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in subsidy by advertising. I am shocked to find £3,200,000 paid for advertising on television. This is just another burden the capitalist system imposes on the unfortunate consumer because the cost of television advertising goes into the cost of the end product the consumer buys.</P>

      <P>The Estimate of this particular Government Department covers practically every part of the country and many features of our life. I said last year that it is possibly the most important Government Department in relation to the quality of life we are going to have in the future because it deals with physical features, it deals with our historical heritage, it can affect the shape of our capital city for years to come, it deals with recreational facilities and it is also a commercial department in the sense that it is responsible for arterial drainage and works in connection with those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last year, the Board of Works has within it a very good tradition of caring although sometimes that tradition seems to become weakened.  One hopes that tradition will be fostered and, if anything, enhanced.  It has a great deal of influence in this city because it is responsible for many of the public buildings and the standard of maintenance and care that it chooses to give to these could set an example for the private sector.  The Board of Works can also initiate public building for Government Departments.  The architectural standards it insists on can set a very necessary headline for the speculators who have been destroying so much of Dublin.  The Board of Works should in its approach to <Col N="2603" /> building in this city be ultra-careful in regard to the problems of conservation.</P>
    <P>We have never got any details from the Board of Works of the financing of the provision of Government offices. I believe from a newspaper comment &mdash;there is not anywhere else to get the information unfortunately&mdash;that the Government Departments sited in these new office blocks around this part of the city are all there on a rental basis like any other tenant.  The Government have no propriety interest in these premises beyond whatever propriety interest they may acquire under the Landlord and Tenants Acts as occupying tenants.</P>
    <P>A change of policy has occurred in relation to the new building being built in Kildare Street for the Department of Agriculture.  Again we have to rely on newspaper comment but I understand a sophisticated financial system of leasing, leasing back and various refinements on that technique have been put into relation to ensure that eventually the fee simple will come back to the State.  It would be interesting and only proper if the Parliamentary Secretary would in his reply inform the House, as representative of the taxpayers responsible for that building, what precise financial arrangements have been made to have it built, how it is going to be operated and the finances involved generally.</P>
    <P>It has been rumoured that the Government have been God's gift to the speculators, who have erected these concrete and glass boxes all about, in relation to the rents they were prepared to pay in advance of letting.  It is time we were told what these rents are and how they compare with going commercial rents.</P>
    <P>The Board of Works have a big responsibility in relation to the headlines they set, the quality of the buildings they erect and the financial return they are prepared to pay because it can set a line for the private sector. The line they set can be very important in that over extravagance or generosity could be an inflationary factor.</P>
    <P>In addition to that the Board of Works have tremendous influence in <Col N="2604" /> regard to the recreational facilities available.  Being in charge of the Phoenix Park is, of itself, a task of massive importance.  In his speech the Parliamentary Secretary adverted to some of the problems that are becoming acute in relation to the Phoenix Park.  He mentioned the volume of motor traffic that is using it and the volume of horse riding that is taking place there.  There will have to be control of both of these features.  It would be a pity, and impossible, to ban the park to either or both.  The number of fatal accidents at cross roads, in particular Mountjoy Cross, has been alarming.  Steps will have to be taken to prevent any recurrence of these.  It would be contrary to the nature of a recreational park to have to erect traffic lights in it and I would urge the Board of Works not to erect traffic lights if some other means of controlling traffic can be found.  Lorries and buses are prohibited and I have no doubt this prohibition will and must continue.</P>
    <P>Much of the through traffic in the Park at the moment is due to the fact that the bridge at Blanchardstown is not being used and traffic is being diverted through Castleknock Village and the Phoenix Park instead of going straight up the main Navan Road.  If that bridge were repaired it might relieve the Park to a considerable degree.</P>
    <P>People go to the Park at weekends to exercise themselves and allow their children to play.  These people must have access to the Park and unfortunately they come in motor cars.  They park their cars on the grass and on the verges of the road and they cause a certain amount of damage in so doing.  This is a dilemma which is going to be difficult to solve.  Perhaps the amenity study which is being carried out by students in the city will come up with some answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>The problem of horse riding, and I am not referring to commercial horse riding, but to riding schools which have hacks of livery will have to be tackled because as far as I can see at the moment horses are ridden in any part of the Park.  The result is that areas near the gate and at certain crossing points are a morass of mud <Col N="2605" /> when the weather turns wet.  It is unfair to the horse trainers who pay quite a substantial sum each year for the privilege of training horses in the Park that their facilities and their training gallops should be interfered with by horses from the riding schools.  I am glad to note however that the Parliamentary Secretary does not intend to prohibit horse riding in the Park.  It is a feature of the Park's activities and it adds to the appearance of the Park and the views available to see people riding horses through that nice parkland. It is possible that special walks or rides will have to be provided so that the matter can be controlled.</P>
    <P>I am glad the agitation to provide a municipal golf course in a part of the Phoenix Park has died by the provision of such a course on the far side of the Liffey between Islandbridge and Chapelizod.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to resist any attempt whatever at any encroachment of the Phoenix Park.  It is too precious and for a growing population it is almost too small to permit any further encroachment. The fact that the golf course was resisted is an indication that the Board of Works is well aware of the value of this amenity and the importance of preserving it.</P>
    <P>Another way in which the Board of Works has a big effect on the recreational facilities of this country is its responsibility for the inland waterways particularly the River Shannon.  I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the men employed in Shannon Navigation for the help they are to users of the Shannon and for the dedication they give to their work.  There is no question of their being confined to any 40 hour week; these men are available at all times to help tourists and other users of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The level of the Shannon which, strictly speaking, is not within the bounds of control of the Board of Works, is something which has caused great anxiety to boat operators during the last two summers.  I mentioned last year the fact that the CIE cruiser was unable to ply north of Athlone for most of the 1970 summer season and <Col N="2606" /> that owners of vessels other than the average cabin cruiser were chary of crossing Lough Ree.  I mentioned, too, that the reason for this was that the level of the water in Lough Ree was being deliberately kept low by the ESB and that there was a conflict of interest between the needs of the ESB and the tourist needs of the Shannon. There are two different Departments unfortunately involved&mdash;the Office of Public Works would be involved with tourist needs and the Department of Transport and Power with ESB needs. Some progress has been made in that the ESB has now at this late stage through the Minister for Transport and Power indicated that there might be an improvement next year, but I would suggest to the Office of Public Works, which has overall responsibility for the River Shannon, that this is not good enough and that the value of this river to the tourist economy, especially in the next couple of bleak years, will far outweigh any value it may have to the ESB by way of providing power for Ardnacrusha station.  The ESB admit, to use a watery analogy, that Ardnacrusha is only a drop in the ocean in the overall production of the ESB.  To try to maintain a high level in Lough Derg at the expense of Lough Ree is economically unjustifiable, particularly as it is being held in Lough Derg, I understand, merely for an emergency at Ardnacrusha, so that the reserve could be put into the national power grid, should the need arise.  This is a callous approach, and ultra-conservative, on the part of the ESB when you consider the damage it is doing to navigation on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>One flotel operator in Athlone, who came here nine or ten years ago, converted barges into floating hotels and he has been a very successful operator and has been a great boon to the economy of the town.  He has had to move his headquarters from Athlone down to Killaloe.  This is a big blow to Athlone and to the North Shannon area as well, as these barges plied north of Athlone as well as south of Athlone.  The reason he has had to move is lack of water in the river at Athlone immediately north of the weir and lack of water in Lough Ree&mdash;it <Col N="2607" /> was dangerous for him to cross Lough Ree and for him when he got north of Lanesboro.  The position there has been improved to some extent by the dredging which is taking place, but the improvement is only minimal and will not affect the position so long as the ESB open the sluice gates at Athlone and let water down south.</P>
    <P>The position in Athlone could have been improved for this man by the Board of Works directly, because in the bed of the river in Athlone, to the east of the navigation channel between the weirs and the town bridge, there are old mooring stones lying there from times gone by when large yachts used to be moored in Athlone.  These are a navigational hazard and any large boat navigating from the navigation channel to go to a mooring on the east quay is in danger of fouling its propeller on these stones.  The Board of Works were asked on numerous occasions to lift them.  The Board of Works navigation boat with its portable crane has been moored at the dock in Athlone for many weeks over the past few months, and to a lay person like myself and the boat users in Athlone, it is a mystery why the Board of Works, knowing that this need was there, knowing that these stones serve no purpose beyond being a hazard&mdash;why this boat capable of lifting them was not directed to lift them from the bed of the river once and for all.  I strongly criticise the Board of Works for allowing that position to continue.</P>
    <P>During the past summer, it was noticeable that there was considerable activity with hired boats on the Shannon and that the persons using them were in the main from Germany and France.  I understand that the prospects for next summer in the same tourist market are good.  The English market is dead as a dodo and it would be a pity if this continental market which is being developed could be in any way prejudiced by making navigation hazardous over Lough Ree next summer.  I urge the Office of Public Works to support all the boat owners in the pressures they are putting on the ESB and indeed to assert itself over the ESB and to assert its prior claim <Col N="2608" /> to regulate the waters of this, out largest inland waterway, so as to ensure that tourist activities on the River Shannon next year can continue unimpeded.</P>
    <P>I should recall too that the areas being served by the upper Shannon are what are known as some of the underdeveloped areas&mdash;Counties Roscommon, Longford and Leitrim&mdash;and any business that comes to these areas is welcome and a very essential boost to their economies.  It makes nonsense of the policies for western development and encouraging industries to go west when this readymade industry is not encouraged so as to become fully utilised.  Every boat that lands in Rooskey, Carrick-on-Shannon, Drumsna and Boyle brings spending into the area and a certain degree of prosperity, and any boat that cannot go north, that has to stay at Athlone or cannot even reach it is a loss to the area.  I cannot emphasise strongly enough or often enough how important it is that the level of Lough Ree for this coming tourist season will not be interfered with.  There is no good saying to me that the ESB have never let the level drop below the statutory minimum. The statutory minimum is no longer applicable because it does not leave enough water for the type of craft that wants to use Lough Ree and the Shannon above it.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the new regulations, the new bye-laws, relating to the Shannon should be fully thrashed out with all interested parties and, if possible, have them in operation and well publicised before next summer.  Every boat and boat hirer should have a copy of them.  They should be distributed to all boat hirers to be left in hired boats.  It is important that these bye-laws should not be imposed on any of the groups using the Shannon.  They should be brought into operation only after the fullest consultations.  I know that some submissions have been made by associations of persons interested in the Shannon in connection with some of the bye-laws.  Some of the changes they suggest would make nonsense of the bye-laws, and I do not think they would be prepared to force them, but <Col N="2609" /> I do think they should be done the courtesy, as the users of this great waterway, of being consulted before the bye-laws are finally framed.  The Parliamentary Secretary did indicate very properly that he was prepared to meet these people but I think he should take the initiative and arrange these meetings and have these bye-laws passed into law.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that attention is being given to the canals.  These are essential parts of our inland waterway system, and as I indicated earlier, these are the one part of the tourist industry which showed promise during last summer.  Every time I cross a levelled bridge on the Royal Canal, it brings home to me the terrible sin committed in allowing that waterway to fall into disuse.  It was a nicer waterway than the Grand Canal because it went through more interesting country side and it had numerious spurs which served many towns in the midlands and provided a wide variety of touring facilities.  It is so far gone now unfortunately that it is beyond repair. If there were stretches of it from the Shannon eastward or from Dublin westward that could be restored, I would ask the Office of Public Works to examine these with a view to restoring them.</P>
    <P>The Barrow navigation should get urgent attention because it goes through most lovely country and it should be opened up for boat users so that access over its full length would be easily available.  I have never travelled that waterway but I understand that there are navigational difficulties here and there on it, but it would not be over-expensive to remove them and I would like to see them removed and this waterway made completely accessible.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Ballyconnell Canal and the possibility of linking the Shannon with Lough Erne.  If the Shannon could be linked with Lough Erne and the Barrow navigation improved, we would have an inland waterway system from Limerick to Enniskillen, from Waterford to Limerick, to Enniskillen and to Dublin&mdash;a wonderful system with a wonderful potential for tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2610" /> Eventually, too, it might be possible to persuade the authorities in Northern Ireland to restore the link from Lough Erne to Lough Neagh and one could foresee the day when it could be possible to travel by inland waterways from Limerick to Belfast.</P>
    <P>The other matter that I would like to deal with is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works for our historical heritage.  I wonder sometimes whether there is sufficient urgency within the Office in relation to the problems under the archaeological and national monuments headings. One of the most urgent tasks facing the Office is the archaeological survey.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has told us, it was decided in 1965 to make a survey on the ground of the entire country.  Yet, in 1971 after six years during which there have been tremendous physical changes in the country, only the counties of Louth, Monaghan and Meath have been completed under this survey.  We are told that it was extended last year to counties Cavan, Westmeath and Longford and that it is proceeding satisfactorily.  I beg to differ from the Parliamentary Secretary on that statement and to say that it is misleading because my information is that outside Dublin there is now one officer available on the ground for work on this survey.  If it was possible only to complete three counties since 1965, I can forsee a very slow rate of progress in the future.</P>
    <P>Because of land reclamation works, arterial drainage, the extending of towns and the building of new roadways, it is critical that this survey be carried out as a matter of urgency so that anything worth saving would be saved.  I understand that a new headquarters is being built outside Mullingar on a Board of Works site. Therefore, with new headquarters and with the will in the Office, all that is required is personnel and I would urge that personnel be recruited even to the extent of providing scholarships for graduates in archaeology so as to ensure there will be no shortage of personnel coming into the service in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>A matter that I mentioned here last <Col N="2611" /> year and which has caused anxiety to people interested in archaeology is the destruction of ring forts.  As I said on the previous occasion, it was in a ring fort that the Ardagh Chalice was found. There are many ring forts throughout the country and unfortunately many others have been bulldozed out of the way in the course of land reclamation work.  If the significance and potential importance of these forts were explained to the farmers and contractors concerned I have no doubt that they would be willing to co-operate and leave them until such time as they could be excavated.  I do not know whether preliminary investigation would indicate whether they were worth saving, but it might be possible to give a quick decision in respect of these forts to contractors concerned as to whether they should be bulldozed or preserved for further investigation.  It is my experience that the farmers of Ireland take immense pride in their being anything of historical importance on their land and I am sure they would be anxious to co-operate in ensuring that anything worthwhile would be preserved and that there is access to it and that it is never damaged.  Possibly some sort of task force could be set up within the Office of Public Works for the purpose of investigating ring forts.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is liaison between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Office of Public Works concerning the danger to ring forts but many of them are not mapped and I understand that permission for the demolition of some of them has been given without any excavation being carried out.  None should be demolished without prior excavation. The archaeological survey has been progressing too slowly.  If it is not speeded up the whole exercise will be pointless and too many valuable relics will have been lost.</P>
    <P>The major conservation works to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred are to be commended and one would hope that they could continue on an ever-expanding scale.  It is good to know that Clontuskert has been given attention.  Last year I mentioned Clontuskert as being a prime example of what neglect can do.  It collapsed <Col N="2612" /> in 1968 and nobody had been aware of the state it was in.  I was interested to note that Trim Castle, a very dramatic monument, is receiving attention.  There are so many places that need urgent attention that the matter is almost a cause for despair.  Last year, too, I mentioned Inisboffin, which has various historic remains.  There was an Augustinian monastic settlement there and this monument was restored in 1912 but nothing has been done with it since with the result that much of it has been overgrown.  There is a hole in the sacristy roof and some grave slabs have been broken.  I can understand that it is outside the resources of the Office of Public Works to attend immediately to every national monument and to give them the attention they deserve, but throughout the country there are local archaeological societies and perhaps the Office of Public Works might consider arranging closer liaison with these societies and, indeed, appointing officers to make arrangements for these people to look after and care for monuments in their areas and do a certain amount of restoration work on them.  The Mullingar association did excellent work on a site in their area.  Such liaison could result, perhaps, in urgent work being carried out until such time as major conservation works could be executed.</P>
    <P>There is a growing interest in things historic throughout the country and this interest should be fostered by the Office of Public Works, but it would necessitate the appointment of special officers or the setting up of a special section to harness this enthusiasm and guide it into practical work.  Another way in which this local enthusiasm could be harnessed would be in the collecting of grave slabs.  There are many grave slabs in graveyards throughout the country.  These stones are historic and should be collected. Very often they become broken.  At one time there was a tradition in rural Ireland&mdash;in Clonmacnoise to be precise&mdash;that when a grave was opened it was considered lucky, if one might use the term, to bury with the remains pieces of some ancient stones with the result that a lot of very valuable pieces have been lost in that innocent but, unfortunately, harmful way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2613" /> The storing of such remains as grave slabs or interesting stones is something that must be a problem for the Office of Public Works.  These are museum pieces but, of course, the National Museum is in no position to receive any more for its collections.  It is already overcrowded and a big percentage of its collection cannot be put on view at all.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Office of Public Works have in Athlone an ideal venue for showing many of these remains and that is Adamson Castle.  I understand it is not an ancient monument for technical reasons.  The Department of Defence on handing it over reserved rights for certain soldiers' families to continue living there but to all intents and purposes because of its antiquity it is an ancient monument.  It is in excellent condition.  It has been maintained in that state by the Department of Defence since the foundation of the State.  It has within itself apartments which would be suitable for displaying and storing things such as grave slabs or historic stones that might have become isolated from the buildings to which they were originally attached.  I read a letter in a newspaper recently, which I meant to keep, in which somebody referred to the fact that a Sheelagh-na-Gigh had been removed from a wall and that it appeared to have been lost.  This would be unfortunate because these figures are very interesting.  Their origin, I understand, has never been completely explained but if there were any in situations where they might be liable to damage or theft they should be removed and stored in a suitable place where they could be documented so far as any documentation is possible. The Parliamentary Secretary should suggest to the ancient monuments section to consider Athlone Castle as a site for storing these relics.  I did ask his collegaue in Education to consider it as a place to which to move the Army museum from Dublin.  It is not being shown in Kildare Street and this castle would provide a most appropriate setting.  The answer unfortunately was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  As this property belongs to the Office of Public Works I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary strongly to use it for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2614" /> I should like to refer to the provision of plaques at historic sites.  I mentioned 18 months ago, when we had the last debate on this Estimate, that all that was available on a site was a warning notice that anyone causing damage would be prosecuted and that it was the property of the Office of Public Works.  There was no explanation of the history of the site or no information at all for the casual tourist.  I am glad to see that this is under way but the speed at which it is being done is regrettably slow.  Eighteen months have passed since this was mentioned by me and I am sure it was known to the Office of Public Works long before that.  I hope there will be some sort of crash programme to get these things erected.  I would suggest that the local societies to which I have referred earlier could be used.  They would be only too willing to involve themselves in work of this nature because it is part of their activities.  I do not know who planned or designed these plaques or what information they will contain.  I was in Cashel and the plans there are commendable because from reading them one can get a picture of the site and the various buildings on it.  Clonmacnoise, on the other hand, is not well done.  There is a plaque and a site map of the remains showing the different periods in different colours but it is a bit confusing and could be improved.  A lot of care should be given to the design and inscription of these plaques.  There is an urgent need of toilet facilities at Clonmacnoise.  It is the most important monastic remains in the country and it is visited each year by many thousands of tourists.  The lack of elemental toilet facilities is a serious drawback.  There is no shortage of suitable discreet sites in the area and I would ask that this be attended to as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The other main feature in which the Office of Public Works impinge on national life is as builders of schools. I readily concede that their efficiency here primarily depends on the availability of money but nevertheless every parish priest and reverend mother in the country has every Deputy in this House annoyed and plagued and pestered trying to get priority for his <Col N="2615" /> or her school.  I do not know what the procedure in the Office of Public Works is for deciding the priority between schools.  I know that the procedure for finding out exactly at what stage a school stands leaves something to be desired.  It would be of immense help if each year a list of schools that would positively be done in the following year could be published.  I concede that lobbying might result to try to upset that list but if school managers became satisfied that once they appeared on the list to be done their school would be done and that they would not be put off in favour of somebody else such lobbying would drop off and would eventually cease.  At the moment the chief reason for frustration is lack of information about how priorities are decided, about how much money is available, about how many schools are to be built, about the technical difficulties within the Office of Public Works in getting the designs completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Priorities are decided by the Department of Education, not by the Office of Public Works.  We advise them on the suitability of sites and we build the schools in the order of priority drawn up by the Department of Education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many features which are relevant to this Department that one could speak for a very long time but I have dealt with the matters with which I personally am acquainted or <Col N="2616" /> about which I have strong feelings.  I want to emphasise again to the Parliamentary Secretary how important it is that the level of the River Shannon in the summer of 1972 will never be let fall to the level to which it was allowed go in the years 1971 and 1970. He may say that this is primarily a matter for the ESB, over which he has no control, but he should look to have legislation introduced restoring to his Department the full control over that waterway, particularly now when its tourist potential and its actual tourist revenue are greater than its need for the ESB.  This is a matter of supreme importance for the whole Midlands and for that undeveloped area of North Roscommon and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The waterways generally should have priority in the activities of the Department but I would urge that the Shannon get first priority among waterways because it is the greatest potential source of recreation for our own people and for tourist revenue in the economy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one reason more than another why I would be complimentary to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance it is because of the interest he has displayed and the recognition he has given in respect of the Phoenix Park, Dublin.  I say that not from any parochial point of view but because in the times in which we live the Phoenix Park is one of the most important monuments we have. It is one of the biggest and I think the best of public parks in Europe and I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the concern he has shown to keep the Phoenix Park as it was <Col N="2617" /> originally intended to be, and on behalf of the people of Dublin and, indeed, of the people of Ireland, I thank him.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would take the opportunity of reminding the Parliamentary Secretary that, with all his concern, there is perhaps the danger that the Phoenix Park will lose its identity, that an effort will be made to change the character of the Phoenix Park, which will not be to the benefit of the people whose privilege and pleasure it is to use that park.</P>
    <P>There has been progress in the field of technology.  We are living in times of tension and pressure. Especially in Dublin, green spaces are being eaten up; children are forced, in some circumstances, to live in unnatural surroundings.  There are certain limitations, generally speaking, on the lives of people.</P>
    <P>The Phoenix Park is one area where, without charge, people are free to go, without any danger to themselves.  One need have no fear that children will meet with any misfortune there.  In the Phoenix Park people can remove themselves from the so-called progress, from the undoubted tension, and live at least for a few hours in peace and quiet, can rest their eyes on the natural colours and beauty of the countryside, notwithstanding the fact that the park is situate in the metropolis.  There can be seen the natural furniture, the deer, the beast, the horse.  There can be seen children at play or people reading quietly.  We can see there the ideal life which unfortunately is receding from us.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned that the Parliamentary Secretary would resist the pressures which would change the character of the Park.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, traffic has now reached the point where the freedom that one enjoyed some time ago in the Park no longer exists.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate to us in his reply how he proposes to contain this problem.</P>
    <P>While the Park is for the use of all the people and while I accept the fact <Col N="2618" /> that people will travel in their cars to the Park I would hope that they might be required to park their cars at a given point and that they would use the rest of the Park on foot or on horseback or, perhaps, if it could be arranged, on bicycle.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we are going to allow the use of cars in the Park, it is necessary that a speed limit should be established.  I would suggest a speed limit not in excess of 20 miles an hour. On the main road, white lines should be laid down, indicating the right and left sides of the road.  At the moment it would seem that people imagine they are at liberty to use the main road in the park any way they like.  These are precautions that would be necessary if motorists were to have the full run of the Park.  The distance from any one point of the Park to another would not be greater than three miles. I do not see any reason why people would not be prepared to park their cars at one point and to use the rest of the Park on foot.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the natural furniture. I referred to the horse.  Because, perhaps, of the affluent times in which we live and the demand for horseriding, I am afraid this has got somewhat out of hand, as has been mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary. I referred to this matter last year but, being conscious of the fact that there were quite a few people engaged in the enterprise of making horses available, I was concerned that they would not lose their livelihood, although I have doubts as to whether or not people should be at liberty to commercialise the Phoenix Park.  Where this is done, a substantial fee should be imposed and we should recover from those who are commercialising the Park an amount of money which would go towards the cost of renewal of the sod which is removed, an amount which would compensate for the damage done by the horses.  There are hundreds of horses involved.  They are mutilating the Park to an extent which makes me unhappy.</P>
    <P>There is another feature.  I referred to this last year and subsequently I got a note from the Office of Public <Col N="2619" /> Works.  At the moment anybody who has 15s or £1 in his pocket can go to one of these stables and take out a horse.  He can tell a lie and say he is an experienced horseman.  He can be supplied with a fairly fiery horse and take it into the Park.  As has happened, he may be thrown from the horse.  The horse then moves riderless through the Park and there have been occasions when accidents have occurred.  If a serious accident occurs, normally the injured party would be entitled to compensation, but in this case he can take action against the rider of the horse who may not have more than the 15s which he paid for the horse, or against the owner of the stable who may not have the money which would be judged in court as suitable compensation.  It is absolutely essential that this matter should be resolved very soon.</P>
    <P>I should not like to let this opportunity pass without paying a compliment to the staff of the Phoenix Park, the Park Superintendent and his staff.  They get a certain amount of botheration from some people but they manage to control the Park without causing insult or annoyance to anyone. They maintain the Park in a fashion which does credit to them.  In certain areas of the Park they should look at the desirability of providing more footpaths. They request people not to walk on some of the green margins but in the absence of footpaths, if people want to move from one place to another, they must trespass on the green verges.</P>
    <P>In the new primary school curriculum great emphasis is placed on the study of environment.  I should like to seek weekly incursions into the Phoenix Park by students from all the schools on the perimeter.  Obviously the Park cannot be supervised all the time but the incidence of vandalism in the Park is less than it is in any other part of the city of Dublin.  This may be attributable to the work of the staff but it also derives from the fact that the atmosphere and the environment do not lend themselves to vandalism.</P>
    <P>I said that I would confine myself to speaking about the Phoenix Park but there is one other point I should like to make.  I said in Irish that I <Col N="2620" /> welcomed the Estimate because it gave me the opportunity and the satisfaction of listening to Deputy Henry Kenny. Having said it in Irish I should like to repeat it in English lest it might not be made known to the public.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the proposal to introduce a simultaneous translation system into this House.  This is an excellent idea and it should have been attended to years ago.  It will be of great advantage to Deputies.  We all desire to have the Irish language spoken in this House.  To those of us who are anxious to express our thoughts in Irish it would appear that there is no anxiety or desire on the part of other people that those thoughts should be made known because of the fact that they are expressed in Irish. I am relating my comments to the proposal to introduce a simultaneous translation system here.  It is unfortunate that in this country, where we are told that we have national newspapers, papers that are interested in everything that is national, papers that will at times take issue with the Government because of their attitude to the Gaeltacht, people who speak in the Irish language do not get their names mentioned in the papers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at great length, although this is an Estimate to which I usually contribute. My main reason for intervening is to express my disappointment at the very bad news contained in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement so far as the constituency I represent and Limerick county are concerned.  I deplore the decision which led to the Parliamentary Secretary stating:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount sought, £878,000, is less than the £1,176,000 provided last year and it does not enable a <Col N="2621" /> start to be made on the Maigue Scheme.</P>
    <P>I am sure this news will come as a bombshell to the hundreds of farmers who live along the River Maigue which flows not merely through a good agricultural region but through a considerable part of the Golden Vale which is regarded as the finest agricultural region in Western Europe. This scheme has met with a continuous series of mishaps.</P>
    <P>When the late Donogh O'Malley, God rest his soul, was in charge of the Board of Works he initiated a scheme of drainage for Limerick, starting with the Deale, proceeding to the Maigue and then to the Mulcaire.  The Deale scheme was completed and steps were taken to proceed with the Maigue scheme.  Unfortunately, objection was lodged and subsequently in the High Court and, on appeal, in the Supreme Court the scheme was found to infringe the rights of a certain party in Adare.  The result was the Board of Works had to amend the scheme.  A new scheme was introduced.  We were absolutely certain that the decks had been cleared and work would start on the Maigue.  Now the Parliamentary Secretary says that the provision this year will not enable a start to be made on the Maigue.  I want to know, and so does every farmer in the area, what has gone wrong.  When will the scheme start?  What has happened to the machinery that was there after the Deale had been completed?  Has it been transferred to the Boyne?  There are a few machines working.  The Parliamentary Secretary describes this as a very small scheme.  So many people's hopes and livelihoods are dependent on this major catchment being drained one would think the order of priority would naturally dictate that the agricultural potential of the catchment area would be taken into account.  The Maigue flows through the finest agricultural area in Western Europe, the Golden Vale.  I deplore the decision of the Board of Works and the Parliamentary Secretary and, indeed, the Government will have some explaining to do to the people in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Mulcaire, the <Col N="2622" /> Parliamentary Secretary said this is listed among the schemes for consideration and preparation.  He then went on to talk about a new concept. He talked about the application of cost benefit techniques to arterial drainage. A cost benefit analysis, he said, into the question of arterial drainage has been initiated by the Board of Works in co-operation with the Department of Finance.  This is the first time this has happened in my ten years in this House.  What the hell do the Board of Works and the Department of Finance know about the agricultural industry? There is no one in the Board of Works capable of assessing the productivity of the land in the area concerned.  The next thing we will hear is that the Board of Works and the Department of Finance, having set up a cost benefit analysis, Messrs.  McKinsey will be called in.  That will be the next step. That is the pattern nowadays.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of cost benefit analysis.  I have advocated it in respect of a certain State company.  I am a firm believer in assessing the social advantages of economic programmes and plans but, surely to goodness, common sense must dictate that, if an area of land which is subject to severe flooding is drained, the productivity of that land must inevitably increase substantially. Anyone with even an elementary knowledge of agriculture or farming knows that.  It is common sense.  It is even more commonsensical when one takes into account the area through which the Maigue runs, starting at Kilfinnan and running right down through Kilmallock to Limerick city, with the Morning Star and Groody tributaries.  Surely this scheme, if completed, must increase to an enormous degree the productivity of the land.  I cannot see where a cost benefit analysis comes in here.  It is a mad idea.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute have carried out certain studies into this. Studies have also been done in other countries.  It is not the Board of Works or the Department of Finance who should be carrying out these studies. This is an exercise much more suited to the Agricultural Institute because they have both the expertise and the <Col N="2623" /> know-how essential to assess the benefits from arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>Some 18 months ago the Parliamentary Secretary very kindly received a deputation of the landowners along the Mulcaire.  This river is on the Limerick/Tipperary border.  Deputy Smith will know all about it.  The Parliamentary Secretary was most courteous.  He listened attentively. Before that deputation came to see him a cost benefit analysis had been carried out by a group representing the Mulcaire catchment area.  They produced for the Parliamentary Secretary facts and figures which showed the losses they were incurring along the catchment area through which the river flows, losses in productivity, losses because lands flooded were infested with fluke and other animal diseases.  Their facts were backed up by a veterinary surgeon who had expert knowledge of 15 years work in this region.  He gave details about the benefits which would accrue from the drainage of the Mulcaire catchment area. In his introductory statement the Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>With a view to reaching a conclusion on such matters the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Office of Public Works, has put in hands a full cost benefit study of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary comes to reply I want him to answer certain questions.  Where is this study being carried out?  By whom?  Who are the people carrying it out?  What are their qualifications?  What experience have they of the agricultural industry? What are they hoping to prove as a result of this particular exercise?  I challenge the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works to send these gentlemen down to the river Mulcaire catchment area or to the Maigue catchment area and I defy them to produce results which will not show the advisability and the advantages of proceeding with the drainage of these catchment areas.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary then went on to talk about the objectives of arterial drainage.  He asked whether <Col N="2624" /> drainage schemes were intended primarily to relieve flooding of land or to alleviate the problems of those living in areas subject to flooding.  To me, this is simply outrageous casuistry.  I have never heard anything so outrageous in any ministerial or Parliamentary Secretary's brief in this House. I understood that the purpose of arterial drainage was so obvious that there was no need to couch it in terminology of this particular nature.  What that kind of language will mean to the hundreds of farmers in Limerick when they hear that it is not proposed to proceed with the schemes I do not know. God alone knows what will happen about the Mulcaire scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the board has been operating to a brief 30 years old and it may well have to reassess the objectives of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>The whole question of arterial drainage is closely allied to agricultural production and the social and economic problems of rural Ireland. As well as being the concern of the Board of Works it is also the concern of the Department of Lands and the responsibility of certain local authorities. I had thought the whole question of arterial drainage within the context of agricultural and rural development would have been looked into and responsibility for it might very logically and, perhaps, with considerable benefit be assigned to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I will not be surprised if next week the Parliamentary Secretary announces that Messrs McKinsey are coming in to assess this assessment of the cost benefit analysis.  I cannot be blamed for suspecting that this cost benefit analysis is a delaying tactic and is being used by the Government as an excuse because they do not have enough money to carry out the drainage.  The Board of Works, the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries all know the benefits to be derived from arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that work on the River Groody, which is a small river just outside Limerick city, is proceeding. The Parliamentary Secretary has said <Col N="2625" /> this is a relatively small scheme but even so I am sure it will provide a very good subject for any examination which may be carried out into the benefits of arterial drainage.  This Estimate is normally a non-controversial one but I make no apologies for having expressed my views so strongly about the whole question of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>The Board of Works is co-operating with the Department of Transport and Power in relation to canals and the river Shannon navigation.  As one who is interested in transport particularly in relation to the tourist industry, I think it is true to say that the development potentials of our canals and inland waterways as tourist attractions cannot be over-emphasised.  I believe there is colossal potential on the river Shannon, on the canals and on other inland waterways particularly in the light of the attractiveness of this country to foreign visitors.  Natural amenities such as rivers, lakes and canals should be a source of enjoyment to our own people and a valuable tourist attraction.  The same can be said about our national monuments, parks and other examples of our heritage.  These national monuments and national landmarks can be used effectively.  They should be developed in a responsible manner so as to be a source of pleasure and enjoyment to our people as well as serving as a constant reminder of our great heritage.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the work done by the Board of Works in this respect I should like to pay tribute to a voluntary organisation called An Taisce which have done a tremendous amount in focusing attention on the need to preserve antiquities of various kinds.  I am not familiar with the national operation of An Taisce but I am very familiar with the small group of dedicated people in Limerick and the tremendous work they have done excavating and cleaning up outstanding historical landmarks contained in what are internationally known as the Walls of Limerick.  They have focused attention on the vast amount of antiquities and history contained in places like Lough Gur adjacent to Limerick city. An Taisce and organisations like it <Col N="2626" /> should be given every encouragement.</P>
    <P>While I am conscious of the way our historical monuments, national parks, waterways and canals can make a valuable contribution to the development of our tourist industry the real value of preserving our ancient monuments and historical landmarks is that they serve as a reminder to younger generations of our vast cultural and historical heritage. This type of work must be encouraged and continued.</P>
    <P>The outstanding example of such a development is what are known as the castle tours which have been developed by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  While certain people scoff at Bunratty and look upon it as a mere tourist gimmick, with the reconstruction and renovation of the castle into its present state and shape, apart from being an attraction to tourists, it is also a most interesting place to visit, and I am glad to know that more and more schools are availing of the opportunity to take senior pupils particularly to these castles, not for the purpose of indulging in mediaeval banquets and imbibing the very potent liquor down there, mead, but of giving a practical lesson on history.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to see that at long last the problem of providing a decent Garda barrack in Limerick city is being overcome.  This has been a source of continuous annoyance and difficulty. I am very gratified to find that it has now been possible to secure a suitable site on which to provide the muchneeded Garda headquarters in the city of Limerick and I hope there will be no delay in the construction of this building.  It almost shames me to talk about the building which has had to serve as Garda headquarters in a city the size of Limerick.  I hope that all the stops will be pulled out and that the building programme will proceed as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass) Noel T. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooney pointed out that he raised matters some 18 months ago and Deputy Tunney told us that it was not a good idea to debate an Estimate of £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 when most <Col N="2627" /> of the money had, in fact, been spent. That leads me to recall that the debate on this Estimate last year went on for a period of many months, and while it is not for me to make decisions on these matters, I think every Deputy and every member of the Government would like to see the Estimates dealt with more expeditiously.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the matters raised under various heads rather than in the order in which they came up, but as the last speaker referred to Bunratty Castle, I happen to have here a report from An Taisce to the Government. I cannot reveal the full contents as it is not a published report yet, but it says:</P>
      <P>in relation to the eight museums who specialise in folk material, the most ambitious and at the same time the most successful of these is the folk park at Bunratty.</P>
      <P>I should like to agree with Deputy O'Donnell and An Taisce that this has indeed been a great success.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with some marine questions.  Deputy Kenny led the Fine Gael contribution and one of the questions he asked was in regard to Roonagh Point in County Mayo and Clare Island, County Mayo.  He quoted the figure of £40,000 being allocated, but, in fact, a proposal for the extension of Roonagh pier was sanctioned, the cost being about £50,000. Plans and specifications were prepared and are with Mayo County Council for some time for consideration, and when Mayo County Council come back to the office of Public Works, I hope there will be no delay as a result of what we hear from them, but it may be that the plans will require alternation and some more work may be necessary; but at this particular point of time the proposals for the extension of that pier are with Mayo County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal to improve the landing facilities on Clare Island has also been sanctioned.  These works consist of an extension and raising of the deck level of the existing pier, extension landward and realignment of the paved area adjacent to the breakwater, realignment on one side of the boat slip and provision of a crane.  It is proposed to proceed <Col N="2628" /> with this scheme and provision has been made therefor in the Estimates for 1972-73 and it is expected to invite tenders very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny was concerned with a rather broad area around his constituency, the Erris peninsula from Ballycastle to Broadhaven Bay and down the Achill area.  There are many proposals for marine works in this area and I think the most important of these is in Ballyglass, for which proposals estimated at £250,000 are being considered at this time by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. When I mention a sum of £250,000, Deputies will realise that we are thinking of a major development in this area, and, as you would point out, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the final policy decision is one for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, but I think it is only right that I should put on record the works which we plan to carry out.  While this is not the very final decision, I would say that it will be very close to the works which will be carried out in due course.</P>
    <P>First, it is proposed to erect a pier to accommodate boats, two abreast, drawing 7½ feet of water; secondly, it is proposed to erect a storm wall; thirdly, we are concerned with the provision of an approach; and then, if feasible, the provision of lighting.  We found in the various other harbour works we have undertaken over the years that the provision of lighting has been a tremendous help to the fishermen because they are not then confined by the time of day or the conditions of light as to when they can come in and go out and they have greater availability of the high tides. A scheme has been sanctioned for works at Reenroe, estimated to cost £18,000 and it is hoped to commence work on this in the spring of 1972.</P>
    <P>Other proposals in this area, which I am sure Deputy Kenny will be glad to hear are being investigated, are new schemes at Frenchport and Blacksod, improvements at Belderrig and Doonea and Coolabinneas, Achill Island.  At Porturlin, a scheme of works estimated to cost £19,000 is in hand since July, 1971, and this scheme consists of dredging the approach <Col N="2629" /> channel and pool, the raising of the storm wall, repairs to the old sea wall, removing pieces of concrete from the sea bed, rebuilding part of the old CDB pier, and the provision of lights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny was concerned particularly with this question.  He said that people were willing to earn a living from the sea and that provided the necessary facilities were available, this type of activity would enhance greatly the prospect of an area.  I have pointed out already that policy as to where the particular facilities are provided is not a matter for my Department, but I would like to make it clear that my Department have surveyed all the areas concerned and have made recommendations to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  That Department are now considering these recommendations and I have no doubt there will be no excessive delay in reaching policy decisions on this matter.  Development of the five major harbour centres decided on by the Government is continuing and the experience of the Office of Public Works is that as quickly as we can provide facilities the fishing fleet expand faster than we ever anticipated, so that we find it necessary to consider further expansion as soon as a scheme is completed.  That trend is encouraging and, regardless of what exchanges we have had in the House during the week concerning the negotiations in relation to the inshore fishery problem in the context of the Common Market, statistics prove that the activities of the Office of Public Works, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, have resulted in this industry growing to a much greater importance than what it was when the negotiations were first entered into.</P>
    <P>Ours being an island country, it is only natural that most Irish people would have a love for the sea.  It is clear now that a good living can be made from the sea by those who wish to earn their living in this way.  The inborn skills which the Irish have in this respect go back probably to the time of the great <i>voyageur</i>, Saint Brendan.</P>

      <P>I understand he built a monastery in America and he hardly would have reached there if he had not been able to fish.  I have no wish to play down anything that was said here last night by Deputy Kenny who spoke at considerable length.  Obviously, he put a great deal of work into the preparation of his contribution and we have not had very much time to prepare a reply.  However, I would like to deal with the various matters he mentioned.  At the outset Deputy Kenny complained that the practice of handing out copies of a speech only after the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary concerned had stood up to read the speech made it difficult for the speaker who was to follow.  I do not know who was responsible for this particular rule but I am certain that it is not the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is responsible for it.  Perhaps it would be a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I have not been able to trace the origin of the practice but I understand that in earlier days no copies of a Minister's speech were circulated and that the practice of circulating them was adopted for the purpose of facilitating Deputies.  So far as I am concerned personally I would endeavour to facilitate Deputies in any way I could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not recall that the present Minister for Health in his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Transport and Power used to circulate a document giving the main points of the activities of his Departments during the year.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can recall, the Office of Public Works have on occasions in the past given a run down of their proposed activities in advance of the Estimates being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have prepared a history of the Office of Public Works and some time I hope to have an opportunity of using it.  I have researched the Department back to their inception. There was a time when the Office of Public Works employed one out of every seven people in the country. However, we will consider the suggestion with a view to giving Deputies a breakdown on our activities at a date earlier than that on which the Estimate is introduced.  Deputy Corish will appreciate that one can never be sure as to when an Estimate will be taken. This week, for instance, some Bills were dealt with in the House which I am sure Deputies would have expected to have been dealt with at much greater length.  Therefore, if I released a copy of my speech, say, this week, there would be the possibility of my not getting in to introduce the Estimate for a further couple of weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not.  I have been advised now that what has been given out in the past is a list in relation to subhead E which is the biggest subhead in our Estimate and relates to new works, alterations and additions including furniture, for new buildings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall revert to that practice next year.  This might facilitate Deputies by informing them of where there are changes in expenditure, and, consequently, would help to improve the contributions.  So far as I am concerned the more criticism and advice that I can get in the House the better.  I listen to everybody and I try <Col N="2632" /> to shape the policies of the Office of Public Works in a way that will reflect the wishes of the people.  By and large I think that I have made a reasonable interpretation of the people's wishes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny inquired about Portacloy. Here, unfortunately, it is impossible to design a scheme to climinate ground swell entirely.  Some swell might be eliminated by the provision of a breakwater across the entrance to the bay but this would be very expensive. When the scheme for Portacloy was being designed several meetings were held with local fishermen.  The final scheme was agreed with them before commencement.  Subsequently, the scheme was expanded during the progress of the work at the request of the fishermen and in consultation with them.  Consultations with fishermen are invariably held but it has often been found that, while schemes have been agreed on with fishermen before commencement, they have later changed their minds and have requested alterations or additions to the schemes.  I assure Deputy Kenny that it is not just the engineers and the experts of the Office of Public Works who decide where the pier, landing place or breakwater should be situated.  He seemed to suggest that the local fishermen, who knew every current, every drift and every swell, would be better able to decide where these things should go.  I assure the Deputy that all the activities carried out under the heading of marine works are done in consultation with the local fishery interests.  He quoted from the fishermen's journal and I shall not enter into any dispute on that but it is a little unfair to say that the marine engineers employed by the Office of Public Works do not consult local interests, that they built a pier costing £20,000 of taxpayers' money and that it is now no use.  It is just not done.  The kernel of policy is that, before any work is done, any technical advice we can give to the fishermen is given and any advice they can give us is listened to.  We try as far as possible to meet the wishes of these people and to see that the most satisfactory scheme is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully dealt with major harbours <Col N="2633" /> as distinct from fishery harbours. He was most concerned about Drogheda harbour and he asked what has happened to the proposed development scheme.  This is a concern of the Department of Transport and Power. The Drogheda Harbour Commissioners are carrying out an improvement programme with the aid of a grant from the Department of Transport and Power and the Office of Public Works are at times called upon, but only in a consultative way.  I do not know whether the Estimate for Transport and Power has yet been taken, but if Deputy Tully wishes to pursue the matter further that is where it should be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some information about our activities at Cleggan harbour, County Galway.  The works recommended by the County Galway survey team and being carried out are (1)  removing the silt from within the harbour; (2)  providing a new crane for handling the boom; (3) lengthening and cleaning the inner slip; and (4) providing a winch on the slip.  The estimated cost of this is £11,000 and the county council will contribute 25 per cent.  Repairs estimated at £4,000 are also being carried out on the pier on behalf of the county council and the cost will be repaid by the council.  The works are in hand and will be completed before 31st March, 1972.</P>
    <P>In relation to Roundstone, County Galway, the works recommended by the survey team are widening and repairing the slip and are estimated at £3,000.  The county council will contribute 25 per cent.  All preliminaries have been completed but the work cannot start until a foreman is available. The two foremen in County Galway are engaged at Cleggan and Shruffaun.  These are both jobs sponsored by Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Efforts are being made to recruit another foreman and if these are successful Roundstone can be started this year.  The only other one in this particular series is Emlaghmore.  The work recommended by the survey team consists of facing the quay and raising the level above the main high-water spring tide.  The cost is estimated at £6,000 and the county council again are contributing <Col N="2634" /> 25 per cent.  The position in this case is similar to that of Roundstone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny, in relation to coast protection, raised a question about Carramore.  He suggested that the protection wall at the pier was too low and as a result ten acres of land and three houses are flooded by the sea.  He asked that something should be done about this under the Coast Protection Act, 1963.  In the case of all matters that come under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, it is in the first instance a matter for the local authority to submit proposals. If Deputy Kenny will arrange for the local authority to submit proposals in respect of Carramore, when this is done they will be considered under the provisions of the Coast Protection Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully, under a similar heading, asked whether the Office of Public Works could provide the necessary money to make good damage to a wall in County Meath which is being damaged by an under tow.  Again the Meath County Council should examine this proposal to see whether it is a case for action under the Coast Protection Act, 1963.  If so, they can refer their proposals to the Commissioners of Public Works and I promise they will be considered in conjunction with several other proposals we have already received.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully and other Deputies were concerned about the Government's policy of decentralisation. Referring to the provision made this year under Subhead E, they said that it looked as if this was only a gimmick and that it would never happen and they asked why not admit this.  Deputy Kenny, I think, was a little bit more astute when he quoted an article from a Sunday newspaper.  All I am entitled to say is that decentralisation of Government offices, while not a matter for me, is very far from dead.  Indeed, I would expect some positive developments in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There were a number of questions asked about drainage, particularly by Deputy O'Donnell.  I think I would be unfair to the House if I said anything more than what I said in my original contribution, that is, that the question <Col N="2635" /> of drainage is under review; that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Office of Public Works, has put in hands a full cost benefit study of arterial drainage as administered at present; that the Office of Public Works is working under a system that has been in operation now for 30 years and it is time to have a new look at the entire matter.  But, I should like to assure Deputy O'Donnell, without going into any of the specific rivers which he mentioned or, indeed, any of the others mentioned during the debate, that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and An Foras Talúntais are on a committee collaborating with a team doing the cost benefit analysis. If I had been misleading in my original address, it is the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works, An Foras Talúntais and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries that are carrying out this survey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, the Department of Agriculture, surely, is the final authority on the advantages of draining land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This will ultimately be a matter for Government decision, priorities and so on.  In some countries in the European Economic Community arterial drainage is done in a slightly different way.  Their criteria as to the justification for it are based mainly on social considerations rather than on economic returns and there could be an argument made, for instance, that in parts of the West of Ireland, in particular, in the Gaeltacht areas, where there are steep mountains, most of the tillage land would be along the banks of the river and the rest of the land is fit only for grazing cattle or sheep.  While under the present system of costing this might be found to be uneconomic to drain. socially it might be more desirable.  I announced the introduction of this analysis last year.  It is now under way. <Col N="2636" /> It will take some time.  You cannot just carry out a proper cost benefit survey in 12 months.  I am afraid that until such time as it has been produced, it would not be right for me to anticipate how the Government will view the matter in relation to next year's Estimate.  We have made some recommendations to them but the full survey is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to the European Economic Community and the question as to where the best social benefit or economic benefit might lie must be brought out and shown clearly.  The present policy is to do the biggest and the most economic scheme. whereas it might be more desirable to do smaller and less economic schemes for their social content.  If there is to be a change in policy, the cost benefit analysis must be carried out so that it may be understood what is going on and the reasons for the Government decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in favour of cost benefit analysis but the point I made was that I did not see the need for it in respect of a project like arterial drainage, the advantages of which agriculturally are so obvious. That is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what I hope we are going to prove.  As the Deputy well knows, the percentage of the Capital Budget allowed for arterial drainage has been diminishing consistently over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It may serve a useful purpose in that it would spell out the actual advantages that we have taken for granted.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The original inspiration for my suggesting this was that the percentage of the Capital Budget allowed for arterial drainage has been diminishing, not all that much in money but in relation to national spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputy Tully that there is no question of trying to save money on maintenance.  So long as there is useful work to be done the men will be kept on.  I have got <Col N="2637" /> two answers here because I know Deputy Tully has a specific question down about this for next week and if he were here I would know whether I should leave it over until then or not. I will just explain the position in this way: In relation to the Glyde and Dee drainage scheme, in which he was most particularly interested, the position is that the most effective period for maintenance work on drainage schemes is from early June to November.  This year men were taken on on the Glyde and Dee scheme when conditions were suitable, at the beginning of June, and will be let go during the present month because the work is finished.  There is no question of their being laid off to counter wage increases.  In any event, money spent on maintenance is recoverable entirely from the county council.  Any lay-off on maintenance is because no useful work can be done. It does not cost the Office of Public Works one penny to carry them out.</P>
    <P>Also, Deputy Tully suggested that the Commissioners of Public Works were very cute or were being a little oversmart in making a provision in the 1945 Drainage Act whereby if a well dried up after a drainage project they were not legally responsible.  In relation to the drying up of wells, there was a Common Law decision&mdash; it has nothing to do with the Act&mdash; which excludes the Office of Public Works from any liability whatsoever once these wells come from underground channels that have not been mapped.  However, I should like to give this undertaking to the House: the Commissioners will view individual complaints sympathetically.  This has not been done in the past but this will be done from now on and I think in relation to some wells Deputy Tully was complaining about in the current year he cannot complain that he was not sympathetically treated.</P>
    <P>While I have dealt with drainage in an overall way, I should like to say one word about the Boyne.  The most scenic area of the Boyne Valley is not being drained at all, with the consent of the farmers.  I would say that in relation to all arterial drainage schemes undertaken, more attention is being paid to conservation in relation to the Boyne and in particular in relation <Col N="2638" /> to the disposal of spoil.  I have been in that area and I have not seen what Deputy Tully was complaining about, but I think it is being very well done and I should like to compliment the engineers and officers in charge of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There were one or two things that Deputy Tully said yesterday that really concerned me deeply.  One of them I knew about and one of them I did not believe and I cannot answer now adequately. He complains about the failure of the Office of Public Works to reply to letters written by him as a trade union official.  I am not sure what letters the Deputy is referring to and if he will supply me with the details I will have the matter looked into and see that replies are issued without further delay.</P>
    <P>The other matter which concerned me deeply was&mdash;I am sorry the Deputy is not in the House but, no doubt, word will get back to him of what I am now about to say&mdash;Deputy Tully accused the Office of Public Works of committing a grave injustice towards a former employee who, he alleges, was dismissed on very flimsy grounds.  I offered to discuss this case with the Deputy during the past week but a mutually convenient opportunity did not arise.</P>
    <P>To be quite honest, I am astonished that he should have stood up in this House and made such sweeping allegations without first paying me the courtesy of listening to the other side.  The truth is that Deputy Tully is not in possession of the full facts of the case. I think he performed a disservice to the man whose cause he is championing by raising this matter publicly in this way.  I do not intend to follow his example by going into any great detail.</P>
    <P>Suffice it to say that I am fully satisfied that this man was dismissed for good and proper reasons.  If anything, the Office of Public Works leaned too far in the direction of leniency by offering to employ him in another capacity and by offering him the option to resign rather than be dismissed.  I invite Deputy Tully, if he so wishes, to discuss this case with me fully and privately and I will explain all the <Col N="2639" /> reasons why this disciplinary action was taken.  I have the file here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell him.  That is not his form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quite surprised myself.  I think I have said enough. We would only do this man and his family a disservice by discussing it further.  In view of the various representations made to me he is probably identifiable to many Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully was also concerned about income tax deductions.  The Commissioners of Public Works deduct tax in accordance with instructions received from the Revenue Commissioners. Based on previous experience, they make deductions even before they hear from Revenue in an effort to spread out the burden as much as possible.  It can happen occasionally that, when a man's circumstances have changed and his actual liability becomes known, a fairly big sum can remain to be deducted within a specified period.  I think this is what the Deputy was worried about.</P>
      <P>The problem in general is being examined to see if anything can be done about it, but a simple solution rests with the employees who are usually aware of all the relevant circumstances, that is, to ask to have increased amounts deducted from their pay each week in anticipation of a quarterly assessment.  What that boils down to is that if an employee requests that an arrangement be made for an evenly spread out sum to be taken from his wages, that will be done.  It is the employee who does not make that request who occasionally finds himself in the situation about which Deputy Tully was concerned.  I am glad to say it does not happen too often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney and Deputy Cooney were concerned about Trim Castle and what it is intended to do about it.  In Trim Castle a limited archaelogical excavation is in progress to supplement our information on the history of the site.  Conservation works to protect the monument are in progress and will be continued.  We do not own Trim castle. We are the guarantors only.  I intervened <Col N="2640" /> in the debate to say that some work has started at Trim Castle.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy Tunney very sincerely, not for his kind remarks about me, but for his kind remarks about the Office of Public Works employees in the Phoenix Park. I made a note of the points he raised about speed limits and I noted with great interest his suggestion that the horse owners using the Park might be assessed for some sort of compensation for the damage done to the turf by horses.  Each year on this Estimate I have listened to the different ideas and suggestions from Deputies and I have had them examined individually. I have come to the conclusion that a proper assessment of the Park and its amenities and facilities, and how we can retain its character so that people can go there and relax in safety, should be undertaken.  Anybody who knows the job the students did for us in Kilkenny in the national park area survey knows that we will get a good report and a good job from them. Then we can decide on proper park management and we can ensure that this amenity is developed in a way that will best suit the needs of people of the capital city and also visitors from around the country and from abroad.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by some Deputies that what we said about the proposed golf course sounded as if we were taking a step backwards.  That is far from being true.  The biggest difficulty was overcome with the very fine co-operation of the Gaelic Athletic Association and the vocational education committee.  The vocational education committee had a site for the development of a large technical school in the region of what is known as The Ranch in Ballyfermot.  If we were to develop an 18-hole golf course in the Phoenix Park the Office of Public Works would have to acquire this site.  As it turned out, the vocational education committee felt that if they could locate their school nearer to the Islandbridge end of the Phoenix Park extension they could cater not only for students from Ballyfermot but also for students from Walkinstown, Drimnagh and Crumlin.</P>
    <P>There is also a fully developed <Col N="2641" /> Gaelic athletic pitch on the site which they now occupy and which they have agreed to service and use in co-operation with the Civil Service Gaelic club. I should like to compliment these people on their co-operation.  Many lettings have had to be terminated and although I have not written this to them formally yet&mdash;they may have changed their name but I know them; they were one of the first deputations I ever received back in 1955; the Inchicore Plotholders Association&mdash;I regret that it does not seem likely that we will be able to extend their tenancies. They are hard-working men and they certainly work these plots to a magnificent degree.  I am looking into the possibility of finding somewhere else where they can carry out this activity but, unfortunately, I cannot say that I am very optimistic about it.  Every Deputy who knows Dublin well knows that land is at a premium.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny mentioned the need for guide books at national monuments. Deputy Cooney and other Deputies referred to this matter also. The need for providing guide books, photographs and so forth on the site of national monuments is appreciated, but the task of providing high quality, attractive brochures is a formidable one.  Proposals are under consideration to tackle this side of our activities in an organised way, but quick and spectacular results need not be expected. It is hoped to make up what I admit is a deficiency on the sites of our national monuments gradually and steadily.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny was concerned about our inland waterways.  He asked about the Ballyconnell Canal.  As requested by the Minister for Transport and Power, we have carried out a survey and furnished a report to him.  We have so far heard nothing from the Department.  The restoration of the canal is feasible and it would not be very costly.  With regard to the suggestion about extending the canal to Lough Erne and ultimately linking the Shannon with Belfast, there would be greater problems to solve because arterial drainage would be involved. We would be talking in terms of millions of pounds.  However, when the Ballyconnell Canal is restored, as I <Col N="2642" /> hope it will be, I think the natural evolution will be the eventual linking up of the canal with the Shannon.  The demand for this type of facility is increasing very fast.</P>
    <P>As far as cruiser traffic on the Shannon is concerned, our information is that the boat hirers had an excellent year despite the fact that it was not a good year for tourism generally.  Apart from other considerations, cruising relieves traffic on the roads.  Everyone will agree, I think, that this is an ideal form of recreation.  It has resulted in a marked improvement in the economy of remote and depressed areas.  I agree with the statement made by many speakers that the potential of our inland waterways as a tourist and recreational attraction cannot be overestimated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny was also concerned about Clonmacnoise.  A scheme is under consideration for the provision of proper amenities.  The Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and the county councils are co-operating in this.  The county council are acquiring a site and the Office of Public Works will design a scheme for the provision of the facilities required.  The matter is in hand and we hope the scheme will be executed expeditiously.</P>
    <P>At Question Time some time ago Deputy Kenny and I had an exchange about the level of Lough Ree.  I hope now to put the record straight because Deputy Kenny was not satisfied with what I had to say to him in that particular exchange.  Statutory control with regard to the level of the lake rests with the Electricity Supply Board. The Minister for Transport and Power is responsible for the Electricity Supply Board.  He is also responsible for Bord Fáilte.  Naturally, he must weigh the views of both these bodies in the balance.  Our interest is to maintain the level in the interests of the navigator and we intend to press our interest.  We will back up every complaint about navigational difficulties caused by the mooring stones at Athlone.  This is the situation with regard to the level of Lough Ree. Statutory control rests, as I said, with the ESB.  While we are in charge of <Col N="2643" /> navigation, they can at any time, without consultation, decide to lower the level of the lake.  A couple of years back they intended to do just that and would have done it were it not for the intervention of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney had something to say also about the bye-laws on the Shannon and he advocated consultation with interested parties before bye-laws are formally adopted.  We have invited observations from all interested parties.  The observations received will be fully considered and, where necessary, discussions will be initiated with the interested parties because bye-laws are required to protect the rights of the people rather than to cause restrictions on their employment.</P>
    <P>Interference with graves and vandalism generally is a very serious problem and I agree with Deputy Cooney that local vigilance is in the last analysis the best defence against unwarranted interference with our heritage.  It is proposed to improve many facets of our information service and the provision of the guidebooks to which I referred earlier will be a first step in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was concerned, too, about Athlone Castle.  I understand the idea is to establish a military museum there.  I am not aware that this project has been abandoned.  Neither do I know if it will be proceeded with.  We would be glad to know what the ideas of the local people are with regard to its future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was concerned about our archaeological survey.  What people do not appreciate here is the great difficulty we have in recruiting the requisite technical staff.  The team based outside Dublin has been reduced because one of our archaeologists resigned on marriage.  We cannot prevent women getting married but we hope to replace this officer as quickly as possible.  The work is progressing satisfactorily within the limits of our financial and technical resources.</P>
    <P>There were queries about some of our national schools.  Deputy Tully was concerned about the school at Duleek. Two prefabricated classrooms were erected there in the play space in front <Col N="2644" /> of the school.  This was considered the most suitable site for the location of these classrooms.  There was some difficulty about drainage.  Water was lodging against the dwarf wall on which the prefabs were built.  The erectors of the prefabs were then instructed to provide GT gulley traps and sumps to take away this water.  The electricity supply was connected on 28th March, 1971, and the electrical contractor received a complaint on 17th November, 1971, that the heaters were not working.  This complaint will be investigated on 22nd November.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the proposed new school at Killbeg, County Meath.  A grant was sanctioned by the Department of Education on 11th February, 1971.  Sketch plans have been prepared. The manager has been asked to obtain planning permission and he is in consultation with an architect from the Office of Public Works regarding the sinking of a well.  As soon as these matters have been satisfactorily dealt with the preparation of working drawings will be commenced.  The estimated cost is in the region of £18,000.</P>
    <P>The proposed new school for mildly mentally handicapped children at Ballina, County Mayo, is, I believe, the project closest to Deputy Kenny's heart.  A grant was sanctioned by the Department of Education on 21st October, 1971.  Outline planning permission has been obtained and preliminary drawings have been submitted by the manager's architects.  These will be examined and the architects will shortly be advised as to the necessary amendments so that working drawings may be prepared and tenders invited. The estimated cost will be in the region of £38,500 and the grant will be £34,650.</P>
    <P>Kilbride National School, County Meath, is of cross-wall construction. The nine-inch block cross-walls were erected in November, 1969, and the contractor was warned that it would be necessary to place the trussed purlins in position as soon as possible so as to brace the cross-walls.  The trussed purlins were not on the site at this time; they were being made in the builder's yard.  The walls were left without any bracing for a considerable <Col N="2645" /> time as a result of which, one stormy night, three of the cross-walls were blown down.  Progress on this project was very slow and the &ldquo;virtually complete&rdquo; certificate which we get from time to time has not yet been certified. The contract date was 31st July, 1969, and the date of completion was 3rd July, 1970.  The architect warned the contractor of the necessity to brace the unsupported cross-walls.  This is a problem but it is a matter we hope to sort out soon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny complained about the delay in paying subcontractors.  The payment of contractors by the Office of Public Works is made with as little delay as possible.  In a number of cases the contract is placed not by the Office of Public Works but by the school manager or by the main contractor who is locally responsible.  While there have been some complaints in the past about final payments the matter has been cleared up completely in the last year.  There should be no complaint now but if the Deputy is aware of any such complaints I should be pleased if he would let me know and naturally I shall have them looked into.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the £2,000 expenditure on Leinster House.  This sum resulted from the paying off of some final accounts which were not received in time to be paid last year.</P>
    <P>I agree that the entrance to Leinster House presents many problems especially on days like Budget Day when many people wish to come and view the activities of the House.  While this is not entirely a matter for the Office of Public Works we have looked into the matter.  We have come up against security problems and aesthetic problems. We have written to the Clerk of the Dáil and I quote part of that letter:</P>
    <P>We refer to your letter of 4 Samhain, 1970, about the possibility of improving the Waiting Room at the Kildare Street entrance to Leinster House, and to say that we accept your view that any attempt to enlarge the existing structure laterally might meet with objections.  These objections could be reinforced by the unbalancing effect on the appearance of the entrance, viewed either from the street or from Leinster House, <Col N="2646" /> if the other lodge were not also extended. In addition, it would be necessary to remove the existing large tree, an act which in itself might draw critical comment.</P>

      <P>We concluded by saying:</P>
      <P>Should you consider that a discussion of the problem generally with our Architect would be helpful we would be happy to arrange for his attendance.</P>
      <P>The Clerk of the Dáil has not invited us to send our architect to discuss this matter.  It is a matter largely for the Committee of Procedure and Privileges in consultation with the officers of the House, the senior officer being the Ceann Comhairle.  If people are worried about these complaints, I suggest that they pursue the matter in this way. We have communicated with the Clerk of the Dáil and at all times an architect from the Office of Public Works will be available.</P>
      <P>We have again the hardy annual, the temperature complaints.  The position is that the new office block is air-conditioned and this is controlled automatically to give conditions, namely, temperature and relative humidity, which are suitable to most people.  Unfortunately it is not possible to vary these conditions for individual rooms in the building and some people favour conditions different from those favoured by the majority.  The balance of Leinster House is heated by hot water radiators, some installed and in operation for many years, and some installed in recent years following structural alterations carried out when the new office block was completed. There is no temperature control or humidity control system provided in this part of the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be possible to fit thermostatic radiator valves to a number of radiators in this section of the building.  These would provide a measure of temperature control and would certainly help to prevent excessively high temperatures.  These <Col N="2647" /> would have to be fitted during the autumn heating season.</P>
      <P>The Dáil Chamber is heated by warmed air and is provided with extract fans to provide adequate fresh air.  This system is not controlled thermostatically, but is carefully watched during the sittings and suitably adjusted to prevent excessive temperatures during the heating season.  The Chamber can, however, become excessively hot during the summer months, generally for a few days only, because no cooling facilities are available.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the Deputy.  The Public Gallery in this House has accommodation for 132 people, and on occasions nearly as many people again can be accommodated, standing behind the seating. In normal conditions, entrance to and egress from the Gallery is via one wide double door at one end of the Gallery.  From this door visitors come or go by a staircase in the Press block which leads directly to the outside.  The double door to the Gallery which I have referred to has always been there, but the staircase which is of incombustible construction, is a new one, provided as part of the scheme of alterations and additions.  In addition to the normal exit, there had been an emergency exit in the centre of the Public Gallery.  This was removed under the alteration scheme and replaced by a new emergency exit in a more suitable position near the opposite end of the Gallery.  Although this exit has to be kept locked for security reasons, there is a key kept in a glass case beside the door for use in emergency. There is always an usher on duty in the gallery who is briefed on what to do in an emergency.  In addition, on specified occasions when big numbers are anticipated, such as on Budget day, a member of the fire picket is stationed beside this door with a spare key in the lock.</P>

      <Col N="2648" /> Deputy Tully complained that we had not made good the fire damage in Iveagh House.  The repairs of the fire damage are finished for at least three months, he will be glad to hear. He was anxious to know what new provisions were being made for Kildare Street.  The money for this is for a new roof in particular, the biggest part of the expenditure, fire precaution works and improved heating and lighting.  He also inquired about an office being built in Monaghan.  This office has been finished and is now occupied by the local employees of the Department of Education.  The new building in Drogheda to be built on the site of the old Custom House will provide accommodation for all Government staffs in the town, excluding, of course, the Garda and Posts and Telegraphs staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also referred to a plot adjoining the ball alley at Dunshaughlin Garda station, on part of which Meath County Council applied many years ago for the erection of a fire station.  The request had to be refused by the Office of Public Works because the Department of Justice considered that the entire site should be reserved for Garda purposes.  The county council have not re-opened the matter since, but if they wish to do so, the Office of Public Works will be quite prepared to ask the Department of Justice to reconsider the position.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered nearly all the main matters raised, but if I have overlooked something, I shall be only too happy to answer Deputies personally, if they make inquiry.  I hope I have dealt with most of the points raised and I commend the Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>I did not hear all the reply and the Parliamentary Secretary may have dealt with it, but there was a reference to the President Kennedy memorial.  Was the Parliamentary Secretary referring to the Kennedy concert hall?</P>
