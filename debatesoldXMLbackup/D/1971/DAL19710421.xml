      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state, with particular reference to paragraph 3.12 of the Report of Committee on Review of State Expenditure in relation to Agriculture, if studies of low income families in Ireland are currently being made or have been recently completed under the auspices of any Department of State; and, if so, if and when they will be published.</P>

      <P>The Western Regional Office of the Department <Col N="202" /> of Agriculture and Fisheries has recently completed a study of the low income problem in farming in the West of Ireland and its report is at present under consideration by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. No decision has yet been taken as to publication of this report.</P>
      <P>Certain information on low income families, in urban areas only, was collected, <i>inter alia,</i> in the Household Budget Inquiry undertaken by the Central Statistics Office during 1965-66. The available information is published in <i>Household Budget Inquiry, 1965-66,</i> published by the Stationery Office in August, 1969.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether, following his visit to Norway, he has reached agreement with the Norwegian Government on joint action to safeguard the livelihood of Irish fishermen and to guarantee the future progress of Irish fishery interests within the framework of the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>During my visit to Norway, which was at the official invitation of the Foreign Minister, I had discussions with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and other members of the Norwegian Government.  These discussions covered matters relating to the applications of both our countries for membership of the European Communities and other international questions of common interest to the two countries.  As regards the European Communities, I reviewed with the Norwegian Ministers the progress of the negotiations to date and the prospects for the coming months.  We discussed those matters of common concern to both Ireland and Norway which have arisen in the negotiations, notably the Community's Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
      <P>The Norwegian Minister confirmed to me that, as in the case of this country, the implementation of the provision on common access to fishery waters which is embodied in the Fisheries Policy would give rise to serious problems for Norwegian fisheries.  The Norwegian Delegation has emphasised to the Community, as we have done, the major importance of this matter, and, like us, intends to pursue it in the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was agreed in the discussions that <Col N="204" /> Ireland and Norway would maintain close contact during the negotiations on the question of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state if either the Irish Government or the Norwegian Government, who I take it are negotiating together on this problem, received any satisfaction whatsoever from the EEC? May I point out to the Minister, to clarify the position, that I gather that the Norwegian Government had originally protested against a joint fisheries policy being created in the EEC without their being consulted, and they were refused consultation.  Does the same position apply to us?  Have we been refused consultation as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I protested on behalf of Ireland immediately on the introduction of the common fisheries policy. This does not seem to have reached the Opposition benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a matter for protest because the introduction of the common fisheries policy came at a time when the applicant countries, who are more concerned with fisheries than the present member States are, were negotiating for the enlargement of the Community.  The introduction of the common fisheries policy was in the context of the acceptance by the applicant countries of the decisions made arising out of the Treaty of Rome.  The four applicant countries seemed to be held to abide by this regulation which is not at all suitable to us or to the <Col N="205" /> Norwegians.  So I protested and the Norwegians protested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that my discussion on this with the Community took place in the morning and that of the Norwegians took place in the afternoon, so I was ahead of them.  If the Deputy wants the facts those are the facts, but if he wants to joke I will go along with him. Arising out of our protest and the Norwegian protest and the others, it was decided that the officials of the Community and the officials of the different delegations would examine on a technical level the implications of the application of the regulation if we become members.  This has been done but, having done this, I am still not satisfied.  I am certain that this regulation does not suit us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position.  In relation to what Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde said about joint negotiations may I say that there are four separate negotiations on the Treaty, so there are no joint activities between any two applicant countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister possibly reconcile his statement to the House this afternoon with the glowing rosy prospect suggested by Deputy Fahey, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who assured us last week that there were no problems and that Ireland's fishing industry had a glorious future?  To help us in this matter perhaps the Minister would circulate to the Members of this House the memorandum which he gave to the Commission in furtherance of his protest so that we will know the truth of the situation as it exists today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the speech made by Deputy Fahey, he made a speech outlining the effects of two regulations, one of which affects common access and which is certainly not to our benefit but operates in the other direction.  Other regulations of the Community provide for marketing help and marketing arrangements which will be of benefit to us so far as the fisheries section is concerned, <Col N="207" /> and also for aids for the structural development of fishery fleets which we could use.  I do not think it was intended to suggest that everything in the garden was lovely because in Brussels we have repeatedly said that this regulation on common access does not suit us.</P>

If the Minister can give me any written proof whatsoever to the effect that such proceedings were instituted.  I shall accept his word for it but I have been unable to get any such proof from the Land Commission, the reason being that the three commissioners are all Fianna Fáil.

This, conceivably, could give rise to sharp practice in various forms.  It would be difficult to work out a satisfactory solution to the problem but, at the same time, a satisfactory solution should be sought because this is one of the areas in which group farming could be really effective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in my replies to questions on this subject on 24th and 31st March, I am aware of certain financial aids, related to conversion of heating systems to natural gas, being given by the Dutch Government to glasshouse growers using fuel oil.  Our exports of tomatoes are primarily to the United Kingdom, and in particular to Northern Ireland, where Dutch tomatoes are subject to customs duties whereas ours have free access and we have an advantage in proximity to the market.  I see no reason to believe that our tomato exports will not continue to be fully competitive.  On the home market, also, Irish tomatoes are protected from competition from imports <Col N="222" /> during the annual season of homegrown supplies.  I have no funds at my disposal out of which I could pay a subsidy towards fuel costs in horticultural production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that it does not and I would ask him to have another look at the matter. Would he have particular regard to the fact that oil used in the glasshouse industry is a very important factor and a more important one in our cooler climate than it might be in some of the Mediterranean climates and because of our inability to get access to natural gas we have had this considerable additional cost and the horticultural industry is finding the greatest difficulty in absorbing, as it is at present required to absorb, an increase of between 20 and 30 per cent in fuel costs in one year?</P>

      <P>I am assured that the report issued by the Industrial Development Authority under the title <i>Review</i> 1952/70 <i>Annual Report</i> 1969/70 was certainly not intended to mislead as to the date of the establishment of the authority.  As successor to An Foras Tionscal, the IDA undertook responsibility for the publication of the annual report previously issued by An Foras Tionscal which gave details of the various grants given each year. The grants scheme came into operation in 1952 with the establishment in that year of An Foras Tionscal and I am informed that it was thought appropriate that the review should cover the period since then.  It is made clear in appendix 5 of the report which deals with the functions of the former authority of An Foras Tionscal that the authority was constituted under an Act of 1950.  I feel that this information might more appropriately have been included in the introduction and I have asked the IDA to keep this point in mind in the preparation of future reports.</P>

The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement does not provide for any reciprocal arrangement for the importation of high unit granular fertilisers.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether Dublin Corporation are owners of premises at the junction of Cuffe Street and St. Stephen's Green West; if so, if he will take action, or state what action private citizens may take, to oblige the corporation to put at least the exterior of the premises into a presentable condition; and if, having regard to the number of local authority owned derelict sites which are eyesores, he is satisfied with the adequacy of the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, to deal with the problem.</P>

Pending demolition, the care of the premises is a matter for the corporation and any complaints regarding the present appearance of the property should be addressed to that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the last part of the question, the Derelict Sites Act, 1961, is not <Col N="234" /> applicable to sites owned by the corporation. Some sites held by the corporation may remain undeveloped for a considerable time.  This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as delay in obtaining possession of all the property required to secure areas of convenient shape for redevelopment, the need to acquire additional property, or the need to determine the future street pattern for the areas concerned before redevelopment can be commenced.  It is a matter for the corporation to decide when redevelopment of any particular site should be undertaken and what steps may need to be taken in the meantime to keep it in a presentable condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  (1)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of Section 9 of the Principal Act, an employee shall be entitled to temminate his contract of employment in circumstances of uncertainty in which it is reasonable for the employee to anticipate dismissal for redundancy (whether or not he has received notice of dismissal or protective notice of dismissal or lay-off) if it is reasonable for the employee to expect that his remaining in the employment would seriously prejudice his prospects of obtaining suitable alternative employment which became available and was unlikely to remain vacant.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where, in the circumstances specified in this section the employee has received an offer in writing from the employer and on a reference to the Tribunal it appears to the Tribunal, having regard both to the reasons for which the employee seeks to leave the employment and those for which the employer requires him to continue in it, to be just and equitable that the employee should receive the whole or part of a redundancy payment, the Tribunal may determine that there shall be paid to the employee&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the whole of the redundancy payment to which the employee would have been so entitled, or</P>
      <P>(b)  such part of that redundancy payment as the Tribunal thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have put down this lengthy amendment to ensure that a worker anticipating with good reason that redundancy is pending&mdash;we are all aware that employers can very often create an air of uncertainty about this &mdash;should have the right to seek alternative <Col N="237" /> employment and still receive either in whole or in part redundancy payments.  At the present time if a person legitimately anticipating redundancy obtains alternative employment he automatically loses his redundancy benefits.</P>
    <P>Most labour and trade union spokesmen agree it was unfortunate that the 1967 Act did not include the provision contained in section 20 of the Northern Ireland Act.  Amendment No. 8 is, in fact, a rewrite of section 20 of that Act. In simple terms we want the worker who has sought alternative employment in anticipation of redundancy to have the right to apply to a tribunal for whole or part of the redundancy payment. The tribunal should investigate the case and determine whether or not such a payment should be made to the employee.  We feel that workers in the Republic should be afforded the same opportunities as workers in Northern Ireland are under section 20 of the Northern Ireland Act.  This would make the measure more flexible and it would give employers a greater incentive to be honest with workers and tell them what their prospects are.  It would also act as an incentive to workers anticipating redundancy to seek alternative employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1963 the Fine Gael party suggested companies should give more information about themselves to their employees.  A subsequent NIEC report came up with the same idea.  We wanted State companies to start doing this and we hoped they would act as an incentive to public companies to publish information about themselves.  I agree that certain secrets about the purchase of new premises and such like could not be published, but this amendment is a logical follow on to the original suggestion made by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many businesses employment can be very doubtful.  We have had the experience of people who had been working for 20 or 30 years suddenly finding themselves without a job.  The company gave no information to the workers.  As Deputy Desmond said, if management were prepared to give more information not alone would the workers have more security, perhaps, but they would also be more loyal to <Col N="238" /> their employers.  I can see some slight abuses.  Management might say that a company was going badly when that might not be the case at all.  The Minister could compromise.  Where redundancy has been declared and subsequently the employer wants to withdraw that declaration any employee who wishes should be allowed to move out and collect his redundancy payment. I support this amendment very strongly and I would be glad if the Minister could see his way to accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the suggestion that workers may find themselves in a position in which they feel their employment is being jeopardised and, because of that, they should be given an opportunity of moving into safer employment.  I could not visualise many situations arising in which there would not be all the co-operation desirable between workers and management, the kind of co-operation which would enable them to have the change carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  While having sympathy with the type of case that might possibly arise, one must weigh that against the possibility of what could happen on the other side. One must have regard for the situation from the point of view of management. If workers were given the opportunity of expressing the fear that things were not going too well they could use that argument legitimately at any time for claiming and getting redundancy payment.  One can visualise the chaos that could lead to in industry.  The remote likelihood that any cases might arise would not justify taking the overall risk of subjecting management to that kind of pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is in two sections and subsection (2) seems to ask that the redundancy appeals tribunal be empowered to make partial awards.  I would much prefer not to embark on a partial payments scheme.  Having regard to the many safeguards for the workers' position in the Bill as a whole, I think the amendment should be withdrawn. It would create anomalies.  If workers thought they could get better employment elsewhere they could <Col N="239" /> always argue that they had a feeling their job was not going well.  I am strongly opposed to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister puts up an Aunt Sally and then proceeds to knock it down himself.  The amendment says specifically that the decision will rest with the tribunal.  First of all, the Minister said the number of cases might be small and then he proceeded to argue that this provision would disrupt industry. If the second part of the amendment is accepted with the first part there can be no abuse because the tribunal will decide whether or not the claim is a legitimate one.  No employee will jeopardise himself by simply leaving a job if the case for redundancy is not strong enough.  He would be a fool to leave his job in those circumstances. If, however, he feels his job is going badly and he is likely to lose it, and another job comes up, surely he should be entitled to take that job and then appeal to the tribunal and get his redundancy pay.  Had this been in operation we would not have had the situation we had in the last six or eight months.  We would not have had the situation we had when Hibernian Transport closed down.  For a couple of weeks employees were being laid off in ones, twos and half-dozens.  Many of the workers told me they were offered jobs they could not take because, if they left, they would not get any redundancy pay.  The Minister is making a mountain out of a molehill. This is a very sensible amendment and it should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has taken me up wrongly.  The number of cases in which you would not have full co-operation on the part of the management would be few.  The number of cases in which workers would be victimised would be so small I cannot see the need for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendments were accepted and workers were given the right to leave jobs and claim redundancy there could be many cases of workers leaving jobs since they could always assert they left because they felt there was no security in the job.  This could lead to a good deal of shuffling in and out <Col N="240" /> of employment and that would not be desirable.  It would not be defensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point, but take the case of a company which manufactures for export and which does not have any export orders; they could lay employees off for a period.  Then they might get an order, re-employ these people and lay them off again.  It would be obvious the company was going downhill but nobody could put his finger on the date on which they would actually go broke. Surely the worker should be entitled in that case to make up his mind and get out into another job in which he could be useful.  The tendency now in new companies is to pick younger personnel and the older employees could find themselves thrown on the scrap heap.  This amendment may look as if it is hitting the employer but in actual fact it is not.  The worker will be given more information and the sooner a man is told there is no future in a job the better that will be.  There have been too many dead end jobs.  Where workers are laid off the remaining workers are under the constant threat of being laid off too.  There may be other jobs available elsewhere and they should have the opportunity of getting out at that stage if they want to.  Surely they should be entitled to redundancy payment.  Again, where an employer withdraws a redundancy notice, the worker is entitled to say that, if redundancy threatens once, it could also threaten again and it would be better to get out.  Whether or not the declaration is withdrawn the worker should be allowed to move out at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than prolonging the discussion on the amendment perhaps the Minister might consider it <Col N="241" /> on Report Stage?  He might have a look at the situation in Northern Ireland where I understand this particular section of the Northern Ireland Act has worked quite well.  In this regard I would refer to the case of Ballingarry.  Many of the workers there were well aware in recent months that things were getting more and more difficult, not necessarily that Mr. O'Brien had no money but they knew they would be declared redundant. Nevertheless, they did not leave that employment but waited for formal notification of redundancy.  If they had left of course they would have, in accordance with Mr. O'Brien's views, dismissed themselves.  This brings a degree of flexibility into the Bill which admittedly is rather difficult to administer in terms of case studies and precedents.  It does throw a great onus on the tribunal.  However, the Minister might have a look at it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have a look at it all right or indeed at any matter; but it is, I agree, impossible to cover all the contingencies one could foresee. In trying to cover them one must have regard to the employers' rights too. They cannot be completely disregarded. It would be a dangerous precedent to give workers the right to leave one job and go to another and claim redundancy.</P>

      <P>I can see the danger of an employee saying: &ldquo;I will leave now because this firm is going broke&rdquo; when it may not be&mdash;it may be short of finance or something&mdash;but surely the Minister could go some way in this? In other words, if redundancy was declared or a number of people had been let go because of redundancy, it should be open to a worker at that stage to decide that it was time to get out and try to get a job with a more progressive company or a company doing better.  You get a firm with bad management going down and the worker sees it but he cannot decide to join another firm.  I agree with the Minister that if there was more co-operation between management and worker a lot of this would be covered but there is not that co-operation to date.</P>

      <P>That is why there are so many industrial strikes and the State companies are not the greatest at it either.  If a worker is in a firm which is going down gradually he must stay with it until he is declared redundant. This is wrong.  I agree with the Minister that it is also wrong that an employee should decide, because there is a shortage of money in a particular firm, that he is about to become redundant. They are both wrong.  Surely in between the Minister could come up with something that would go half way to meet this amendment?  It could be that, if there is declared redundancy or if a number of people have been sacked <Col N="243" /> because of redundancy, from there on a worker is entitled to leave that firm and declare himself redundant.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 30, to insert &ldquo;or after&rdquo; after &ldquo;before&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>If the Minister could give us sufficinet reason for the omission of the words &ldquo;or after&rdquo; after &ldquo;before&rdquo; we would be only too willing to withdraw this amendment.  Section 5, line 30 reads:</P>
      <P>An employee of the previous owner accepts, before the termination of his contract of employment with the previous owner, ...</P>
      <P>We suggest it should read:</P>
      <P>An employee of the previous owner accepts, before or after the termination of his contract of employment with the previous owner, an offer by the new owner of employment in the same place of employment.</P>
      <P>I would fully accept the Minister's view that it might be six months or two years afterwards that he would get an offer of employment and that there should be some stipulation, say, before the termination of the contract or within two months after the termination of his employment that a new owner of employment should offer him the same terms as previously or not materially less advantageous.  I raise the point because there are cases which could certainly develop and we want to elicit the information from the Minister.  We will not push the matter too hard but we are rather puzzled as to why the words &ldquo;or after&rdquo; are not included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister not to make the period too short because it is quite usual for a firm to be taken over and a period of time to elapse.  Two months would be a reasonably short period unless it was sold as a going concern.  If it is sold as a going concern the difficulty does not arise.  It would be a pity to spoil the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar, which is what the Minister would do if he stipulated less than four weeks.  In effect, he would be treating it as if it were a going concern. I would ask the Minister to stretch it to two or three months.  I am sure that when he looks at it he will realise this very often happens.  The temptation at present is to close down and let somebody else carry the can and then to restart again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where an employee is or was employed by a sub-contractor who (under contract or otherwise) is liable to another person (in this section referred to as the principal) and that employee is subsequently <Col N="245" /> employed by the principal, the employee's continuity of employment shall have effect as if the sub-contractor and the principal were the same person.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Contract&rsquo; includes a contract or arrangement&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to carry out work or oper-tions of any kind,</P>
    <P>(b)  to be answerable for the carrying out of such operations by others, whether under subcontract to him or under other arrangements made, or to be made by him, or</P>
    <P>(c)  to furnish his own labour or the labour of others in the carrying out of such operations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is one about which we are rather adamant and which we wish to press very strongly.  Perhaps amendment No. 11 might be taken with it and we could discuss both together? Amendment No. 10 relates to the extension of section 5 to sub-contractors' employees not eligible for benefits on transfer taken on by the principal employer.  I do not want to draw analogies but if I were to employ Deputy Blaney to do a job in Donegal and if I transferred Deputy Blaney to Deputy Brennan, if Deputy Brennan were to pay Deputy Blaney for work done directly it could be held that there was a new contract of employment between them even though I was the principal employer.  Automatically, questions of length of employment with the subcontractor or contractor come into account.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be intrigued as to where we got amendment No. 10.  I can assure him it is one that Deputy Colley has dreamed up.  It is taken directly from the Finance Act and I can see no good reason why we should not ally the Finance Act with the Redundancy Payments Act in terms of sub-contractual arrangements.  I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister a number of cases in that regard.  One is the well-known, rather blatant case No. 37 of 1970, <i>Hehir versus Murphy</i>&mdash;Murphy being the Cork building contractor. Another is the case <i>Collins versus Murphy,</i> No. 101 of 1969&mdash;what <Col N="246" /> we call the take-over of employees where employers form a new company. I have in mind a particular employee who was told one day that his contract of employment was terminated, that the company had gone.  He was a lorry driver in one of the two cases I have referred to and the following morning he reported for work.  There was no change of foreman and he started off with a new employer because the employer had decided to liquidate the company and set up an entirely new operation.  Automatically he was not covered under the Act.  In relation to a number of instances known to us, we consider this was done rather blatantly.  Deputy Tully has reminded me now, quite correctly, that I am speaking both on amendments Nos. 10 and 11 in terms of the take-over of employees.  I am sure the Minister will understand the direct relationship here.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we suggest to the Minister that he should be sympathetically disposed towards amendment No. 10.  I think it is eminently fair and reasonable and worthy of his support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Deputy but there is one point about which I am not happy.  I am speaking now in regard to amendment No. 10.  Let us take as an example a painting contractor who is doing a job for a builder or even a builder if he is sub-contracting.  From the insurance point of view for a nominal rate he guarantees that the sub-contractors are insured and the insurance will cover him for that.  If one happens to be uninsured the workers can go right through and take it from the principal. I think the rate is 20 per cent against 100 per cent here.  In this instance something similar could happen except that it is for redundancy payments. Again, let us take the example of a painting contractor employing ten men. He works for a builder and goes broke. The builder will have to finish his contract in a certain time and the men concerned continue working for him. It may mean that it will take only three weeks to finish the job and in this regard the builder could be stuck and under pressure.  In the long run if the builder had to do this very frequently he would not last very long.  He might <Col N="247" /> well have a considerable number of redundancies piling up.  I see a loophole here.  Otherwise, I agree completely with the amendment and I do not think employers would disagree with it.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might clarify one point.  Deputy Desmond referred to amendments Nos. 10 and 11.  The best case is where one considers the position in regard to the erection of a factory. In a country district a number of people are employed on the erection of a building which might take perhaps 18 months.  When the factory commences operations the employee is switched and continues as the employee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Let us consider a manufacturing company who have a number of people employed in the sale and distribution of goods.  After a period of ten or 15 years they decide that they will take them over directly as employees.  These people lose all the time they have been employed as distributors by the fact that they were sub-contractors.  Similarly, there are many jobs where the sub-contractor does a portion of the work and at a certain stage the main contractor takes over.  It could happen that there will be a loss of the time when they were employed on the job, doing the same work for one person.  Possibly the question of a complete take-over which is dealt with in amendment No. 11 might be left aside for the time being.  I think amendment No. 10 is worded in the clearest way possible and I suggest that it should be included. I think the Minister can see its merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I agree that the two amendments can be taken together.  I do not like the tone of amendment No. 10.  A sub-contractor is a man who takes on his own employees, carries out the job in his own way and pays the employees. The man who has employed him as sub-contractor has no right to tell him how to pay his men.  It would not be <Col N="248" /> fair to ask the principal in that case to take on liability in respect of the other man's employees.  It would not be right to compel him to do it.  If he wants to take them on and agrees on continuity or otherwise that they are entitled to redundancy, they can claim it if they have the requisite period of service.  If he wants to take them on and permit them continuity of service so that they may claim redundancy at a later date, that is all right too but I should not like to compel him to accept liability for the sub-contractor's employees. Amendment No. 11 does not deal with quite the same point.  I do not think I could accept this at all. In any event, since the 1967 Act came into operation he is safeguarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that in this city there are a number of very big firms who employ sub-contractors to carry out maintenance work.  They may be employed for a year, or two years, or three years.  If they find that the premises they are employed on is a good one they may move in there.  They are employed in the same premises all the time but at the moment they cannot count the service which they had with the sub-contractor who was carrying out the maintenance work.  The Minister says that this can be done if they have the necessary four years or two years but the Minister knows that is not correct <Col N="249" /> because the Department of Labour will almost certainly shoot them down and say: &ldquo;They are not entitled to it.  You can make redundancy payment yourself if you want to, but we will not because they are not entitled to it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The whole question comes down to whether or not it is important for a man to get credit for employment with a sub-contractor when he switches over to the main employer on the job.  This may not seem important to some people who are interested mainly in protecting the employer's interests.  I am sure that the Minister must understand&mdash;he represents a rural constituency&mdash;that these people working on a job cannot live those years over again. I know a man here in town who was employed by a sub-contractor for ten years in the one establishment.  He has been doing maintenance work in that establishment and if, as he hopes, he gets a job one day with the principal firm for which he has been carrying out the maintenance, he will lose all his service.  The Minister may say that he can count the service which he had but he cannot because no provision is made unless he is laid off as redundant. He would be terminating the service. There is a lot more in this amendment than the Minister seems to think.  I would be very glad if he would take a good hard look at it before he throws it out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P> (1)  Where before, on or after 1st January, 1968, an employee was employed by a Company which was wound up, liquidated, sold or otherwise ceased business or ceased to employ the employee, and the owner, or a director, or a person who had a controlling interest in that Company, dismissed an employee in circumstances of redundancy and within 52 weeks renews the employee's contract of employment or re-engages the employee under a similar or new contract with another Company of which he is the owner, director or has a controlling interest, the employment of that employee shall be deemed to have been continuous.</P>
      <P>(2)  Payment (if any) to employees affected by this section who were dismissed by reason of redundancy before the commencement of this Act shall be made from the Redundancy Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case study here is the case of <i>Hehir versus J. and G. Murphy</i> of Cork, builders.  I regret having to mention names but it is the easiest way to show why our amendment is necessary. This person never lost an hour's pay, <Col N="251" /> but a new company was formed.  He started off the following morning under the same foreman and yet he was deprived of his benefit for the simple reason that he was taken over as an employee rather than the company being taken over, one might say.  We have referred to Case No. 37 of 1970 and Case No. 101 of 1969.  There is the case of <i>Darby versus Jacobs,</i> Case No. 380 of 1969.  In that case again there was a takeover of employees, a new company being set up and a change in the control of the employees and the employees losing their benefit.  We feel very strongly about amendment No. 11. After all this was the very purpose of the redundancy legislation.</P>
    <P>We have good reason to believe that a very small minority of employers&mdash; but nevertheless they should not be allowed to get away with it&mdash;deliberately used this loophole to avoid payment of benefit.  There is a very large number of case studies already in existence which involve the takeover of employees.  There is the case of <i>Halpin versus Meade,</i> another take-over of an employee, Case No. 334 of 1969.  There is the case of <i>Roche and O'Reilly versus Lawler,</i> Case No. 420 and 423 of 1969.  In the case of <i>Roche and O'Reilly versus Lawler</i> they were catering employees and the employers changed.  A tribunal held that there was no change in the business as such. We have had that kind of development and there is certainly need for a change in the current legislation.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider this amendment sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see Deputy Desmond's point.  The amendment provides: &ldquo;...the owner, director or has a controlling interest, the employment of that employee shall be deemed to have been continuous.&rdquo;  A director could have 3 per cent or 4 per cent of the shares.  He could be brought into the company because he has the knowhow but he might not have the ability to run it.  I agree the amendment should apply where an employer re-employs men and continues with the controlling interest.  If a person has 51 per cent of the shares he has not the right to sell that company but if he has <Col N="252" /> 76 per cent he can do what he likes with it.  Occasionally for tax purposes or to avoid certain actions being taken, a person with a controlling interest could start a new company and the workers might suffer.  However, I do not agree with the inclusion of the word &ldquo;director&rdquo; because he might have no say and might be only a small boy in the firm.  For instance, an ex-Taoiseach or an ex-Deputy could be a director for 20 different companies, but you could not apply this provision to a whole range of companies like that. However, where there is a majority stake I would agree with the amendment.</P>

      <P>The amendment is a far-reaching one and could have serious implications for employers.  It is objectionable in principle for two reasons: first, because it is contrary to the concept of limited liability which is common law and, secondly, because it seeks to impose liabilities with retrospective effect from 1968.  That is the legal side of it but, in practice, we could be legislating here to overcome the irregularities of malpractices or possible malpractices of a few people and maybe penalising workers who are genuinely helped to obtain new employment by good employers. Deputies may have experience of cases from the Appeals Tribunal where somebody has acted deliberately for the purpose of circumventing the regulations of the Redundancy Act but I do not think there is justification for inserting a special amendment to get at something that is the exception rather than the rule, an amendment that could do a great deal of harm to employees. Firms may be associated through directorship or otherwise with other firms and frequently can assist employees to find jobs elsewhere.  You are hitting at those genuine cases for the sake of dealing with what would appear to be the reprehensible practices of another firm.  The amendment would do more harm than good and I would not be prepared to accept it.</P>

      <P>I concede that a person may be a director in 20 different companies and that it is wrong to include &ldquo;director&rdquo; in the amendment. <Col N="253" /> However, take the case of a builder who erects, let us say, 60 houses and there is a fault in each one of them.  The purchasers take action against him and he goes into liquidation. If he had a controlling interest he could start another company and change it slightly in order to prevent the trade unions following it up.  Where his wife had five shares he could give her ten and so on; in other words the company is not exactly the same; the directors are different having regard to the number of shares they hold.  There is also the fact that if a person goes into voluntary liquidation after a certain number of years&mdash;I cannot remember the exact period&mdash;he can save tax. These are two cases in which the worker can be caught.  I do not say it is the intention to victimise the workers, but the employer could let some of them go and keep on a few others as it suits him.  As I say, where there is a majority interest, where a company is really owned by the one person or a company is owned by a holding company of the same group, this amendment should apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been endeavouring through the various amendments to this Bill to plug holes in the original Bill.  The legislation is less than four years in existence and Deputy Desmond has already given at least half a dozen examples indicating the need for an amendment such as this. We in this party are not wedded to the actual wording of this amendment but, in the light of these examples, we believe an amendment of this kind is required.  The argument that the Minister makes that this may do harm to employees of good employers cannot hold, because the good employer will be good whether there is a Bill there or not.  He does not require legislation. The reason we are amending the legislation after four years is that all employers are not necessarily good in their dealings with employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a definite need for this amendment or for an amendment on these lines.  There are many instances, not only in regard to redundancy, of individuals turning themselves into limited liability companies in order to avoid some kind of liability.  It would <Col N="254" /> not be surprising to find this happening in the future.  If the Minister is not enamoured of the wording he can put forward his own amendment, but I would ask him to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me why he wants to deal with companies in a different way from that in which he deals with private employers? The next section, section 7, says:</P>
      <P>Where an employee who was dismissed before the commencement of this Act was not entitled to redundancy payment under the Principal Act in respect of the dismissal solely because the requirements of the business carried on by his employer for employees to carry out work of a particular kind, or to carry out such work in the place where the employee had been so employed, had not ceased or diminished or were not expected to cease or diminish, the Minister may, at his discretion and notwithstanding the Principal Act, pay to that employee out of the Redundancy Fund a sum equal in amount to the sum to which he would have been entitled under the Principal Act if the said requirements had ceased or diminished or were expected to cease or diminish.</P>
      <P>That is, if he is a private employer, he can do the three card trick.  Deputy Desmond has read an impressive list.  We are not asking the Minister to take our word for these cases because I am sure they are documented in the Department of Labour.  They are cases which with the exception of one or two have come up on appeal&mdash;an English decision in the case of <i>Bumsted v. I. L. Cars Ltd.</i> and <i>McKinley v. Craig Paisley and Melvin.</i> In almost every case the situation was that there was a takeover of employees on the same job where the owner became insolvent or where an owner or his son switched the name of a company and which resulted in the employee not being treated in the same way as if he were employed by a private employer.  There is no reason whatever why this should not be included except that the effort appears to be to let these people off the hook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> Let me refer again to the fact that as soon as it became known that the Redundancy Payments Bill was to become law, the smart fellows endeavoured to get away with something. We asked that the Act be dated back to the date of the publication of the Bill because this was the only way in which it could cover the people concerned. Of course, the Minister did not do that with the result that everybody knew the legislation was pending and took advantage of it.  We are asking that the same be done in respect of another amendment that will be coming up later on because people who have known that the period was being reduced from 208 to 204 weeks have since been laying off people of relatively short service for the sole purpose of getting away with a few shillings.  This is an amendment which the Minister must accept and if he does not so accept it, we shall challenge a division on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy has not said anything that would lead me to change my mind on this.  What I think the Deputy has in mind is having it made retrospective in order to bring in one or two cases which he has already thought of.  I am opposed to the principle of retrospection and we must make a case against it.  Apart from that, I am advised that this is objectionable in principle for two reasons.  In the first place, it is contrary to the concept of limited liability which is a basic of company law. We cannot introduce something that is contrary to the provisions of what is basic in company law and thereby create new liabilities for persons.  Also we must think of the genuine cases that I have been trying to explain such as when a firm closes down but everything possible is done to help the employees to obtain employment with other firms.  Of course, if they have completed two years employment with the firm they would be entitled to a lump sum.  I do not think that any serious damage is being done here to workers.  I am afraid that the Deputy has more in mind the reopening of one or two cases that occurred in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the <Col N="256" /> Minister that we are not going to have a division solely on the question of retrospection?  We are free and easy on that aspect.  We know that injustices have occurred in the past under the Redundancy Payments Act of 1967 but that is bad law and bad precedent and we do not intend trying to have it both ways in that regard.  What we are saying is that under the new Bill there should be fairly tight provision to prevent a deliberate&mdash;one might even say malicious&mdash;intent on the part of an employer to evade the prospect of responsibility for an employee's continuity of employment.  Technically, if the Minister does not accept our amendment there is nothing to prevent an employer saying to an employee &ldquo;I know you have worked here for the past 30 years but we are setting up a new company as and from Monday next.  Naturally, you will be kept on in your job but your continuity of employment will begin as and from next Monday&rdquo;.  Of course, from the employer's point of view it would be worth something to him to have no redundancy liability on his books if he intends selling out in, say, 18 months time.  I am stretching the point but I think that can happen.  I pointed this out in relation to Cork City where, in my opinion, there was a definite case in which this did happen.  The building firm concerned has now gone into liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out also a second case&mdash;that of <i>Halpin v. Meade,</i> Case No. 334&mdash;in relation to the takeover of an employee.  In this case the employer died and his son then took over the business.  It may be argued that continuing liability, statutory limitations and so on, which would impose fresh legislation on the son, should not be contained in legislation.  I make a point that in this particular case the son of the original employer formed a new company and the employee's claim before the tribunal was thrown out and he got nothing because he was not eligible for redundancy.  In a case such as that there should be some continuing responsibility and liability arising from the continuing employment of the worker.  A worker should not be hammered to that extent.  If, at Report Stage, the Minister can give us any <Col N="257" /> assurance that, even on a futuristic basis, he might try to meet the point made by the Labour Party, we shall not challenge a division on it.  Otherwise, we have very strong feelings in relation to this amendment.  While I can appreciate the objections to retrospection, I believe there should be some means by which the tribunal could prevent some of the Mickey Mouse efforts on the part of a minority of employers to evade liability under the Act.</P>

      <P>So far as we in Fine Gael are concerned we could not accept this amendment where a director is involved.  We could accept it in the case of a majority of shareholders but not in the case of a director because a man could be a director of 25 companies.  The Minister's case about upsetting company law does not worry me unduly in this case.  In Dublin city, for instance, many people own limited liability companies which may be operating under different names.  A glaring case here is that made by Deputy Desmond where a company was taken over by a son of the owner and where the continuity of employment should have existed.  I would not worry about the limited liability.  I am sure a good barrister versed in company law could tell you that you could easily get out of this.  I hope that the Minister will have another look at this.</P>

      <P>I hate to be appealing to have divisions warded off by promising to have another look at a section and I would like to be very honest about this matter.  I cannot quite see that in future there will be any of the danger of the type which the Labour Party Deputies feel there might be.  Certainly I would not be prepared to have any retrospection.  As far as the qualifying period is concerned, we have reduced it.  Redundancy is redundancy and if a man can continue in employment then he is very fortunate.  The number of persons likely to be adversely affected if this type of amendment is not incorporated in the Bill is likely to be extremely small, and indeed I can hardly visualise any.  I could see, however&mdash;and I think Deputies <Col N="258" /> will agree with this&mdash;that it could do harm by passing on liabilities to people who have not got such liabilities at the moment and who can be genuinely helpful with good employees.  Such people have been helpful in the past and I hope always will be.  We could make it awkward for them by attaching a liability to them which they have not got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that what he is saying is that the decent employer who would not do this sort of thing should not be penalised? He would not do it anyway.  We are trying to get at the man who has no conscience in regard to money or employees. The Minister is not so naive as to imagine that there are none of these.  Unfortunately, they are far too numerous.  Even if there were only half a dozen the effort would be worth it if we could in this legislation ensure that the half dozen who would suffer as a result will not suffer by plugging any loopholes in the Bill.  In regard to retrospection, I am sure the Minister is thinking of cases in which the State might have to produce money because some employers would not be able to turn it up, but as he says the number would be relatively small.  However, there are a number and it is the job of this House to ensure that nobody is imposed on by the smart alec who does what we are trying by this amendment to prevent.  Like the Minister, I do not think that we should stave off divisions simply by saying that this matter will be looked at again.  Following the information which Deputy Desmond has provided I would ask the Minister to have his officials look at these case histories and see whether or not there is justification for doing what we are asking in the amendment.  We could have a division here and be defeated on it and see on which side people stand, if we wanted to do that. We are prepared to do that if the Minister will not look at this again. I would ask him to get his officials to look at what has been cited here and see the unfairness of what happened. If he can come back on Report Stage and say that he is still satisfied that nothing can be done then we are prepared to accept that, but every <Col N="259" /> effort should be made to ensure that any loophole in the Bill will be plugged.</P>

      <P>I should like to give the Minister an example which has just occurred to me.  I own the same amount of shares in six companies and I promote or move a man from one company to another.  Well, that is all right; he is going to get his redundancy as if the company were all one, but in fact he is losing continuity of employment. He is losing each time he moves.  If he moves from one place to another place no redundancy is due to him.  If he moves within less than two years no redundancy is due to him.  This is what can happen.  I am giving the Minister a perfect example involving a group of companies which are basically the same with a slight difference in the share holding and I can tell the Minister that in law you have no case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is citing the case of a man who would be working for a year and 11 months and the company would move him to another one and then after another year and 11 months move him to another and deprive him of the right of continuity which I do not think under other sections of the Bill could be done.  However, before we pass it over with a promise of looking at it again I will read the proposed amendment.  It says:</P>
      <P>Where before, on or after 1st January, 1968, an employee was employed by a company which was wound up, liquidated, sold or otherwise ceased business or ceased to employ the employee, and the owner, or a director, or a person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>forget about the retrospection&mdash;</P>
      <P>who had a controlling interest in that company, dismissed an employee in circumstances of redundancy and within 52 weeks renews the employee's contract of employment or re-engages the employee under a similar or new contract with another company of which he is the owner, director or has a controlling interest, the employment of that employee shall be deemed to have been continuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> Could you not be doing a disservice to an employee who was knocked off maybe after six or seven months and some company, which possibly could be held to be an associate, re-employs him?  We have to provide this entitlement to continuity.  Looking at it at its best the new employer knows that he is taking on this man with a liability of continuity and would the obvious thing for him to do be not to take him on and to take on somebody else who does not carry such liability?  In that way you are not doing a disservice to reemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can force an employer to take on somebody who has a gap of six months but where he does take him on we say that he shall not penalise him retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must also know that no employer employs a man because he likes the man's blue eyes or fair hair but because he is the best man he can get to do a particular job. If he has been employed in a firm for a number of years doing a job and he is off because the company is being wound up and then somebody restarts the company, either under a new name or under new management, he is re-employed for that reason; he is not re-employed because he is liked.  This is a thing which annoys me because always we seem to get the impression that workers are being done a favour by somebody when they are given a job.  If they are good men or women doing a hard day's work they are earning every shilling they get.  A man or woman with five, six, or ten years will get a relatively small amount of redundancy payment under existing or amending legislation, but if they go back into employment and are employed for a further ten or 20 years, the additional time they would be allowed to work earlier will be important to them.  That is the kernel of the amendment.  In addition, there is the question of ensuring that people who have already been codded by what has happened should, if possible, be covered by this.  The wording of the amendment is ours; the parliamentary draftsmen may have entirely different views and we are prepared to agree if <Col N="261" /> an amendment which they believe will cover some of these things we are trying to get at here is introduced it will at least be an improvement on the present Bill.</P>

If the employer is re-employing him as a result of his work in another company he must have been very happy with him in the previous company. He must be a very good man and he would have no worries about carrying something like that which he may never have to pay.  The man must be good if he is going to take him again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>Before section 6 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>6.  The following subsection is hereby inserted in section 19 of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  An employer who fails to pay a lump sum which is due to an employee under this Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> I am always very reluctant when moving an amendment to suggest that we should have a division if it is not accepted.  In this case, however, unless the Minister is prepared to accept that there should be some form of penalty for non-payment of the lump sum I think we in these benches have no option but to seek a division.  Section 19 (1)  of the principal Act baldly says:</P>
    <P>Upon the dismissal by reason of redundancy of an employee who is entitled under this Part to redundancy payment, or upon the termination by such an employee in accordance with section 12 (2)  of his contract of employment, his employer shall pay to him an amount which is referred to in this Act as the lump sum.</P>
    <P>(2)  Schedule 3 shall apply in relation to the lump sum.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by order amend Schedule 3.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is no provision in the 1967 Act whereby if an employer tells an employee that he is not getting his lump sum and refuses to pay it, the employee can do anything about it.  That is that under the Act.  The Labour Party propose that an employer who fails to pay the lump sum due to an employee under the Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50.  I take that customary figure as the rather conventional conservative penalty in that regard.</P>
    <P>The point is self-evident.  You can have a situation where only under the collective pressure of the Minister and the redundancy section of the Department and the trade union an employer finally pays out the lump sum.  Half the number of workers in this country are not in unions and we on the trade union side tend to forget this.  The insured population not in trade unions is invariably very weak and consists of persons open to exploitation, many of them in the service industries.  Therefore, if an employee is entitled to a lump sum which might be the largest single amount of money he will ever get arising out of a lifetime of employment, no employer should have the option of saying: &ldquo;You will not get your lump sum.  You can sue me if you <Col N="263" /> like but I will not be liable on a statutory basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think amendment No. 12 is quite fair and reasonable.  It is beyond the understanding of my party that it has not been incorporated in the 1967 Act. The vast majority of responsible, reputable employers do pay the lump sum but I know of at least four or five cases where in the recent past employees were told to go and sing for their money.  Personally I have been told by two employers in south County Dublin that I could also go and sing for it.  I am here singing for it this afternoon and seeking some statutory measure of redress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy has properly studied the provisions of the Bill.  In the case where an employer refuses to pay the lump sum and the employee brings his case to the tribunal and is granted a lump sum, the Minister is entitled to pay it out of the fund and can take action against the employer for the recovery of the amount and deprive the employer of the rebate&mdash;all or part of it&mdash; which he ordinarily would get.  This is a pretty severe penalty in itself and safeguards the employee.  Looking at subsection 3 of section 17 of the principal Act we find it states:</P>
      <P>An employer who fails to comply with this section or who furnishes false information in a notice under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.</P>
      <P>The penalty is already in the principal Act and there is the additional penalty I have just outlined of being refused the rebate when he is made to pay up as a result of the decision.  I am not too sure about this.  Penalties are mentioned in subsection (4) of section 18 of the 1967 Act which states:</P>
      <P>An employer who fails to comply with this section or who furnishes false information in a redundancy certificate shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> That relates to a redundancy certificate in the Principal Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing one point.  We are not talking about the fellow who supplies information; we are talking about the person who simply does not pay, who gives no information and who refuses to discuss the matter.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that the man can apply to the Redundancy Tribunal and get redress and that the employer who is foolish enough to do that loses out heavily, but we are dealing in one case with an employee who, as Deputy Desmond has said, because he is not a member of a trade union, is not aware of his rights and does not know the right way to go about it.  We are dealing with an employer who may not be quite sure what the employee is entitled to, but is certain that he is not going to give any money to an ex-employee if he can get away with it.</P>
      <P>If the employee is advised to take the case to the Tribunal it may take some time to get his money but eventually things will work out.  What the Minister is overlooking is that like the man who will not stamp his employees' insurance cards the one thing an employer dreads is appearing in court where an official will tell the court that this man did not do what he was supposed to do under the law.  Nobody, even in a town or city, not to talk of a country district, likes to be held up as a mean person before his neighbours. As things stand there is no provision for legal action unless the employer gives false information.  If he plays dumb he can get away with it without going to court.  Has the Minister any evidence of the number of people taken to court for giving false information?  I am prepared to hazard a guess that none of them has so far reached court.  The same thing happens here as happens to employers who fail to stamp insurance cards.  The Department are a little too kind with people who do not meet these things, because they are people who have property and they are dealing with people who have nothing except what they earn with their two hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear if the present <Col N="265" /> wording is the best way of doing this, but the amendment proposes that if an employer does not pay his employee the money due to him it should be possible to take him to court in addition to depriving him of the share of the refund he would be entitled to.  I believe this would have an effect not only on him but on many others like him.  I had a letter this morning from a man who said he was employed by his employer for 27 years and he was laid off.  The employer told him he would pay him his redundancy pay.  Nothing was put in writing because the man did not know he had to have documents filled up and his employer either did not know or was too cute to tell him, but after ten weeks the man went back to his ex-employer to find out why he was not getting his money and the employer told him he had changed his mind, he could not afford to pay him.  I am quite sure if that employer realised that in addition to having to pay the money he would have to go to court and pay a £50 fine, he would have been much more careful.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) of section 17 states:</P>
      <P>An employer who fails to comply with this section or who furnishes false information in a notice under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That refers to the giving of notice.  Subsection (4) of section 18 states that an employer who dismisses an employee shall give him a certificate and failure to comply with this section means that the employer will be liable on a summary <Col N="267" /> conviction to a fine not exceeding £50.  In section 19 subsection (4) of section 18 is omitted.  An employer can refuse to give an employee notice in writing of the proposed dismissal; he can refuse to send the Minister a copy of that notice and he will get hammered to the tune of £50 for a conviction.  Likewise, an employer can refuse to give the certificate to the employee and he will be hammered to the tune of £50, but the employer can refuse to pay the lump sum but no penalty is mentioned.  I know that an employee has a redress through the tribunal but let us remeber that redundancy and subsequent unemployment is a traumatic experience for an industrial worker.  At that stage he is not in a fit condition to start careering off to the office of the Minister for Labour, seeking out the various forms, completing his complaint, waiting to go before the Redundancy Tribunal and getting his money from the tribunal. Months later the Minister will go through the whole process of litigation to get the money from the employer, less the proper rebate.  What we are saying here is that an employee entitled to a lump sum, whose employer tells him to go and swim for it, is entitled to statutory protection.  In other words it will be an offence on the part of the employer.  I do not think the Minister should have any difficulty in accepting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I would be well advised to have another look at this.  There is ample cover. Under section 19, where the Third Schedule is said to apply, there is very good protection for the employee because, instead of putting the onus to take action on the employee, the Minister takes action for him.  The Minister pays the money and takes all the responsibility for recovering from the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the redundancy certificate, the employee is provided with a form at the employment exchange and that form incorporates a certificate for the lump sum.  Receipt of a certificate of redundancy is in itself a receipt for a lump sum and failure on the part <Col N="268" /> of an employer to produce it renders him liable on conviction to a penalty of £50.  There is adequate cover.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where an employee who was dismissed for reasons of redundancy before the commencement of this Act was not entitled to a lump sum redundancy payment under the Principal Act solely because the claim or appeal was not made within the period of 30 weeks specified <Col N="269" /> in section 24 of the Principal Act and the employer had failed to give the employee&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the written notice of dismissal under section 17 of the Principal Act, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a redundancy certificate under section 18 of the Principal Act,</P>
    <P>in cases where the Tribunal decided, or decides, that the employee was dismissed for reasons of redundancy (and notwithstanding the Principal Act), the lump sum as duly calculated, shall be paid to the employee out of the redundancy fund.</P>
    <P>Where there is a deliberate failure on the part of an employer to give notice we propose that the lump sum payment could be made without the certificate. This is self-explanatory but the Minister's views would be welcome.  This would certainly strengthen the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have already dealt with this matter of retrospection. I could not accept either of these amendments.  Amendment No. 18 would seem to abolish altogether the time limit for claiming lump sums. We have been reasonably generous, I think, in trying to meet the views of all concerned by extending the period to 52 weeks and that 52 weeks can be further extended to 104 weeks.  Neither side in industry would like to see the time limit abolished altogether.  What we are inserting is a very good medium. It goes far enough to meet both employers and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Minister is saying that those who got away with it, because there was a loophole in the Act which enabled them to avoid making the payments they should have made, should not now be interfered with.  In essence, that is what the Minister is saying.  I am no more a lover of retrospective legislation than he is but, as Deputy Belton said, the Government when it suits them have no hesitation in introducing retrospective legislation.  Here we have a clear case in which people were coded out of a few pounds, a few pounds which would have made a great difference to them, <Col N="270" /> because the employer did not obey the regulations.  Had he been prosecuted it would be a different matter but, as Deputy Desmond pointed out, no such prosecutions took place.  Certain employers simply got away with it.  The employee did nothing about it and the employer clapped himself on the back and said: &ldquo;I wiped their eye that time.&rdquo;  He wiped the eye of someone who had lost a job and who was badly in need of a few pounds, but that will not keep the employer awake at night. Here we are talking about the exception in employers.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that we do not have so many of these people but I would follow to the ends of the earth the employer who tries to get away with this.  I would do everything possible to make him meet his commitments. That is what is suggested in both of these amendments.  I cannot see why the Minister says that since he has given, in the new Bill, 52 weeks, with a possible extension to 104, that that should be sufficient.  I suggest to him that under other legislation there is a statute of limitations laid down.  It is laid down for ordinary debts.  In my opinion money owed by an employer to an employee is an ordinary debt.  Therefore, I suggest that he should accept both amendments and let the statute of limitations be the only bar on it.  An employer may lay off a man and give him the impression that he will be re-employed and play him along, as a few of them I know have done, and keep him going until he is outside the law as it stands.  There are employers who are proud of themselves for doing this. Such an employer may be depriving the head of a household, with a family to support, of a few pounds which would probably cost the employer very little if he had gone about it in the right way but would not do that because he was a particularly mean type of person and did not want to meet his commitments.</P>

    <P>We are now getting an opportunity to do something which was not done when the 1967 Act was going through. If the Minister then knew that this sort of thing would happen I am quite satisfied that he would have put such a requirement into the Bill but not <Col N="271" /> having put it in he is now asking the House to accept from him that those who got away under that provision should not be penalised in any way and that those who try to get away with it in the future should not be penalised either.  I do not follow his line of reasoning at all.  Fifty-two weeks will almost certainly be the limit.  In rare exceptions it may go to 104.  When we are talking about protection for working people there is no reason why we should not give them the fullest possible protection.  If somebody who owns a business owes money and is bound only by the statute of limitations with regard to the repayment of that, why should an ordinary worker be bound by the one year period suggested in the Bill?  Why should he also not have simply a statute of limitations governing the time in which he may recover the money which is legally, lawfully and morally due to him?  This is the kernel of the whole thing.  Some people do not seem to understand that workers are being done out of money to which they are morally entitled.  The Minister is prepared to pooh-pooh the whole thing and say he would not have anything to do with retrospective legislation. It may not be the best thing in the world but when the Government could do it when it suited themselves in other ways I see no reason why, on this very important issue, they should not introduce what the Minister calls retrospective legislation and let this money be paid without a limit on the period.  In addition, they should make those who have got away with it meet their commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider accepting the Labour Party's proposal.  A statute of limitations might, perhaps, be a major problem facing the Minister but why should there be a specific time limit? Admittedly, the Minister is being somewhat generous in the proposal, coming up to 104 weeks.  Nevertheless, we think the limit should not formally exist.  There have been a number of cases involved.  I have in mind the case of Ryan v. Limerick Health Authority in relation to disputes about the definitions under the Act.  Difficulties arose <Col N="272" /> which I suppose could be said to lie with the original defective drafting of the Act itself where a midwife was replaced by a district nurse.  This brings us to the case in England where a barman was replaced by a bunny girl.  That was the subject of a rather interesting court case too.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept the Labour Party's proposal.  It is eminently fair and reasonable to submit that if an employer fails to give the statutory notice, and this usually happens in the case of non-trade union people, they may discover a very considerable time afterwards that, in fact, they were entitled to redundancy compensation. Bearing in mind that the length of insured employment is generally being reduced, it is most frustrating for a person to discover that if he had activated his interest earlier he would then have been entitled to benefits under the Act but because the employer was cute enough not to mention it or unfair enough not to give it he is, in fact, no longer entitled to it. The Minister should reconsider his approach on amendments Nos. 14 and 18.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 14 has to do with a type of legislation which is not desirable because it seeks to controvert something that was passed in this House, went through without any counter proposals at the time or anybody questioning the adequacy of the 30 weeks which was provided in which to make a claim.  To re-enact legislation that would undo the decisions taken under that section would not be good legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is totally different in the Ryan v. Limerick Health Authority case where the spirit of the Act is contravened in a decision of the Supreme Court.  We all agree that this is contrary to what the original spirit of the Act was intended to be.  To re-define what the original intention was is retrospective legislation and could be contested to some extent but at least there is justification for it in that it is giving to the Act the definition which it was originally intended that the Act should have.  To bring in retrospective legislation to cover cases which it was agreed were adequately covered <Col N="273" /> under the section would not be desirable. Thirty weeks was considered to be reasonable at the time.  Nobody questioned it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the discussion last night I think I outlined fairly sufficiently the difficulties that arise in seeking a legislative solution to the problem of building land prices.  As I pointed out last night, the committee I established under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kenny was set up in the hope that if there is an effective solution this committee might come up with it.  I have asked the committee to deal with the problem and to make a report to me as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>In the course of the discussion to date no Deputy has suggested any other solution.  For that reason I would ask the House to await the report of the committee, and for that reason also I must reject the motion because what it proposes is premature at this stage.  I would go so far as to say that the motion is unfair in that it does not give any recognition of the Government's anxiety in regard to house prices.  This anxiety has been given practical form in the various steps which have been taken.  Apart from the establishment of the committee, which is the only sensible and practical way to approach the legislative difficulties we are faced with, other steps have been taken.  Although I have not much time to deal fully with the various measures that have been taken by the Government, I shall briefly go through some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the long term it may be that the only practical solution would be to ensure that so much serviced land is made available that land will lose its scarcity value and in this way become available on the market at normal market prices.  The resources available to the Government are not unlimited. However, within the limits of these resources, my predecessors and myself have impressed on the local authorities the necessity of proceeding with the planning and execution of schemes for the provision of water supply and sewerage facilities in those areas where it is evident that there is a strong demand for serviced land for house building. Various priority schemes have <Col N="275" /> been worked out at the request of Minister for Local Government.  The main priorities given to these schemes were to ensure that they catered for new housing and new industrial development. They were to be designed for areas where they would meet the most urgent needs.</P>
    <P>A sum of approximately £15.2 million for new sanitary service schemes in the major pressure areas has been released since April, 1968.  However, it is obvious that the allocation of resources for sanitary service works must complete with all other demands for capital on the public purse and this is accepted by everyone.  Particular attention to the provision of sanitary services has been given to the Dublin area.  It is recognised that this is where the greatest need arises because in this area there is the greatest number of people and the greatest rate of expansion. In Dublin, two of the four major sections of the Dodder Valley main trunk sewer have been completed; the third section has commenced and it is expected that tenders will be invited for the final section quite soon.  The Dodder Valley scheme will open up 6,300 acres of new land for housing, industry and other development.  In addition, Dublin Corporation are pushing ahead with the design of the Grand Canal sewer project.  At present the time scale envisaged for this project, which will provide services for an area of approximately 11,000 acres of additional building land, suggests that it will be completed by 1976.  These large-scale schemes, together with others either at the planning or execution stage, will cater for the building land needs of Dublin city and its environs for many years to come.  Of course, other large schemes are planned in other areas where significant growth is anticipated.</P>
    <P>In addition to making provision for sanitary services, a number of other steps have been taken.  Regarding the acquisition of land, which I have mentioned on a number of occasions, local authorities are constantly urged to acquire land for development in advance of their present needs.  This is particularly the case where services are to be provided, in order to ensure that as <Col N="276" /> far as practicable, the increase in the value of land attributable to the provision of these services accrues to the community.  All major housing authorities have been acquiring considerable quantities of land in recent years.  In many cases the land on hand should be sufficient to meet their expected needs for some years to come.</P>
    <P>The £3 million that was made available in the Dublin area for the acquisition of land for future house building over and above the normal land acquisition programme of Dublin Corporation for its own house programme enabled the local authority to purchase an additional 2,000 acres.  Taking into account the other 2,000 acres which the Dublin authorities have for their normal housing programme, they have on hand at the moment 4,000 acres of land.  Some of this has been disposed of to private builders at favourable prices.  The price at which land is available to a private builder in Dublin ranges from about £4,500 per acre for land which has been disposed of by the corporation in fairly substantial blocks and which has services adjacent to its boundaries.  In addition, building sites are available from £1,100 to £1,300.  Water and sewerage services are laid on to those sites.  Public roads, footpaths, lighting and the other expensive services that must be provided are included in the package deal price of £1,100 in some cases and £1,300 in others.  This land has been disposed of and is being disposed of within a progressive programme by Dublin Corporation. They are in the strong position of being able to say that no builder needs to be without building land.  The land can be supplied to him by Dublin Corporation provided that he is a traditional building operator in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>One of the contributing factors to the escalation in the price of building land was that the small builders were competing with each other for land which became available on the market, pushing the price up against each other, introducing a certain amount of panic into the land buying market, and contributing to the high prices which they were subsequently obliged to pay.  I hope that the disposal of land by Dublin Corporation will convince <Col N="277" /> these builders that there is no need for them to compete with each other now in the purchase of land.  This applies mainly to the smaller builders.</P>
    <P>Another step taken by the Government was the introduction of the special subsidy in the 1966 Housing Act, the £150 per site for private houses, in order to encourage local authorities to acquire and develop land on a scale sufficiently large to bring with it economies of size and the benefit of a good overall design suitable to the particular neighbourhood. The authorities are beginning to avail themselves of this subsidy to an increasing extent, and this is making a substantial contribution towards providing sites at a reasonable price for persons anxious to buy them to build homes for themselves.</P>
    <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the local authorities were empowered to require developers to make a contribution towards the cost of the provision of services such as water supply and sewerage services.  The judicious use of this power should ensure that at least part of the increased value of the land attributable to the provision of the services at public expense will accrue to the community.  The provision of services, however, accounts for only part of the increase in the value of land which arises when land is needed for development to meet various community needs.  The principle that the community should in fact derive some benefit at least from this increased value created by the needs and actions of the community and the planning policies and decisions of planning authorities, is obviously a reasonable one which must command general acceptance.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to mention that in the Dublin area&mdash;and Dublin is most often mentioned as an area where land is scarce, an area in which there is the greatest demand and where the highest prices are paid generally&mdash;in their acquisition programme Dublin Corporation, in acquiring the 2,000 acres I mentioned, some of which was serviced and some unserviced land, acquired the land at an average price of £1,500 per acre.  They have already begun to <Col N="278" /> distribute and sell it.  Recently the corporation leased 115 acres of this developed land to private builders and will make more land available from time to time as it becomes serviced. Recently also they decided to allocate 735 serviced sites comprising about 150 acres to small builders and to co-operative housing groups.</P>
    <P>All in all, the proposers of the motion should accept that there is full recognition on the part of the Government and certainly on my part, as I have stated publicly on several occassions, of the undesirable trend which has appeared on the open market where land was being sold, and the part this was playing in adding to the cost of housing.  I am concerned about it.  We have taken steps.  The legal obstacles which faced us are being thoroughly examined and, until I am in a position to study the report of the Kenny Commission, it would be premature of the proposers of the motion to ask me to accept the motion.  For that reason I propose to reject it.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have very much more to say.  This is a problem which concerns all of us and, if a ready solution could be found, I would be very anxious to take whatever steps were practicable.  I have great faith in the examination which is being carried out at present.  Despite that, we will continue with our programme of acquiring as much land as possible, because the greatest single factor is the operation of the principle of supply and demand.  If we can supply more serviced land than there is a demand for we will deflate prices and enable young people in particular, who are of such great concern to me, to purchase their houses at a cost which would be reasonable and within their resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in this House are concerned or at least should be concerned with the situation to which this Labour Party motion draws attention. This is an extremely difficult problem. The proposals in this motion are not clear enough to satisfy me that they are the answer to the problem.  In fact, I do not think there is any clear-cut answer to it.  It is deplorable that when so many people decide they want to get married, settle down and get <Col N="279" /> a house they find such difficulty in doing so.  The site cost is one big element in the overall cost of housing our people but it is not by any means the worst element.  Site costs have rocketed over the years.  I think the Minister feels, as I do, that the principal way to bring down the cost of house sites is to extend the services, to service more land.  What was responsible for the price of housing sites rocketing, particularly in the Dublin area, over the years was the failure to recognise that this was extremely important.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks in a very saintly way about the concern felt by the Government over the years about this problem.  Since I came into this House approximately ten years ago I have heard Ministers for Local Government expressing the same views which are now being expressed by the Minister about the serious concern that exists.  I saw the racket carried on in the Dublin region by friends of the Government who were allowed to carry it on.  This was deplorable.  I can give the Minister specific instances, if necessary, where people bought land where there were no services, knowing that the local authority would have to refuse them planning permission, but knowing full well that when it went to the Minister on appeal they would get permission, and that the local authority would then be saddled with the responsibility to provide services within a certain time. They then disposed of it without putting £1 into it themselves, without putting any effort whatever into it.  They disposed of it at enormous profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying quite clearly that friends of the Government passed that burden on to unfortunate people who were trying to provide themselves with houses.  This is what I object to and seriously object to.  I do not think anyone should be allowed to speculate and traffic in land at the expense of unfortunate people who have the problem of finding the wherewithal to provide themselves with a house.  I hope this will never be permitted again.  I hope we have seen the end of it.  That is one aspect with which the Kenny Commission should be concerning themselves. Nobody should have the right to buy land and sell it when they get <Col N="280" /> some special permission, or when they use their advance knowledge that certain land will become valuable, and that development will take place in a certain direction.</P>
    <P>The price of sites in the Dublin region will come down, because at long last the Government appreciate the great necessity for extending services. Services are now being extended at a fairly rapid rate but it took far too long to get to this point.  The Minister is quite right when he says there are limits to the resources available to the Government and to the Minister for Local Government, and that is quite so.  However, the manner in which these resources can be best used is by extending services.  In my view that is the least expensive way of bringing down the cost of building land.  It requires an enormous amount of money to build up a substantial land bank, and a fairly substantial land bank has been built up in the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>There is a limit to where you can go in this direction without doing damage. We have reached the point in this connection where local authorities put a compulsory purchase order on land that has been bought by a builder who is ready to go ahead and build whereas the local authorities themselves are not in a position to go ahead with the building.  More houses can be made available by leaving the building to people who are erecting a large number of houses, however we may feel about the amount of profit they are making. Perhaps they are making too much profit and perhaps there has not been sufficient examination of the profits being made by builders, but at least they are producing houses quicker than the local authorities are producing them.  Influence can be brought to bear on them to build moderately priced houses having regard to overall costs. Great care should be taken about putting compulsory purchase orders on land that could be built on long before the local authority can do the building.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken here as if this scheme has worked in the most perfect fashion and that this competition between small builders that was responsible for the price of land rocketing has been brought to an end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> What has happened is that the corporation have been competing against small builders in the purchase of land and have made it quite impossible for a small builder to purchase land.  I know of a case where a builder wanted to buy 18 acres of land and had the price just made when the corporation stepped in and said: &ldquo;No.  We are putting a compulsory purchase order on that.&rdquo; That is not good business.  That is putting a small man out of business.</P>
    <P>Is it right to say there is no builder now without sites?  Only a month or so ago I had a builder with me who said he applied last November and he is still waiting.  It is not running as easily or as smoothly as all that.  Nobody can pretend that there are cheap sites.  They may be bought by the corporation at an average of £1,500 but they are being sold at £4,500.  The corporation still say this is not an economic figure and they are making no money on it.  It is difficult to see that this could be so; in certain instances it could be so. There is another way in which this undesirable speculation in building land could be overcome.  There is now a levy of £1,500 an acre on land.  This is a blister that goes on top of the normal price of land.  I personally was opposed to this levy because I knew that inevitably it would put up the price of houses.</P>

      <P>I do not quite get the Parliamentary Secretary's point, but up to quite recently there was a development charge of £375 per acre.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it is the full cost.  Therefore the person who buys the land is now paying the full cost of the services.  First of all, he is selling his land at whatever he can get for it but the fact that it is a certain price is not costing the local authority anything because on top of that he has to give them £1,500.  It is said the local authority has made his land suddenly valuable overnight and therefore he should not be allowed to sell it.  It is one of these extremely difficult problems, because if a man has property of any other sort will he be told he cannot put that on the market and get the best price he can for it?  That is a problem that will have to be resolved by supply and demand.  I am very much in favour of this building up of an advance pool of land more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the local authorities.  Certainly, they must have a more than adequate amount of land available for their own requirement over a period of years, but it would be a grand thing if the local authorities could eliminate the competition and buy all the land for building and resell it.  They have the advantage that they can buy very large areas of land.  They have the machinery for acquisition and for valuation and the powers of compulsory purchase. They would need sufficient money but the plain fact is that there is not sufficient money in the State.  It would require an enormous amount of money to do this job.  However, it should be done on a limited scale all over the country where housing is seen to be required over a period ahead.  This is the only way that the housing programme can proceed and that prices of building land can be kept at a reasonable figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in the country is seriously concerned about the plight of people who are trying to buy houses today. The Minister says he is seriously concerned. I have heard this over and over again, but I do not think this concern has been shown clearly.  There has not been a searching analysis of the profits <Col N="283" /> in building today: what constitutes the full cost of a house and why it should reach this point.  The people should know fairly clearly what is involved in this.  A house is something that must be bought by every family or, at least, every family must possess a house; some of them are fortunate enough not to have to buy it.  If people knew there was not a racket in this, then they would make a very great effort to save the necessary money and pay what would be regarded as fair prices. Undoubtedly the way to reduce site prices is to extend services.  The Dodder Valley scheme has been mentioned and the number of acres it will open up in the Tallaght area will have the effect of reducing the price of land.</P>
    <P>If we consider an area of ten or 12 acres of serviced site land on which, when fully developed, houses would cost £4,000 or £4,500, we will see that the site does not represent an enormous element in the cost of a house.  There are many other factors that go to making up the price of a house and, indeed, the Government are responsible for contributing to the cost by way of taxation.  Many aspects of the committee's report should make interesting reading.  Incidentally, I hope the committee will report on matters other than site prices and that they will consider the entire cost of providing a house. I hope they will indicate where are the elements of cost and what profit there is in the business today.</P>
    <P>This motion is being debated at a time when the situation is certainly improving in relation to site costs and when some action has been taken and is being taken in an effort to reduce the cost of land for building.  Previous speakers referred to the Local Government circular in relation to ribbon development.  I have had a fair amount of experience of such development in Dublin and I know the effect it has had.  We have reached the stage in County Dublin that I do not know for what purpose roads are being provided, because in any place where there is an existing road we are told, in relation to any proposition there may be, that a traffic hazard would be constituted. Of course, it would bring in extra traffic, but what are roads for <Col N="284" /> if they cannot take traffic?  The roads concerned are supposed to be main roads only, but I am sorry to say that, because of the way this is being interpreted by engineers, in regard to any place where there is an existing road and where there is a proposition to build houses on that road frontage, we are told there is a traffic hazard and, consequently, the proposition is turned down.  If we are not to utilise our existing road frontage to the fullest extent, we will increase vastly the price of houses.</P>

      <P>I do not mind if the Parliamentary Secretary interrupts in this way because he is only helping me.  However, I am sure that I know as much about ribbon development as the Parliamentary Secretary knows. He says this is not utilising land to the fullest extent but that is only a half statement because, of course, ribbon development can be descriptive of many things.  It is possible to utilise existing road frontage while leaving sufficient openings for building in depth at a later date if that is so desired; but the idea that we should clamp down now and say &ldquo;no&rdquo; is adding enormously to the cost of providing houses.  Also, it is delaying greatly planning permission because applications are being turned down wholesale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As chairman of the planning authority in County Dublin, I have had <Col N="285" /> a lot of arguments with our own planners in this regard.  I know that if an engineer says a proposition would constitute a traffic hazard the planning manager is in a very difficult position. He is being advised by a person who is supposed to be qualified to advise him, and if there is even one accident on that road in anybody's memory and if planning permission is given against the engineer's advice, there may be serious trouble.  Of course, this is all nonsense and has a very serious effect on the cost of houses because we are not utilising our existing road frontages. I would advise the Parliamentary Secretary to issue a further circular explaining what the first one meant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that it is being misread by road engineers and is constituting a considerable element of extra cost.  Roads are very expensive to build and everybody knows that today it is the house purchaser who is paying for the roads.  In the old days, if a road existed somebody built a house on it and that was all there was about it, but now the house purchaser is also providing the road.  That is what is happening in relation to all these building estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an enormous burden on people purchasing houses because of the gap between what they can get by way of grant and loan and the actual cost of the house.  Perhaps the Government are going as far as they can in their efforts to remedy the situation having regard to the resources available to them, but a way must be found to enable people to purchase their own houses.  We are told that a searching investigation is being carried out in this matter.  The sooner the results of that are known the better, because people are in desperate straits in their efforts to find sufficient money for house purchase and, having found it, they find that the interest rates are crippling.  I do not know where all this is going to end.  Recently I went on a trip to England to study ways and <Col N="286" /> means of reducing the price of houses. The Minister himself has done something about this and this is an indication of his concern and appreciation of the situation.</P>
    <P>The main thing that this motion is doing is drawing attention to the plight of people but I cannot see in it the answer to the problem.  However, I can see the frustration of anybody who sets about finding an easy way to solve the problem of the cost of land for building because there is no easy way. The only effective way I can see is by the extension of services and the utilisation of available moneys for that purpose rather than for the purpose of building up enormous land banks all over the country&mdash;land banks that are not likely to be used in the fairly near future by the local authorities.  It would be wrong to buy land vastly in excess of needs and vastly in excess of the building capacity not only of the local authorities but of the country generally over a short number of years.</P>
    <P>I know that such land is let in the normal way until it is required for building and, in that way, it is likely that it more than services the debt involved; but the money must be found in the first instance and that is the Government's big problem.  As I see it, it is locking money up unnecessarily to buy land too many years in advance, whereas if the services were extended in advance of requirements the law of demand and supply would operate.  If there is more than an adequate supply, the price of building land will be brought down to the level at which we all believe it should be, but it is going a bit too far when it is stated, as it is in this motion, that land should be acquired at its previous use price.  I do not think anybody would suggest that, for instance, land in the region of Dublin city should be sold for building purposes at what would be its economic price for farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am not reading the motion correctly.  &ldquo;At prices determined by its previous use.&rdquo;  Well, if its previous use was farming is it <Col N="287" /> suggested in this motion that that should be the price, what it is worth as an economic proposition for farming? That needs a little explanation. Land must always have a location value over and above what it would be worth as an agricultural proposition.  I do not think you can fix the price of land.  First of all, too many people fought for far too long for free sale in this country and the second thing is that if you attempt to fix the price of land so much of the price will appear in public and on paper and there will be so much of it given this way.  I do not think there is any effective way to do it except for the Government to buy all building or development land. This is being done in some countries where the money does not matter, so to speak, but certainly it matters here where resources are very limited.</P>
      <P>To be practical about it, I do not think it can be solved in this way.  I think we can go part of the way to solve it and the Government have started to try to do this.  The main grouse I have with the Government is in regard to the racket they allowed to take place over the purchase and resale of land, having got permission on appeal to the Minister.  That is what I resent more than anything else and that this was pushed on to the backs of unfortunate people in the Dublin region, as I am well aware. They had to bear the extra cost.  Fabulous fortunes were made in this business over the years.  I support the thought behind this motion but I do not think the solutions suggested will achieve what the Labour Party have in mind.</P>

It is easy to make the latter statement.  It will make the headlines &ldquo;Government accused of corruption&rdquo;, and so on.  Deputy Clinton made this allegation in the context of this very well-intentioned motion but he made the statement and then ran away from it.  This to my mind is the sort of allegation, imputation, mean-mindedness that brings the body politic, Dáil Éireann, institutions of this State, and so on, into disrepute.

Any public representative who is not concerned should not be called a public representative.  He should get out of public life.  Of course, we are concerned about it but the mean <Col N="289" /> allegations made on this well-intentioned and well-meaning motion do not do very much for anyone.  However, I shall leave that subject but I look forward to the time in the near future when Deputy Clinton will produce the results, as he calls them, of his investigations and puts them before the House.

      <P>If it is no trouble we can look forward to it as a matter of some urgency because I am going to pursue it.  I have said that those of us who are not interested in the welfare of the people I described, the people in the lower income group, and, indeed, in the middle income group, and the cost of housing to these people should not be called public representatives. In the recent past I opened a number of houses which were in the region of £7,000 to £8,000, middle income group houses nowadays, as they would be described, and the plot of ground on which each house was built added something in the nature of £1,200 to £1,500 to the price of the house.  That to me is immoral and it is wrong.  The Minister in his contribution of one quarter of an hour yesterday, and again in his concluding quarter of an hour this evening, indicated his concern on <Col N="290" /> behalf of himself and his Department in the context of spiralling land prices brought about by this inflation about which we hear so much these days, and, consequently, the concern of the Government about this whole problem.</P>
      <P>We are not heartless people.  We do not want to burden the population with the weight of the prices of houses and lands they are being asked to pay. There is no pleasure or joy for us in that&mdash;quite the contrary.  As I say, this is our concern and again our concern is witnessed by the setting up of the Kenny Commission which the Minister mentioned and which will look into this problem which the Labour Party mention in their motion &ldquo;the consequent cost of houses to private house purchasers and local authority tenants&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are problems which particularly affect the urban city areas, be they in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork or any other major growth area. Dublin Deputies and Deputies living in cities, or in the counties where there are cities or towns, are concerned about the prices asked nowadays for houses. Neither is it fair to blame builders, because if some builders did not build vast estates in the city and county of Dublin we would be in a very serious position.  It is not fair to be over-critical of these people.  We are living in a free enterprise society.  I do not mean a grab-all type of society but free enterprise with proper control.  If we are living in that sort of society these people are entitled to make a just profit on the amount of work they put into housing.  I say a just, not an excessive or unfair, profit.  If we examine the intention behind the motion it suggests that the Government are not concerned.  That is why I am voting against it.  We are very concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister earlier suggested that possibly in the long run the answer to this great problem would be the operation of the law of supply and demand and that if enough serviced land were available the price would drop as a result.  We in the Labour Party who put down this motion feel that day is so far off that while waiting for it many more thousands of young married couples will be joining ever-increasing housing lists in every city and town.</P>
      <P>I think it is generally accepted, particularly since the enactment of the 1963 Planning Act, that the scandal existing in the sale of building land has increased particularly in the case of land adjoining towns and cities.  It is with this in mind that we, not only on this occasion, but on every possible occasion jump at the opportunity of raising this question and seeking a solution.  Somewhat belatedly the Minister, on 24th March last, in replying to a debate on a supplementary estimate in which I participated, said according to the Official Report that he was referring to the Kenny Committee recently set up to inquire into building land prices.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to it in passing as an indication of the Government's <Col N="292" /> concern about the increasing price being paid for building land and what we are trying to do about it. Pending any recommendations the committee might make, we are continuing to encourage local authorities to acquire as much land as possible and build up a land bank.  This land could either be let out to builders or let out in private developed sites by the local authority.  Acquiring land for the community in this way ensures that the increasing value will be passed on to the community instead of into the hands of speculators.</P>
    <P>Clearly there the Minister acknowledges that there is speculation in land, that there is a scandal in the present operation of land sales for house building and that it is something that must be dealt with.  As a new Minister it is to his credit that he has done something about this matter.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a commission to deal with the particularly thorny problem is perhaps an old Parliamentary way of handling a difficult problem but in this instance I think we can accept that the Minister appreciates the problem and perhaps by having an interDepartmental committee rather than a committee drawn from outside he has shown a sense of urgency in wishing to do something about the problem. In that way we welcome the setting up of the committee and we hope it is not a method of shelving the problem.  The Minister has not indicated how long the committee will sit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>They have had 14 meetings already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly promising.  I hope their findings, as they become known, will be made available to the House.  It shows the Minister's concern about the problem, a concern singularly lacking in the past eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We say in our motion that the land required for housing should be brought under community control at prices determined by its previous use.  Deputy Clinton queried that.  We give an indication there of what we feel could be a solution to the problem and, as a party, we think that community control <Col N="293" /> would in effect be a very good watchdog on speculators and perhaps in regard to the problem at the moment of land being paid for in ways other than the stated price.  The community could keep a very close watch because one of their interests would be to see how the land was purchased and paid for.  It is reasonable to suggest that prices could be determined by the previous use of the land but naturally it does not mean to say that if as agricultural land it is worth £200 an acre it should be worth £205 an acre as building land.</P>
    <P>The situation in County Dublin seems to be one at the other extreme. Only last week it was reported in the newspapers&mdash;I am sure Deputy Clinton is well aware of this&mdash;that a 60-acre farm sold for something in the region of £270,000, which is equivalent to almost £4,500 per acre. Everyone accepts that the owner of land is entitled to a just profit when he sells it, but it is just as important that a person owning land in my own county or any other county should get a just profit.  How do we gauge what price per acre such land would go for in places where it is restricted to farming?  I venture to suggest that land restricted to farming would not fetch anything like £4,500 per acre.  People with farming land in or near Dublin are compelled to sell that land if they get planning permission for it because they know that prices like £4,500 an acre cannot last forever&mdash;there must be an end to speculation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the urgency with which the Minister set up the Kenny Committee and I am glad to hear it is meeting regularly.  I am sure the sale of land at the price I have mentioned has not escaped the notice of that committee.  I am equally sure they are aware of the need to control land speculation in the very near future.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that speculation occurs only around Dublin and other large cities, but County Wicklow is suffering and the pressure for building land in Dublin is now spilling over into Wicklow.  This is causing problems for Wicklow County Council.  I had the pleasure recently of meeting <Col N="294" /> the Minister at a chamber of commerce dinner in Wicklow and he spoke at some length about the housing problem in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Those problems were adverted to in three articles which recently appeared in the <i>Irish Times,</i> with particular reference to the setting up of a recreation centre or national park in the Dublin-Wicklow mountain area.  Reference was made in that article to the number of planning applications which were being put through by Wicklow County Council under section 4 of the County and City Managers Act.  It is purely and simply because of our close proximity to Dublin that this problem has arisen.  Despite what the writer of the articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> thinks, county councillors and public representatives in Wicklow are just as aware of the beauties and amenities which County Wicklow possesses as people outside it are.  We are equally well aware of the need to preserve them not only for the people of Wicklow but for people from other parts of the country and indeed for visitors from all over the world.  Nevertheless, people have to be housed in Wicklow the same as anywhere else and if a family wants to buy a site on which to build a house near Glendalough why should they not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to point out that the cost of building land in Wicklow is affected by the problems which exist in land speculation in Dublin at the moment.  The price of building land in Wicklow has rocketed because of the pressures of the population in Dublin.  Dublin is a small county compared with Wicklow and the population of Dublin at present is 800,000 whereas the population of Wicklow is less than 70,000.  It is only natural that, with the ever increasing price of building land in Dublin, people will move to adjoining counties and this is causing Wicklow County Council problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Planning Act as it is being operated in Wicklow at the present time is causing serious problems, and this was adverted to by the Minister <Col N="295" /> when he visited the county.  Planning permission is being looked for in every conceivable part of the county, and if all applications were granted it would be possible to house the entire population of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the Deputy should relate his remarks to the motion, which deals with the price of building land and land acquired for housebuilding.  The question of planning would not arise for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to do that.  The Labour Party motion suggests that the previous use of land could be used as a method of arriving at an equitable price for land.  There must be some sort of guideline for people at present trying to buy land for building purposes.  The price I have mentioned earlier shows the necessity for this.  If the Kenny Committee does not find a solution to this problem I cannot accept the Minister's statement that the law of supply and demand will solve the problem.  The amount of land available to local authorities as a result of the policy of acquiring land to form a land bank is, as far as I am aware, not sufficient if building continues at its present rate or at a slightly increased rate.  Local authorities have to buy land on the open market.  This means that they themselves are contributing in some degree to inflated prices because they compete with other interested buyers and the price is ultimately arrived at by the law of supply and demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Wicklow is regarded as a rural constituency.  The problem is not simply a Dublin problem.  It is <Col N="296" /> becoming a general problem.  In Wicklow it is becoming increasingly difficult to acquire land for building, not only because of its scarcity but also because of objections to building in many parts of Wicklow.  Supply and demand is an important element in the price factor. Recently we had an unfortunate incident. I am sure the Minister is aware of it.  Wicklow County Council decided to purchase a piece of land and an individual who had knowledge of the proposed purchase because of his position as a councillor went to the owner and put a deposit on the land before the council had time to act. This is what we are trying to prevent by this motion.  I think people are well aware of what happened in Wicklow because there was some newspaper comment.  I hope the Minister's committee will find a remedy for this kind of thing.  It was an unfortunate episode and it highlights the need for greater restriction on the sale of land for building.</P>
      <P>Talking about just profits is not altogether logical in this context because people are availing of the shortage of houses and the demand for houses to make profits which could not be regarded as just.  Legislation is needed to combat certain practices.  The price of land is determined by the fact that there is or is not building permission for it. The difference is too great to be regarded as a just profit and this is what we want to correct.  If the 1963 planning Act was designed to eradicate this kind of thing, in my opinion it has had the opposite effect.  Planning permission makes the land that much more valuable.  The Minister will have to amend the Act.  I hope the Kenny Committee will have suggestions to make in this respect so that abuses stemming from the Act can be corrected. We regard this as an urgent matter and we ask the Minister to accept the motion as a possible method of doing away with the present abuse in land speculation.</P>

I speak as a member of Fermoy Urban Council and refer to their problem in acquiring land.  I also speak as a member of Cork County Council.  The stage has been reached at which the Minister must take serious cognisance of this motion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann records its grave concern at the continuing increase in the price of building land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> Surely, there is nothing contentious about that?  Anyone who is concerned about the price of houses realises that building land is the main factor in the increase in price.  Nothing effective has been done by this Government to control the price of building land.  The speculation that has gone on and the vast fortunes that have been made by particular people out of the basic needs of our people has, in many instances, surprised even the people who were speculating.  Even they were surprised at the amount of money that it was possible to make out of the needs of others.  In this House to my knowledge since 1965, since I became a Member of this House, this has been plugged, this has been said and it has been acknowledged, even from the Government benches, but no effective action has been taken to control this type of speculation in a basic need of our people.</P>
    <P>When you talk about building land it is a sort of abstract subject.  It is something you cannot really get your teeth into unless you are meeting people night after night, day after day, who are living in the most deplorable conditions that one could imagine. Then you realise exactly how these speculators are making their money. They are making their money on the misery not only of men and women but of the children of this country. If one is a member of a local authority or indeed a Member of this House one has what are commonly known as clinics at which one meets one's constituents. I do not know about the rural areas, I am not a rural Deputy, but in Dublin 98 per cent of the people one meets are concerned about housing.  They are either living in a flat which is privately owned and paying an exorbitant rent or they are living with their in-laws in crowded conditions. What young married couple wants to live with their in-laws, irrespective of what their relationship is with them?  It may be very good but try living with them.  It can burst a marriage.  They may be living with friends.  There is a lot of difficulty about health charges and the burden of health charges on the rates.  I say, without fear of contradiction, that at least 60 per cent of the health charges <Col N="299" /> can be ascribed to our housing conditions. If a normal young married couple are forced to live with their in-laws the tensions are indescribable. They must be experienced to be appreciated.</P>
    <P>I have met many people anxious and endeavouring to buy their own homes, sacrificing all the normal luxuries, if one could describe them as such, such as cigarettes, going to the pictures, going to a play.  These people sacrifice so much and achieve so much only to find that the deposit on a house has suddenly escalated by at least 20 per cent.  They save, they scrimp, they sacrifice to get £600. What happens?  Some cute little boy comes in, buys a bit of land and, bang, their deposit now is £850.  Now £250 to this gentleman may mean nothing whereas £250 to a young couple who have been saving, sacrificing and scrimping is an awful lot of money. What is this gentleman about?  He is about getting rich quick and in what is described in a ridiculous way as far as I am concerned as a free society he can get away with it.  In a civilised society he would not get away with it. The only people who can stop this type of thing are the Government in power. The Minister interrupted Deputy Barry to say that he had catered for this, that he had stopped this.  I wish to God the Minister would come to my clinic next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and tell this to the people I have to deal with, the people with two or three children who are coming to me and who have made all these sacrifices.  They have not seen the effects of the Minister's intervention because the get-rich-quick merchants are still operating despite the fact that since 1965, to my personal knowledge, and long before that I am sure this thing has been brought before the Government.  This Government have neglected to provide local authority houses in sufficient numbers.  That is an established fact.  It is not an attack on the Government, it is a statement of fact.  By their failure they have compelled a number of people <Col N="300" /> to purchase their own houses but even then they did not stop.  They have now reached the point where not only are they depriving the people of local authority houses but they have made it virtually impossible for a very large number of people who are quite prepared to make sacrifices to get the deposit. Why?  I intend no reflection on the Minister.  I think the Minister personally is a conscientious Minister, relatively new to his job.  I will tell you why.  Because according to the philosophy of his party he thinks the get-rich-quick merchants are the boys who will provide the lolly.  They do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 13 to the end of the paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is the definition section and the first word defined is &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo;. It is defined as &ldquo;using or threatening to use force in relation to person or property&rdquo;.  My amendment seeks to delete the words after &ldquo;property&rdquo;.  The reason is that these words constitute in effect the offence of conspiracy and are completely out of place in the definition section.  I doubt if the word &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; needs definition because it is a word with a clear and obvious meaning in the ordinary use of the English language and certainly it is not necessary to define it by including what is in effect a definition of the offence of conspiracy.  If the Minister wants to widen &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; to include conspiracy, he has already done so in a <Col N="301" /> subsequent section.  &ldquo;Forcibly&rdquo; should not have been defined in the way it is defined in section 1 and for that reason I consider that it should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because it seeks to delete an important portion of the definition of the word &ldquo;forcible&rdquo;.  The portion of the definition which it is sought to delete is based on the meaning which was given to the concept of the use of force in judicial decisions throughout the centuries in relation to the existing Common Law and statutory offences of forcible entry and forcible occupation. The Forcible Entry Act of 1381 speaks of an entry &ldquo;with strong hand&rdquo; or &ldquo;with multitude of people&rdquo;.  According to Halsbury Laws of England and other authorities, it is not necessary in order to constitute the offence that there should be actual violence to the person of anyone.  It is sufficient if there are threats to those in possession giving them just cause to fear that bodily hurt will be done to them if they do not give up possession.  The offence may be committed by going to the premises armed or with such an unusual number of persons as plainly to show that force will be resorted to. Not only does the definition in the Bill largely coincide with the interpretation which has been given to the concept of force in existing law, it also accords with the forms of action and intimidation practised by the particular groups with whose activities the Bill is designed to deal.  So far as I am concerned the whole of the definition is important and I cannot agree to any part of it being excised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, as drafted, the words I seek to have deleted in effect constitute a definition of the offence of conspiracy? They are quite unnecessary because if the substantive offence of forcible entry is to be committed it follows that conspiracy to commit it is an offence also.  This follows from the laws that exist and it is unnecessary to expand the definition of the word &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; to show conspiracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of this Bill which re-states existing law <Col N="302" /> in an up-to-date way.  It re-states in a specific way so that none of these people or groups with whom I am concerned can claim that they did not understand the position or complain that they are being prosecuted under ancient statutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's first statement relied on the terminology in ancient statutes for justifying the definition as framed but the statute of Richard II merely sets out that entry by force is illegal.  What it had in mind was forcible entry by a landlord.  I cannot see that persons against whom this Bill is aimed would be in any doubt regarding the meaning of &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo;.  It has been defined judically time and again.  It is a bad principle to bring into the definition section of an Act words which in effect create the offence of conspiracy. It is out of place there.</P>

No matter how the Minister may attempt to draft section 1, no <Col N="303" /> matter how he may attempt to define what may or may not be calculated to constitute forcible entry or what may or may not be construed by him to mean forcible entry, it cannot conceal the fundamental inconsistency of this basic piece of legislation.  So bereft is the Minister in his attempt to convince the House of the need for this legislation that he resorts to definitions at the beginning of section 1.  This is an approach which forces one to suspect its true intent.  I submit to the Minister that section 1&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Deputy Cooney's amendment is a very brave but rather futile effort I suspect, with respect to Deputy Cooney, to remove the confused intention of the Minister from this section.  The Minister should take a long hard look at it. In terms of the Constitution it is a lawyer's paradise.  It is a senior counsel's bonanza in terms of future legal cases.  I suggest that the Minister would be better off to withdraw the section and the Bill rather than to introduce <Col N="304" /> a defence against an amendment which, with respect to Deputy Cooney, is designed for debating purposes. We in the Labour Party have not put down an amendment because we find the whole section and, indeed, the amendment rather repugnant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to an extract from <i>The Garda Síochána Guide,</i> the fourth edition, page 323.  The Minister knows that this book is issued for the guidance of ordinary rank and file members of the Garda in the carrying out of their duties.  The paragraph I propose to read is headed &ldquo;Forcible Entry and Detainer.&rdquo;  It sets out to instruct ordinary rank and file members of the Garda in what constitutes &ldquo;forcible&rdquo;.  As I said in my opening remarks, there is no need to have this word defined at all because its ordinary meaning is quite clear and unambiguous, and it has been well defined judicially.  <i>The Garda Síochána Guide</i> says that everyone commits the misdemeanour called forcible entry &ldquo;who, in order to take possession thereof, enters upon any lands or tenements in a violent manner, whether such violence consists in actual force applied to any other person, or in threats, or in breaking open any house, or in collecting together an unusual number of persons for the purpose of making such entry. It is immaterial whether the person making such an entry had or had not a right to enter, provided that a person who enters upon land or tenements of his own, but which are in the custody of his servant or bailiff, does not commit the offence of forcible entry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear from that that it is already well settled that &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; is as defined by the opening words of the definition, and does not mean the words to which my amendment takes exception. It would be interesting also if I were to read for the Minister and the House the direction which up to now has been the standard direction to members of the Garda in matters of this nature.  It is by way of a footnote to that paragraph and it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> The Attorney General has stated his view that the evidence to substantiate charges of forcible entry and forcible detention must show such a force as constitutes a public breach of the peace, or such proceedings as constitute unlawful assembly. </P>
    <P>That direction immediately raises a question here with regard to the definition in this Bill as to whether &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; is to be construed in accordance with the direction of the Attorney General or to get a more narrow construction in the sense of its ordinary meaning. The author goes on to say&mdash;and again he is quoting the Attorney General's opinion; obviously a direction or an opinion was sought from the Attorney General on some particular problem:</P>
    <P>He has also pointed out, for future guidance, that in the Attorney General's Office the line has been taken for many years that the charge of forcible entry ought not, generally speaking, be used as a means of assisting in the enforcement of a civil right to possession of property. </P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give the page and the title of the book?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same book, the fourth edition of <i>The Garda Síochána Guide,</i> page 323.  That quotation is of immense significance when we consider the tenor of this definition and the Bill of which it stands a part.  The line of the Attorney General's Office has been for many years &ldquo;that the charge of forcible entry ought not, generally speaking, be used as a means of assisting in the enforcement of a civil right to possession of property&rdquo;. Yet here we have a Bill flying straight in the face of that perfectly sound and respectable and commendable legal principle as laid down by the Attorney General's Office.  The author goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Where a doubt exists as to whether police action should be taken in any particular case, proceedings should not be initiated by the Garda Síochána without prior consultation with the local State Solicitor, who may decide to seek a direction from the Attorney General. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> Interference by the Garda in what are essentially matters of civil law were regarded as so serious by the Attorney General that it was felt necessary to have a direction in the Garda Guide warning the Garda against interfering in a civil matter without at least consulting a State Solicitor, and more probably the Attorney General himself. This goes to the very root of our legal system.  It goes to the very existence of the rule of law on which our entire system depends.  It shows the regard of the Attorney General for that principle that it was introduced into the Garda Guide by way of warning, and yet we have this piece of legislation with this definition flying in the face of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how inconsistent somebody can become, because we have Deputy Cooney now making the case that this is something new, something flying in the face of everything that went before.  Five or ten minutes ago he was pointing out to the House that the definition which he wants to take out of the section is in fact a restatement of the law.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very significant that he quoted the Attorney General's direction about the non-user or the sparse user of the existing legislation, and the fact that it should not be used as a means of assisting the enforcement of a civil right.  That is the very point I made right through both my speeches on Second Reading.  It was funny to see this sudden turn around on the point now.  The fact of the matter is that the entire definition re-states in a concise statutory form the gist of the existing law in so far as it is stated in the first paragraph on page 323 of the Garda Guide.  Of course this is not a very authoritative legal textbook by any manner or means.  It is an attempt by the learned author&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and no doubt a <Col N="307" /> fairly successful attempt, to state in a concise and understandable way for non-lawyers the gist of the Common Law on this point.  It is made perfectly clear and perfectly simple in this definition. It is much more satisfactory. I have heard Deputies on all sides of the House say with regard to legal Bills that definitions of things like this should be modern and up-to-date and should be in statutes where they can be ascertained precisely by people who want to know what the law is on a particular matter.</P>

      <P>It is amusing to hear the Minister talking about a book for non-lawyers.  My recollection of this Garda Guide is that the opening pages are numbered off and everyone who wanted to defend people in the criminal courts tried to get a copy of it by hook or by crook.  So far as I know it was not for sale and I do not know if it is for sale now.  The Minister says this is just a handy book of no significance.  The fact is that it is the old RIC guide brought up to date.  To the best of my knowledge it was first produced more than a hundred years ago.  It is an excellent guide for any person who is interested in ascertaining what the Common Law is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney's amendment has a great deal to recommend it.  Take the word &ldquo;forcible&rdquo; itself in the title&mdash; and I shall have more to say on this when we come to the Title of the Bill. That should be &ldquo;Prohibition of Illegal Entry&rdquo; if we are to be realistic.  Despite the word &ldquo;forcible&rdquo; in the Title, if this Bill becomes law, cases will be brought before the courts where there is no question of forcible entry at all.  I ask a simple question: will a person be guilty of an offence under this Bill if he finds a door open, goes in and occupies a house or an apartment?  We in this party object to every part of this Bill and will have nothing to do with it, but I do agree with Deputy Cooney's approach, and I think the Minister's offhand approach about this handbook for the guidance of members of the Garda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Seeing that we are at the beginning of the Committee Stage of this Bill I would suggest to the Miniter that Deputy Cooney's amendment is not only fair and practical but elementary common sense.  I defy the Minister for Justice to give me a definition of the term contained in section 1 which would be deleted if Deputy Cooney's amendment were accepted, namely, &ldquo;participation in action&rdquo;.  That is a useful piece of legalism.  I can say to Johnny Murphy: &ldquo;I think that because you are standing in that doorway you are participating in action that will ultimately constitute a threat&rdquo;&mdash;not of forcible entry because that does not enter into the section&mdash;&ldquo;to use force.&rdquo; This is the kind of semantics dear to the heart of those who would love to have a piece of legislation to hammer the civil rights of everybody in this country simply because a few Sinn Féin people, a couple of housing action people, got on the Minister's nerves. That is the kind of nonsense that is in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another section here, which, with due deference to the Chair, is the one which should be deleted by the amendment, so I am quite in order in talking on it.  It says here: &ldquo;... for the purpose of participation in action or conduct with others&rdquo;.  There is a nice piece of parliamentary gobbledegook. Could the Minister give us a simple Webster Dictionary definition of &ldquo;conduct with others&rdquo;?  If Deputy Pattison and I decide to go to the toilet together are we indulging in infamous conduct or are we indulging in infamous conduct together if we decide to walk out and put our shoulders against a door and go into a house?  That kind <Col N="309" /> of thing brings parliamentary draftsmanship and the Fianna Fáil Party, the party renowned as the party of reality, into disrepute.  Take the other section which would be deleted by Deputy Cooney's amendment: &ldquo;... conduct with others in numbers&rdquo;.  If a husband and wife in bed together decide to have a bit of forcible entry against the approaches of the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Could the Minister, in all seriousness, give me a definition whereby I would be participating in action or conduct calculated to prevent <Col N="310" /> by intimidation?  There is a beautiful piece of draftsmanship.  It baffles the imagination.  I have not the slightest fear for the redundancy of barristers or solicitors because they have a magnificent source of constitutional litigation for decades to come.  It will be worth a fortune to anybody who takes up the legal profession.  All that the section boils down to is not forcible entry but a threat to use force.  This is not a definition of forcible entry.</P>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister he had good grounds for inserting in line 16 an exclamation mark, after the word &ldquo;forcible&rdquo;, when he concludes with the words &ldquo;and `forcible' shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;?  This Bill is hardly worth the paper on which it is written because it is so absurd.  It is important to point out here that only ten minutes ago the Minister said that Part I will bring about a concise statutory form.  All I can say in relation to that phrase is that Limerick people are lacking in conciseness. I had always thought that people from the south of Ireland and particularly those from Limerick were noted for saying what they wished to say and for saying it precisely and not to hedge about in that kind of spurious parliamentary draftsmanship which shows up the impossibility, under the written Constitution of this country, of trying to devise a piece of legislation which would take into account all the circumstances and which, in effect, would cover the kind of issues that the Minister has in mind.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that we are not in the least bit interested in what he thinks the Bill is all about.  All we are interested in is what is in the Bill and, to be polite, in relation to section 1 all that is in this is rubbish.  Deputy Cooney's amendment is one which should save the Minister from some embarrassment not only now but in relation to the remaining Stages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons:&mdash;1. Wrongly to injure or prejudice a third person or any body of men in any other manner.  2.  To commit any offence punishable by law.  3. To do any act with intent to prevent the course of justice. </P>
    <P>That is his definition of conspiracy. As drafted, the definition of the word &ldquo;forcible&rdquo; sets out clearly the offence of conspiracy and is completely out of place as part of the definition.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We have a definition of ownership.  For the purposes of this Bill, &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;any person having an estate or interest in land&rdquo;.  Section 2 goes on to say that a person who does anything that is prohibited by section 2 shall not be guilty of an offence if he is an owner within the definition contained in section 1.  The definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as &ldquo;any person having an estate or an interest in land&rdquo; means that this section, for the purposes of ownership, regards an owner as a person who is not entitled to go into land and who may never be entitled to occupy land. It defines a person who may be a fee farm grantor.  In many cases in this country fee farm grants were granted in 1750, in 1760 and in the 1800's. Those fee farm grants go on forever. In many cases they are subject to normal rent and they confer on the grantee the right forever to ownership, but here we are saying that a fee farm grantor, who may not even be resident in this country, can come back here and forcibly enter land on which a house has been built and on which thousands of pounds have been spent. Under this Act there will be no protection for the grantee.  In effect, we are saying that the grantor may come back and use any threats or force that he may think fit.  He may go in there and squat but the grantee will not be empowered to put him out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same goes for a landlord who grants a lease for 99 years or, for that matter, for 21 years.  He will not be entitled to occupation of the land save in accordance with such rights as may be reserved in the lease as long as the terms of the lease are observed.  Under this measure a perfectly law abiding lessee who observes every clause in the lease may find himself in a situation in which a landlord, whether it be in the case of a very long lease or a very short one, forcing his way into the premises will not be covered by the definition in section 2 and will be deemed not to have committed any offence.  If it was an offence for those <Col N="313" /> people who went into the Hume Street houses, as I believe it should have been, it certainly should equally be an offence for some landlord who may be hundreds of years removed from the right to occupation of land to go there and squat.  Under section 2 he should be guilty of an offence in the same way as anybody else.</P>
    <P>The amendment I propose merely protects the person who has a right to ownership at any given time and prohibits a fee farm grantor or a lessor from descending on his lawful tenant or grantee and using force to enter the premises.  Such a person should be as guilty of an offence as would any stranger who might come in and commit the offence of forcible entry.  I hope I have made myself clear because I have strong views on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support generally the views of Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The effect of his amendment must be considered in relation to that part which says &ldquo;and, in relation to land or a vehicle, any person acting on behalf of the owner&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;any person acting on behalf of the owner&rdquo; is so ridiculously broad that the Minister has no defence.  I find it impossible to believe that any responsible Minister for Justice would bring in a clause in a Bill, in relation to property rights and so on, which says &ldquo;any person acting on behalf of the owner&rdquo;.  Suppose a particular security firm is designated to act on behalf of the owner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I challenge the Minister to define what he meant by that.  Am I to believe that if an elder son of a property owner, after having a few drinks with his father, decides that he is now going to act on behalf of the father and says to the tenant &ldquo;Out you go, I am acting on behalf of the owner&rdquo; or if a security firm is appointed&mdash;we had an example of that in Hume Street&mdash;or if a caretaker suddenly becomes high and mighty acting on behalf of the owner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are grateful to Deputy Desmond for pointing out to us the danger, in view, under the Bill, of husbands and wives committing offences in bed, and I am happy to assure him that there is no possibility of that.  Similarly, his trip to the toilet with Deputy Pattison equally would <Col N="315" /> not come under the Bill, no matter what happened there.  However, unlike Deputy Desmond I should like to speak to Deputy Fitzpatrick's amendment.  I regret I cannot accept it for these reasons.  Sections 2 and 3 provide that a person who forcibly enters or occupies land shall be guilty of an offence unless, <i>inter alia,</i> he is the owner.  As I explained on the Second Stage the words &ldquo;any person having an estate or interest in land&rdquo; were included in the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; to ensure that the Bill will not apply&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;not apply&rdquo;&mdash;to incidents that arise in the course of private disputes between persons having different interests in the same land, for example, between landlord and tenant or between mortgager or mortgagee.  These are matters that should properly continue to be regulated by existing civil property law and I am perfectly satisfied that that will be the position as far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick expressed concern that under the Bill as drafted a head landlord or a fee farm grantor who had no right or entitlement under any circumstances, unless his rent was not paid, or the terms of the grant were broken, could enter the land with impunity. The answer to that criticism is of course that a tenant or grantee has ample remedy under existing civil law if the head landlord or grantor behaves in that way and those remedies are not affected by this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins and one or two other Deputies were concerned on the Second Stage lest an overholding tenant might leave himself open to prosecution for an offence under section 3 by remaining on after his tenancy had expired.  While I am not convinced that such a tenant would not have had an interest in the property within the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;estate or interest&rdquo; it is only reasonable to put the matter beyond doubt and the first of the amendments which I have tabled is designed to do this.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald alleged on the Second Stage that the Bill supported landlords against tenants in a way which was not done &ldquo;even in the most extreme periods of British oppression&rdquo;.  That is at column 134, volume 251, of the Official Report. Nothing in fact could be further from the truth.  As I said, this Bill by defining &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as including any person having an estate or interest in land effectively exempts both landlords and tenants from the scope of the offences created by sections 2 and 3. Accordingly, there is absolutely no basis for the suggestion that the Bill interferes in any way as between landlord or tenant or that it supports one such party against the other.  This is not a Landlord and Tenant Bill but a Bill to deal with the forcible entry on property by persons who have no right of any kind to that property.  To listen to Deputy FitzGerald one would imagine that he was disregarding completely the substantial body of law which regulates landlord and tenant relationships and which provides&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the words were deleted, my understanding of it is that one or other of the parties could seek to have the owner prosecuted; similarly as between mortgagor and mortgagee.  If the words are retained, the fee farm grantor or the mortgagee would not commit a criminal offence under the Bill and he would be left to seek his remedy, or the two parties would be left to seek their remedy, in the ordinary way in the civil court under the civil law.  That is what I seek to retain.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> My concern here is that under the Bill <Col N="318" /> as drafted the grantor or the landlord will be able to bulldoze his way into land which another person is entitled to occupy and he will not be guilty of the criminal offence that others entering would be guilty of.  In reply to me the Minister says the tenant has his civil remedy.  So has the landlord, but the Minister here is conferring a summary right on the landlord to go in and escape subsection (2).  Surely the Minister is aware that the very considerable body of opinion in this country opposing this Bill tooth and nail&mdash;I do not go all the way with them; I want to make that clear&mdash;are opposing it on the grounds that there are existing civil rights to deal with the position.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is the argument being put up by agitators up and down the country and that is the argument the Minister is using here against my amendment.  He cannot have it both ways.  A landlord or a grantor is not entitled to be put in any better position than any other person who is not entitled to immediate occupation of this land.  The Minister is doing that by saying that, while John Jones who is living under canvas down the road will be guilty of a criminal offence subject to fines and imprisonment if he goes into a house, a landlord who may come from the Isle of Wight and equally unlawfully and without any authority bulldozes his way into that house will not be guilty of an offence.  If I am thinking clearly, that is precisely the effect of this Bill.  I am more with the Minister on this Bill than a good many people are because I believe a man is entitled to the occupation of his private property.  That is why I put forward this amendment, to make sure that he will be entitled to the occupation of his private property against all and sundry, including his landlord or his grantor who is not entitled to possession so long as he observes the law and the terms of his lease or grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is satisfied to leave the tenant with the civil right against the landlord who invades him, why not leave the landlord with the same civil right?  I defy contradiction when I say <Col N="319" /> this will put the landlord in a preferential position and give him the right to act in a way that would be unlawful for any other person.  It will give the landlord a right to by-pass the courts and use illegal methods to get possession of his land if he wants to take it. We are concerned not with what may happen, as Deputy Desmond has said, but with what we are doing in this measure.  I persist in my objection to this particular definition; I think it is unnecessary.</P>

Where the tenant dies the family feel they have a right to the house but they are not covered by this and will be treated as squatters under this Bill. This will be very dangerous.  The matter could not be contested but they would feel they had a right to the house. Secondly, the Minister said the tenant can bring a civil action against the landlord.  Could he do that after going to prison?  I should like the Minister to answer those questions.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that the very reason why I feel these words should stay are the reasons why Deputy Fitzpatrick thinks they should go out. Obviously, we are both trying to achieve the same objective.  If we take them out we leave it open to one party or the other to make use of a criminal statute to solve his civil dispute and by leaving them in and by excluding any activities as between landlord and tenant from the criminal law under this Bill at least we are ensuring that the Bill is not used, as I do not want it to be used or as Deputy Fitzpatrick or anybody else does not want it to be used, to enforce civil rights as between one party and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the difficulty that the words were deliberately put in to exclude disputes between landlord and tenant or between grantor and grantee. Deputy Fitzpatrick's point, as I understand it, is that because they are excluded therefore the grantor will do things which would otherwise be a crime if he were not a grantor under <Col N="320" /> the Bill.  I do not see any possibility of that and the grantee, of course, has ample rights if any improper entry was made on the grantee's land.  I see the point Deputy Fitzpatrick is making and I suppose there is a very remote academic possibility that some fee farm grantor might decide: &ldquo;I will not commit a crime by going into this property but I will commit a tort and I will be subject to the ordinary action&rdquo; but I do not see the fact that he does not commit a crime would in any way encourage him to do it.  He might allege that he is not committing a crime at the moment in going in and the fact that he then would not commit one would not, I think, have any effect on him.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister complains that if we take out these words we would be using a criminal statute to enforce civil rights. I do not agree with that.  If we take out these words we are doing no more than using a criminal statute to preserve the <i>status quo.</i> If we leave in these words we are saying to the landlord or the grantor: &ldquo;You may use forcible entry, you may short-circuit the civil law, you may short-circuit the courts and we shall see to it that you are not guilty of a criminal offence.&rdquo;  That is a fair and accurate summary of what we are doing.  If we leave out these words we are then going to see to it that if the landlord wants to enforce his rights he will do it through the courts; if he takes the law into his own hands he will do it at his own peril and if the tenant wants to enforce his rights he will have to do likewise.  I take it that is not an unreasonable proposition.</P>
      <P>When one analyses this one finds it is a strange measure in some respects, because it is going to prevent all squatting and all forcible entry; and I am in favour of that within certain limits.  It goes on to strengthen the hands of the landlord unnecessarily so, and that is what I object to.  This is where the whole measure will fall into disrepute and that is where the people who oppose it, if they analyse it closely, will find further ammunition for their argument against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather that the Minister is not <Col N="321" /> altogether comfortable with this.  He says that he and I want to do the same thing.  All I want to do is to make sure that the citizen who is exercising lawful rights in respect of the occupation of property will have those rights preserved as against everybody in the world, including the unlawful landlord. I do not think that is an unreasonable proposition.  If the Minister considers it he will come to the conclusion that if a landlord has some reason for going into a property he has the law there at his disposal&mdash;he has the civil courts and he should avail of them.  Most landlords are people of property, people of means.  The Minister wants to say that the landlord can break the law if he likes, take possession unlawfully of the property and the onus is put on the tenant to get him out.  The tenant may be a man of humble means and there is no legal aid in this country.  The onus has been shifted around in favour of the landlord against the tenant and I do not think this is the kind of legislation that should be taken at the present time.</P>

      <P>The Minister has had a tough day today.  He split the party down the middle on the Unemployment Assistance Order and there was all hell to pay at 12 o'clock, but I am afraid we have got to come back to the so-called prohibition of forcible entry.  I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick will agree it is ironic that legislation which comes before Parliament very <Col N="322" /> often sets out to do the reverse of what is intended and this in practice is what is being done here.  Bearing in mind the history of litigation in relation to property and the rather questionable manner in which property inheritance evolved in this country as between family and family and estate and estate anybody can claim, certainly for the purpose of holding up proceedings, that they come magnificently under the phrase used by the Minister: &ldquo;any person having an estate or interest in land&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks the Minister spoke about &ldquo;concise statutory intent&rdquo; and certainly anybody wanting to tie himself up in knots in terms of intent can do so under this section. The Minister said he was not anxious to have it open to one party or another to avail of criminal proceedings and he spoke about a remote academic possibility that this could occur.  He knows perfectly well that we are not interested in a High Court interpretation of what was in the Minister's mind in regard to this Bill.  All we are interested in is what is contained in the Bill as drafted.  We suggest that what is in the Bill is going to lead to eternal confusion and disservice in relation to property legislation.</P>
      <P>Members of the Labour Party who oppose this Bill are automatically told by the Minister that they favour squatting, forcible entry and the abuse of property rights, but the Minister knows perfectly well this is not the policy of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>It is not the policy of the Labour Party to make a situation which at the moment might in some relatively minor respects be difficult. I do not see any reason why the Minister should refuse to accept this amendment simply because a few hundred people decided to have some fish-ins on agricultural property or to take over a castle in the dead of night and amuse themselves there for a couple of hours until they were, correctly and properly, removed by the Garda Síochána, or because they questioned the rather questionable rights of the <Col N="323" /> ancient lords of Ireland to the property or the estate which they deemed themselves to hold because of some historical obligation.  This all boils down to the Minister, having looked at the situation and having been rather dubious about his entitlement, saying to the parliamentary draftsman, &ldquo;Bring up something fast; the party does not give a curse&rdquo;.  There is not even a backbencher behind the Minister to show an interest in this vital piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has quite rightly put forward an amendment suggesting the deletion of the words &ldquo;any person having an estate or interest in land.&rdquo; My parents come from rural Ireland. They would not have to go beyond half a mile of Millstreet in north Cork to find many a person who would maintain that he has more than a particular involvement in an estate or land and he would have a bit of paradise under this section of the Bill.  The Minister should, without further embarrassment to himself, withdraw the section, have a good night's sleep on it and consult with the Taoiseach.  He does not even know what is going on these days, and I very much doubt even with his legal training, admittedly it was not practised very much&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They <Col N="324" /> were usually small pieces of land, the site for a house or a number of houses. The landlord, or grantor, never built any of the houses usually.  The grantee spent, maybe, thousands of pounds building or rebuilding a house on this bit of land from the grantor.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, line 27, after &ldquo;interest in land&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(including a person who remains in occupation <Col N="326" /> of land after the determination of his tenancy therein), the owner of the servient tenement (in relation to an easement or profit <i>à prendre)</i>, the owner of an easement or profit <i>à prendre</i> (in relation to the servient tenement)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The opening words which appear in brackets are designed to make clear that the phrase &ldquo;interest in land&rdquo;, where it appears in the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;, will include an overholding tenant.  Some Deputies were concerned lest, by remaining on after his tenancy had in fact expired, such a person might leave himself open to prosecution under section 3 of the Bill.  While I am far from convinced that such a tenant would not have an interest in land within the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;estate or interest&rdquo;, I am satisfied to put the matter beyond doubt as provided for in the first part of the amendment.</P>
    <P>The second part of the amendment reproduces in a form that is acceptable to the parliamentary draftsman the substance of what Deputy Cooney is, I believe seeking to achieve in his amendment, No. 5.  The idea of extending the definition of owner to include the owner of a servient tenement is acceptable but I think that logically the definition should also cover the owner of an easement or profit <i>à prendre.</i> This would ensure that neither the grantor nor the grantee of these incorporeal rights would run the risk of committing offences under section 2 or section 3 in relation to each other's interests.  As I have emphasised, it was not intended that the Bill should apply to any incidents which may arise in the course of private disputes arising between persons having different interest in or over the same land.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Deputy will have no difficulty in accepting the official amendment in lieu of the one tabled by him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two legs.  The first deals with the permissible occupant; the Minister describes him as the overholding tenant.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the person genuinely, but wrongly, in possession will not be subject to the sanctions of the Bill.  I widened the definition of <Col N="327" /> owner to include the permissive occupier. The Minister's overholding tenant could also be classed as a permissive occupier, but that narrows the categories of permissive occupier.  I have in mind the type of person who might be a caretaker or a herdsman. He would not be overholding on the termination of the contractual tenancy; he would be there <i>ab initio</i> by permission. To terminate status all that would be necessary is a simple and informal demand for possession and the protection which permissive occupancy gives is then removed.  He has no interest in the land and he will be completely at the mercy of the Bill.  Consequently, it is impossible to confine the exemption to a person remaining on as an overholding tenant on the expiration of a notice to quit.  The spirit of the Minister's amendment, like my amendment, is to meet what I have in mind&mdash;to cover innocent persons in possession after permissive occupancy has been ended.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that before we get on to subservient and dominant tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A person such as a permissive occupant should not, to the extent that his entry or occupation is covered by the permission which was granted to him, be liable to find himself in a position in which he might be guilty of an offence.  It was never intended and I am quite satisfied that the Bill as drafted would not have that effect.  In relation to the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; a person acting on behalf of the owner would presumably come within that definition of &ldquo;permissive occupant&rdquo; in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have in mind is the situation of a caretaker or perhaps a person minding a gate lodge. There was indeed an example in Laois/ Offaly only a short time ago in which we had the public spectacle of the bailiff with the battering ram where a person was in occupation of a gate lodge by permission and that permission was revoked.  That person then refused to leave and actually bolted the door against the bailiff.  The Minister said that he did not think the Bill as drafted would have the effect of bringing in a &ldquo;permissive occupant&rdquo;.  I <Col N="328" /> think it would because as drafted &ldquo;owner&rdquo; at its vaguest means a person with an estate or an interest in land.  Once a demand for possession is served on a permissive occupant, and it need only be an informal demand, his permission is withdrawn and he then technically has no interest in the premises.  Consequently if that permissive occupant, who might have been there for many years in his own right and who might have succeeded generations of predecessors in the permissive occupancy of the premises, could find himself after maybe 50 or 60 years family occupation, in a position where he would have to bolt the door against the owner.  He would find himself then committing an offence.  I think that would be wrong.  This is percisely what happened at Tullamore some weeks ago where the person in occupation of a gate lodge did not get out when requested to do so by the landlord and bolted the door against the landlord. If this Bill were in operation that person would be committing a criminal offence because he would have no interest in land.  He would not be an overholding tenant because his tenancy was not founded on contract, it was founded on permission.  That is why I think that to have the saver limited to overholding tenants is to narrow it too much and I think the Minister is not doing himself justice.</P>

      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 38 and 39 and substitute:</P>
      <P>(3)  Nothing in this Act shall apply to an entry or an occupation of land or a vehicle in the exercise of lawful authority or with the permission of the owner.</P>
      <P>I think this would cover this point. One of the difficulties is that under section 2 an offence is not committed by an owner but the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is so wide that it would include someone who is, in fact, a permissive occupant.</P>

      <P>But if the permission is withdrawn the Deputy will agree with me that, equitably, he is in a less strong position than an overholding tenant.  I think it is valid to draw a distinction between a former permissive occupant and an overholding tenant.  An overholding tenant may still have an equitable estate to some extent. A former permissive occupant has none whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is only one part of it.  The Minister is quite right. I introduced the amendment regarding the servient tenement to deal with the question of the owner of land over which some person might have a right of way to perhaps a fishery or just a right of way, and if the owner of the land being the owner of the servient tenement locked the gate against the dominant tenement that he would not draw on himself the rigour of this Bill.  I am glad to see that the amendment is being accepted, but the very fact that the amendment had to be made and that the Minister has widened it will point up the difficulty and the ridiculousness of trying to bring into what is completely a matter for the civil code a criminal sanction. In my amendment I say:</P>
      <P>and including also the owner of a servient tenement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> The Minister in this amendment says:</P>
    <P>The owner of the servient tenement (in relation to an easement or profit <i>à prendre),</i> the owner of an easement or profit <i>à prendre</i> (in relation to the servient tenement).</P>
    <P>I think the proper expression there is: &ldquo;the owner of the dominant tenement&rdquo;. It would then follow that it is the dominant tenement in relation to certain incorporeal rights being either an easement or a profit <i>à prendre</i>.  The point is that the owner of the dominant tenement is the person entitled to the right of way.  Take, for example, if I have a right of way over the Minister's lands to my lands, my lands are the dominant tenement and the Minister's lands the servient tenement.  Is that agreed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the fact that you own a profit <i>à prendre</i> or an easement does not mean that the easement or the profit <i>à prendre</i> is the dominant tenement.  The dominant tenement could only refer to other land.  The incorporeal right in itself is not a dominant tenement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot exist <i>in vacuo</i>.  There must be a dominant tenement to which it is attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have a profit <i>à prendre</i> in gross without attachment to a dominant tenement, for example in fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you could not have an easement.  However, the point is that the owner of a dominant tenement under this Bill might be in a situation where he would be invoking the Garda authorities to visit criminal punishment on someone who interfered with his rights and perhaps a third party.  At the same time, he could not take an action for trespass for damages against the third party.  The owner of a dominant tenement cannot maintain an action for trespass on the servient tenement against a third party.  An action that he cannot bring under the civil code is now liable to be made a criminal offence.  This is one of the ridiculous results that will come from this statute.  It is unavoidable when you <Col N="332" /> start bringing the criminal code into the realm of the civil law.</P>
      <P>I could foresee situations where rights of fishery are involved: for example, the fish-ins, against which the Minister is aiming this Bill, come into play.  Where there is profit <i>à prendre</i>&mdash;the right to take the fish&mdash;and an easement&mdash;the right-of-way across land &mdash;one could be in deep legal water in an attempt to exercise those rights. The question would arise as to whether some of the rights which this Bill is seeking to protect were easements or profit <i>à prendre</i>&mdash;for example, that they would not be irrevocable licences. As Deputy Desmond pointed out, there is here a meaty bit of work for lawyers. If a Bill can have those consequences, particularly in regard to criminal law, it is an unsuitable piece of legislation. Above all, the criminal law must be clear.  If it can lead to intricate and highly technical legal consequences it is defective.</P>
      <P>My amendment, which includes the owner of the servient tenement, is sufficient without bringing in the owner of the easement or the profit <i>à prendre</i> and the person entitled to the dominant tenement.  At that stage you are opening the door to exemptions and to quite ridiculous situations.  One can consider the various type of easements that exist: for example, the right of light, there can be an easement over water and the right-of-way over land.  Under the Bill if a person's easement in respect of light is forcibly interfered with by a third party a criminal offence can be committed. This is not the case if it is interfered with by the owner of a servient tenement as he is protected by the amendments.  If a third party for some reason decided to diminish the amount of light to which the owner of that easement were entitled, the third party could be prosecuted under the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the servient tenement in the case of the right to light. The servient tenement would be the adjoining building which cannot obscure the right to light.  The dominant tenement is the person entitled to receive the light and the servient is the property over which the light passes.  They are the two persons involved.  If a third party intervenes and diminishes the right to light it would appear that we would have the ridiculous situation that that person would be committing a criminal offence.  I do not think that this would be good law.  There are various other easements&mdash;easements to repair, support, perhaps to take turbary, which could lead to all kinds of contentions in rural Ireland.  These are matters that should be settled by the parties involved and the criminal law should not be invoked. The criminal law can be invoked; it is no answer for the Minister to say that these are extreme examples and that it will not be invoked.  That is begging the question because it can be invoked in an area in which it has no business.  It is bad for the law and is not necessary.</P>

So far as the latter part of my amendment is concerned, it differs from the amendment put down by the Deputy only in that quite logically it extends the exemption to the owner of the easement or profit <i>à prendre</i> as well as the owner of the servient tenement.  I think Deputy Cooney must agree that it is only logical to do this.  It is extended to the owner of the easement or profit <i>à prendre,</i> not to the owner of the dominant tenement.  It seems to me not only illogical but unfair to have it one way and not the other way&mdash;which is the very thing all of us on both sides are trying to avoid doing.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is in effect to extend subsection (3) of section 1 by providing that nothing in the Act shall apply to an entry or an occupation of property with the permission of the owner.  In this respect the amendment covers what I think Deputy Cooney was trying to achieve in amendment No. 5 by his reference to a permissive occupier.  Where a person has permission to enter or occupy land it is, of course, right that his entry or occupation, to the extent that it is covered by the permission granted, should not be capable of rendering him guilty of an offence under section 2 or section 3.  It would be possible to ensure this by suitably extending the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; but that approach would have an unintended and undesirable side effect in that, for example, when the Bill speaks in section 2 of a person who forcibly enters land being asked to leave by the owner, the reference to &ldquo;owner&rdquo; would include a person who was merely on the land with the owner's permission.  This would clearly be undesirable because, of course, such a person would have no right to speak for the owner or to exercise any of the rights of ownership in relation to a third party.</P>

The word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; no matter how vaguely used is to be the all important thing.  This amendment says that anybody who takes possession of property forcibly, provided he does so with the permission of the owner, will not be guilty of an offence.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Owner&rdquo; means the fee farm grantor, a person who is not entitled himself to possession of the land.  Suppose this fee farm grantor were devilish enough or mischievous enough, he <Col N="336" /> could authorise some man of straw and give him permission to go in and squat in somebody's house, and the occupier would have to rely on the civil law to get him out, and might be put to very, very considerable expense in getting him out.  The Minister may say that I am taking a very far-fetched example but I am not, because I should like to go back to&mdash;I was going to say the late Mr. Boland&mdash;the former Minister for Local Government and his belted friends about whom he spoke in this House.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Belted friends.  Assume for the moment that the fee farm grantor of a Georgian house which is scheduled for demolition for some very laudable or very worthy purpose wants to co-operate with people who, according to a lot of other people, quite unreasonably, want that house to be retained.  If he believes that at all costs the house should be preserved, all he has to do, if this definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is passed, is to give permission to anyone he likes, or to any number of people he likes, to go in there and squat.  They will not be committing an offence and the Minister cannot put them out.  If this Bill had been in force when the Hume Street episode was in full flight, if the fee farm grantor of one of those houses, or the lessor under a lease for 10,000 years, had given permission to the protesters to go in there, they would have been entitled to go in and the Minister could have done nothing about it.</P>

    <P>With all due respect to the Minister he has drafted this Bill badly.  He should have spent more time on it.  He should have another look at it.

The Minister accused me earlier on of making fun of him and of his Bill.  Amendment No. 6 proposed by the Minister says:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 38 and 39 and substitute:</P>
      <P>(3)  Nothing in this Act shall apply to an entry or an occupation of land or a vehicle in the exercise of lawful authority or with the permission of the owner. </P>
      <P>A cursory examination of that amendment exposes the need for having a sense of humour in dealing with this Bill.  The tragedy of it, of course, is that, having regard to the fact that political legislation is brought before this Dáil for an entirely different purpose from that for which it was drafted, it will take a half a dozen cases in the law courts, following the passage of this Bill, to expose the inherent inconsistency of amendment No. 6.  Therefore, we should not spend much more time on it but, perhaps, pass on to amendment No. 7 in which the Minister provides gratuitously, as he will discover, that the Bill will not apply to trade disputes, for which we must express profound thanks.</P>

      <P>The whole tenor of all the amendments so far to the definition section has been to widen the categories of persons who will not be affected by the Bill.  There is the difficulty of making it too wide so as to make the Bill ineffectual or of making it too narrow so as to be unjust to people who should not come within its scope.  It is gradually getting wider and wider.  We have exempted permissive tenants and overholding tenants; we have exempted persons having any interest or estate in land, persons lawfully in occupation of it.  We have now exempted persons who are there with lawful authority or with the permission of the owner and, in addition, any person acting on behalf of the owner.  That lets in a very wide <Col N="338" /> category of people when the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is already so widely defined. Then there is the case of a person acting on behalf of the owner.</P>

One begins to wonder what is the point of the legislation when the exemptions are so wide and there are so many legal loopholes contained within the exemptions, room for so many legal arguments, that the Bill appears, at this stage, to be ineffectual. The Minister's last amendment will further widen the scope of the exemptions.  It is perfectly commendable to avoid innocent people being caught by a criminal statute but the Bill now exempts so many people that it is shown up to be what it always was, unrealistic and not at all a suitable or necessary piece of legislation for our society.</P>

I do not want the legislation to apply to anyone who has any shadow of right in the place.  That is the reason for this amendment.  Deputy Fitzpatrick produced what I think even he will agree was a very far-fetched example.  It is really an extension of his argument in regard to his own amendment No. 3.

I gather now the Minister thinks that is what the Bill says.  The Bill does not say that.  The Bill says that an owner, for the purpose of this Act, is a person who has an estate or interest in land.  A fee farm grantor or a lessor certainly has an estate or interest in land.  That is elementary. Such a person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let us say that Lord So-and-So is very interested in the protection and preservation of Georgian architecture &mdash;and I respect the views of people who believe that these Georgian houses should be preserved.  It is a point of view, but it could very well happen&mdash;and the Minister will not contradict me here&mdash;that Lord So-and-So, who believes in the preservation of Georgian architecture, would be the fee farm grantor or the head lessor of a house of the Georgian type which was about to be demolished.  If that landlord or grantor authorised an army of protesters to go into that house and squat there, then this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be useless in the hands of the Attorney General or the Garda from the point of view of getting possession of the house and the Minister would be right back where he started.  If that is what the Minister wants he should say it.  I happen to be more with the Minister in regard <Col N="340" /> to this Bill than he thinks.  I believe that the occupier should be protected but I do not believe that this Bill is protecting the occupier.  It was drafted without due thought for the occupier and with too much thought for the person with a remote interest in land.</P>

Therefore, any problem that might arise under this amendment, No. 6, would arise or would not arise, depending on how No. 3 was dealt with, so I suggest that the problem will be overcome by our reconsideration at Report Stage of No. 3.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 39, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>(4)  Nothing in this Act shall affect the law relating to acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute within the meaning of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment in order to make it clear that nothing in the Bill will affect acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.  It was never the intention that the Bill should apply to acts of that kind and my amendment will have the effect of specifically excluding such matters from the scope of the Bill.  When this Bill is enacted the position will be that anything done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute which would be lawful under existing law will continue to be lawful and anything which <Col N="341" /> would be unlawful now will continue to be unlawful.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;an act done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&rdquo; are used in the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  Their meaning has been well established in case law.  For an act to be done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, the dispute must be imminent and the act must be done in expectation of and with a view to it, or, alternatively, the dispute must already exist and the act must be done with the support of one of the parties.  In either case, the act must be genuinely done as described. The term &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; is itself defined in the Act of 1906 and has also been the subject of interpretation in case law.</P>
    <P>Acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute are already exempt from certain aspects of the ordinary criminal and civil law. Section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, provides a measure of immunity in this sphere from the law of criminal conspiracy and section 1 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, extends the immunity to civil conspiracy.</P>

      <P>(5)  Nothing in this Act shall be regarded as conferring on any person any right to entry or occupation of land which did not exist immediately before the commencement of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to allay the fears of those Deputies who, on Second Stage, inferred that a right which does not already exist is being conferred on persons to enter or occupy land.  As I said earlier, I am satisfied <Col N="342" /> that there is no basis whatever for such fears because while the Bill makes it an offence forcibly to enter or occupy land in certain circumstances, it does not contain any provision that could even remotely be construed as conferring a right of entry or occupation that does not exist at present.  From the legal point of view, there is no necessity for this amendment but I have put it down in order to prevent any misunderstanding or deliberate misrepresentation of what is in fact in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This highlights what I said earlier in regard to amendment No. 6 which was that the further we go in debating this, the clearer it becomes that it is a most difficult Bill and that the whole fear of the Minister is that it may affect innocent persons.  Naturally, it is a commendable fear but what sort of a wrong does it seek to remedy when it is so full of danger for innocent persons?  One can only come to the conclusion that the wrong and the abuse must be so minimal within our society as to be underserving of a piece of criminal legislation to try to right it. This has been my case all along in regard to this particular Bill.  There is another way of remedying what is a trivial abuse within our society.  It is now clear that the Minister and the Government accept that the abuse is minimal and is being perpetrated by a very narrow section of our society.  It is almost impossible to draft a piece of criminal legislation that will effectively contain that particular section while impinging on the rights of no other section.  So long as society does not suffer from an ailment that is widespread and potentially harmful enough to merit an easily applied piece of criminal legislation, society is not ready for such legislation and does not need it.  It is bad to bring in legislation that is not obviously needed.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party's point of view in relation to section 1 should be stated at this stage.  We believe that section 1 should be opposed.  We are vehemently opposed <Col N="343" /> to squatting as such by individuals or by groups of individuals either on public or private property.  We do not accept that there is a need for the provisions in section 1.  We consider the Bill to be unduly sweeping in its overall implications for the civil and the political rights of all our people.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that the Minister in advancing the various ambiguities in section 1 made very little reference to the purpose of section 1, and entirely related it to his concept of the use of force by persons other than the owners of property.  To take one part of section 1, it is stated on line 28 &ldquo;any person acting on behalf of the owner...&rdquo;.  I consider that to be entirely reprehensible. Does this mean that if a security firm in this city decide to act on behalf of an owner, using whatever legal means they wish, they are perfectly entitled, under the full protection of the criminal law, so to act?  Does this mean any relative of an owner, or any person acting on behalf of the owner? It does not even say &ldquo;any unauthorised person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The implications of section 1 are entirely unacceptable to the Labour Party.  This brings me to a comment made by an impeccable moral authority, the Reverend Father Enda McDonagh, Professor of Moral Theology at Maynooth College.  He made a very cryptic comment on this Bill with direct reference to section 1. He said that the Bill gave him a vision of a society which he found impossible to take.  He said this a couple of months ago.  He also said that the Government ought not to be tackling the symptoms that deprive the weak; they should be tackling the strong who are responsible, and he said that this Bill is designed to protect the strong even further.  I think that Deputy Cooney, Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Fitzpatrick would agree with me that this can affect the overall position in regard to the Bill, which is an unbalanced Bill, a Bill I might say, given extreme prominence by the Government in their legislative programme away and beyond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The definition of what might constitute a threat to use force is something which has already been amply elaborated on by ourselves here tonight and has been shown up to be the spurious piece of drafting which it is.  There is nothing in section 1 which can afford us any comfort whatsoever in our approach to this legislation.  It would be quite impossible for the Minister to bring in a section which would cover the very many contingencies which he has tried to cover in a very clumsy way.

      <P>Not only have they done as good a job as they possibly could do but the Minister gave them an impossible task, a contradictory task and I might say a vindictive task and I do not use that word lightly.  The Minister gave them the job of producing what has been described by almost every responsible editor in the country and by anybody with a shred of liberality as retrograde legislation.  Any person who owns property or any person enjoying the use of property, any solicitor, barrister or any member of the judiciary reading that section could certainly drive a coach and four through it.  The Minister will very much regret that he has produced this definition section in such a ridiculous way.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On the Second Reading I said that I accepted the Bill in principle in so <Col N="345" /> far as I wished to protect the rights of an occupier of land or a building to the occupation of that land or building, but I also said that the Bill would need many amendments before it would be acceptable to me.  The fact that the Minister has seen fit to table four amendments to the definition section goes to show that the Bill was drafted in haste, that the section was drafted in haste at a time when there was considerable squatting and forcible entry in this city.  It was drafted in that sort of atmosphere.  The Minister, as I say, has put down four amendments to the section and he has promised to consider at least two other amendments put down by Deputy Cooney and myself.</P>
      <P>I would find it impossible to support the section as it stands were it not for the fact that the Minister has promised to have another look at my amendment No. 3, which is directly related to his amendment No. 6.  The Minister will see how absurd amendment No. 6 would be if amendment No. 3, or something like it, is not given effect to. I am convinced that the Minister will see clearly that he will have to do something about this definition of ownership because otherwise the Bill will be a farce and will be unworkable. There is no use putting on the Statute Book legislation that is absolutely meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first definition is in regard to the word &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; and the Minister refused to accept our amendment to let that read &ldquo;the use, or threatening to use force in relation to personal property&rdquo; and persisted in retaining within the definition what is in effect a definition of the offence of conspiracy.  There is no doubt that the tenor of the Bill is penal and repressive and the state of our society does not demand such legislation in this day and age.  I am very conscious that the amendments which we have been discussing have been designed to soften the impact of the Bill.  The Minister has shown himself anxious to widen the exemptions, to make sure that any person that, as he says himself, has even a shadow of right in relation to property will not be prosecuted.  That is commendable but it highlights the fact <Col N="346" /> that there is no evil in our society which demands a piece of repressive criminal legislation to remedy it.  There was a minor problem, the result of a social wrong, and the way to tackle it is not with criminal legislation.  Possibly, as a lawyer, the Minister is aware of the value of the idea of the rule of law, that the law should be enforced equally on all citizens and should never be unjust or repressive.  This Bill is a breach of that rule which is the keystone of any democracy.  Any part of such a Bill, irrespective of what good may be in it, if its general tenor has that effect, must be repugnant.</P>

      <P>I do not like in any way to criticise the Chair but I wonder where we are going.  We are on section 1 and there have been a number of amendments proposed and these were very ably and fully discussed.  We are now considering a section which is composed of definitions.  We may have strong views as to what &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; should mean, whether it should merely mean using or threatening to use force in relation to person or property or whether it should mean the added words contained in section 1.  We may have views also as to what &ldquo;owner&rdquo; means, whether it should mean the words contained in the section or the words proposed to be added in different amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that, from the point of view of the Committee of the House, in so far as those who hold the views which were expressed&mdash;in my view very sincerely&mdash;this is not the section in relation to which they are appropriate.  This is merely the section defining the terms to be used in relation to the subsequent sections of the Bill.  Having passed the Second Reading of the Bill I think section 1, in principle, has been agreed to subject to whatever amendments would be incorporated. I am suggesting that this is a matter that might be taken so that we could get to the more important sections of the Bill which I think are the subsequent sections.  I would have supported it but I would also have supported a change in the definition of &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; and other suggested amendments to the section.  These have not been carried by the Committee of the <Col N="347" /> House and now the only question is whether this section, which is purely a definition section, should stand so that sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 may be considered in the light of these definitions. I think we should get on to sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 and decide the matter as qiuckly as possible.</P>

We are adamant in saying that there is no need for the criminal law to be extended by means of definition in this Bill into an area concerned with resolving conflicting property interests if the problem can be resolved either by improving relevant civil proceedings or availing of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Suppose that by a not improbable circumstance this side of the House suddenly found itself with a majority and section 1 were deleted from the Bill we would then, I imagine, unless there was an intervention of a force outside our control, go quietly to section 2 and discuss it without any definition of what &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; or &ldquo;owner&rdquo; might mean and we would find ourselves <Col N="348" /> in rather a peculiar position.  It would seem to me that, however strongly people may feel about it, it is at least a good thing to have the terms used in section 2 defined so that we can understand what is meant in the section rather than have them at large without definition.  Section 2, if the terms are not defined, becomes a much more repressive section than, in fact, it is.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c)  he enters in pursuance of a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section is perfectly in accord with the amendment which the Minister introduced to the definition section, section 1.  Section 2 creates an offence by a person who forcibly enters land or a vehicle unless he is the owner of the land or the vehicle or if he is not the owner he does not interfere with it and leaves it in a peaceful way when called upon to do so.  The amendment puts in a third exemption, &ldquo;unless he enters in pursuance of a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right&rdquo;.  When we were discussing the first section the Minister was at pains to make sure that no innocent person would be inadvertently caught by this Act.  I have put down this amendment to introduce a further paragraph into the section in order to ensure that no innocent person who enters in pursuance of a <i>bona fide</i> claim of right would be guilty of an offence.  As the Minister said, and I quote his exact words, because they impressed me at the time: &ldquo;I do not want the Act to apply to anyone who has even a shadow of a right.&rdquo;  That was a very commendable statement and it meets my amendment exactly as I intended it.</P>

In fact, we would be against even the owner himself having the right to forcibly enter the land because, as we have seen far too often in the past, particularly where persons are acting on behalf of the owner, they have been shown to be rather ruthless in the way in which they enter such buildings and in the treatment they mete out to people they find occupying such buildings.  The amendment does not help the situation because it gives the person acting on behalf of the owner, who, as I have said, could be anybody at all, certain rights which we do not feel they should have under this section.</P>

Such a claim resulting in a supposition by the person that he had a right to act as he did is a defence to charges involving various types of offences including <i>inter alia</i> malicious damage, larceny and other crimes against property.  Since a claim of right concerns the state of mind of the accused it has the effect, if successfully established, of negativing <i>mens rea.</i></P>

      <Col N="351" /> It is, of course, the general common law rule that a crime cannot be committed unless there is <i>mens rea</i> and this rule is imported into a penal statute unless a contrary intention is expressed or implied.  I am advised that no such contrary intention is expressed or implied in either section 2 or section 3 of the Bill.  Indeed, in so far as section 5 acknowledges the possibility of a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership by a person charged with an offence under section 2 or 3, the Bill contains a strong pointer to the presence of the requirement of <i>mens rea</i> and the availability of claim of right as a defence in relation to these offences.</P>
    <P>In the statutes relating to malicious damage to property, the defence of claim of right is provided in the case of some offences but not in the case of others.  Nevertheless, the courts have held that the defence is available in respect of all such offences.  Where the defence has been provided by statute, as in section 52 of the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, it has been criticised as unnecessary and as restricting the defence that existed at common law.</P>
    <P>Claim of right is only one of many grounds of exemption from criminal responsibility which exist at common law.  These grounds include insanity, incapacity because of age, dress, necessity, mistake and so on, but it is not of course the practice to write them into every penal statute.  There is good reason for this, because the common law rules relating to these matters are supported and governed by a substantial body of case law and there is always the very real danger of unintentionally altering or narrowing the scope of one of the rules in attempting to write them into statute law.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, as I said at the outset, I am prepared to accept the substance of the amendment if the House so agrees and if it would make Deputies opposite a little happier.  My acceptance is subject to the making of two minor changes, which we could perhaps agree here and now if the House is willing. In section 2, to which amendment No. 9 relates, it will be necessary to add the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; at the end of paragraph <Col N="352" /> (b).  In section 3, which speaks of a person who &ldquo;remains in forcible occupation of land&rdquo;, <i>et cetera,</i> amendment No. 10 will have to be altered to read, &ldquo;or so remains in pursuance&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;or has entered thereon in pursuance&rdquo;.  Clearly, the claim of right must relate to the remaining in forcible occupation and not to the entry, since an offence under section 3 could occur even though the manner of entry was lawful.</P>

      <P>May I say I was speaking to the Minister and I asked him to intervene and he did intervene to make this concession?  I do not say &ldquo;concession&rdquo; in any sort of ungenerous way because this is, in my opinion, a major change in this Bill. This change is due largely to the way in which Deputy Fitzpatrick put the argument in the Second Reading debate and to Deputy Cooney's intervention on this Committee Stage.  This is, of course, a major change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major change in the Bill.  If the Minister wants modern law, there is a section on our Statute Book which says that anyone who imports arms without a licence shall be guilty of an offence. That is an absolute offence.  The importation of arms is absolutely prohibited and if a person imports arms, thinking he has a permit from the Minister for Justice, discovering later that it had been forged, that person has committed an offence although he had no <i>mens rea,</i> no guilty intention, no malice.  That is what is known as an absolute offence.  These absolute offences are not known to the common law but they are known to our statute law.  Far too frequently in this House, ill-advised from time to time&mdash;I do not say by the present Minister, but certainly by some Ministers&mdash;Deputies are asked to pass Draconian sections, sections imposing absolute prohibitions on a course of conduct and things that <Col N="353" /> people might do, irrespective of what they intend.  Section 2 of this Bill was just such a section.  The section read:</P>
      <P>A person who forcibly enters land ... shall be guilty of an offence unless</P>
      <P>(a)  he is the owner of the land....</P>
      <P>I am saying &ldquo;Thank you for nothing&rdquo;. It is a good thing to know that I can go back into my house, that despite the fact that a number of people might be able to resist me, and though I had to use force to get back into it, under the concession from the Minister, I did not commit an offence because I wanted to rejoin my family.</P>
      <P>The section was:</P>
      <P>(b)  if he is not the owner, he does not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the land... by the owner and, if requested to leave, he does so with all reasonable speed and in a peaceable manner.</P>
      <P>As that section stood, it did not matter a thrawneen that the motives of the person were perfectly peaceful, perfectly legitimate, and absolutely, as he believed, in pursuance of his legal right.  He may have felt he was the lawful owner of the house; he may have felt he was the lawful tenant of the house.  His intentions may have been along those lines but, under this absolute prohibition, that was no defence.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he is advised to the contrary.  I do not respect, I am sorry to have to say it, the advice tendered to the Minister and I do not think the Minister thinks very highly of it either because the Minister has declared that he is prepared to accept this fundamental amendment.  That is, I think, a good thing for the Minister to do.  His having done it, let us be thankful for it, but let no one think that this amendment is being accepted by the House on the basis that it is unnecessary.  This is a very essential amendment to this Bill.  In my view it clearly changes in a very drastic way the provisions of section 2 and the credit for the Minister's acceptance is due to Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Cooney for pointing out this clear omission from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into what is clearly an academic argument now but, as I stated at the outset, and as Deputy O'Higgins very well knows, there was a presumption of the necessity to prove <i>mens rea.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still necessary to point out that section 2, irrespective of amendments, still creates a new criminal offence of forcible entry and forcible occupation.  This is the basic objection to this Bill and to this section. I see no need at this point in our social development to create such a formal criminal offence.  Such activities are already crimes and the need to create another new statutory offence is still not clear to me.  Illegal entry and illegal occupation of property has always been dealt with through the civil process and not through the criminal law.  In England, where squatting problems are much greater than they are in this country, the position has been met by streamlining the civil law by such means as providing for the serving of proceedings on squatters without necessarily having to formally name each one of them, by simplifying the various technical requirements in respect of civil proceedings and by strengthening the general machinery for enforcing decrees.  What do we get here?  We get a Garda Síochána in uniform who in his wisdom comes to the conclusion when he sees somebody in a field or in a house that that person has forcibly occupied that premises.  We are putting uniformed members of the Garda Síochána in, I would suggest, an entirely new invidious position.  We are saying to the garda: &ldquo;If you feel that somebody has forcibly entered land or a house you may walk up to him and say, `You have forcibly entered there.  Out you get.  It is a criminal offence and if you do not get out with all reasonable speed and in a peaceable manner I will charge you with a criminal offence.' &rdquo; There is no question of a civil prosecution. Placing such authority in the hands of the custodians of the law is putting them in an invidious position and making questionable the law of a democratic country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he has gone even further in relation to the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.  It includes any person acting on behalf of the owner.  Supposing I in Dún Laoghaire am the non-resident owner of a house <Col N="357" /> or flat and get a telephone call to say that somebody has moved in.  I can ring the Garda Síochána or I can ring K Security and say that I think somebody has occupied my flat and ask them to bring up their Alsatian.</P>
    <P>Criminal offences are brought into being under section 2.  This is an entirely reprehensible, retrograde step. A farmer could advertently or inadvertently enter land, perhaps land which is in dispute in the family, and another member of the family may say that he has an interest in the land. He may say the farmer has forcibly entered the land and contact the Garda Síochána in uniform or he himself may do it and if that farmer does not leave with all reasonable speed in a peaceable manner he is committing an offence of a criminal nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
