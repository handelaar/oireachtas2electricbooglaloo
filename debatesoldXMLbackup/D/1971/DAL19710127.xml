      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a further statement concerning the current situation arising from the Government's decision announced on 4th December, 1970, relating to the threatened introduction of internment without trial.</P>

      <P>The information available to the Garda Síochána strongly suggests that the conspiracy referred to in the original Government statement has not been abandoned and that, in particular, there has been no change in the intention to kidnap. Over recent weeks, however, the information available did not indicate the imminence of an attempt at kidnapping and, in view of this, the Government have so far felt justified in refraining from bringing into operation Part II of the Offences Against the State Act, 1940.  The question whether this will or will not be done depends <Col N="2" /> on whether better counsels will prevail among those concerned in the conspiracy.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement <Col N="3" /> on the content and outcome of the discussions which he and other members of the Government had with farming organisations in late December, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is evidently referring to the meeting which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and I had with the President and other representatives of the National Farmers' Association on the 23rd December last.  I would refer him to the statement issued by the Government Information Bureau on my behalf on the evening of the meeting which outlined the outcome.  I cannot usefully add anything to that statement at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add because talks are continuing at official level.  One has already taken place and there will, I expect, be others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will arrange that Cabinet and other official records will be made available after a 30 year period so that these documents may be available <Col N="4" /> to historians and other interested persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will take steps to have Cabinet papers and other confidential State documents of interest to historians made available after a 30 year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>First of all, it is necessary that we should be quite clear about what we mean by &ldquo;Cabinet and other official records&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The official records in the archives of my Department, the most important of which are the official records of the Cabinet Secretariat, can, broadly, be classified under two headings: Government and Cabinet Minutes on the one hand and official files on the other.</P>
      <P>The Government and Cabinet Minutes are records of decisions taken at Government and Cabinet meetings and do not, ordinarily, include any details of the documentation and the discussions leading up to such decisions. The official files in the archives of my Department contain, where relevant to the subject-matter of the file, the memoranda on the basis of which Government and Cabinet decisions are taken, as well as papers dealing with the general functions and work of the Department.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should like to make it clear that it has always been the policy of my Department to be as liberal as reasonably possible in the matter of the making of official papers available to historians.  In connection with the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of the Rising of 1916, it was decided in 1966 that the official papers in the State Paper Office would be thrown open up to 1916&mdash;an extension of the previous open period, which stopped at 1895, of 21 years.  Shortly afterwards, I announced in this House on the 8th February, 1967, that the Irish documents relating to the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations of 1921 would be made available for inspection, to <i>bona fide</i> historians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> I have been giving consideration, for some time past, to the extent to which we might further liberalise access to the records in the archives of my Department. I have now decided that a copy of the Cabinet Minutes of the First and Second Dála, covering the period from April, 1919 to April, 1922, and all the original Dáil Cabinet files and other records in the archives of my Department for the period, should be transferred to the State Paper Office, where they will be available for inspection on the usual conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we should go beyond this for the present.  The years from 1922 onwards&mdash;especially the earlier years&mdash;cover a particularly controversial period of our domestic history, and I think it might be better if the Cabinet records in regard to that period were not open to public inspection for some further time.</P>
    <P>So far as official records other than those in the custody of my Department are concerned, I am making arrangements to have the position examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that on 28th February, 1968, the then Taoiseach informed this House that the release of any papers more than 30 years old &ldquo;Will have to depend upon the Lord Chancellor in Britain&rdquo;?  Now that the Lord Chancellor has released these papers why are the Government reneging on the promise they then made that they would release them if the Lord Chancellor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that question referred solely to the release of papers in the possession of the British Government. I cannot read anything else into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the terms of the reply which the Taoiseach has given, is the Taoiseach aware that in certain circumstances papers have been published in Britain dealing with matters that had been the subject of discussions between the Irish and the British Governments and, in cases of that sort, does he not consider that there are strong grounds for publishing the Irish <Col N="6" /> papers in connection with these instead of having papers published only on the British side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a case for that, but the Deputy will appreciate that it would prejudice a decision in relation to an earlier period, and that earlier period to which I have already referred was controversial in our history, and the release of papers dealing with that period might give rise to further controversy and, in my opinion, unnecessarily so.  However, the suggestion made by the Deputy is worthy of examination, and I can have it looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that questions have been put down by Members of both Opposition parties, surely the Taoiseach would agree that up to 1941 would be an appropriate period for full publication, bearing in mind that there is no limit whatever in this country and that this publication of documents is done purely on an arbitrary basis by the Government, at the sole discretion of the Government? That is rather an undesirable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my responsibility mainly, as Taoiseach, and as long as I have that responsibility, it is not my intention to exacerbate any situation or position.  The matters which were controversial are not yet above controversy.  Many of the people who were engaged in these controversial matters in the early twenties are still alive, and I do not think it would be fair to them and certainly not fair to the equanimity of the country, that these documents concerning this period should be thrown open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that we are mature enough to know the facts about what happened 46 to 48 years ago?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that his suggestion, that the publication of them would in some way exacerbate bitterness or something, suggests that we are living in the past, which the younger generation in this country could not accept?  Will he not agree that we in this country are as mature as people in <Col N="7" /> other countries, where very controversial documents relating to periods as recent as 30 years ago are published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was born, I think, after the Civil War. Remember there was a civil war in this country, and it cost many of those who took part in it their lives.  We are moving away from the situation when the Civil War can be a matter of friction between people but I am not satisfied that we are yet far enough from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What relevance has the Civil War at this stage?  Surely we can hear the facts?  It is a reflection on the maturity of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed no, but I would not reflect on the maturity of the people of 1921 and 1922 either, as the Deputy appears to imply.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are at present being made for a national commemoration to be held in Dublin, of the 50th Anniversary of the Truce.  This does not preclude local committees in other parts of the country from organising commemorations in their own areas.</P>
      <P>The Government have set up an informal committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Seán F. Lemass and comprising Colonel Austin Brennan and Messrs.  Vincent Byrne, Liam Deasy and Seán Dowling, together with four representatives of Departments of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> The committee has no formal terms of reference; its purpose is to plan and organise the national commemoration. The committee has already held two meetings and, at this stage, I can say that the main ceremony will take place at the Garden of Remembrance on Sunday, the 11th July, 1971, the 50th Anniversary of the day on which the Truce came into effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of establishing a Dáil Committee to review the work of State-sponsored bodies is related to the recommendations in regard to the restructuring of the public service in the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group.  These recommendations are still under consideration and, until such time as decisions are taken in relation to them, it is not envisaged that any conclusions will be reached in regard to the subject of parliamentary review of State-sponsored bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have taken one decision, that is in relation to the setting up of the Public Services Department, which we believe is crucial to the implementation of the rest of the Devlin Report.  Legislation is now being prepared for that purpose and it is expected to be enacted by the Easter recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I referred to reforms in Dáil procedure in my closing speech in the debate on the adjournment of the Dáil for the Christmas recess.  Shortly after the Christmas holiday, I instructed my Parliamentary Secretary to make arrangements whereby the question of establishing a special committee to deal with the matter would be discussed with the Opposition parties.  He will communicate with the other Party Whips on the subject early in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider this a matter of urgent importance and instruct his Parliamentary Secretary, the Chief Whip of the Government, to contact the other two parties?  I do not think any of us could impress upon him too strongly or at too great length the importance of the revision of machinery here.  The evidence is in the unfinished business that we have listed here, a list that has been there for six or seven months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach is aware that the he has allowed two and three armies to parade openly and in uniform in this country for the last year without being arrested and that the has allowed them to arm and train, to appear on television, to give press conferences and statements to the press signed by the adjutant and so-and-so of the IRA and that the Government have stood idly by while the Twenty-Six Counties are being used as a base for incursion into the Six Counties?

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and his colleagues quote Scripture when it suits them.  Deputies opposite, and Deputy L'Estrange in particular, must be aware that there was a prosecution brought in respect of the case in Dundalk and that of the several people prosecuted all but one were dismissed at the preliminary stage and the one remaining was dismissed by a jury.  I have no control nor would I want control over the decisions of the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely the Taoiseach has control over his own Government and the Government have collective responsibility?

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Deputy L'Estrange's question on Thursday, 19th November, 1970, in which I stated that the high number on the live register at that time was due to the lingering effects of the <Col N="18" /> cement and banks' disputes.  The after-effects of these disputes, together with certain structural factors related to improved social welfare payments, continue to be mainly responsible for the increase in numbers on the live register.  As I stated in my reply to Deputy L'Estrange, the solution of the problem of unemployment and emigration is, in the Government's view, to be found primarily in the creation of new opportunities for employment in industry.  Employment in industry has been rising rapidly in the past two years and it is Government policy to continue to press ahead with the encouragement of new industries with a view to reducing unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what opportunities have become available but I do know that there are nearly 70,000 people unemployed at present, which is an increase of 4,000 compared with the previous year, and as a result of the bank dispute it is possible that this number will go even higher and I should like the Taoiseach to comment on this aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the cost of living index figure at (a) the latest available date, (b) a similar date 12 months ago, (c) a similar date five years ago; if he will indicate (1) the points increase in the past 12 months, (2) the percentage increase in the past 12 months and (3) the reasons for the abnormal increase; and what action the Government intend to take to stabilise the cost of living.</P>

      <P>The consumer price index with base November, 1968 as 100 rose by 10.8 points from 107.6 at mid-November, 1969 to 118.4 at mid-November, 1970 or by 10.0 per cent. With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the points increase attributable to each commodity group and to the principal constituent items.  Prior to November, 1968 the consumer price index was calculated to base August, 1953 as 100. To this base the November, 1965 figure was 144.8 and the corresponding figure for mid-November, 1970 was 192.6.</P>
      <P>A number of factors have contributed to the increase in prices in the past 12 months.  Due to the general tendency for prices to rise sharply in the main countries with which we trade, import prices rose significantly. The pay increases beyond the growth of national productivity which occurred during 1970 were also a significant factor both directly and because, in the case of Government services, pay increases led to higher taxation.  There were also increases in food prices due to market and other circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As price increases are caused by a number of factors, many of which are not within our power to control, absolute price stability cannot be ensured by the Government.  The Government's objective is to keep price increases to <Col N="20" /> the minimum.  Economies are being made in Government expenditure, action has been and is being taken on the prices and incomes front and credit policy will be directed towards ensuring that excessive credit will not be created during 1971-72.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>POINTS increase in the consumer price index (base November, 1968=100) between mid-November, 1969, and mid-November 1970, attributable to each commodity group and to the principal ocnstituent items.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he and his Government have fallen down completely with regard to the cost of living, which has gone sky high?

      <P>The consumer price index numbers are calculated in respect of mid-February, mid-May, <Col N="22" /> mid-August and mid-November each year.  The index with base August, 1953, as 100 was 113.8 at mid-November, 1957, and 192.6 at mid-November, 1970.  With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the national average retail prices for mid-November, 1970, for the principal food items included in the consumer price index, together with percentage changes since November, 1957, for certain individual food items and for all the major commodity groups.</P>
      <P>In the case of items, other than the principal food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful. The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive inquiries.</P>
      <P>In introducing the present consumer price index in November, 1968, changes were made in the list of items priced and in the set of retail outlets from which price quotations are collected. As a consequence it is not possible to give comparable national average retail prices for food items for November, 1957, but percentage changes for a number of food items can be derived by linking the two series.  In the case of non-food items where the revision was more extensive, percentage changes have been compiled only for broad groups.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>(a)  NATIONAL average Retail Prices of Principal Articles of Food at Mid-November, 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 to 28 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is necessary to make it clear that a large number of patients in the Central Mental Hospital have not been found guilty of murder or other serious crimes.  Whatever the nature of their crimes they have been medically certified to be mentally ill.  They are admitted on Orders made by the Minister for Justice or by me as Minister for Health. I would like to emphasise, however, that these Orders in all cases are made on the basis of medical reports.  The Central Mental Hospital is operated as a hospital where patients receive psychiatric treatment.  As part of treatment it is desirable that they should be allowed a reasonable amount of freedom within the hospital and grounds. I am satisfied, however, that, as far as can humanly be foreseen, that freedom should be exercised in such a way that escapes do not occur.  When escapes do occur I take a very serious view of the circumstances in which they take place. I immediately ordered an inquiry into the circumstances of the recent escapes and I appointed a group to re-examine security precautions in the hospital.  The report of the inquiry into the escapes has been delayed owing to the absence on illness of some members of the hospital staff.  The House can rest assured, however, that on receipt of the report <Col N="28" /> I will take all necessary measures arising out of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The group which was appointed to review the security arrangements reported to me on the 13th January and I immediately took steps to have the recommendations implemented.  These included the removal from the boundary walls of all projections, such as side walls of the ball-alley, which made escape easier, the raising of the boundary walls in certain places and a number of smaller measures which the group considered desirable.</P>
    <P>The group also adverted to the possibility of moving some patients from the hospital as reduced numbers would permit of greater security.</P>
    <P>In the recent past around 30 patients each year have been discharged or removed to district mental hospitals, or returned to prison, on an Order made by me or by the Minister for Justice. In either case the Order is made on medical advice.  A fresh examination is being undertaken to see if a certain number of patients now in the hospital can be transferred.  This question is being pursued at present as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, taken or will take all steps necessary as a result of the inquiry into the escapes and as a result of the report of the group which re-examined the security arrangements. Provision was made in the Health Act, 1970, for the transfer of the administration of the Central Mental Hospital to the new Eastern Health Board.  This will facilitate the staffing of the hospital&mdash;a matter which has created considerable difficulties in the past owing to the small size of the hospital and the limited range of psychiatric activities with which the staff are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined will prevent, as far as humanly can be foreseen, the danger of further escapes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate why the sheets used in the escape from this hospital were left there for approximately five days after the escape?  The sheets used by the people who escaped were left hanging from the wall of the hospital for five days after the escape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not. say.  I have no information in regard to this. All possible security measures have now been taken and I have had no complaints from the area of Dundrum of any assaults by the prisoners, neither the prisoners who escaped recently nor the ten who escaped in the last five years.  The Deputy can be assured of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Would the Tánaiste bear in mind that there is at least one patient in Dundrum who already escaped from another such institution and caused death to a woman by violence, and that other members of that family are living in terror as a result of the news of these escapes lest that person would escape again?  There may be other such cases of which I am not aware.  Will the Tánaiste take steps to satisfy himself that, while these unfortunate people have liberty within the mental hospital grounds, it is made impossible for them to escape, and will he publicise the steps that have been taken so that these people may cease to live in terror?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have published the steps that have been taken.  Those who know about psychiatric illness will realise that it is difficult to say that it will be forever impossible for a prisoner to escape from the Central Mental Hospital, because if the patients are kept permanently under very heavy sedation it may be impossible to cure them.  Therefore there has to be some minute risk taken that patients who are experimentally not being given the same heavy sedation as other patients may act with violence against a warder so that the psychiatric nurses immediately have to take the right steps to take care of the patient.  However, I would say that with the steps I have now taken the chances are, I hope, very remote that anyone will escape.</P>

I could not make any special promise about that.

Surely the Tánaiste will agree that recent and not so recent history of this institution would suggest that it is too easy to escape, and will the Tánaiste take steps to differentiate between various patients and take particular precautions with those that harbour grievances or have homicidal tendencies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three trained and experienced whole-time psychiatrists in the Central Mental Hospital. The range of treatments provided include drug therapy, ECT, occupational and recreational therapies and rehabilitation. Consultants and other specialised personnel, such as psychologists, are employed as required.  The standard of psychiatric care is satisfactory, but I am sure it can be improved.  That is why I am arranging for the transfer of the hospital to the Eastern Health Board, as this will facilitate its staffing to a level which has not been possible in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has conceded in an earlier answer that a limited range of psychiatric care is available in Dundrum, what is he going to do with the young people there who require care and treatment in the meantime until it is taken over by the Regional Board?  Why not provide that care for them?  Surely it is a matter of urgency for them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were possible to do anything about it I would do it. Nevertheless, a high level of security is required for the young people as for the old.  Although we can examine that position, I think it is preferable to wait until the Eastern Health Board take over the hospital and until the whole advice and experience of the psychiatric staff can be added to that of the present psychiatric staff in the Central Mental Hospital in order to see what can be done to improve the facilities there and the treatment.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 to 32 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputy, as a doctor, will appreciate my difficulty in answering questions in regard to individual patients&mdash;questions which cannot be answered fully without disclosing clinical details, something which I am sure the Deputy does not expect me to do.  I am also in the difficulty that I am not sure to what patients the questions relate.  I assume the person to whom Deputy O'Connell referred is a certain patient.  If my assumption is correct, this girl was in the Central Mental Hospital from June to October, 1969, on the Order of the Minister for Justice.  She was then discharged. She was readmitted as a temporary patient to St. Loman's Hospital, Ballyowen, in November last.  I have, at present, before me proposals for her transfer to the Central Mental Hospital under the provisions of section 207 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  After a full investigation by competent psychiatrists, I am advised that she is completely unsuitable for treatment in a district mental hospital.  I must point out that the circumstances outlined by Deputy Dr. O'Connell in respect of this case are not in accordance with <Col N="33" /> the facts.  To give one example, the information at my disposal indicates that this patient has been hospitalised in psychiatric institutions on at least 20 occasions since 1966.</P>
    <P>There is no male patient in the Central Mental Hospital under the name conveyed to me by Deputy Browne.  I assume, however, he refers to a patient with the same surname who was admitted on an Order of the Minister for Justice in December last. This Order was made on medical recommendation. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has advised me that he is satisfied that the Central Mental Hospital is more suitable for the treatment of this particular patient than St. Brendan's.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to a statement of Dr. O'Brien, Governor of the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin, that during her long psychiatric career she had never sent a patient to Dundrum and that, following her recent three years as Governor at Dundrum, she was satisfied that she was correct in adopting such a policy; and whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Patients are transferred from district mental hospitals to the Central Mental Hospital under section 207 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  Action under this section is initiated by the psychiatrist in charge of the particular patient.  This section provides, briefly, that if a person detained in a district mental hospital is charged before a justice of a district court, sitting in the district mental hospital, with an indictable offence, and evidence is given which satisfies the justice that the person committed the offence but would be unfit to plead if placed on trial, the justice shall certify that the person is suitable for transfer to the Central Mental Hospital. The Minister for Health then requires the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to report on the patient and, after consideration of his report, may <Col N="34" /> direct the transfer of the patient to the district mental hospital.</P>
      <P>The number of persons dealt with under section 207 is limited and the question of whether a particular psychiatrist was involved with the transfer of patients under the section depended partly on whether the required circumstances arose in a particular place and partly on whether the psychiatrist thought it was necessary or desirable to have proceedings initiated under section 207.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Mental Illness was satisfied that it was essential to maintain a procedure for the transfer from district mental hospitals to the Central Mental Hospital of patients who are very violent or homicidal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health who are the persons referred to by Dr. O'Brien, Governor of the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin, when she said that there are young persons in that hospital who should not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Dr. O'Brien had in mind persons who had committed or had been charged with minor offences and that she felt they could suitably be dealt with in the district mental hospitals.  I am afraid that Dr. O'Brien's views on this matter are not shared by most of her colleagues. Patients who are under sentence or on remand have to be detained with a resonable degree of security.  It is very difficult to provide this security in most district mental hospitals.  In accordance with modern concepts on the care of psychiatric patients these hospitals have few, if any, locked wards and such wards may be completely unsuitable from a therapeutic point of view for the patients referred to by Dr. O'Brien.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain how he is prepared to accept Dr. O'Brien's decision in one set of circumstances and reject it in another set of circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a wide variety of views in regard to psychiatric illness.  The Deputy should know much more about that than I do but I have read enough in <Col N="35" /> general on the subject to know that views on various types of mental illness and the treatment therefor are not universally accepted by everybody and there can be controversy but I can assure the Deputy that Dr. O'Brien is a competent person and my Assistant Inspector and inspectors of my Department have frequently reviewed her decisions and have found nothing wrong with them and so although she may hold views of her own of a comparatively strong character on the matters referred to by the Deputy I have no reason to suspect that she does not exercise wise judgment in her recommendations in regard to patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clearly established by everybody, including the Minister and the Commission and his own inspector, Dr. Campbell, that there are no remedial, psychiatric facilities available in Dundrum?  No reflection whatever on the existing staff, they simply have not got the facilities.  Why then is the Minister so indifferent to the reality that there are a number of people there who could be perfectly peaceful, not violent people, who could be held in district mental hospitals and, what is much more important, given remedial psychiatric care?  Surely the Minister may not remain indifferent to these people? If they were relations of his own, surely he would not treat them in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have tried to make the position perfectly clear to the Deputy.  I am satisfied from the observations of the psychiatric inspectors of my Department that the position is reasonably good and that there is nothing about which I should have extreme momentary anxiety.  I have also said that when the Central Mental Hospital is linked and integrated with the Eastern Health Board mental hospitals the position can be improved.  The two statements are not inconsistent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what steps he proposes to take to enforce segregation of young from older patients at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, Dublin as recommended by the Governor, Dr. <Col N="36" /> O'Brien, and in particular in the case of one young man (name supplied) who is held in the infirmary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the complete segregation of young from older patients is not necessarily a therapeutic requirement and that contacts between them can be of benefit to both types of patient.  In the case of the patient, whose name was conveyed to me by the Deputy, I am advised that, in the opinion of the Governor of the Central Mental Hospital and of the Assistant Inspector of Mental Hospitals, it is desirable, in the interests of the physical and mental condition of the patient, that he should be cared for in the infirmary but this does not prevent his participation in other recreational or therapeutic activities in the institution.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The length of time it takes to appoint any type of officer will vary with circumstances&mdash;in particular with the number of suitable persons available and the attraction of a particular post. As I have already indicated I expect that the transfer of the Central Mental Hospital to the Eastern Health Board will facilitate the recruitment of staff in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the present staffing of the Central Mental Hospital were given in a reply to the Deputy's question on 9th December last.  It showed that there are three full-time psychiatrists in the hospital and I do not, therefore, understand <Col N="38" /> the question in regard to a recommendation that a full-time psychiatrist should be appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a reasonable estimate would be at least one a year before all the facilities would be provided at the Central Mental Hospital?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission on Mental Illness recommended that the administration of the Central Mental Hospital should be transferred to the local health authority and that as soon as practicable attendants should be replaced by psychiatric nurses.</P>
      <P>Consideration was given to the implementation of the latter recommendation in advance of the transfer of the hospital.  It became apparent, however, in the light of experience gained in the recruitment of nursing staff of a more senior level, that efforts to recruit qualified psychiatric nurses would not be likely to succeed while the hospital continued to be administered in isolation outside the main stream of psychiatry in Dublin.</P>
      <P>It was decided, therefore, to concentrate on the other aspect of the commission's recommendation and I took the opportunity to include in the Health Bill, which was then in course of preparation, provision for the transfer of the administration of the hospital to the health board for the area.  I intend to bring this arrangement into operation as soon as possible after the health boards assume their functions on the 1st April next. I am confident that following this change, an important feature of which will be to enable the hospital to play its part in the training of student nurses, significant improvements can be made quickly in all aspects of the services including nursing services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to answer Questions Nos. 40 to 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I think I should make the point that the recently-published report of the Royal College of Physicians&mdash;Smoking and Health Now &mdash;contains nothing essentially new or anything which was not known to me or my advisers in relation to the hazard to health which is caused by smoking cigarettes.  That is not to decry the work which the report represents nor to attempt to diminish the import of its message.  Rather it is to say that being aware of the gravity of the problem I had a year ago taken a positive decision to intensify the campaign of my Department against cigarettes.  This campaign is quite frankly aimed at the young person and is designed not only to dissuade him or her from starting to <Col N="41" /> smoke but to engender a climate in which the maturity status of the cigarette and its present automatic social acceptance will be questioned and ultimately cast aside.</P>
    <P>I have, with the whole-hearted co-operation of Radio Telefís Éireann, used television, this most powerful medium, extensively in my endeavours to achieve this purpose.  I have also used radio, the newspapers, magazines with a special appeal to youth, have sponsored a country-wide poster design anti-cigarette competition for young people and used school film shows in my endeavours.  So far as adults are concerned, I take the view that they are adequately educated by the various reports and the comment upon them in the media down the years and this, together with the fallout from the youth-orientated campaign of my Department, should, I feel, enable them to make a sensible choice as to whether to smoke or not to smoke.  I am, therefore, strongly disinclined to waste resources of either time or money in what would be essentially futile efforts to dissuade them from the habit.</P>
    <P>As to the future efforts of my Department, I intend in the coming financial year to intensify still further the campaign of my Department aimed at the young.  Apart from beaming the anti-cigarette smoking education at the young persons themselves directly, using the most sophisticated media methods available to me, I propose to enlist in my campaigns the aid of people who have direct and special relationships with the young.  I am, too, considering other methods but it is premature to make any disclosure of them at this point.</P>
    <P>On the question of banning advertising of cigarettes entirely, I must say that I am disinclined to use any element of compulsion whatsoever.  Radio Telefís Éireann have voluntarily decided to abandon cigarette advertising on television as from the 1st April next and, in my view, this must of itself have considerable impact&mdash;although I should perhaps draw the House's attention to the fact that in paragraph 9.28 of the recent report of the Royal College of Physicians the point is made that despite the fact that in Russia and <Col N="42" /> Italy, there is no advertising of cigarettes, consumption of them has steadily risen.  I should also make it clear that I will be watching carefully for any intensification or diversification of cigarette promotion.</P>
    <P>On the question of notices on packets, I remain to be convinced that they are of any really significant value. As to the warning notice, the report in question, in paragraph 9.34, reveals that a survey in the United States showed that only one in five said that he or she had been affected by it and only 2 per cent had stopped or decided not to start smoking because of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why he is reluctant to use methods of compulsion in the case of this particular drug as he is quite free with his compulsory powers in relation to other drugs such as marijuana, amphetamines and the rest?  Why does he exclude this drug?</P>

      <P>On the order of business, if the Taoiseach consults the Order Paper he will see that there is a motion, No. 61, in my name and the name of Deputy Enright dealing with a matter of very great interest and concern to my constituency involving the livelihood of 1,500 persons.  In view of the urgency of this and because, in the ordinary way, this motion will not be taken until close to the summer recess, would the Taoiseach be prepared to grant Government time for the discussion of this motion, in view of its importance in relation to the livelihood of so many people in the town of Clara in County Offaly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this Bill is the long delay which has taken place before its introduction.  This Bill is long overdue, so much so, that we have had the anomalous and dangerous situation in that, on the admission of the Minister, the law, which it is being sought to amend in this Bill with regard to the transport of livestock, has been broken for some time.  This was due to the fact that the law was archaic and totally out of line with the needs of the present time.  Those who broke the law were doing what was only sensible in the economic interests of the country.  However, it is to my mind a very bad situation that it should be necessary to break the law in order to do what is best in the economic interests of the country and, in this case, the economic interests of those engaged in agriculture. This situation was engendered because of the great delay on the part of the Government in introducing this amending legislation designed to liberalise the transport of cattle.  The Minister himself admitted at column 749 of volume 249 of the Official Report that the law had been broken for some time and that a blind eye had been turned to this fact.  I quote from the Minister:</P>
      <P>It is apparent indeed apart from these studies that illegal haulage by interests associated with the livestock trade has become firmly established on a widespread basis and that reversal of this situation is impracticable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This illegal haulage took place on a <Col N="54" /> widespread basis because of the grave delay on the part of the Government in introducing this legislation.  It is very unfortunate that people should be driven to what is technically illegal activity because of delay on the part of the Government in introducing necessary and long overdue amending legislation.  It is a bad background against which to introduce such legislation.</P>
    <P>It is clear that in the recent past the Government have had further pointers to the introduction of this legislation but neverthless it was delayed.  In April, 1968, the Store Cattle Study Group recommended and produced a well-documented case for the liberalisation which is, in fact, being introduced in this Bill.  Instead of acting on the recommendation of this Store Cattle Study Group and taking a decision there and then, when the facts were put before them, and in order to shelve the taking of a decision and saving themselves the embarrassment of having to admit immediately that they were wrong and should have introduced this long ago, the Government set up yet another inter-departmental study group to make exactly the same recommendations on exactly the same facts with exactly the same data some time later.  Meanwhile nothing was done and it is only now that this legislation is being introduced. Why was it necessary, I should like to ask, to have two bodies making exactly the same recommendations on the same data before the Government were prepared to act?  Why was it necessary for people to flout the law over a long period before the Government were prepared to amend it?</P>
    <P>This culpable delay on the part of the Government should be strongly condemned in this House, because it brings this House into contempt.  I believe the liberalisation proposed in this Bill in relation to the haulage of agricultural products is unduly restricted.  The only categories of livestock covered are cattle, sheep and pigs.  The Minister, in his speech, gives an explanation for the exclusion of horses in this context and I am prepared to accept it but has any consideration been given to the exclusion <Col N="55" /> of other types of livestock, such as poultry and greyhounds?  Why, when making liberalisation in this case, have other categories of livestock not been excluded as well?</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that the standards of licensing in relation to the road haulage of agricultural products should be different from the standards of licensing in relation to the haulage of non-agricultural products because of the dispersed nature of farmers.  They are spread all over the country and in order to get their goods to market they have to rely on a wider variety of different types of transport.  As the produce of an individual farmer is in small quantities there are a larger number of individual occasions on which farmers in general require transport for their goods whereas a factory can transport in bulk relatively easily.  Licensing arrangements can be easily enforced and accepted in regard to industry but in the case of farmers I think a more liberal approach is necessary.</P>
    <P>Another point is that many agricultural products are highly perishable and transport in such cases is required very quickly.  Again, goods are produced in rather uncertain quantities from day to day and produce may ripen very quickly.  Reliance on licensed transport may be very impractical whereas, in industry, it is easy to predict when goods will be produced since the production line is not affected by uncertain factors, such as weather, and the quantity is also more easily transported and, therefore, transport arrangements with licensed hauliers can be made easily in advance.  In the case of agriculture, however, with uncertainty as to quantity, and even as to time, it is not so easy to make transport arrangements in advance with the limited number of licensed hauliers available.  There is also the fact that farmers are more dispersed and therefore tend to need transport to a greater extent than does industry.  Because of that I suggest that a different standard should be applied to agricultural goods as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are commodities which are excluded under this measure.  There is milk, for example.  Many farmers have <Col N="56" /> to get their milk to creameries.  At the moment individual farmers bring their own milk to the creameries.  I think it would be a wise step for one farmer to undertake to do a round and bring all the milk of the neighbouring farmers to the creamery, thereby leaving them free to get on with their work; but, if the farmer carrying the milk were to accept any monetary reward for doing so, no matter how small it might be, he would have to have a merchandise haulage licence.  It is entirely wrong that, under the present law, this man would be breaking the law for carrying this milk without a merchandise haulage licence.  It is very difficult to get such a licence and to expect such a farmer to procure such a licence is quite absurd.</P>
    <P>Again, if a farmer has two farms and he hires a contractor to cut silage on one farm and that silage has to be taken by road to the second farm, the contractor would be deemed to be carrying that silage for that farmer for hire and technically he would be breaking the law unless he had a merchandise haulage licence.  Sliage and hay should both be excluded, as well as milk.  If a contractor were to cut grain for a farmer and if he were to bring that grain along the road to some storage point he would be breaking the law unless he had a merchandise haulage licence.  Clearly there is need to revise this legislation so that these circumstances can be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In certain cases CIE cannot meet the requirements of agriculture and private lorries are plated by CIE to do the work.  This is done in the case of both sugar beet and ground limestone.  CIE take 10 per cent of the earnings of these private lorries.  They are unable to do the work themselves and it seems to be utterly iniquitous that they should profit out of their own inadequacies. There seems to be no economic justification for giving this extra 10 per cent to CIE.  They are doing nothing to earn this money.  In fact, plating private hauliers would not be necessary were it not for the inadequacies of CIE.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, it is the farmer who pays the ten per cent to CIE.  It <Col N="57" /> is the primary producer who pays because he hires the private haulier to carry his sugar beet or his ground limestone so this 10 per cent surcharge is a 10 per cent surcharge on the farmer.  There is no justification for this and it should be removed.  Temporary arrangements of this nature tend to destroy the pattern of production. If there is land near a big factory which is unsuitable for the production of beet, the man who owns that land will produce beet because his transport costs will be minimal.  On the other hand, a farmer who is far away from the factory, with land which is ideal for the production of beet, will not produce beet because transport costs will make the production of beet uneconomic for him.  He would have to engage a private plated haulier and pay a 10 per cent surcharge.  The result is there is a disincentive to produce beet on good land whereas the farmer near the factory who can transport his beet in his own tractor and trailer has an economic incentive to produce beet on unsuitable land. This distortion is most unhealthy and very unfortunate.</P>
    <P>What will be the effect of this legislation on co-operatives and group farming?  I touched earlier on this when dealing with the transport of milk to creameries.  If the concept of group farming develops one farmer will do all sorts of haulage of all sorts of goods for other farmers.  It seems to me that under present legislation that farmer would have to have a haulage merchandise licence unless he was carrying only cattle, sheep or pigs, which are exempted.  The scope of subsection (5) would need to be extended.</P>
    <P>There is the question of transporting soft fruits.  These can be ripe one day and, if they are not transported very quickly, they can be rotten the next day.  Under the present arrangement unless one were to get a licensed haulier, which would be rather difficult particularly as many of the farmers producing soft fruit are producing very small quantities, the carriage of which would not be worthwhile for a licensed haulier, with a big vehicle, one would have to rely perhaps on a neighbour to carry the <Col N="58" /> goods to the jam factory or whatever it is.  Unless the neighbour is a licensed haulier he is breaking the law.  The list of agricultural products which under the present regulations unless carried by a licensed haulier are carried in breach of the law, is endless and I think the exemption contained here is quite inadequate in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the Bill provides for the removal of weight limitations on licensed vehicles.  Would the Minister consider imposing a condition for the issue of a licence of this nature that the vehicle be fitted with anti-pollution devices? Perhaps that could not be incorporated at this stage in this Bill as there has not been sufficient preparation but the possibility should be included of imposing such a condition.  I gave a long list in the House recently on another Bill of the types of chemical air pollution arising from motor vehicle exhausts and so on.  These can be particularly dangerous in confined places and many of the heavy trucks covered by this Bill may pass through narrow streets and there the half-burnt fuel being churned out through exhausts can be a very dangerous source of air pollution.  There should be regulations requiring these vehicles to have anti-pollution devices fitted.  I do not know much about the details of such devices but I know they are being introduced in the US at present and it would be highly appropriate for the Minister to require, before giving a merchandise haulage licence, that the vehicle should be fitted with an anti-pollution device of a standard approved by him.  The introduction of such a condition in this Bill would not allow sufficient notice to those concerned but I hope the Minister will consider doing it some time in the reasonably near future.</P>
    <P>It is stated in section 8 subsection (1) (a) that the Minister may grant a licence subject&mdash;and this is the important part&mdash;&ldquo;to any conditions which the Minister may see fit to impose and specifies in the licence.&rdquo;  The Minister may impose any condition.  Under subsection (2) (b) the Minister may, by order, amend or revoke an order under this section.  He can impose any conditions <Col N="59" /> he likes without reference to anybody and then he can change these conditions by order without consulting anybody or without any standard being observed.</P>
    <P>The conditions envisaged in subsection (1) (a) should be spelled out to the House.  What are they?  It should be incorporated in the Bill that the Minister would be required to set out objective standards for the conditions he intends to apply in the issue of such licences.  There is the danger that one man could get very easy conditions if he were somehow favourably looked on by the Minister while another, with an equally good case, could conceivably get much severer conditions.  To give the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to impose any conditions without any requirement that they should be consistent from one place to the next is giving him too much power.  The introduction of legislation like this giving the Minister such wide power is probably the greatest reason why there is such widespread talk of corruption in public life.  The Minister's powers are not clearly delineated and there is room for him to exercise discretion in favour of particular supporters of his. I do not suggest the present Minister will do this but it is bad legislation to give such power without reference to the House or to objective standards that can be seen by any member of the public.</P>

      <P>One external company could give the Minister a backhander and another might not and the company giving the backhander might get more liberal treatment than the one that did not.  The Minister is being given power that I think he should not be given.  It is bad to give unlimited power of this kind to any Minister generally, whether international or national companies are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to have the Minister's comments on subsection (b).  The Minister might make an order in a particular case and the applicant having got the licence would go to work on the basis of it.  Then under subsection <Col N="60" /> (b) if for some reason this licence-holder came into disfavour the Minister might, by order, revoke or change the licence.  This gives the Minister power to deprive a man of his livelihood.  It it the sort of provision that should not be in legislation coming before this House.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (5) is again the sort of thing to which I seriously object.  This provides that the Minister may at his discretion prescribe whatever fee he likes in respect of a restricted road freight licence.  He can then double the fee without reference to anybody.  Fees for legal documents which are in a somewhat similar category can be changed as easily as in this case and they have gone up by 87 per cent in the past few years so far as I know.  This is far ahead of the rate of inflation and beyond any justification there might be.</P>
    <P>This section also gives the Minister power to increase the fees without justifying them to anybody.  To my mind the power given to the Minister under subsection (5) of section 8 should be subject to appeal to somebody to ensure that the Minister was not exercising his power in an autocratic way, increasing fees far out of line with the necessity for an increase.</P>
    <P>There is another point here.  We are dealing with the issuing of licences. At present if a man comes from abroad to live in Ireland his driving licence from another country will not be recognised but a tourist who is going to leave the country again, will be able to drive for six months without a test.  It is a great discouragement to business people who may be coming to live here either permanently or temporarily for two or three years, that they should have to go through this procedure of passing a driving test again.  Why should a person who is coming to live here have to pass a driving test?</P>
    <P>Under subsection (2), cattle, sheep and pigs are far too limited a number of commodities and there are other commodities which should be included. In relation to the issue of merchandise licences there should be a requirement for the fitting of anti-pollution devices to such vehicles.  Also, section 8 gives the Minister far too <Col N="61" /> wide a discretion, a discretion which should never be given by this House to any Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis in the Minister's opening speech was on the advantages of rationalisation which would accrue to the transport industry as a whole.  I would refer the House to the Minister's remarks where he stated that the possible effect on CIE's finances must be a secondary consideration in his view.  We believe that the adverse consequences of such rationalisation on the good employment already provided in the industry may not have been inquired into too closely by the Minister's advisers when they were drafting this Bill.  We wish to express dissatisfaction in regard to the changes which must mean increasing competition for CIE and therefore must have an adverse effect on the trade union employment in the country at present.  While there is a reference to the necessity for providing an up-to-date service the Minister did not refer to the question with which employees are very concerned, namely, any specification in relation to the manning of lorries.  We all know that the trend now is to have larger trucks and the absence of any up-to-date legislation in regard to a satisfactory complement of helpers for these larger lorries is a cause of uneasiness among trade unionists.  There is also the important safety factor which apparently is not being looked at here.  I accept that possibly this is a matter for the Minister for Local Government but there was no reference in the Minister's speech to the matter.  I would ask him to clarify his mind on these matters in any further statements he has to make on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we had occasion, on behalf of the trade union of which we are members, to express our uneasiness and dissatisfaction with safety measures as they affect oil trucks and so on.  I would ask the Minister if he, in consultation with his colleague the Minister for Local Government, could suggest a method by which we can have an annual check&mdash;because that is the minimum necessity&mdash;of all licensed merchandise vehicles in the State because <Col N="62" /> we do hear stories&mdash;perhaps unsubstantiated in some cases, but the reports are there&mdash;which suggest that the safety standards of many people in the industry are deplorable and certainly not satisfactory.  In many cases the manning procedure is inadequate for the increasing size of these trucks.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increase in the number of foreigners operating trucks here.  We have received a report that the number of personnel attached to these larger foreign trucks appears to be far in excess of the number common among home operators.  Whether this means that there are superior manning conditions to be complied with in these other countries than obtain here it certainly appears that there is a higher safety standard adopted in these other countries than here.  If the whole tenor of the Minister's speech and of the speeches of supporting Deputies is to suggest that we must be as efficient as our competitors and if that argument holds it means that in manning and in safety precautions we must be on a level basis of comparison.</P>
    <P>Our point is that we are not satisfied that employment in CIE will not be affected adversely.  It is true that there is good trade union employment given outside CIE&mdash;many members of the Licensed Hauliers' Association have been doing so for years&mdash;but the Minister appears to take a rather lighthearted attitude in regard to the possible effect on CIE's road freight service arising from these proposals.  It is a section of CIE which is operated at a profit and therefore we should not lightly allow any diminution of this trade.  The Minister said he was satisfied that there was no real threat to CIE's business and I hope he will address himself to more weighty reasons for this confidence.</P>

      <P>That is one viewpoint. Perhaps the Minister would state at greater length what plans are on hands in CIE's portion of this trade to deal with the consequences arising from the Bill.  We will be very interested to hear them.  As I said, there are 40-foot vehicles coming in and our impression is that these foreign firms apparently have more personnel attached to them. Whatever the Minister may say about reducing the number of own-account firms there will be, as a result of this Bill, an expansion in the size of firms operating in the industry and whilst on one side you may say that rationalisation is to the advantage of the industry it may not be to the advantage of the employment content of CIE.  These are very real fears.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to the hackers and to the fact that the law was coming into disrepute as a result of the number of these around the country.  We have had reports that some such unlicensed operators&mdash; whether this is true or not I should like the Minister to inquire into it&mdash;have had connections with certain CIE business. As I say, it is merely a report but it would be a regrettable state of affairs if such people had been acquiring any business from CIE.  If the Minister has any evidence at departmental level to suggest whether this is right or wrong we should like to know.  We feel that there has been too little emphasis in the Minister's speech about the possible consequences on employment in CIE and we should like more assurance on this point, arising from these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are extremely unhappy about the lack of proper safety precautions in this industry and are also concerned at the total absence of a statutory minimum number of personnel to be attached to these trucks.  Perhaps the manning question is more a matter for the Minister for Local Government&mdash; who is specialising in prohibitions elsewhere&mdash;but we should like if the Minister for Transport and Power would give an assurance to this House in the course of the passage of this Bill that he will take up this matter with the Minister for Local Government at the first opportunity.  I can <Col N="64" /> assure him that the transport section of the Irish Transport Union and other unions are extremely concerned about the apparent lack of safety precautions and the strong legal obligations on operators to provide minimum personnel in the manning of these trucks.</P>
    <P>It is all right if we are going to have rationalisation of the industry and the Minister may plead the advantages of that situation.  However, where there is rationalisation and expansion of firms as a result of legislation passed by this House, and the units in the industry are to become larger, equally the obligation devolves on them to provide greater safety precautions and to observe a higher standard.  This should mean that we will have legislation very shortly whereby each year trucks in this area will be examined for all the specifications we say are necessary. There have been reports from trade unionists regarding the lack of standards and we would like the Minister to give the House an early indication that action will be taken on this matter.</P>
    <P>From what Deputy Foley has said &mdash;and he claims sole authorship of the proposals in this Bill&mdash;it appears he is suggesting strongly that there should be some compensation paid to existing licence holders.  I would ask the Minister if there is to be such consideration shown to operators already in the industry that similar consideration be given to the affairs of the employees also who worked faithfully and hard in this industry during the years, especially when things were not so good.  I should like that some consideration be given to granting compensation to any trade union employee who, as a result of the passage of this Bill, may find himself without a job, who may find that his job has disappeared in the interests of greater rationalisation in the industry. Perhaps Deputy Foley and those who claim sole authorship of this Bill would address themselves to that twin obligation arising from rationalisation in the industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker in speaking on section 8 regarding the expression of any statutory powers the Minister may wish to have and I agree <Col N="65" /> these should be spelled out in the Bill. These powers should not be vaguely hinted at but they should be clearly delineated in the Bill we are asked to pass.  I hope that the Minister will give us some assurance on the points we have raised, especially those that bear on the existing employment of trade unionists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill mainly because it brings into effect a measure about which there has been a considerable amount of agitation during many years both inside and outside the House, namely, the liberalisation of the haulage of livestock. It is difficult to understand why it should have taken so long to bring this before the House but the Minister must be given credit for having at last seen the light and having brought this Bill before us.  However, previous Ministers&mdash;it is not confined to one Minister&mdash;have resisted during the years the fact that farmers particularly had to put up with a hopeless situation in regard to the haulage of livestock.</P>
      <P>The Minister's own statistics prove that the entire haulage business in relation to livestock was, by and large, done by illegal hauliers.  The statistics given here of the findings in 1964&mdash;I have considerable doubt about them&mdash; say that 83 per cent was &ldquo;own&rdquo; haulage. However the bulk was illegal haulage, if one could describe it as such, and it was illegal because CIE could not be got to do the job.  Deputy O'Leary has made reference here to the fact that he hoped that CIE had no truck with these people.  In fact they had and this was one of the more serious aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE were practically legislating. They could ring up at any time and say they were unable to undertake a dirty job, where there were laneways involved and corners around which their larger trucks could not go.  They could license any one to pull out his truck and do the job for them.  This is well known and it is not denied by the Minister; I certainly drew attention to it more than once in the House. CIE were, in fact, a licensing authority and this was a deplorable situation.  We brought this Bill in when CIE were carrying only 3 per cent so that, in fact, <Col N="66" /> they are throwing away nothing.  However, no Minister in the country had the courage to bring it in before because all were afraid they would lose a few votes.  That is the only reason it has not been introduced before now.</P>
    <P>We had a most inefficient haulage system for livestock.  All Members in the House may not remember when CIE first got the monopoly but having regard to the amount of trucks in the country at the time we had a relatively efficient system of livestock haulage prior to the days when CIE got this monopoly.  The situation then was that you had a man in the country with his own lorry and one helper.  He knew all the farmers in his area who might have a few pigs to send to Dublin or cattle to the market.  All that was necessary was to leave a message at the local; he went to Dublin with the livestock, he washed down his truck and he brought home a load of merchandise for the shopkeepers along the way.  He organised his business efficiently.  The same degree of efficiency was not displayed by CIE.  In that organisation the trucks were not privately owned and the people there did not worry themselves about getting a load back from Dublin and, in my view, this created a most inefficient transport system.  CIE sent a driver a considerable distance; he had to inquire at ten different houses before he arrived at the farm and was not even sure whether he could go down many of the laneways and arrive at his destination.  The local man knew all about this and had no difficulty.  He knew all the farmers and gave an efficient transport service.</P>
    <P>In addition, markets and fairs started at very early hours in the morning so that early and late travel was essential. This did not suit CIE; they never provided an efficient transport organisation and that is why they lost it.  One of the worst features was that CIE had no competition.  I heard the view privately expressed by the manager of the Road Freight Department of CIE many years ago that he was in favour of competition. However, this competition was eliminated and, consequently, CIE sat down and did not have to try.  That was wrong.  This Bill completely liberalises the haulage of cattle, sheep and pigs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> Horses are excluded from this and I have some doubt as to whether even this restriction should have been imposed. It is quite right to say that this is one job CIE do very efficiently.  Most of the horses they handle are bloodstock to sales or to race meetings.  CIE are well equipped and safely equipped for this and they do an excellent job. However, having regard to the way they are equipped and the fact that payment is made in respect of horses going to race meetings, I doubt very much if they would suffer if this transport was opened up completely.  It is quite undesirable that a man bringing horses, for instance, to a gymkhana should either have to have his own transport or look for CIE.  These conditions should not be imposed.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to working horses.  If working horses have to be transferred from one place to another over a distance that they cannot be walked in the normal way, it should not be necessary to ensure that CIE or a man with his own lorry will transport them.  There is so mething all wrong about it.  The amount of business CIE would lose as a result of the complete freeing of livestock transport would be negligible.  In fact, they will lose nothing at all from this except a headache that they never wanted and that they were never able to carry.</P>
    <P>People have deprecated here in the House the fact that for so long there were in this country what were described as illegal hauliers.  In fact, they were great benefactors and should have been applauded.  It was a good thing that many members of the Garda Síochána realised that these people were doing a first-class job for the Irish people and closed their eyes to the illegal aspect of the haulage.  It is a disgrace that the Government allowed this situation to go on for so long, a stupid situation that was increasing the cost of production on the farmers, a burden of which they should have been relieved many years before.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Bill has been introduced. It is a very restricted Bill and, as Deputy Tom O'Donnell said in the course of his speech, it is time that an overall national transport policy were <Col N="68" /> brought into this House in view of what we face in relation to the EEC and because of the enormous changes that are taking place in freight and haulage generally through the introduction of these enormous containers of one sort or another which are being hauled around the country in any case. If they have all the opportunities they want to operate almost as they like, the Irish people should have the same freedom.  In relation to this whole question of freight it would be far better for the country if it was a free-for-all.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary is concerned, naturally, about employment.  However, the same amount of material is to be transported and if people are not employed in one place they will be employed in another.  Nobody seemed to be greatly concerned about the number of people throughout the country who lost employment at the time the monopoly was handed over to CIE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many people looking for workers who will do an immense amount for nothing, but I do not know of anybody who is getting them now.  There are fairly strong pressures to ensure that this is so, and that is as it should be, provided we are not putting an unbearable load on the end product that has to be exported, a load that it has not to carry in the countries of our competitors.  It is all right to talk about the manning of yokes.  I am in favour of reasonable manning but you can over-man, too, and put an impost on a product that makes it uncompetitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill that could probably be better discussed and be discussed in considerably more detail on Committee <Col N="69" /> Stage.  This whole question of safety precautions and the roadworthiness of the vehicles that will be used is more a Local Government concern, but the Minister for Transport and Power should not be unconcerned about it either.</P>
    <P>A great deal of concern has been expressed about existing licensed hauliers. My view is that these have been the privileged people for a very long time.  They have been very well looked after and I do not see why there should be all this concern about them.  I have as much right to have a licence as any other person.  There is no restriction on the number of shopkeepers.  Why should there be a restriction on the number of people who have a licence to haul materials around the country? It does not make sense to me.  It is just making a privileged class when a State-owned concern is not involved.  I do not think there is any justification for this class of people in Irish society at all.  It may be that these people can say: &ldquo;We have spent an enormous amount of money in equipping ourselves for this business, and regard should be had to this.&rdquo;  In any business a person has to spend money to set himself up but he cannot get a monopoly for himself.  The licensed haulier should not put himself in a privileged position so that he has to be protected against competition from other people who would like to go into this business.</P>
    <P>These are matters that require a great deal of consideration in this Bill or in any Transport Bill that comes before the House.  As I say, it is a limited Bill, and the portions of it that I like are those that liberalise the whole business and make it free for people to come into the transport business and do it efficiently and effectively and with the local knowledge that is required in many departments.  Certainly this is a step in the right direction.  It is not by any means a comprehensive Bill but it is one to be welcomed by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this matter has been very constructive and I should like to emphasise the kernel of the matter as outlined in my opening speech on Second Stage.  Again, it <Col N="70" /> is relevant to remarks that have been made by a number of Deputies.  Practically every Deputy touched on this matter but particularly Deputy O'Donovan and Deputy O'Leary who were concerned about CIE employees in the road freight section.</P>
      <P>The hub of the matter is that here in Ireland 83 per cent of our transport is own-account transport.  This is far too high by any standard you can take from any other country in the world.  I just mentioned Britain in my Second Stage speech.  There the figure is of the order of 51 per cent compared to our 81 per cent.  That is the pattern all over.  The people who will benefit from the substantial diminution in own-account transport from 81 per cent down are the professional hauliers who will emerge from this system and the largest professional haulier in the country is CIE.  They cannot but benefit along with the other hauliers who, in my view, will be able to rationalise themselves into small, maybe medium-sized, efficient transport operating companies and then we will have CIE as the major transport operating company, operating competitively with them.  The total effect of that should be to diminish this figure of 81 per cent own-account haulage as compared with Britain's 51 per cent.  That is a situation that is highly undesirable, a situation which obviously is leading to over-capitalisation by private people hauling on their own account, not alone by smaller business people but by substantially large firms in this country who at the moment because of these restrictions are not in a position to hire efficient professional hauliers.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the lack of this type of international approach to road transport on the part of our hauliers, to the absence of roll-on/roll-off facilities.  I agree with him that this will be the trend in the future&mdash;transport facilities that will run right through Britain on to Europe and back.  Indeed, the Common Market transport policy is now being evolved and we will have to participate in whatever regulations are proposed as a result of the deliberations of the European Economic Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> This again is pertinent to what has been raised by Deputy O'Leary concerning the manning and the other safety regulations.  We will have common European safety and manning regulations in this regard.  What Deputy O'Leary is referring to in regard to manning concerns crews on these long-haul operations where there would be naturally extra personnel to deal with driving on a shift basis over a couple of thousand miles.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that the whole purpose of the Bill is a first stage to rid ourselves of a restrictive, inward-looking road transport system that has operated here since 1933, that whatever relevance it had to the particular time when it was introduced under that statute it has obviously no relevance in the world of today where we are moving into a completely new transportation conception in containerisation involving roll-on/roll-off procedures that are linking together both road surface and sea transportation and bringing a totally new conception to the whole operation.  In this new conception of transportation the emphasis in Europe and in Britain, and it must be here, is on the efficient professional hauliers.  CIE can be one of those and there can be a number of other medium-sized and smaller efficient operators due to the inevitable development that will flow from the creation of 840 new licences without any weight, commodity or area restrictions. These 840 licences will undoubtedly lead to mergers and amalgamations in some areas and the growth of private enterprise, a professional transportation area, and that as it happens in our situation will act as an ideal counterfoil to the existing State professional operation of CIE in that CIE has 860 trucks in its road freight section.  There will be 840 new licences created so that there will be a rough and ready 50/50 balance between State enterprise in this field and private enterprise.  This is apart from the shipping licences which may be given to shipping companies.  Therefore, there will be a nice balance between private and public enterprise.</P>
    <P>As regards CIE's performance on <Col N="72" /> the road freight aspect I would have no worries at all in regard to the employment situation.  There will not be any diminution in employment, first of all, for the reason I have mentioned that there will be an increase in business accruing both to CIE and private hauliers arising out of the diminution that will result in road account haulage and, secondly, the CIE road freight operation is a highly successful one. In 1969 its operating profit was in the region of £227,000.  In 1970 its operating profit was £195,000.  Even with a deduction from that in relation to financial charges their net profit in 1969 was £122,000 and their net profit in 1970 was £83,000, so that applying the strictest private enterprise accountancy criteria to their operation it is obviously a highly profitable type of operation.  I look forward to the growth on the private and public sides and on the shipping side of a highly efficient professional road haulage service that will be available to business in this country and a diminution of investment by firms and private people in over-capitalised and underworked road haulage stock which has been the pattern heretofore in this country.</P>
    <P>I have referred to Deputy O'Donnell's interest in the EEC situation.  I agree with him and we are watching that very closely.  As regards the overall transportation policy that he suggested should be introduced we have had a number of reports on this matter over the years and it is such a rapidly changing business that it is better to proceed in stages.  We have now taken the first step.  We should see how this develops.  If, arising out of the framework of this legislation, we develop a highly professional road transport organised service through various organisations, both private and public, if that does develop in the way I envisage, that will be very satisfactory as far as the road freight side is concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to transport generally I have, as I have already told the House, inaugurated an investigation with the aid of international consultants, McKinsey and Company, with a view to ascertaining the precise problems in regard to the CIE operation generally. <Col N="73" /> There should be some interesting answers coming up in the report which I expect, a preliminary report at any rate on the rail side, inside the next two months and inside the next six months a total report on the whole operation of CIE.  There should be some interesting results from this investigation which will throw up the options open to the Government and the House here in regard to where we should go concerning future transportation as it affects CIE generally. That is the rail side and the bus side of CIE, the operations other than the road freight side.</P>
    <P>We have also engaged the same firm of consultants to advise us on how best to organise sea transportation between B &amp; I and British Railways.  They have already come up with a preliminary recommendation which has been adopted as to the sharing of terminal facilities between Dublin and Liverpool and the sharing of ships between the two companies and there are further recommendations coming along in this respect.  In this rapidly changing business it is better to proceed on the basis of businesslike reports from consultants of this kind, to make decisions, bring in legislation, proceed stage by stage, rather than having a long-term total report that may be irrelevant by the time it comes out because it is a rapidly changing business.  In the past five years we have seen a complete change-over from traditional road freight to containerisation. This all happened in the last five to ten years.</P>

Of course, there will.  There will be no more enforcement of regulations in regard to areas or weights or commodities which exist at the moment, and entailed a large number of Garda personnel to see how existing hauliers were obeying or not obeying the existing regulations. That will all go.  The 840 existing hauliers will have their licences for the whole country and that will be a clean, straightforward matter.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that, as far as the unlicensed hauliers are concerned, the law remains the same, apart from the concessions in regard to cattle, sheep and pigs given here for everybody in the community.  It is totally free and not involved in the restrictions at all.  It is quite clear that the provision in regard to cattle, sheep and pigs is generally welcome.  It is just taking legislative cognisance of a fact of life. CIE road freight was only about 2 per cent of the haulage of this sort of business.  The provision was obviously being breached widely already.  I could see the legitimacy of that&mdash;although I do not condone breaches of the law&mdash; because of the impracticality in rural areas of a large operating company like CIE being forced to bring trucks to remote rural areas.  This just did not work and was not functioning properly. This type of business, depending as it does on arrivals and departures at all hours of the day and night, and involving a very personal and intimate relationship between haulier and farmer, obviously should not be included in any form of licensing or any form of restriction. I think the House generally recognises the commonsense of that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made about power being given to me by way of order under some sections of the Bill, and particularly section 8, I should like to assure the House that there is nothing unusual in this at all.  In a licensing Act it is obviously foolish to tie up any Minister or any Government over-much in regard to a matter that is flexible and may change from year to year or from time to time.  The safeguard is <Col N="75" /> that such orders must be placed before the Dáil and can be perused by Deputies and, if it is considered that there is any wrong or injustice incorporated in such orders, Deputies are free to raise the matter in public debate here in the House.</P>
    <P>One matter was mentioned for consideration by me and representations on it were made to me by the road haulage organisations.  There is one argument, although Deputy Clinton put forward the other argument.  On one argument it can be regarded as inequitable in this Bill that the 100 odd Twenty-six County hauliers who paid substantial money for their licences are being put on the same basis as their 740-odd other colleagues who had a less valuable type of licence and who are now put on an equal basis.  The case has been put to me that as and from 1st January, 1969, we should allow an extra lorry to each of these 100 licensed hauliers, just one extra.  It was suggested that whatever licences they had for whatever number of trucks, one should be added to that from 1st January, 1969.  That is the case which was made by Deputy Foley. Representations have also been made to me by other Deputies.  I will consider that matter between now and Committee Stage.  The other point was put by Deputy Clinton who said that these people bought a business at a particular time and asked why should they get anything in addition under this or any other legislation.</P>

      <P>I am giving the points of view that were raised in the debate.  This is the one matter which <Col N="76" /> was mentioned as possibly needing an amendment of the Bill.  No other amendment was suggested.  In view of the fact that this specific suggestion was made, I am willing to consider it between now and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not think anything else arises.  I am very glad the Bill has been welcomed generally.  As I said in my opening statement, I regard this as the first stage in the whole process of rationalisation in regard to transportation generally with a view to gearing our economy for the Common Market. It goes without saying that, because of our geographical location, transportation and the elimination of transportation costs as far as possible will be an all-important factor in our being a prosperous member of an enlarged European Economic Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to deal with a problem to which the community has been increasingly exposed in recent times and which finds expression in the forcible occupation of other people's property, mainly at the instigation of quasi-political groups, and forcible interference with the legitimate rights of the owners and sometimes of the general public as well.</P>
      <P>Since the House is well aware of the activities with which the Bill is concerned I need not refer to them in detail but I would like to make it clear that the Bill applies not only to the forcible occupation of buildings but also to the type of intimidatory exercises that have come to be known as fish-ins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a democracy such as ours, where there are no permanent political minorities, there are adequate democratic processes not only for ventilating dissatisfaction with the existing order of things but also for resolving grievances and differences of opinion. <Col N="77" /> Changes in law and policy can be, and are, secured by these processes.  Unfortunately, some of those who seek change are not prepared to abide by. the rules which our society has laid down for the conduct of its affairs. Instead, they resort to force and violence&mdash;or, as they would call it, &ldquo;direct action&rdquo;&mdash;to achieve their aims.  In recent years we have seen a growing tendency on the part of individuals and groups within the community not only to behave as if they were outside or above the law but to claim that they are entitled to act in this way.  It is clear that this development strikes at the very roots of our society and could not be allowed indefinitely to go unchecked.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the creation of three new offences in relation to land and vehicles, namely, forcible entry, dealt with in section 2, forcible occupation, dealt with in section 3 and encouraging and advocating the commission of these offences, section 4. &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; as defined in section 1 means an aircraft not in flight, a train, an omnibus or a boat, ship or other vessel.  The terms &ldquo;forcibly&rdquo; and &ldquo;forcible&rdquo; are defined in section 1&mdash; they include unspoken threats of force caused by the weight of numbers but, on the other hand, do not cover peaceful picketing or the like.  In section 3 the action of locking or barring doors, windows, <i>et cetera,</i> and the action of erecting physical obstructions to entry will constitute forcible occupation, where, but only where, such actions are calculated to prevent or obstruct the entry of any person lawfully entitled to enter.  Since the Bill is not designed to deal with such forms of occupation as, for example, where a &ldquo;wandering minstrel&rdquo; sleeps in a disused outhouse, or an itinerant or other homeless family seeks temporary shelter in an abandoned farmhouse, an exception is made in section 2 for a person who, having forcibly entered land or a vehicle, does not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the land or vehicle by the owner and, if requested to leave by the owner or by a uniformed garda, does so with all reasonable speed and in a peaceful manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> Section 4, subsection (2), of the Bill provides that, where a statement encouraging or advocating the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation is made by or on behalf of a group of persons, each member of the group will be guilty of an offence.  Contrary to what I understand has been suggested by some critics, there is in this no element of guilt by association. A member of a group is not being held responsible for what other members say unless what is said was said by or on behalf of the group.  Here I would point out that whether a statement has been made on behalf of a group is a question of fact which the prosecution would have to prove and, accordingly, the provision could not apply to a statement purporting to be made on behalf of the group which was actually made by some outsider.  Even though the provision is limited in this way, it might be unfair to individual members of a group to allow them no line of retreat where a spokesman has perhaps said more than some members would wish and subsection (3) of section 4 provides, therefore, that it will be a good defence for a person charged with such an offence to prove that he immediately took all reasonable steps open to him to dissociate himself from the statement or that the statement was made without his knowledge or that it was made without his consent.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been framed on the basis that the sanction of the criminal law should not be invoked as a substitute for civil action against trespass or to protect property rights or remedy civil wrongs where the circumstances are such that there is no threat to the community and no general public interest is involved.  The Bill will not, therefore, apply to incidents that arise in the course of private disputes between persons having different estates or interests in the same land, for example, between landlord and tenant or between mortgagor and mortagee. These are matters to be regulated only by existing civil property law.</P>
    <P>Where a person commits an offence of forcible entry or forcible occupation, it will, in the overwhelming majority of cases, be in circumstances where he has no colour of right to the property <Col N="79" /> entered or occupied.  Consequently, it would in the ordinary way be unreasonable to the point of absurdity to require the prosecution to go through the tedious and possibly costly process of proving ownership that is not being challenged.  Members of the House who have had personal experience of the purchase or sale of a house will appreciate that proof of title can be a tedious process.  Accordingly section 5 of the Bill provides that, unless the defendant shows to the satisfaction of the court that he has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership of the property, it will not be necessary for the prosecution to prove ownership.</P>
    <P>It may happen that, when squatters or protest groups occupy buildings and refuse to leave, it will become necessary for the owner to use some force to eject them and, in the process, he may cause damage to his property.  A practical example of this is where an owner had to break down a door of his house that was barred against him.  Since damage reasonably caused in such circumstances is directly attributable to the refusal of the illegal occupiers to get out when asked to do so, the Bill proposes, in section 6, that the court, in coming to a decision as to a penalty appropriate to the offence, should be able to take account of the damage as if it were damage caused by the defendant and also to take into consideration whether the defendant had compensated the owner for the damage.  Section 6 also provides that the owner may recover the amount of the damage as a simple contract debt in civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>The penalties for offences are provided in section 7.  Increased penalties are prescribed for second and subsequent offences tried summarily but all the offences are to be triable either summarily or on indictment.  Because the district court has no basic jurisdiction in regard to title to land, it is necessary to provide that jurisdiction in summary proceedings will not be ousted by reason solely of a question of title to land being brought into issue. Likewise, decisions of the district court in prosecutions under this Bill would not affect questions of title.  Both these matters are dealt with in section 8.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Because the offences created by the Bill are indictable it will be possible for the Garda Síochána to apply for warrants of arrest where necessary. However, there may be cases where an offence under section 3 has taken place and the circumstances are such that serious damage to, say, a building, or serious interference with the lawful rights of the owner in relation thereto, or serious inconvenience to the public wishing to transact business in the building, is being or will be caused as a result of the continuance of the offence and the only way of preventing the damage or inconvenience or of minimising it would be for the gardaí to arrest those concerned immediately. Accordingly, section 9 of the Bill provides for the vesting in the Garda Síochána of a power of arrest without warrant in what is an emergency situation. This arises only in relation to an offence under section 3.  Deputies will notice that all the four conditions set out in section 9 for the exercise of the power of arrest must be satisfied&mdash;they are not alternatives.</P>
    <P>So far as the problem of squatting is concerned, the provisions of this Bill are of general application and will extend to squatting in local authority dwellings as well as privately owned houses.  I want to make it clear, however, that the provisions of the Bill are without prejudice to section 13 of the Housing Act, 1970, which makes it an offence for an unauthorised person to enter a local authority dwelling in certain circumstances.  That section was enacted last summer to deal with an urgent and serious situation that had arisen in relation to squatting in houses owned by Dublin Corporation.  The section is part of the Housing Code and its enforcement is a matter for local authorities.  It will remain on the Statute Book alongside the provisions contained in this Bill, which, as I have said are of general application.  It may well be that section 13 of the Housing Act will prove adequate to deal with the problems confronting local authorities in this regard.  On the other hand, it is easy to envisage circumstances in which certain provisions of this Bill would be needed to supplement what is in the Housing Act.  I am thinking <Col N="81" /> primarily of section 4 of the Bill, under which it will be possible to deal with organisations which encourage and advocate squatting for quasi-political motives, and section 6, which will enable an owner to recover in civil proceedings the amount of any damage involved in recovering possession of property taken over by squatters.</P>
    <P>While I do not propose to involve myself in any discussion on housing matters, I think that, in so far as the Bill does seek to deal with the problem of squatting in local authority houses, it is necessary to say this much by way of justification of it.  Dublin and to a lesser extent other cities and towns, like cities and towns in every other country that we know of, have a shortage of houses, though it is of nothing like the dimensions that some of the critics would have us think. Those who have studied the problem most extensively say that the only city without a housing problem is a city that is dead or at least dying.  If they are right in this&mdash;and I believe they are &mdash; we must accept as a fact that urban housing shortages cannot be solved overnight, particularly in a country like ours that has limited resources.  Given that situation, it is essential that priorities should be determined in a rational and objective way and that needs should be met in accordance with these priorities.  The people who are most vociferous in their protests are rarely those in most urgent need.  If there is to be elementary justice, houses must continue to be allocated in an orderly manner and in accordance with the priorities established by the local authority.  I suggest that all of us here can and must agree that this is so and that the allocation cannot be allowed to be decided by small unrepresentative groups using force.</P>
    <P>The Government&mdash;and, I would submit, not only the Government but the Oireachtas &mdash; has the duty to protect the rights and the freedoms of all citizens &mdash; not just the most noisy elements. To say that is not to condemn people for voicing their grievances and for keeping on doing so.  Protest and pressure for change are not in themselves bad.  On the contrary, human <Col N="82" /> progress can be measured by the extent of man's questioning of himself and his environment and his willingness to adopt new concepts when the old ones have proved inadequate or unsuitable. Consequently, although many of us disagree profoundly with the ideas of some of those who are at present seeking to change the existing order of things and although we may, with justification, suspect their motives, we can and must respect, and if necessary defend, their right to propound their ideas and to voice their dissatisfactions, provided that they for their part understand that the majority, too, have rights.  But when people resort to force and violence to achieve their ends, the situation takes on a different complexion.  As I said earlier, ours is a democratic régime in which there are democratic processes for dealing with grievances and, where necessary, altering laws and policies.  In these circumstances there can be no justification for the use of force and violence.  If the foundations of democracy are liberty and order, let us not forget that without order there can be no liberty.</P>
    <P>It so happens that just at the moment we are in a period of relative quiet so far as the particular problem with which the Bill is designed to deal is concerned.  I think it is fortunate that this is so because it enables us to examine the proposals in the Bill in a more detached way than might perhaps be the case if our deliberations were to take place against a background of heat engendered by particular incidents.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to stress that I do not put forward this Bill as the last word in perfection.  I put it forward as a reasonable and moderate attempt to meet a serious and recurring problem.  Some may think it is not strong enough: others that it may go further than is necessary.  I shall be glad to hear the views of the House and to consider any suggestions that may be made for its improvement.</P>
    <P>With that, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The introduction of this Bill by the <Col N="83" /> Minister for Justice is a serious reflection on the Government.  I say that because the reasons given by the Minister for the introduction of this Bill pinpoint the failure of the Government in certain respects.  The Minister in the second paragraph of his speech says:</P>
      <P>Since the House is well aware of the activities with which the Bill is concerned I need not refer to them in detail but I would like to make it clear that the Bill applies not only to the forcible occupation of buildings but also to the type of intimidatory exercises that have come to be known as &ldquo;fish-ins&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With those few lines the Minister skated over the entire background to this piece of legislation, quite understandably as far as he is concerned.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fish-ins, this Bill is being introduced by the Minister because of the protests and demonstrations in regard to the Hume Street houses last year and because of squatting by certain persons to highlight the disgraceful condition of housing and the homeless in this city and throughout the country.  I propose to deal very briefly with the Hume Street demonstrations.  It is hard really to blame the students and others who demonstrated, first peacefully and eventually in an unlawful manner, to publicise the fact that Georgian houses in Dublin were being demolished, were to be replaced by modern office blocks and the city of Dublin thereby was to be robbed of its character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of that episode can be very briefly told.  These people had a legitimate and understandable point of view.  They protested in a peaceable and orderly manner for many months. They sought to convince the powers-that-be that it was wrong to pull down these houses and that a great number of people in the city and throughout the country favoured the retention of these houses as part of the character of their capital city.  They did that in a lawful way until they were blue in the face.  The Government would not listen to them.  The Minister for Local Government would not listen to them. <Col N="84" /> The Government, through their spokesman in this House, insulted the protestors and those who agreed with them by describing them as &ldquo;belted earls&rdquo; and other derogatory and, in Irish conditions, insulting names.</P>
    <P>Let us see what happened.  Lawful protest got these people nowhere.  Lawful protests were ignored.  There was a newspaper campaign, a perfectly legitimate campaign.  I think I am right in saying there were lawful pickets, lawful marches, lawful protests, banners, placards, the lot, and they were all ignored, and the spokesman on behalf of the Government here had very hard things indeed to say about these people and expressed his utter contempt for them and all that they stood for.  But when these people, still believing that they were right, that they had a legitimate argument, that the Government were unreasonable, were driven to unlawful means, to forcible entry, to unlawful squatting, the Government climbed down.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;he is now Minister for Finance&mdash;gave an assurance that the houses would stand, that they would be preserved.  Lawful efforts failed but unlawful efforts prevailed.</P>
    <P>I think, and many think with me, that if item No. 21 on today's Order Paper had been dealt with months ago the Hume Street episode could not have been used as an excuse for introducing this Bill.  Item No. 21 is the Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill, 1969.  The object of the Bill is to remove to some extent planning appeals from politics. It does not go as far as the Bill that this party introduced before to remove planning appeals entirely from politics and hand them over to an independent tribunal which would adjudicate on them in an impartial way, free from backdoor whisperings, from political party influence or vested interests.</P>
    <P>It was only because of unfair decisions regarding the use of the Hume Street houses that the people were driven first to peaceful street protests and, in the final analysis, to the unlawful method with which the Government disagreed but to which it succumbed. The other sit-in or squatting protests <Col N="85" /> in this city were staged mainly by people who had become frustrated and exasperated waiting for houses for years.  It would be difficult to blame people in many parts of Ireland, urban and rural, if they adopted illegal means to draw the attention of the powers-that-be to the circumstances in which they are living as regards houses.  A person waiting for a pre-fab, which is something that should be put up in a matter of weeks, may have to wait months and sometimes years.  This is the sort of dereliction of duty on the part of this Government which drives decent, law-abiding citizens to break the law to ventilate their just grievances.</P>
    <P>As regards fish-ins, have the Government done anything to inquire whether there are abuses by absentee landlords or find out whether local people have grievances?  I do not think they have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Do something practical about it.  So much for the background to the Bill and why the Minister found it necessary to introduce it.  I say it condemns the Government for dereliction of duty on a number of headings.  So far as the general policy of the Bill is concerned, I and this Party believe in the rights of individuals, not only in the rights of landlords, but in the rights of the ordinary man who occupies a house or land whether he occupies it as owner or as tenant, but this Bill will need a lot of thought and consideration before this House could pass it. Certain portions of it seem to me dangerous and quite unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Minister to section 1 and the definition of owner, &ldquo;owner' in relation to land, includes the lawful <Col N="86" /> occupier,...&rdquo; I have no quarrel with that; &ldquo;every person lawfully entitled to the immediate use and enjoyment of unoccupied land,&rdquo;... I have no quarrel with that definition, but &ldquo;any person having an estate or interest in land&rdquo; is to be treated as the owner for the purposes of this Bill and in particular for the purposes of section 2 of this Bill.  That could mean a fee farm grant or somebody who has parted with occupation of the land so long as he is paid his nominal ground rent which may now be compulsorily bought out for something like 14 years purchase. I think that definition should go out immediately because when you come to section 2 of the Bill it says that a person who forcibly enters land or a vehicle shall be guilty of an offence unless he is the owner of the land, or the vehicle.  If my reading is correct that means that a head landlord or a fee farm grantor who has no right or entitlement under any circumstances, unless his rent is not paid or the terms of the grant are broken, to enter the land, may do so by virtue of this legislation and he will not be regarded as committing an offence.  That is dangerous and quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I am totally against section 4 of this measure which I do not think is necessary. This is the section which makes it an offence if a person encourages or advocates the commission of an offence under sections 2 or 3 of this Act.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Where a statement in contravention of subsection (1) of this section is made by or on behalf of a group of persons, each member of the group shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>What is a group of persons?  Where is the definition of &ldquo;a group of persons&rdquo; in this Bill?  It would be very difficult to define a group.  Are they to be associated under some set of rules, under a constitution?  Are they to be incorporated or unincorporated?  Are they to be some people who meet socially?</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Where a person is charged with an offence under sub-section (2) of this section it shall be a defence to the charge to show&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> (a) that as soon as possible after the statement was made he took all reasonable steps to dissociate himself from the contents of the statement,...</P>
    <P>How can he do that?  Is he to buy newspaper space or get a loundspeaker van to go around the area telling all and sundry that he dissociates himself from this?  It is not workable.  That the statement was made without his knowledge or consent &mdash; how is he to prove that? I say that section 4 is an unnecessary and dangerous section and I intend to oppose it <i>in toto</i> on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I also think that section 5 goes too far.  Section 5 more or less shifts the onus of proof on to the defendant.</P>
    <P>I am against these sections in criminal legislation.  The section-says:</P>
    <P>In any proceedings in relation to an offence under section 2, 3 or 4 of this Act or to conspiracy to commit such an offence, unless the defendant shows to the satisfaction of the court that he or, in the case of proceedings relating to an offence under section 4, every person whom he encouraged or attempted to encourage has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership of the land or vehicle, it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to prove ownership of the land or vehicle.</P>
    <P>My reading of that section is that if a person <i>bona fide</i> believes that he has a right to enter land and honestly does so under that <i>bona fide</i> belief, once the State proves that somebody else owns the land then the person who is accused is guilty of a criminal offence under this measure notwithstanding&mdash;I would advise the Minister, as I see him shaking his head, to read this section a few times.</P>

    <P>In any proceedings in relation to an offence under sections 2, 3 or 4 of this Act or to conspiracy to <Col N="88" /> commit such an offence, unless the defendant shows to the satisfaction of the court that he or, in the case of proceedings relating to an offence under section 4, every person whom he encouraged or attempted to encourage has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership of the land or vehicle, it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to prove ownership of the land or vehicle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We have had too many glib statements like this from Ministers from that party in the past who would not listen to any suggestions or reason from this side of the House and later it was proved that this side of the House was right and the Ministers and their advisers were wrong.  That happened many times.  I am giving the Minister notice now that I believe that this section should put the law beyond doubt by stating that if a person acts <Col N="89" /> in the <i>bona fide</i> belief that he has a claim of right he is not committing a breach of the law.  If the Minister agrees with me that that is what he means then I would advise him and his advisers to have another look at this and put that beyond doubt because certainly it is far from beyond doubt in the measure as it stands.</P>
      <P>The Minister thought necessary to refer to this matter of an arrest without a warrant and to say that all the conditions here must be complied with, that there was &ldquo;and&rdquo;, &ldquo;and&rdquo;, &ldquo;and&rdquo;. I believe that in the present state of the law and the number of people who are entitled to issue warrants, it should always be reasonably practicable to obtain a warrant.  This sort of arrest without a warrant is creeping into Act after Act, Bill after Bill that comes into this House, and it is a move in the wrong direction.  The Minister has told us that notwithstanding the Housing Act of last year, which dealt with squatting in corporation houses, this Bill is intended to apply to such squatting. I should like the Minister to clarify what he means here.  I sincerely hope that by squatting he does not mean sub-letting; that he does not mean that unfortunate parents who take in their children, or in-laws, or relatives who have not got houses are going to be treated as squatters or people in unlawful occupation under this measure and prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, if the Government had been doing their business, if they had accepted the Planning Appeals Bill which was introduced by this party, debated here for months during Private Members' time and decried by the then Minister for Local Government this measure would not be necessary.  I believe that if the Bill introduced by the same Minister who decried our Bill and which has been on the Order Paper since 1969, had been gone ahead with, if we had got our priorities right and removed the necessity for these so-called unlawful protests there would not be any necessity for this measure.  I also believe that if the motions standing in the names of members of this party and members of the Labour Party for discussion in Private Members' time, and which are <Col N="90" /> never taken, urging the Government to have a crash programme with regard to the housing shortage were dealt with and if the extreme cases of bad housing were dealt with the unlawful protests which the Minister fears and talks about would not take place and this Bill would not be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is significant that once the Government yielded to what they call the unlawful demonstration, sit-in, or squatin in Hume Street last year, as the Minister said, we have had no more of that.  The people proved by these unlawful protests that they were right and the Minister and the Government were wrong.  That is the sad part of the business. That still would not deter me from accepting the principles in this Bill, but the cut-down principles, the principles, as I say, with the amendment in regard to ownership which I have spoken about, the complete exclusion from the Bill of section 4, and the amending of section 5, as well as other amendments which may be necessary when this Bill is gone over with a fine comb.</P>
    <P>This Bill was conceived by the Government in or about the time of the Hume Street episode or the other sit-in or squatting in Dublin to highlight the housing scandal in this city.  It was hatched and decided upon in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said in the concluding part of his speech that happily those conditions no longer exist.  Would the Minister consider leaving this Bill on the Order Paper for some considerable time?  I want to repeat that so far as Sections 2 and 3 are concerned and so far as they are necessary to preserve the right of individuals&mdash; whether they are lowly working-class people or belted earls, as described by a former Minister in this House &mdash; I am in favour so long as they are necessary. However, they would not have been necessary if this Government had discharged their obligation to the people.  In that atmosphere, and in view of the fact that there has been no repetition of this, would the Minister consider either of two courses: making this a temporary measure to be reviewed in three years, or leaving it on the Order Paper to be activated at a later date if necessary?</P>
    <Col N="91" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>We must question the reasoning and the cause which prompted the introduction of this Bill.  The haste with which it has been introduced must be commented on.  There are many important proposals and Bills to be debated in this House and it is difficult to understand how this Bill has now jumped the queue.  More than 12 months ago, the then Minister for Justice made a rather lengthy statement about the so-called progressive law reform programme being undertaken by his Department and the necessity to carry out that programme as quickly as possible.  In his summary of the measures which he intended to put forward during 1970 and 1971 there was no mention of a Bill such as that now before us.</P>
      <P>The truth of the matter is simply that this is a further public display of the Government's failure and inability to deal with the question of lack of housing and its associated social problems, such as the problem of exorbitant rents for very bad flats, rooms and so on.  Apparently there is a lack of confidence within the Government that these problems will be solved in the forseeable future and they want to ensure that public protest and the resulting publicity is discouraged and eliminated to avoid the embarrassment that such protest may cause the Government.</P>
      <P>Certain sections of the Bill are most objectionable.  The thinking and logic of these sections seem to be borrowed from a dictatorial regime.  Certainly the ideas in some of these sections are not copied from a truly democratic form of Government and it is regrettable that an Irish Government should introduce these alien and dangerous precedents into Irish law.</P>
      <P>Some of these have been mentioned by the previous speaker.  In sections 2 and 3 the offences are defined but a noticeable exception is that a landlord who forces his way into a dwelling occupied by one of his tenants, thereby causing annoyance and damage, apparently is exempt from the provisions of section 2.  Similarly under section 3 if a landlord breaks into the dwelling of one of his tenants, if he stays there and occupies the premises, he is not affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Section 4 is most objectionable because it brings within its scope very many people.  For example, in the situation regarding Hume Street quoted by Deputy Fitzpatrick public statements were made by a responsible body, An Taisce, supporting the action of the people who were squatting. Under this section all those people&mdash; members of that body &mdash; could be guilty of an offence and regarded as criminals</P>
    <P>In section 5 there is introduced one of these alien ideas where it appears that a person must prove his innocence. Our law usually presumes a person innocent until proved guilty but the reverse appears to be the case in section 5 and is a most objectionable section in that regard.  In fact, the section itself does not make much sense because, to my mind, if a person has a <i>bona fide</i> claim to ownership of land or a vehicle he does not commit an offence if he believes he has a claim and acts accordingly.  The thinking behind the section must have been borrowed from a dictatorial regime somewhere.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this Bill is that it does not differentiate between the various types of squatting.  We in the Labour Party do not condone the action of people who crash the housing list.  However, it is one thing to say that they should not do that and should be put out when they get in, but it is another thing altogether to bring all these unfortunate people within the term &ldquo;criminals&rdquo;.  In England where the problem of squatting has been fairly widespread in recent times they have dealt with it in a much better way.  I have not the text of the British measure here but it does not contain any of the very objectionable features of this Bill. In England they have solved the problem of dealing with squatters and protecting the interests of property owners without finding it necessary to create a new class of criminals as we are doing under this measure.  I suppose it is worth nothing, also, that that measure was introduced by Mr. Heath.</P>
    <P>There is no apparent attempt under this Bill to classify the various types of squatters, to analyse their motives or their actions.  Squatters have different <Col N="93" /> motives for their actions.  There are the protesters, for example, people protesting against the sentences imposed in English trials over the past 12 months.  There are those people who occupy certain air line offices and the British Embassy.  Their occupation is purely temporary and usually does not involve the use of force, force within the definition contained in this Bill, and in the normal sense it is something with which a responsible Government must deal.</P>
    <P>There is the other type of squatter involved in the Hume Street and Pembroke Road occupations.  It is possible that a certain degree of force would be used by the squatters in these cases.  Generally the inconvenience caused by their action is slight but they can undoubtedly cause great inconvenience to, say, the occupier of the house.  However, as we have seen in the Pembroke Road case, this problem can be overcome by the existing process of the law.</P>
    <P>Then there are the homeless people who occupy the vacant premises.  In practically all cases these people are victims of the housing crisis, victims of the lack of Government policy, the lack of Government action in regard to housing.  These, too, are in a different class from the other two types of squatters I have mentioned.  Their only concern is to provide shelter for themselves and their families.  It may be necessary to provide a certain amount of force or to give a certain amount of power to the owner of the property to eject these squatters, but certainly there is no justification for calling them criminals or for making criminals out of them, because their only crime is to provide accommodation for themselves and their families, and the owner can get back his property without going to the lengths provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Here again we are saying the homeless person is liable to be fined as well as being liable to be ejected from where he squats.  It may be necessary to give power to eject such a person but to go further and to fine him, to imprison him, to make a criminal out of him, this is something to which we object very strongly.  When that person <Col N="94" /> gets out of prison or out of court after being fined he is still homeless. If he goes back into the same place, again he is ejected; there is a heavier fine and a longer term of imprisonment. Every time he tries to provide shelter for himself the penalties become heavier and heavier.</P>
    <P>The penalties under this measure, in the main, will apply to homeless people, out-of-work people who have not got the means or the money to help themselves.  Having regard to Article 41 of our Constitution relative to the place of the family in the life of this country, most sections if not the whole of this Bill should be re-examined. Under the Constitution the State guarantees to protect the family, but in this Bill he does quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the vast majority of these homeless squatters are married people with families.  I do not want to be misinterpreted in this matter.  People can say that such squatters do other people out of houses and all that.  That is so because, as I have said, the Government have not provided sufficient houses.  I am not objecting to is the fact that we are now to put these people out.  What I am objecting to is the fact that we are now making criminals out of them.  There is already a provision in the 1970 Housing Act to take care of squatting in local authority housing, and I think either one or other of these provisions should be removed from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>There is another significant omission from the Bill in that there still remains the right of the owner, as we have seen in Hume Street forcibly to eject squatters and to use violence.  The Minister referred to violence.  We are all aware of the kind of violence that was used in Hume Street by the landlord in that case against the squatters.  I do not think people should be encouraged by public policy to take the law into their own hands.  This is bad.  It is a very significant omission from this Bill that a landlord is still free to use whatever physical violence he wishes to eject squatters and apparently he has the legal right to use this physical force to get his premises vacated.  There is <Col N="95" /> nothing in this Bill that limits the physical force which a landlord may use.</P>
    <P>It appears from what I have said on this so far that this Bill is very unsatisfactory; it is not required at this point in time; it has been seen that existing legislation is adequate to deal with the problems in this area and that there are new precedents being created in this legislation which are completely alien to the Irish people.  There are even certain sections, particularly section 5, which are in many ways comparable to section 15 or section 19 of the offences Against the State Act, 1939. Section 15 (5) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, reads:</P>
    <P>In any prosecution under this section the burden of proof that any act was authorised under this section shall lie on the person prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the same Act contains a similar provision which states that the charge itself carries a presumption of guilt on the part of the accused. Section 5 of the Bill before the House also carries that presumption of guilt and the accused must prove his innocence and there is no obligation on the prosecution to prove guilt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is completely wrong.  I do not like to interrupt the Deputy but he completely misunderstands the section.  The section refers only to onus of proof&mdash;there is no mention of conviction in it at all&mdash; and onus of proof in relation to one matter which makes up the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it could be the one and only thing that would convict. This is completely unnecessary.  When I first read section 5 I thought I had misread it because I could not believe what I read but my initial fears have been confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 9 a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person without warrant.  Here again we are giving unnecessary power to the Garda Síochána in this day and age when <Col N="96" /> the Force has not got sufficient numbers to cope with crime and we see crime increasing, particularly crime aimed at old people, due in the main to insufficient numbers in the Garda Síochána.  We are now giving the Garda Síochána this extra duty which is one of the most objectionable parts of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have stated my views and the views of my party on this Bill.  Other members of the party will expand on what I have said and add many things to what I have said about this Bill which gives power, in my opinion, to convict on hearsay, on rumour, even on suspicion. It is a Bill which gives power to bring charges against persons who are members of a particular organisation or group, people like members of An Taisce who made a statement in support of the Hume Street affair.  I suppose we could also include the Minister's precedessor who wrote a letter supporting a tenant who had gone into a local authority house. I suppose if the Bill is made retrospective he will be dealt with under section 5.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at this Bill to see if it is really necessary, to examine his conscience or the conscience of the Government as to what basically prompted them to introduce this measure.  I think everyone is agreed that it basically stems from the housing crisis particularly in the Dublin area.  If there was no housing crisis there would be no Bill like this before us today.  If there was confidence that the housing crisis would be solved in the near future this Bill would not have been rushed in here, would not have jumped the queue with the haste with which it did jump it.  I would ask the Minister to stop and think about the people who are in the ordinary way law-abiding who will be accused as criminals if the provisions of this Bill as they stand at the moment are passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it a little bit sad at this stage of our affairs that, with all the laws that have been passed in this House, and all the legislation that is on the Statute Book, during the past three or four years we have found that there is inadequate protection for <Col N="97" /> people to own and enjoy property and to prevent that property from being stolen from them, and that no authority is available to property owners to restore their property to them.</P>
      <P>I was surprised, indeed, to find that this Bill had to be introduced to get over some of the anomalies that exist in the law.  There is nothing at all ominous in this piece of legislation.  It is being introduced to prevent and stop the illegal possession of property under the guise, either political or otherwise, of shortage.  To say that a person without a home is legally entitled to steal possession of a home, and that he is not guilty and is not amenable to the law, is like saying that a hungry man can walk into a shop any day of the week and steal because he is hungry.</P>

If we choose to live according to that concept we will have to have a completely new look inwardly and practice the charity that we would grant to others.  Let us be careful when we go into the field of charity because, in this day and age, there is a diminution of it, and the passing back to the state of the function of looking after people and we, the people who preach charity, in our daily lives know very little about it.</P>
      <P>We are a society regulated by laws and, so long as we are regulated by laws, they are there for the protection of people.  This is the point I am coming to.  This piece of legislation would not be necessary but for people who drift in from anywhere you like, as the fancy may take them, or who are brought in by groups for any purpose of theirs.  They then take over because they have no shelter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;houses which they believe are unoccupied or not in use.  Deputy Pattison said that the argument will be used that the occupation of corporation houses was not interfering with the rights of others who had waited years in poor living conditions and poor housing conditions, that these people were not, in fact, jumping the queue and looking after themselves.  It is all right to argue that if a local authority do not provide adequate houses and a pool of houses.  You must not only provide sufficient houses to meet the daily needs but you must also provide for these people who drift in without any regulation, any transfer, or anything, with a wife and child or two children and expect to be housed immediately.</P>
      <P>To meet this need in an urban area would call not only for full housing for those who live in the city or town but also a pool of houses, a rest centre for those who on some fancy of their own might decide that Cork was not the place where they wanted to live and that Dublin would be nice.  You find this movement between urban areas and from the country to the city. So long as you do, and so long as you have full employment, so long will you have housing problems and housing needs.  These are the growth signs of a lively society.  It is when we reverse this growth and have a standstill position or a falling back that the problem is solved easily enough because the housing units will be available in that area or in that country.  People will have moved out to where they may find better conditions or employment.  Wherever you have this growth you will have these problems.  They are not peculiar to Dublin and they are not peculiar to Ireland.  That does not mean that these people who come in can take the law into their own hands no matter what the personal pressures on them are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The property of people in this city and, indeed, throughout the country has been invaded and taken over. Heretofore it was possible to get a garda and say: &ldquo;This is my property. Remove that person.  He has no right to be here.&rdquo;  Out of that grew the development that you could not do that. <Col N="99" /> You would have to get him off yourself. It was not the garda's duty and you had to get him off as best you could.</P>
    <P>I see a dangerous position in this state of affairs.  Deputy Cooney can well see the development of the position where a house owner or a property owner has to go to a solicitor and start proceedings in court, and go as far as the steps of the court, if you like.  We all know the frustration and danger that can ensue for people who have not got money.  It is all right to say that people who have money can afford to spend it, but what about people who have not?  I can assure the House that people may well be forced to take action on their own. either a knife, or a gun, or a hay knife, or some other weapon, in sheer frustration because they cannot get a person off their property.</P>
    <P>In that respect alone there was a danger that there would be continuing breaches of the law and that, if this were allowed to continue when this weakness was discovered, it could lead to violence and a breakdown of law and order in our society.  I cannot see anything in this Bill about which anyone can complain.  It sets out a method by which the law can be invoked to move a person off some premises where he has no right to be with no legal ownership in the premises and unable to establish any legal ownership in the premises.  For that reason alone this Bill fills a void in our legislation and should be on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>There are too many clever people today who are testing the law to find out how far they can go.  When they find there is no reaction from the law and that they can break the law, they carry on and do so.  This type of baiting is going on all the time.  We are fast approaching a state in this country, and in other countries too, where ordinary law enforcement officers are not too sure that the laws they read and seek to act under are either constitutional or able to stand up in court, with the result that very often they can be browbeaten, if you like, by an eloquent speaker in the street or somewhere <Col N="100" /> else.  They are often told to stay out of it.</P>
    <P>It is time we spelled out the law in a simple manner so that a person can enjoy the ownership of his own property and he can in a simple way prove he has the right to tenancy, ownership or actual full ownership of it and that any person found on that property without permission, reason or right should be removed and removed quickly.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with this type of legislation.  As a matter of fact, I see the positive side to it.  It will save people from getting into serious trouble.  By &ldquo;people&rdquo; I mean ordinary people who believe their rights are guaranteed under the Constitution. There are many aspects to the law. If the owner of the property which these people entered by deliberately breaking the law were to use the same force to get these people out as they used to enter there would be serious breaches of the peace up and down the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison mentioned landlords but it is not so much landlords we are talking about here as ordinary people who own a house.  They are not engaged in the renting of houses or in the building of houses for renting; they are merely the owners of a property. If that property becomes vacant for one reason or another they may suddenly find it is occupied.  If they ask the people to leave and they will not leave they may go along to their solicitor but, on the other hand, they may not, They must go along to the guards but the guards cannot put them out.  The owner is an ordinary peaceful citizen who saved up his money and bought a house and he is the person we are really concerned with here.</P>
    <P>There is also the danger of corporation houses being occupied and here the system of rehousing people may break down completely because of people who jump the queue and set themselves up in homes before anybody else.  If this sort of thing were to continue without being controlled everyone would do likewise.</P>
    <P>The main reason why this Bill is being introduced is to bring some order into an area where a weakness has been <Col N="101" /> found and for that reason alone it is welcome.  The squatting by preservationists in Stephen's Green is a different thing altogether.  I hope the right of protest will never be fully and completely extinguished.  The only progress society can hope for will come from protest.  We are not dealing with this kind of thing good, bad or indifferent; all that is sought in this Bill is the preservation of people's rights.  The idea of withdrawing people's rights is far from the Minister's mind or the Government's mind.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure, which might be just in time, but may be a little late. The fact that it impedes the activities of political groups of one form or another who attract attention to their own aims and ideals, which on full investigation and examination hold forth no great hope for the masses, means that it is doing a good job.  If this Bill protects the rights of the citizens under the Constitution, as it has all the appearance of doing, then I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No one could disagree with the Minister when he says that squatting is a problem.  We would have to be blind and deaf if we did not realise it was a problem.  We must, however, take issue with the Minister in his proposed solution of it.  His solution is to create three new criminal offences as stated in sections 2,3, and 4.  We should examine the problem that has to be solved and see if it merits being solved through the medium of the criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement the Minister refers to the people who create this problem as &ldquo;quasi political groups&rdquo;.  He also speaks about the type of intimidatory exercises which have come to be known as fish-ins.  If we examine those people who have squatted over the last couple of years we see that by and large they were homeless people.  The initiative to go squatting might have come from these groups known as &ldquo;quasi political groups&rdquo; but the reason squatting occured at all was that deserving people were homeless.  In other words, a serious social evil was at the root of the squatting.  I cannot see how a Government in their right senses can hope to solve a social evil by <Col N="102" /> making criminal offences out of that social problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister used emotive language in my view when he described fish-ins as intimidatory exercises.  We all know they have taken place.  Having read about these fish-ins in the press I was inclined to look askance at them, until I had occasion to campaign in the Finn Valley in Donegal during the recent by-election there.  I canvassed every house in the Finn Valley west of Ballybofey.  The Minister was in that area too and I know that Senators and Deputies in the Minister's party also canvassed all the houses in that area.  I knew at the time that the Minister's party would get the majority of votes from the houses in that area.  The point I want to make is that right through that area runs the Finn river and the tributaries to it.  It is quite a famous sporting river but for a length of 15 miles not one of those people whom I, the Minister and his supporters were canvassing is entitled to throw a fishing rod into the river.  Having seen the appalling injustice there, my views on fish-ins have changed.  Fish-ins are an expression of a social evil.  People are being deprived of their just rights and the protests that have taken place in support of those rights do not to my mind warrant the type of offence that this Bill creates.</P>
    <P>It is ironical and shameful that the last time trespass&mdash;because that is what is involved here &mdash; was made a criminal offence was in the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1851 when it was the answer of the Government in the Castle to the lawful protest of the small Irish tenant farmers who tried to become masters of their own destiny.  We are now in 1971 and 120 years later we are introducing repressive legislation to make another type of trespass a criminal offence, a type of trespass which also springs from social evils in our society, in the same way as the trespass by those Irish farmers was caused by the social evil of landlordism.  Very often in the present situation it is landlordism, landlordism in the guise of the property speculator which is giving rise to this trouble.  Deputy Gallagher was <Col N="103" /> eloquent and nearly emotional when he talked about these squatters stealing possession of a home.  That has not happened yet.  He talked about a poor man who would be unable to call on the mechanics of the law to restore his home to him.</P>
    <P>That is not what squatting has been here so far.  Individual homes have not been threatened.  Squatting has taken place in, for example, empty houses in Pembroke Road, houses bought one by one by the property speculator until such time as he has a row of perfectly good houses which he can knock down and replace with an office block.  That is the type of landlordism which is causing this social evil and provoking squatting. Squatting has also taken place in corporation flats.  That does an injustice to the small man because it interferes with priorities on the housing list. That type of squatting must be stopped and powers were given by this House in the Housing Act of 1970 to put an end to that type of squatting.  The Minister referred to that in his speech. I submit that the powers given in that Act are quite sufficient to restrain and prevent any injustice done to anybody by squatting in corporation premises.</P>
    <P>The other squatting that took place was that connected with the notorious events in Hume Street.  It would now appear from what has happened that the squatters were right.  It cannot be that much of an offence if ultimately the people who committed it are proved to be right.  Again, we have to consider the people whose property is interfered with; I will not go so far as to say whose rights were injured.  These were empty houses awaiting demolition. Again, they were the property of a development company and I do not think that the harm done to the property rights of that development company justified any Irish Government introducing a Bill to create a new criminal offence.  It is a sad day to see criminal offences created to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher admitted it would be a poor day that would see the extinguishment of protest.  Significantly, what he said was it would be a poor <Col N="104" /> day to see the full and complete extinguishment of protest.  One must deduce from that that he is agreeable to protest being stifled to carefully controlled and suitably acceptable protest. But protest, by definition, must be free.  I think he was quite wrong in making protest a conditional thing. Protest is proper when it is within the law.  This is where we come to this problem here because these squatting protests are technically outside the law but the law they are outside is the law of property and there has always been a legal remedy for any infringement of the rights of property and the remedy has been through the civil courts by means of ejectment, in order to obtain possession, or by an action for trespass. These remedies are still available to any party whose property may be subject to squatting.</P>
    <P>When we consider the squatting that has taken place to date the parties against whom it took place are well able, both in terms of finance and knowledge, to arm themselves to get into court and get their remedy there. Quite justifiably these people can come back to us and say that the remedy is too clumsy.  As a lawyer, I know well the cumbersome procedures that have to be gone through before a property owner can secure an eviction from his property, but these procedures are cumbersome purely because the machinery is antiquated and old fashioned.  If the present civil law relating to ejectment and trespass were to be revised, overhauled, made efficient and speedy, and if the jurisdiction of the district court were to be increased in ejectment and process, as I understand it is to be increased in tort and contract, and if the machinery were streamlined, there would be no need for this obnoxious Bill creating new criminal offences.</P>
    <P>In Britain, where the problem is more complex and more widespread, and where there are quasi political groups by the score, the Government have not found it necessary to create new criminal offences.  They have streamlined the law of ejectment and this has proved adequate to meet the nuisance.  If the same were done here, property owners, if they wanted to, could invoke a speedy civil remedy and <Col N="105" /> secure possession of their property. Indeed, the Minister in his statement and in the Bill recognises that the only question at issue is the restoration of possession to the lawful owner, owner meaning occupier as well as owner in the strict sense of the word.  Section 2 says that a person who forcibly enters on land but does not interfere with it and subsequently leaves it commits no offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his own statement mentions the example of the wandering minstrel sleeping in a disused outhouse. We have the example of the wandering family&mdash;husband and pregnant wife&mdash; occupying a stable.  These people, if they wander into premises, commit no offence provided they leave the premises ultimately.  It is quite clear the Minister recognises the kernel of the problem is the failure on the part of the squatters to leave.  Surely, if a system can be devised to ensure that they leave peaceably the problem is solved.  If they refuse to leave they can be made to leave if, as I say, the civil remedy is updated and streamlined. There is no need then to create a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>This Bill has been framed on the basis that the sanction of the criminal law should not be invoked as a substitute for civil action against trespass...</P>
    <P>That is precisely what this Bill does, invokes sanction of the criminal law for civil action.  I cannot understand the mentality of a Government prepared to allow a piece of oppressive legislation, which they admit is a criminal sanction to remedy a civil law, and prepared to tolerate this particular approach when they know it is essentially a civil wrong that is at stake which could be remedied by a civil remedy provided that remedy is streamlined. It does not need legislation.  It can be done by updating the procedure. All that is necessary is to convene the Rules Committee, let them revise the rules and lay the revised rules before the House; that will streamline the procedure.  There is no need for an expensive Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>This Bill is indiscriminate in its application. <Col N="106" /> It must necessarily be so. The case has been made that it is designed to deal with the quasi-political groups and the political squatter, the intimidator, but no such distinction is drawn in the Bill and, therefore, it must be indiscriminate in its application and it must hit the genuine as well as the poseur and the &ldquo;scruffies&rdquo;. The Minister recognises this.  He said in his opening speech:</P>
    <P>Where a person commits an offence of forcible entry or forcible occupation, it will, in the overwhelming majority of cases, be in circumstances where he has no colour of right to the property entered or occupied.</P>
    <P>What about the minority of cases in which there is a colour of right?  We are not talking about legal right.  There is a colour of moral right in the case of a person wandering the streets, homeless; surely that person should not be put in gaol because he takes shelter in an empty house belonging to a property speculator.  It seems to me we have come a long way from 1916 and the Proclamation and a long way from 1851, the last time trespass was made a criminal offence by an Act of Westminister.  Prior to that, the last time forcible entry was a criminal offence was in 1402 and then it dealt with forcible entry by a landlord to eject a tenant.  Here we are in the enlightened age of 1971 creating three new offences to stamp out a social evil. I cannot understand the mentality of a Government of a free republic that will not streamline civil law and then exhaust the remedies of the civil law and if they are inefficient or inadequate then come to the House with a piece of criminal legislation.</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of the Bill is to create a precedent.  The onus of proof is shifted from the prosecution in what could be a most important matter, proof of ownership.  Wherever you see the onus of proof being shifted to the defence, that is to my mind impinging on the principle that no man is guilty until proved guilty.  That should be avoided if at all possible in legislation.</P>
    <P>Although it is guarded with substantial conditions the Bill introduces the power for a member of the Garda <Col N="107" /> to arrest without warrant, something that should be used extremely sparingly. It is, I think, a hastily drafted Bill.  Section 2 says that a person who forcibly enters land or a vehicle shall be guilty of an offence unless he is the owner of the land or vehicle or, if he is not the owner, he does not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the land or vehicle.  But by definition, if he enters into another's property, he is trespassing and trespass itself is automatic interference with use and enjoyment. That is shoddy drafting.  These matters can be tackled in Committee, if it comes to that Stage, but I appeal to the Minister not to come to the House to solve a social problem by creating a new criminal offence.  Solve it under the civil law as it has been solved for centuries past.  Do not ask this House to pass legislation making trespass a criminal offence when the last piece of such legislation was passed by Westminister in order to intimidate and make criminals of our forefathers.</P>
    <P>In his statement and in the Bill the Minister acknowledges that the kernel of the problem is to get clear possession for the owner and nobody can deny that desire.  Under our law and Constitution the property owner is entitled to clear possession of his property.  We should be anxious to ensure that he gets it but gets it within the realms of the civil law.  The Minister recognises that restoration of possession is the kernel of the problem and section 2 (b) of the Bill also recognises that.  I appeal to the Minister not to proceed with this Bill but to streamline the civil law and give people the remedy there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill must be taken in the context of the strange sensitivity apparent in the Government in recent months to protests of various kinds. This seems to be a particularly petulant, grossly over-reactive response to a negligible problem.  In its very severe penal clauses it is symptomatic of the pattern of over-reaction shown by the Government as if they felt particularly insecure.  This Government have been in office for 15 or 20 years, a pretty long time, but are they a Government that are so insecure that they must, at <Col N="108" /> every sign of protest, react as they have done in recent months, in the past 12 or 18 months in particular?</P>
      <P>We had the threat of the appalling proposals in the Criminal Justice Bill; then a couple of months ago we had the threat of internment without trial and now we have the threat of six months in jail and increasing sentences if the protest continues.  Surely a Government that have a real sense of their own security do not have to reach for their jailers in order to deal with problems of this kind?  I am particularly indebted to Deputy Cooney for his contribution as a lawyer.  It seems extraordinary that the Minister cannot accept the very much more civilised proposal put forward by Deputy Cooney that there is a simple remedy for this problem by streamlining the process of law in a civil action.  This heavy-handed threat of jail made in circumstances like these is completely unwarranted especially as it was accompanied by a pretentious and sententious homily from the Minister in his opening speech on the freedoms and rights of individuals and their right to voice grievances.</P>
      <P>As other Deputies have said, this is a completely unwarranted method of dealing with a problem created by the continual failure of the Government to deal with the housing problem and to recognise that there is a very damaging threat to the amenities, the aesthetic values of our larger cities and towns by the property speculator.  There are large areas of the country in which, as Deputy Cooney said, people are living on the banks of fish-filled rivers and lakes and they may not take the fish out of them because they must be held intact for our visitors from France, Germany, Sweden, Britain, or our wealthier fellow Irishmen from Dublin who go down to the west, the south, the midlands or the north of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher, like the Minister, gave us a lecture on the rights of private property.  Everybody knows my views about the rights of the private property but even if we accept their views on the rights of the individual under the Constitution, or the sacro-sanctity of his right to preserve and protect whatever property he may hold, <Col N="109" /> there are others who also have very much more important rights under the Constitution.  These rights have been denied to those people by the Government. The right of the individual to rear his family in conditions of reasonable security in a healthy home and background has been denied by the Government and is being denied by the Government to thousands and thousands of men, women and children.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to minimise the seriousness of this problem and he says that all countries have this problem. All countries have this problem but not to the extent that we have it. What is worse, most of these countries, particularly the European countries, have at least the explanation or the excuse that they suffered such widespread war damage that their rehousing problem is and has been an infinitely greater problem than the problem faced by the Fianna Fáil Government over the years when they had a majority here and responsibility for the provision of houses.  It is to the resolution of that problem that the Fianna Fáil Government should turn their attention, the provision of houses for the unfortunate people now living in grossly overcrowded conditions, when they can get accommodation at all.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister ever paid a visit to Griffith Barracks when the unfortunate people were living there &mdash; a wife and children living in the barracks and the unfortunate husband living wherever he could and being pitched out in the evening at six o'clock.  I do not care if there were only two families in Griffith Barracks; until their needs are answered the Government have betrayed their responsibility to our fellow citizens in our community.  How could that unfortunate family, the husband here and the wife there, how could that kind of a marriage be expected to survive that sort of stress?  How could those unfortunate children be expected to grow up into anything but emotionally disturbed children in such a set of circumstances? Those are not exceptional situations.  Any of us who do constituency work know well of the enormous number of people living in grossly overcrowded conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> The Government have had the authority, they have had the money, they had all the power they needed in order to end that problem and they have not done so and the protest moves are a direct response to that reality in our society.  It is no good locking up these people.  It is no good putting these people in jail.  Were I, a father of a family, homeless with my wife and children, and I was wandering the streets and I saw luxury hotels being built, luxury blocks of flats being built, bank offices for bankers, and new insurance buildings and, probably most offensive insult of all to these unfortunate people, £1,000,000 being spent on a luxury playground at Leopardstown, on a racecourse, while I was denied my right to a home, a house, a roof over my head for myself and my family, then by God I would protest in any way I could and I feel I would be justified in making that protest.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to be completely unaware of the magnitude of their failure in this regard and the insolence of this approach to the solution of that problem &mdash; I wanted bread and you gave me a stone.  The Minister talked about the difficulty of finding finance.  I have made this point many times in this House: every single one of you there at different times has said &ldquo;we cannot build schools, we have not enough money to build universities, we cannot give the old any more, we cannot give better scholarships, we cannot provide better health services and now we cannot provide houses, or communications, or whatever it is, because we have not got the money.&rdquo; Why have you not got the money? Do you not tell us time and time again that the social and economic systems in which you believe are the correct social and economic systems and that they are systems which will bring prosperity to our country and give us the money to do all these things?  Why do you continue to keep faith in these social and economic systems?  Why can the Minister not take his own advice when he says that &ldquo;human progress can be measured by the extent of man's questioning of himself and his environment and his willingness to adopt new concepts when the old ones <Col N="111" /> have proved inadequate or unsuitable.&rdquo; Why can he not take his own advice and accept that the economic attitude followed by the Government over the years has failed completely to provide the wealth in the amount needed to solve all these problems?</P>
    <P>It is not the function of capital, private enterprise capital, to provide the wealth to do this kind of thing for the average masses of the people. That, of course, is why I am a socialist. The right to protest, Deputy Gallagher will concede, as Deputy Cooney pointed out, in effect as long as it is not effective protest.  Quite clearly, the right to protest has a very honourable record in our history from the GPO to the Four Courts and right through.  When we wanted to protest against injustice, and particularly the injustice of the landlord, or the wealthy few in our society, we have found in the past occupation and squatting to be a particularly effective method of publicising a grievance, publicising a grievance so that something is, in fact, done about it.</P>
    <P>The astonishing thing is that this Bill has been introduced at all.  The Minister says it so happens that just at the moment we are in a period of relative quite so far as the particular problem with which the Bill is designed to deal is concerned.  Does he think that this is simply a coincidence?  Why is there a period of relative quiet?  If there is a period of quiet, why try to rush this piece of repressive legislation through the House?  Surely everything is there to show that the reason there is a period of quiet is that the existing system of civil law &mdash; inefficient as it is, as Deputy Cooney has pointed out&mdash;is still sufficiently efficient to deal adequately with what is a completely negligible problem?  Nobody is squatting anywhere at the present time and it appears nobody can make any sign of dissent whatever against the present Fianna Fáil Government without the Minister for Justice reaching for his handcuffs.</P>
    <P>We know it is possible to so modernise the existing civil law that this matter can be dealt with without any great difficulty.  The problem is simply <Col N="112" /> the right of ejectment.  Under civil law the aggrieved person if he wants can get an ejectment order.  Deputy Gallagher sought to create the impression that the houses in Pembroke Street, in Hume Street or in Mountjoy Square &mdash; the houses in which people usually squat&mdash;are owned by small-holders. The absolute absurdity of that proposition is so self-evident that it does not require any emphasis whatever. Deputy Gallagher, understandably, is speaking for the big property owners.  All his sympathy is with them, to preserve their rights, but he showed little or no concern for the rights of the unfortunate individual who chooses to squat.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have opposed squatting for a completely different reason &mdash; the type of squatting that is being carried out &mdash; because I have always thought of the whole terrifying experience which must ensue for the unfortunate wife. I am all for men squatting; if they wish to squat good luck to them, but I have felt that the women and children in particular should not be in the front line of this struggle against landlordism, the struggle against the speculative builder and against the incompetence of the Fianna Fáil Government which leaves these unfortunate people no other choice.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that the unfortunate women who have to squat in houses do not do so for the adventure but simply because they have no other place to go.  Anyone would think when listening to the Minister and to Deputy Gallagher that it was a sort of summer Sunday picnic to squat. In fact, they cut off the lights, they cut off the water supply, usually there are no sanitary arrangements and the unfortunate lady cannot leave the house.  Her husband goes out to work but she cannot leave to do shopping because she is afraid when she returns the house will be occupied by the people who are taking it over.  The family live in continual terror.  That is correct; I am not exaggerating, particularly where the children are concerned. There is the battering on the door, the smashing of the windows and then the forcible ejectment which we saw used in Hume Street and Pembroke Street.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> It is like these people who lecture the unfortunate man who must go on strike, as if it were fun being on strike pay and walking up and down in all weathers.  Squatting is uncomfortable, unpleasent, frequently dangerous and apparently essential for some people. It is a tragic commentary on the failure of the Government that it should be essential for somebody to squat in a disused tenement.</P>
    <P>The Minister denies the principle of guilt by association.  Of course, there is this element of guilt by association. Both Deputy FitzGerald and myself would have done our six months in jail for the Hume Street affair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because we got up. I certainly would not have repudiated the activity at that time.  In the event the squatters and those of us who supported them were accepted as having taken the correct line.  I am not primarily concerned for the preservation movement&mdash;I am more concerned for the homeless movement &mdash; but for what it is worth would Hume Street have been preserved were it not for the action of the squatters and those who supported them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole tenor of this Bill is completely fascist.  The hand that drafted this is the hand that drafted the iniquitous provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill, the gradual eating-away of our fundamental freedoms on one pretence or another. There is arrogant insolence in the Minister's introductory statement: &ldquo;If the foundations of democracy are liberty and order, let us not forget that without order there can be no liberty&rdquo;. That is taken verbatim from the works of the late Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Salazar.  All of these people had order but how much liberty did they have? If you want that order, abolish this place and run it as a dictatorship. While telling us he is preserving our liberty the Minister tells us that if we are charged with an offence we have to prove ourselves innocent.  In effect, that is what he is doing.  This is a complete reversal of the elementary process of law, of the responsibility of the State to prove guilt and to regard <Col N="114" /> the individual as innocent until he has been proved to be guilty.</P>
    <P>It is an absurd proposition, a conflict of ideas, first of all, that the individual must dissociate himself from the contents of a statement if a statement is made on behalf of a group supporting a particular action; show that the statement was made without his knowledge, that the statement was made without his consent.  Why should a citizen of the State be put to the trouble of dissociating himself from a statement made or proving that a statement was made without his consent or that a statement was made without his knowledge?  Surely the onus is on the State to prove all of these things rather than the other way around. That is section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 5 says:</P>
    <P>...it shall not be necessary for the prosecution to prove ownership of the land or vehicle.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the unfortunate defendant to exculpate himself, to extricate himself from a dilemma created for him by this kind of legislation. Then there is the iniquitous proposal that a garda has the right to arrest a person without a warrant.  The Minister tries to cover himself by saying that the four conditions in subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 9 must all be honoured before the garda can act.  None of these conditions are serious safeguards because they all represent the opinion of an individual: &ldquo;Reasonable cause for suspecting&rdquo;, &ldquo;the owner of the land reasonably believes&rdquo;.  Who is to decide he is unreasonable? In this House in recent months there have been many people who reasonably believed various things about their colleagues and who were later shown to have been most unreasonable in their beliefs when this matter came before judge and jury in the courts.  Subsection (c) says:</P>
    <P>...the member proposing to make the arrest reasonably believes that the arrest is necessary...</P>
    <P>This is all so much dishonest window dressing: &ldquo;and it is not reasonably practical to apply for a warrant&rdquo;. There is no difficulty there at all.  If a garda decides he wants to arrest somebody <Col N="115" /> all he has to say is: &ldquo;I have fulfilled all of the four conditions&rdquo; because it is merely a matter of arrest on suspicion.  There is no attempt to define subsection (b) which says:</P>
    <P>...the lawful right of the owner in relation thereto, or serious inconvenience to the public or a section thereof...</P>
    <P>What is &ldquo;a section thereof&rdquo;?  Two people are a section thereof, the garda and the man who is making the complaint, two people plus the garda.  This is a piece of police state legislation.  As Deputy Cooney pointed out, it is completely unnecessary.  It is inexplicable to us in the Labour Party that it should have been introduced, particularly since it is known that relatively minor improvements in the existing civil law procedures could provide for the power of ejectment, which is the main power sought in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate people, the husband and wife and children, who take shelter will be forgiven apparently, according to the Minister's unctuous opening statement, if they get off the premises. How very accommodating of the State to forgive them if they leave a derelict tenement house, outhouse or stable in order that Deputy Gallagher's property owning friends can get back their property, tear it down, put up in its place an insurance block, an office block, a luxury hotel or luxury flats and make a small fortune out of the results? If the man and his wife and children leave quietly, showing due humility and penitence for the crime they have committed, seeking shelter for themselves from the streets and the weather, they are forgiven by the benevolent State under Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>This is another manifestation of the crude, inept solutions provided by Fianna Fáil for their failure to deal with important fundamental issues in our society, the most fundamental of all, the right of the individual to provide a home for his family.  It is a thoroughly shameful piece of legislation. It will be opposed by the Labour Party and if there were any shame in the Fianna Fáil Party it would also be opposed by them.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should like to comment on a number of matters which have been raised, so that my views would be fully known. I have no desire to assist in any way the cad called a landlord who, as Deputy Dr. Browne indicated, fuses the lights, cuts off the water supply, terrorises the tenants, locks out the tenants, intimidates the tenants, in order to get more and more rent. There is this type of individual who looks for the last drop of blood from the tenants.  I have no desire to interfere with any measure that would be applied to this man and I hope the Minister will in due course pay the same attention to this particular type of individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to protect speculators, people who are soaking the public or holding up local authority building as a result of seeking more and more money but I certainly have great sympathy for the people on the Dublin Corporation waiting list.  I am mainly concerned about people who are unable to help themselves, people such as those on that waiting list.  I have sympathy for those people.  Housing is a separate matter and one we can discuss in this House at any time.  We can show that we have a creditable record on this score.  More houses are needed.  I hope more houses will be built.  I am sure they will until such time as the demand is met.  There are many factors which brought about the greater demand for better and more accommodation but this is another day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to deal with the situation now before the House I just want to say that we have people who shout loudly about rights but not a word about responsibility.  It would be a sad day for us if we in this House were to yield to organised mob law or organised hi-jackers, some of them directed from outside the State to take possession of accommodation and so deprive the people on the Dublin Corporation waiting list and the waiting lists of other local authorities of homes. Organised groups have endeavoured <Col N="117" /> to take over and are now exerting pressure on certain individuals in this House, and individuals are yielding to pressure, and it will be seen, before this Bill finally goes through the House, who the people are who will yield to the pressure of the organised mob endeavouring to intimidate responsible people.</P>
    <P>The law-abiding citizen has no need to worry if he does not break the law and the vast majority of people in this city are law-abiding citizens.  There is but a small group who are prepared to occupy premises and houses that should be going to people in dire need of housing accommodation.  The Minister has mentioned fish-ins but I want to refer to the kick-ins that have taken place when mobs patrolled the housing estates of this city and when they saw a vacant house they would ask: &ldquo;Will we kick in this door?&rdquo;  The kick-in was followed by sleep-ins and by fish-ins and a whole lot of other types of ins in these houses.  Many people in my constituency, in Ballyfermot and Crumlin, newly-weds and other people on the waiting list, were deprived of accommodation because houses were occupied for prolonged periods by squatters and these people have now lost their rightful place on the waiting list because of the build-up that came during that period.  These people are now forced to live in overcrowded conditions because of this build-up that has occurred as a result of the mob law and the pressure groups that forced this type of organised squatting.</P>
    <P>We saw, not so long ago, an organised group trying to prevent the demolition of stables in Sarah Place. If one takes the bus to Sarah Place now he can see the wonderful flats that have been built there by the corporation and the happy homes that are there at present.  These people who tried to prevent the demolition are the very same people who dished out lists of pending vacancies and actual vacancies and directed people from public houses and elsewhere to where they could break in and squat.  They have no regard for the people on the waiting list who have taken their places over the years.  These are the people <Col N="118" /> about whom I am concerned and if this Bill will remedy the situation and ensure that people on the waiting list, some of whom have waited for years, will get accommodation and that no group of individuals, however powerful, whether they are directed from outside or inside, will have any place in this society and that the law will be able to deal with them swiftly and adequately&mdash;if this Bill will ensure that, it has my full support.</P>
    <P>We all know the type of thing that occurred during the squatting period. In one case a house was occupied during a wake.  The squatters moved in during the wake and did not move out after the corpse.  On another occasion the squatters moved in when an old woman was in hospital and threw out her furniture.  The guards came but were powerless to deal with the situation. This is no laughing matter.  This can be verified if any Deputy wants to verify it.  This is no sob story.  This actually happened.  On other occasions people have been afraid to take accommodation when squatters were evicted because of the pressure that built up in flats by the relatives and other people connected with the person evicted.  They intimidated people and deprived them of their rightful place on the waiting list.  We cannot support outside agitators or groups who are endeavouring to ensure that people are deprived of a home.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the cost.  Doors have been kicked in and the whole interior of flats and houses has been rooted out and anything of value sold.  The filth left behind in some of these places was appalling. The ratepayers and taxpayers must pay for this destruction.  Are we to protect the type of individual who will break in and break up the accommodation of the local authority?  Are we to ensure that legislation will not be implemented to deal with this particular type of individual?  If this legislation is not tough enough then it should be tough enough to deal with that type of person who will damage public property which you and I and the corporation tenants and taxpayers and ratepayers of this city must pay for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> We know these people are very highly organised.  They extracted the lists of people who were lucky enough to draw houses in the local authority draws and paid visits to the houses and got information on when they would be leaving their accommodation to take up their new residence.  They passed this on, sometimes at a price, to people who paid this group of agitators key money in order to get accommodation.  Key money changed hands on many occasions. These people organised the unfortunate people and assured them of support if and when the corporation attempted to evict them.  This is the sort of situation that must be dealt with effectively, efficiently and as quickly as possible.  In the past a man in this city named Dennehy went to prison because he could not get accommodation from the corporation and he squatted but when he was offered accommodation by the corporation Mr. Dennehy did not accept it.  This is the type of individual who was a front and set up by outside interests to develop a situation in this country, which they successfully did to a degree.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are acquainted with the local authority here in Dublin city are well aware of the problems that presented themselves to Dublin Corporation. I fear, however, that the officials of Dublin Corporation or the personnel in dealing with the squatting situation at that time were weak-kneed in their approach and possibly allowed the situation to develop to such a degree that it became uncontrollable.  I hope that situation will never arise again.  I am quite sure that this type of legislation will ensure that it will not happen again and that weak-kneed administrations will not be called upon to deal with a situation that can be dealt with adequately by the law.</P>
    <P>If it is the desire of the Opposition to support this type of group, or the types of individuals we have seen and who were common in this city for many months in the not too distant past, and if it is the desire of the Opposition to ensure that legislation of this type is impeded so that these people can have <Col N="120" /> a free run any time they so desire, another day will come when the citizens of this city will have their say and I am quite sure that they will deal with the Opposition adequately.</P>
    <P>I would agree with some of the sentiments expressed by all speakers here tonight.  I said I was mainly concerned about the local authority situation and about the people who had a rightful place on the waiting list and who waited for a considerable period for accommodation and were then deprived of it by the mobs who roamed this city, as I said before, some of them directed by outside sources and some of them financed by outside sources. I do not want to be associated in any way with the landlord I mentioned earlier who puts the squeeze on in order to extract the last copper from the unfortunate tenant.  I hope the Minister will turn his attention to this individual who has caused so much mental torture to so many people in this city by putting the screws on and twisting them tighter and tighter in order to extract the last copper.  I am not standing up here to defend this man and neither am I defending the speculators who want to extract the last copper from the people in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to make it clear that the remarks I propose to make on this Bill represent my own viewpoint.  I understand that Deputy Fitzpatrick when speaking earlier expressed serious criticisms of many clauses in this Bill and suggested that many amendments would be required. My own position is that I think the Bill is unsuitable and unacceptable as a whole.  In that respect my position perhaps differs in degree, at any rate, from his.</P>
      <P>Reading through the Minister's speech, as I did not have the opportunity of hearing it, being on another body in this House at that time, I am struck by the number of things in it which are questionable or dubious as regards their truth or accuracy and in the latter part of it by the number of clichés packed into a relatively small amount of space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset he started off by saying <Col N="121" />&mdash; and this is a cliché and also something which is simply not true:</P>
    <P>In a democracy such as ours, where there are no permanent political minorities, there are adequate democratic processes not only for ventilating dissatisfaction with the existing order of things but also for resolving grievances and differences of opinion.  Changes in law and policy can be, and are, secured by these processes.</P>
    <P>That, I am afraid, is not entirely true because this Government, by an action they took some time ago, deprived the people of this city of their rights in a way that prejudiced their rights permanently, not temporarily.  The people of this city had a corporation and that corporation had the power which it exercised in the Mountpleasant Square case to overturn a decision of the Minister's, itself overturning a decision of the corporation.  By the abolition of the corporation that power disappeared and the democratic rights of the people of Dublin were removed.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that there is no problem and that changes in law and policy can be, and are, secured by democratic processes.  They are, no doubt, in time but if we had waited for the democratic processes this Government destroyed to be reintroduced, the houses in Hume Street would have gone and been replaced by development totally unsuitable for this city and totally against the wishes of the people of this city.  For a government who have taken away from us in this city these democratic processes to have the nerve to say something like that in a Ministerial speech leads me, on reading it, to feel that the rest of it is unlikely to be worthy of being taken very seriously.</P>
    <P>There are the usual clichés then that this development by agitation &ldquo;strikes at the very roots of our society&rdquo;.  What is really striking at the roots of our society is not agitators and demonstrations &mdash; even though many of these are for causes that I personally do not support or accept, and many of them adopt tactics which I would not support or accept &mdash; but the Fianna Fáil Party and the way they have debased our processes of law and democracy in the <Col N="122" /> interests of big business and in the interests of property developers.</P>
    <P>This Bill which we are asked to take in this House tonight &mdash; why is it here? It is introduced to protect the rights of developers and to make criminals out of people who oppose developers demolishing property.  I am not suggesting for a moment &mdash; and I will come back to this again in a few minutes &mdash; that developers have not got rights and that these rights must not be protected by the law.  They are protected by the law and if that law is defective and a property developer who has a legitimate right to develop his property is unable to do so and is frustrated, then the law must be changed.  If the civil processes which he has a right to use for this purpose are clogged up in some way, they should be reformed and I would support any such reform.  I do not, however, support a proposal that people who oppose measures of this kind, introduced with a view to destroying parts of our city and using the deficiency in our democratic processes created by Fianna Fáil, should be made criminals.</P>
    <P>Further on the Minister told us:</P>
    <P>The Bill has been framed on the basis that the sanction of the criminal law should not be invoked as a substitute for civil action against trespass or to protect property rights or remedy civil wrongs where the circumstances are such that there is no threat to the community and no general public interest is involved.</P>
    <P>An unexceptional sentiment and, indeed, I would take that as the text for my speech because I stand on that principle and I am opposing this Bill. I am somewhat puzzled, however, as to how a Minister introducing the Bill could introduce that sentiment into it as it is precisely this principle that the Bill offends against.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Bill will not, therefore, apply to incidents that arise in the course of private disputes between persons having different estates or interests in the same land... These are matters to be regulated only by existing civil property law.</P>
    <P>I think he ought to expand on that. If this is, in fact, the case then the Bill <Col N="123" /> is singularly badly drafted.  I am not clear whether when he says that the Bill will not, therefore, apply to these incidents he means that he will not apply it and that he is offering us some guarantee that it will not be applied in certain cases or whether he is claiming that the wording of the Bill is such as to exclude the operation of the Bill in those cases. If it is the latter claim he is making, I should like to hear him on it because this is not evident to me on the face of the Bill, nor is it evident to the legal advisers who have looked at this Bill and on whose legal advice I am proceeding on this particular point.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>When a person commits an offence of forcible entry or forcible occupation, it will, in the overwhelming majority of cases, be in circumstances where he has no colour of right to the property entered or occupied.</P>
    <P>He does not explain how he comes to that conclusion.  Forcible occupation means locking your door to stop somebody trying to get in who you think has no right to get in.  I do not know how the Minister measures up the number of such cases as against the number of other cases where the person concerned has no colour of right.  Then he goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Consequently, it would in the ordinary way be unreasonable to the point of absurdity to require the prosecution to go through the tedious and possibly costly process of proving ownership that is not being challenged.</P>
    <P>He has no qualms about making the occupier of the property go through this process.  But a man, who has a claim of right, who is over-holding as a tenant, perhaps, who has sent in his rent and believes he has a right to be there and is expelled forcibly and violently by his landlord with or without the help of the police force mobilised for that purpose, has to prove his property right against the man in the stronger position, the landlord.  It is unreasonable to put the weaker man in the position of having to prove his <Col N="124" /> rights and put the stronger man into the position where the onus of proof is shifted away from him.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech the Minister managed to gather together &mdash; I do not blame him; he may not be responsible for the wording; it may be his advisers &mdash; a wonderful collection of clichés.  He says, &ldquo;The only city without a housing problem is a city that is a dead city or at least dying.&rdquo;  How often has that cliché been trotted out before?  He goes on to say: &ldquo;The people who are most vociferous in their protests are rarely those in most urgent need.&rdquo;  Sometimes that is less eloquently expressed, but it is another well-known cliché.  He further states that the Government and the Oireachtas &ldquo;has the duty to protect the rights and freedom of all citizens&mdash; not just the most noisy elements.&rdquo; Later on he says, &ldquo;Protest and pressure for change are not in themselves bad.&rdquo;  This is, I admit, a major concession for a Fianna Fáil Government. Perhaps we should congratulate them on it.  He goes on to say that &ldquo;although many of us disagree profoundly with the ideas of some who are at present seeking to change the existing order of things and although we may, with justification, suspect their motives, we can and must respect, and if necessary defend, their right to propound their ideas and to voice their dissatisfaction, provided that they for their part understand that the majority, too, have rights.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am getting a little tired of hearing about the rights of the majority.  This country may not have, in the terms that Northern Ireland have, permanent minorities and groups which are segregated by race, colour or religion and are permanently separated from the community and made a minority.  But there are many minorities in this country and I do not see any great concern on the part of this Government to protect their rights.  I see a continual process of undermining their rights.  I am not sure that the majority, whether it be the Fianna Fáil majority in this Dáil or any other majority in this country, need their rights protected, because their rights are well protected. The problem we face is the inadequate protection of the rights of the minority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> So much for the Minister's speech. Let me come now to the Bill itself.  I regard the Bill as wrong in principle and on a number of grounds, grounds which I regard as cogent to the point of being compelling.  First of all, what is the origin of this Bill?  What is the problem it purports to solve?  Is it the problem of squatting in corporation property?  No, because in this House last July we passed a Bill which dealt with that problem.  I am not aware that the provisions of that measure have proved in any way to be inadequate.  I regard them as dubious in a number of respects for reasons I stated at the time we were debating it here.  Neither the Government, the corporation nor the county councils need any further powers.  This Bill is not designed to help them get back possession of property which has fallen into the hands of squatters; they have that provision in the Bill we passed last July.</P>
    <P>Is it then a problem of people's houses being occupied by squatters pushing their way in, taking over rooms and squeezing people out of their houses?  I have not heard of such a case and if any such cases have occurred they have received singularly little publicity in a country where a demonstration of any kind usually receives a great deal of publicity.  Is this the danger?  Where is it threatened?  Where has it happened? The Bill is not designed to deal with that.  What problem does this Bill deal with which is not dealt with adequately by provisions in the existing law?</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to deal with only one form of squatting which has taken place by certain groups with whose activities I have little sympathy, who have occupied various unoccupied buildings for, in some cases, political purposes.  In one instance where the democratic process broke down it seemed to me to be justified.  I am not prepared to condemn in unmeasured terms other cases without knowing more about them.  Certainly, I would distinguish between the fairly innocent squatter, the individual, who, forced by circumstances to find a home, does so in an empty unused building and political agitators who move in to cash in on the process. <Col N="126" /> That is the problem this Bill is designed to tackle.</P>
    <P>It is designed to deal with a situation where the property developer buys up a number of houses but it takes some time to do so; it may take some years. When he gets hold of them he boards them up and keeps out anybody who might make a home there for fear they might be awkward tenants which is something the law should deal with. A useful reform of the law would be one that would ensure, where a developer is in that position and allows a tenant into an empty house for a period, that when the area is ready for demolition he can speedily and quickly ensure the building is vacated.  Such a reform would release a great deal of property.  Wherever one goes in the city one finds buildings boarded up in this way waiting some day to be demolished when the property developer gets hold of another property nearby. I understand and sympathise with the property developer's dilemma.  I am not too critical of him for not letting people in because he is afraid he will never get them out.  Anything that could be done to help with that particular problem and enable these properties to be used during that period would be a useful reform.  The Bill does not attempt to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>This is the only problem of which I am aware that this Bill is designed to deal with except the reference the Minister made in his opening speech to fish-ins, but as far as buildings are concerned this is the only problem in question.  It seems to me, but I am open to correction on this because I have not sought legal advice on this particular point, that the fish-ins as a form of trespass could be dealt with under the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1851 which is the only parliamentary Act of these islands ever passed which made trespass a criminal offence.  That would provide a remedy, so this Bill is not required for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The only problem this Bill can deal with, which is not dealt with by the law already, is that of the developer and his empty houses.  Anybody who tries to defend this Bill on the basis that people must be prevented from walking into &ldquo;my house and taking it over&rdquo;<Col N="127" /> is using an emotive argument that has no basis in fact because these things have not happened.  To introduce Bills into this House in case somebody some time might do such a thing when we have a queue of legislation several years long would be a singularly frivolous exercise for an incompetent Government.</P>
    <P>The denouement of the Hume Street case occurred when the property developer, not apparently, in the absence of this Bill, being able to employ Garda Síochána for his purposes, employed instead a private police force for this purpose, a private police force whose actions led to the prosecution and the conviction for assault of the head of that police force.  I would have thought in any country concerned with the preservation of law and order, as we should be concerned with the preservation of law and order, that the first response of a Minister for Justice faced with that situation would not be to introduce legislation to protect and bolster up the kind of people who put in that kind of private police force, but to introduce legislation to control private police forces. Just as the Government have, month after month, been tolerant of private armies, they are not only tolerant of private police forces but are prepared to back up with legislation people who employ them in this manner.</P>
    <P>May I remind the Minister of what happened on that occasion?  The head of the largest private security force in this country was successfully prosecuted for assault on a girl student by striking her from behind in the small of the back and on that occasion the evidence given by an employee of that firm was that in addition to 15 or 20 demolition workers, who were not employed to demolish the house that day but to demolish the occupiers, he led 25 to 30 other men to the scene to eject the two men students and the two girls who were there.  These 25 to 30 additional men were not regular employees of K Security; they were unemployed men hired for the purpose without the benefit of training or discipline. A private police force hired people off the street and brought them at 5 o'clock on a Sunday morning <Col N="128" /> to beat up young people making a protest in what most people would accept was a good cause.  The reaction of the Minister for Justice was not to control the action of that private police force found guilty of assault&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This man was allowed to take people from the side of the street and bring them in as members of his private security force and let them attack people and the Minister's reaction is not to regulate private police forces, not to lay down a code of conduct for them and make them subject to inspection by the ordinary police who will ensure that they are people who have no criminal record.  No, that is not his concern; but he brings in a Bill to defend the right of the property owner who acts in that way.  I do not think a Minister who takes that course of action in those circumstances and fails to deal with the menace of the private police force, uncontrolled, has any right to stand up here and talk about serving law and order.</P>
      <P>This legislation is repressive in its origins.  It is repressive in the principle that lies behind it and in all its details. It makes trespass in a building a criminal offence for the first time.  The only form of trespass which is a criminal offence is trespass on land under the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1851, an Act introduced to deal with land agitation here and it is our own Irish Government that for the first time extend this principle to making trespass in a building a criminal offence. It might be more to the point if those who fought and won the battle for the land were vindicated now by the removal of this particularly iniquitous provision from the Summary Jurisdiction Act instead of extending it.  But the Minister has no thought of that. If the Minister had been here in the 1880s we know what side he would have been on.  He would not have been on the side of the agitators.  He would have been on the side of the landlords and the landlords would have been vindicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as making trespass in building a criminal offence for the first time, this Bill makes it a criminal offence for a man who thinks he has a claim of right against a landlord and pursues it. For example, a man who is a tenant of a house sends, at the end of his letting, further rent to his landlord and the landlord accepts it.  In certain circumstances the acceptance of that rent <Col N="130" /> could create a yearly tenancy and the man could genuinely claim that the acceptance of the rent has created such a tenancy and he could defend his right, the right he believes to exist, by locking the door against the landlord and his hired thugs.  For six centuries the law in Ireland has protected that man.  What the Minister now proposes to do is to make such a man a criminal because, if he cannot prove his claim in court, a claim he genuinely believes he has, then, without his realising it, he becomes a criminal to be sent to jail, although all he did was defend his occupation of his own property, acting in pursuance of the principle that the law of this country has protected for six centuries, the law that the occupier must be protected against the landlord who may proceed only by way of the courts.</P>
    <P>The same thing could happen in the case of a farmer who takes conacre. He might lock the gate against the owner.  He too will go to jail under this repressive legislation.  So will the businessman if he locks the door against his landlord and cannot prove his claim in court.  This is a complete reversion of six centuries of Anglo-Irish jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>Again, this Bill has a provision whereby any member of an association on behalf of which a statement is issued supporting a demonstration, such as the Hume Street demonstration, will be guilty of an offence unless he repudiates his colleagues. People will be forced to stand up and say, to save their skins: &ldquo;Oh, we did not agree with our friends in the organisation which has put out a statement in support of the action&rdquo;.  Unless people are prepared to take the dishonourable course of repudiating their colleagues they, too, will be sent to jail in what the Minister says is not guilt by association.</P>
    <P>In this repressive legislation there is a unique provision.  When the invaders have wreaked their vengeance on the people and the property itself, as happened in a number of cases, the damage they do will be charged to the occupier even if that occupier has a claim of right and had the right to remain on the property.  Even in those <Col N="131" /> circumstances the damage is charged to the innocent occupier who thought he had a right to be there.  I thought that kind of repressive legislation went out a century or so ago.</P>
    <P>For the first time this Bill gives the district court the primary right of determining property rights, not the final right because, if the occupier thinks he has a tenancy and if he has the money to appeal to a higher court, he may be able to establish his position, after he has been turned out on to the streets. What this Bill does is to ensure that property rights will, for the first time, be determined in the first instance in the district court and the man who loses the case there will be unable to prove his right to occupy the property unless he can find the money to appeal; his rights disappear at the hands of a stronger landlord.  This is a new principle in Irish law.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is power to arrest without warrant.  This is a power which should not be given in this case.  I know of no Bill, except the Criminal Justice Bill of unhappy memory, that contains such a unique list of repressive provisions designed to wreak vengeance on anyone who stands in the way of a man who may be an unscrupulous person, as some of these people are as we have seen from their behaviour.</P>
    <P>Some people may say some Bill is necessary.  Perhaps this Bill is too repressive. Perhaps it could be watered down by amendments, but something needs to be done.  Just what needs to be done?  What has happened in the sister country, as it is sometimes called, Great Britain?  They too had their problems.  There was Piccadilly a year or two ago.  Even the present Tory Government have not introduced this kind of repressive legislation.  They found a simple solution.  They changed the Rules of Court to enable an injunction to be taken against any named people and in that way they resolved this problem within the existing civil code.  Such a provision here would need to be reinforced by measures to speed up the process, to simplify it and reduce its cost.  These are simple administrative measures that could be <Col N="132" /> taken quite easily.  That is all that is required to ensure that any person whose property is wrongly occupied can recover possession, simply, expeditiously and cheaply.  This is good enough for the Tory Government in Britain but not good enough for the repressive Fianna Fáil Government here.  They must have their pound of flesh, guilt by association, arrest without warrant, charging the damage done to the invaders, making a criminal out of a man who may have a private claim in right and a perfectly good reason for believing he has a right to be there.</P>
    <P>This Bill is unnecessary because the problem, such as it is &mdash; and it is a very limited one &mdash; can be easily solved by the simple reform introduced last April in Britain by the Lord Chancellor changing the Rules of Court.  Why is that not good enough here?  Is there some massive threat here that does not exist in Britain?  Anybody who knows anything about the situation knows that the problems of squatting in Britain are ten times greater than here and if they, with a Government which is by no means a liberal one, found it possible to deal with that by the simple expedient of changing the Rules of Court, why in this country is it necessary to cope with it by introducing a measure of this repressive kind?</P>
    <P>This Bill reverses six centuries of legislation designed to protect the occupier.  The law on this subject goes back a long way and for good reason because in the fourteenth century there were men very similar to some of the people today on whose behalf this Bill is being introduced.  There were men who were impatient of the law and legal processes.  Perhaps they had more reason to be because, perhaps, it was more difficult to get the law reformed in those days.  Landlords who wanted to get their tenants out and were not prepared to go to court because, perhaps, the delay would be too long, forcibly evicted their tenants and in those feudal times at the end of the fourteenth century the Government was much more liberal than the Government we have today.  That Government intervened to introduce the Forcible Entries Act to protect the occupier <Col N="133" /> against forcible eviction and if forcibly evicted, even by his landlord who had absolute right to the property, that landlord could be fined or sent to jail because it was vitally important that any man in occupation of property should have his right protected except against due legal process and that no landlord or baron, however powerful or developer however rich, should have the right to put him out by force using his private army, because there were private security forces in those days also.</P>
    <P>The law in Britain at that time and later in Ireland, as I shall show, was changed in order to protect the occupier against that kind of eviction, in order to preserve the peace, because it was found &mdash; as it will be found if this Bill goes through &mdash; that by leaving in those circumstances the right to forcibly expel occupiers to landlords, the landlords took the law into their own hands and violence spread through the country.  Law and order broke down and to preserve law and order and the rights of occupiers and to preserve the legal system and force landlords to use it and not use violence, the Forcible Entries Act was introduced.  It is not entirely clear to me whether under the law of that time that Act operated in this country or not.  There may be arguments about that, but it is not arguable that in 1402 an Irish statute or Forcible Entries Act was enacted.  This statute is unique because it differs from the British Act in a vital respect which shows what extra concern there was in this country for the right of the occupier, even going beyond the British law in the matter.  The British law ended with a clause dealing with some ecclesiastical matters.  Perhaps ecclesiastical benefices were not such a problem in Ireland in those days as they were in Britain.  In the Irish Act, that is omitted and in its place there is a phrase which is important and which means that the law in Ireland at this time &mdash; because, as far as I know, this Act of 1402 is still in force: I should be interested to hear the Minister if he will contend that it is not&mdash; ensures that not alone will a landlord who forcibly occupies the property of <Col N="134" /> his tenants be sent to jail or fined but under the Irish legislation and not under the British legislation, the tenant has the right to be reinstated until the landlord goes back to the courts and takes legal action.</P>
    <P>In the original Act it is stated here in the legal language of the time, which, of course, was French &mdash; I shall give the English translation in case my Old French pronunciation is dubious as well as my modern French pronunciation:</P>
    <P>In case any such entry has been made by force as aforesaid that it be held for naught, saving at another time to the party his entry peaceably in due form if he have right.</P>
    <P>That was the liberal legislation of 1402 in this country under which, not alone could a landlord be punished for forcing his way into the property of his tenant even if he had the right to that property, but the tenant had the right to go into that property again and remain there until the law took its course.  In those days they believed in law and order, not in setting aside the law and giving to violent men the right to take over property and expel occupiers who may have a perfect right to be there or believe they have such a right.  In the British Act that is not present.  The law in Britain differs from that in Ireland in that respect as was held in the <i>Stoke-Pogis</i> case in 1921 where the steward of a golf course was ejected by the club members.  After they had a fairly inebriated evening they went together to his house and threw him out because he had a few drinks too many.  They were subject to punishment for their action but he had no right to get back into the property.  There was no clause in the English legislation such as there is in the Irish legislation.</P>
    <P>The Irish law for almost six centuries now has defended the right of the occupier and that is in the Irish tradition because we have always been concerned with the right of tenants against landlords until this Government came into power and now it is the right of the landlord and to hell with the tenant. Even the British regime in this country 90 years ago did not attempt to change the law as it is now being <Col N="135" /> changed.  Never in our history was an attempt made to support landlords against tenants in this way, not even in the most extreme period of British oppression.  We had to wait for Fianna Fáil to do it.</P>
    <P>We should be proud in this country that the law has been that much more liberal.  Our Act of 1402 is one of the most enlightened pieces of legislation protecting the rights of the occupier and restoring them if they are forcibly denied by the landlord even if, as may well be shown when the landlord takes his case to the courts, the tenant is proved to be wrong.  It is vital that the question of whether the tenant is right or wrong in his occupation should be determined by the courts peaceably and in due form as the 1402 Act says and not by any landlord forcing his way in with the help of a private police force or the Garda Síochána whom he can now summon to his support under this despicable Bill.</P>
    <P>Those in this House who are concerned with the rights of individuals and with law and order have no alternative but to oppose this Bill.  That is my personal view: others may not share it.  They may see it in a simpler light but I have no doubt as to where I must stand in this matter.  I cannot accept legislation at this stage which reverses six centuries of the tradition of protecting the occupiers, which would threaten the rights of the occupier.  No man will know from now on if he does not pay his rent up to date when the private police force or the Garda Síochána may come to put him out and he would be forced in the courts to argue the case as to whether the rent had to be paid then, whether he was on time or whether the rent he did send in was sufficient to give him the tenancy and forced, if defeated in the district court at short notice on that, to take an expensive case to a higher court and in the meantime denied the right to possession of his home.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to conceive of any Government in their senses bringing in legislation like this.  However, they <Col N="136" /> have done so and we can only say why we oppose it.  I know that in taking a stand on this Bill I shall be accused by somebody of encouraging squatting, a good old corny accusation to make.  I have spoken long ago in this House on this subject to make my position clear.  I certainly do not want to encourage squatting in any shape or form.  It creates more problems than it solves and creates grave injustices in many cases.  Squatting in corporation dwellings can create very great injustices if those who squat are not, as they often are not, at the top of the queue.  We must distinguish here between a social problem created by the neglect of housing by this Government, a social problem which needs to be tackled and for which a solution is necessary, and repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>I think I mentioned before, but if I did not it is no harm to mention now, the case of a man who is squatting in corporation property at the moment. He is a decent man and does not like being there and he is doing his best to find private accommodation, even beyond his means.  The reason he is there is one which I have to respect in his case, for him as an individual.  I may say, and say to him, that he has no right to be there, that he ought to leave, but I am not prepared to condemn him.  This man was living in a flat on the other side of the city, with his wife, two children, his parents-in-law and brothers and sisters, to a number which I cannot recall offhand, in conditions of utter congestion and overcrowding. His father-in-law was removed to Blanchardstown and died of TB.  The corporation said that there was no hope of housing him and he had the choice either of staying in that place watching, one after the other, as happened, two of his in-laws going down with TB also and waiting for it to strike at his children, or else squatting because he could not get any private accommodation at that time at a rent which he could conceivably afford and so he squatted.</P>
    <P>Is there anybody in this House who faced with that threat to the health of their children, and in that situation, would have remained on in those conditions&mdash;the father-in-law dead from TB, a brother-in-law and a sister-in-law <Col N="137" /> ill with TB?  Which of us would have remained on there in those circumstances and not moved out?  We must distinguish between two different things as the law of God distinguishes.  We all know that if a man is starving there is no moral law which prevents him from taking food to keep him and his family alive.  There is of course a law of the land against it.</P>
    <P>We should be slow to make criminal offences in cases like this when a civil remedy can exist that is adequate.  We must clearly distinguish between condemning squatting and trying on the other hand to solve the problem of squatting by appropriate means and by using appropriate weapons but not trying to turn decent people who are trying in impossible conditions to save the lives of their children, as this man has had to do, into criminals and sending them to jail.  This man may well be sent to jail tomorrow, or next week, or next month, as he knows.  I had to tell him.  After the Bill was passed in July I went to see him and I said &ldquo;You realise that now you may have to go to jail if you do not move out?  You are now liable to prison; you were not before, but you are now&rdquo;.  He said he realised that and that he would certainly try to get alternative accommodation but he could not go back to where he was, and he would not.  I could not say to him that he should.</P>
    <P>We must distinguish between the general problem, and what the law must do, and these particular cases. While, of course, hard cases make bad law, do not let us ourselves make bad laws, unnecessarily harsh laws to deal with social problems which we have created because whose fault is it that that man is in that condition?  It is not his fault.  It is the fault of those in Government who have allowed the housing situation in this city to deteriorate, as it has done, so that whereas last year there was time when a man with one child could actually get a flat&mdash;for a month or two there was a chance of his getting a flat in one place, in Ballymun &mdash; that is no longer true.  It is a city in which a couple of months ago I was told that a family with two children had a very good chance of getting a flat in Ballybough but when the Ballybough <Col N="138" /> buildings were completed I was told there was no chance.  The situation has now got so bad that only families with three children can be housed.  It is a city in which the housing situation is deteriorating month by month, in which the ante is being raised, in which people cannot have children fast enough to catch up with the number of children that you must have to get a house. house.</P>
    <P>That is not the fault of the squatters; it is the fault of the Government and it was no answer to that problem to introduce this kind of repressive legislation, which is unnecessarily repressive, when there is another solution.  I would have some sympathy with the principle of introducing legislation of this kind if there were no other solution, but when the problem has been resolved in much more difficult circumstances in Britain, in a manner which does not in any way destroy the right of the occupier to protection in the courts, which he has enjoyed for six centuries, I see no reason to destroy that right now and to bring in a Bill with six repressive provisions in it at this stage, to crack this particular nut.</P>
    <P>Of course, there must be adequate power to deal with squatting but that power must be exercised through the court and not by strong-arm men and not by landlords backed up by a most reluctant Garda Síochána.  Had this Bill been law eight months or a year ago the jails would have been enlivened, shall we say, by the company of a number of people of varying degrees of distinction.  I myself would have been one of them under the provision about encouraging people.  Distinguished people like Professor Myles Dillon, Mr. Niall Montgomery and many others spoke out on that occasion as well as myself.  Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Justin Keating and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien would also have joined these distinguished ranks.  It would have been ironic if 90 years after the land war Professor Myles Dillon found himself in jail under a law introduced by an Irish Government so much more repressive than the law which his father fought against 90 years ago.  That is what could have happened if this Bill had been introduced then.  It might have improved the tone of Mountjoy <Col N="139" /> but this House should be thinking of other things than this.  Those are the reasons I oppose this Bill and they seem to me to be sufficient and adequate reasons and I make no apology for doing this.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party have considered this Bill and decided to oppose it and vote against it, that is, to vote against it in the event of its being put to a vote, because we have had experience with this Government of various measures, suggestions and proposals being put forward as extremely urgent and of critical importance and necessary to meet, as was the case with the emergency detention to which the Taoiseach referred, an emergency threatening the life of the nation, or to meet an economic crisis as the Prices and Incomes Bill was supposed to do.  These things are announced with great pomp and flurry but then they do not always come to anything.  In some cases they just fade away.  I wonder whether this may be the case with this measure.  It may not, of course.  However, it does seem to be a possibility foreshadowed in the Minister's speech which contains something of an implicit contradiction between its beginning and its end.</P>
      <P>At the beginning he said:</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to deal with a problem to which the community has been increasingly exposed in recent times.</P>
      <P>Good.  Well, that is something worth serious consideration.  However, at the end he stated:</P>
      <P>It so happens that just at the moment we are in a period of relative quiet so far as the particular problem with which the Bill is designed to deal with is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So it is not actually increasing, as the Minister says at the beginning, it is decreasing.  I would think it possible, as I would certainly think it desirable, that this Bill may, like so many other measures, be put at least on the very long finger, perhaps after getting through this Stage.  I should add, however, that we will oppose it on this Stage also.  We consider this Bill to be a clear example of legislative over-kill <Col N="140" /> and completely unjustifiable when introduced, as the Minister himself confesses, in a period of relative quiet.</P>
    <P>A Government, any Government solicitous for the rights of the citizens, solicitous for not unnecessarily and unduly extending coercive power, should be reluctant to introduce a measure of this kind and should only concede the necessity for it under very grave pressure. This Government do not seem to be reluctant, if we take this Bill at its face value; they seem quite eager to possess such powers, or at least to hold in reserve &mdash; and this seems to be more their strategy &mdash; the possibility, or the threat of possessing them.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that a situation exists in which law-breaking is on the increase. By the Minister's own admission this is not actually the case in respect of the category of offender who is envisaged here but let us assume it is.  What would be the strategy of a wise Government?  Surely it would be to act in such a way as to dry up the sources of law-breaking, to look into the deep, underlying causes which bring this about and to deal with them and, in the meantime, to apply the existing law firmly but with a reasonable tact?  It would not be to tighten up the existing law so as to multiply the number of offences and offenders and increase the confrontation, the social pain and struggle.  This should be all the more the situation if we are, as is the case, living out a lull in relation to matters such as squatting.  The lull surely should be the occasion for an attack on the roots of the problem.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister does not concede that there is a serious problem and this fact is, in itself, one of the most serious aspects of the Government's approach to this problem.  If the Minister for Justice does not know it, certainly the members of his party who are representative of constituencies in Dublin city&mdash;as I am&mdash;know there is a very serious housing problem and that the references to this by the Minister for Justice were completely and shamefully inadequate.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the feelings of a Dublin constituency, Deputy Dowling tried to take some of the harm out of this &mdash; I should imagine Deputy Moore also <Col N="141" /> may do so in a moment &mdash; by talking about bad landlords whom he condemned in strong language, which I must say I would have to call demagogic in the circumstances.  He condemned speculators and so on while, at the same time, making crystal clear his intention to vote for a measure that will make life easier for bad landlords. It will make it easier for them to be even worse landlords and it will make it easy for speculators to benefit from that condition of additional security for that kind of property holding.</P>
    <P>In reading the Minister's speech one wonders just exactly what he and the Government are at in this Bill.  There is a very strong emphasis on what he calls &ldquo;quasi political groups&rdquo;.  I suppose this means political groups who adopt certain forms of action envisaged here.  What effect are we to look for from a measure aimed at these groups and these tactics in conditions where these tactics are diminishing, as they have been in recent months?  How far will the question of the implementation, or the non-implementation, of this Bill depend on the play of political forces in and around the governing party, affecting the question of whether they wish to take tough action affecting &mdash;let us call things by their name&mdash; Sinn Féin?  I think that is a possibility we will have to consider.</P>
    <P>Squatting takes many different forms. Many Deputies have referred to squatting in local authority houses as &ldquo;jumping the queue&rdquo;.  The Labour Party have made their position clear on that; they are opposed to it.  We have a points system for the allocation of houses which is reasonable in itself. The injustices that prevail under the system are not to be attributed so much to the system of allocation of the houses as to the fact that the houses simply are not there.  I believe existing houses are allocated reasonably fairly and those who squat in houses in these conditions are inflicting an injustice on others.  On these benches we would not condone that activity.  We are opposed to it but, as Deputy FitzGerald has pointed out, we already possess adequate legal powers to deal with it. It has been legislatively dealt with and, I believe, with general support here.</P>
    <P>Whatever the legalities of the matter, <Col N="142" /> are any of us prepared to say that we condemn totally, unconditionally, and in all circumstances, squatting of all kinds?  If we were to say that, we would be saying that a family who have not a roof over their head and have not an immediate possibility of getting a house are under the duty of obeying the law by exposing their children to the weather and their children's health to grave risk.  That is an unethical and unchristian position and I do not believe anyone would defend it here. Yet, this Bill is so conceived that it accords to people in that position only a brief, grudging stay of execution before the law catches up with them.  That is one strong reason to oppose it.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of squatting to draw attention to a flagrant abuse. The Hume Street squatting has been adduced there.  That was a case where the action taken was, I presume, illegal. Yet the public opinion of this country &mdash; as it has done in connection with similar activities throughout much of our past &mdash; accepted in what we might call the spirit of philosophical juris-prudence that the activity concerned was not only well-intentioned but had a good effect in helping to save for our children a part of our national heritage. It induced the Government to adopt a new approach, or at least something that may prove to be a new approach in relation to this whole matter.  However, that new approach may have been deceptive because what we get here is the provision for tougher measures with the people who &ldquo;sat in&rdquo; in Hume Street with the general approval of the press and public opinion of this country.  Such people would get it in the neck under this Bill and so indeed &mdash; when I speak of the press &mdash; would the press who praised the Hume Street squatters.  I hope the press will reflect and comment on the implications of section 4 of this Bill which speaks of groups who encourage and advocate; the groups are not limited and I would presume that the people concerned with the bringing out of a newspaper which praised, as many of our newspapers did, those who sat in in Hume Street, would be subject to the penalties in this Bill.  That is one of these numerous, steady erosions of <Col N="143" /> our rights and freedoms which this Government have often been prepared to contemplate with great equanimity and sometimes to apply.</P>
    <P>The general approach of the Bill is significant in the following regards.  Its timing and its tenor indicate that it is aimed at suppressing protests irrespective of the merits of the protest, and preventing occupation of residential property by homeless people.  It ignores the fact that protest may be, and homelessness always is, the sign of serious unhealthiness in the community.  In other words it attacks the symptoms or the results of a national ill-health rather than the ill-health itself, and this despite the fact that the gentleman who presents the Bill to us, the Minister for Justice, acknowledges that the symptoms of this are on the decrease, and this should surely give him time to deal with the roots of the problem rather than the symptoms.</P>
    <P>Let it not be said, as the Minister implies, that this is just a question of dealing with those bad men, those political agitators who drum up grievances where no serious grievances are and that this is not intended to crush the squatter who squats out of necessity. You will note that under section 7 of the Bill increased penalties are provided for subsequent offences, that is to say, that if a family man squats with his family in vacant property he is liable to arrest and may be imprisoned. If when he gets out, still being homeless, he does the same thing again, then he is liable to be imprisoned not merely for six months but for 12.  If he is convicted on indictment instead of in the district court, he may get three years.  Is it the case that regular imprisonment for increasing terms is the Government's solution to the problems of homeless people?</P>
    <P>We all heard this evening the painful case cited by Deputy FitzGerald of a man and his family who are squatting illegally, as Deputy FitzGerald has pointed out, because if they did not squat the children would be running the risk of a tubercular infection which members of the family had, in fact, mitting an offence.  If they were to sustained, but here they would be commove <Col N="144" /> from one property in which they had squatted to another for the same reason, the offence would escalate and also their penalties.  Therefore, the Bill is aimed at suppressing protest irrespective of the methods of the protest, and it is not designed effectively in such a way as to spare those who have to squat out of necessity.  It adds to the problem of the otherwise homeless squatter by holding over his head the danger of being charged with a serious criminal offence.  It puts the interest of property owners before the rights of the homeless poor, and that is its entire spirit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore, who is about to speak after me, I know has sympathy for the homeless of this city, and I would put to him that sentence: &ldquo;This Bill puts the interest of property-owners before the rights of the homeless poor,&rdquo; and I would ask him to answer that challenge and to show this House in what way this Bill puts the rights of the homeless poor before the interest of the property owners.  I think he would have to be a very ingenious advocate to detect anything in this Bill that does that, because this is a property-owners' Bill and a Bill of a property-owners' Government.  This Bill diverts attention from the principal problem which is a widespread lack of adequate housing and in many cases a lack of any housing affecting a large section of the population.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, in a neighbouring country, this has been dealt with in a different way.  In England a new order of the rules of the Supreme Court &mdash; I understand the number was 113 &mdash; came into force last summer.  This provides that a final order should not be made except by a judge in person and except in cases of urgency and by consent of the court it should not be made until seven days have elapsed since the date of the summons.  A special form of summons is available where the identity of the occupants is not known.  The summons may be addressed: &ldquo;To whom it may concern&rdquo;.  If an order is made on foot of such a summons then the sheriff's officers are entitled to obtain possession and to vacate the entire premises, removing from it anybody who is in occupation whether or not he is named <Col N="145" /> in the summons or even if nobody is named.  This is an effective way of enabling the owner of properties to get rid of squatters by the use of due process.</P>

      <P>The English model may not give as urgent and drastic a redress as some people seem to think necessary.  We do not think it necessary to be more drastic than the British Tory Government find it necessary to be, or to institute changes of that nature in the legal system. However, the essential point about the British model here is that it is a model which takes account of, which is respectful of the idea of due process, and which is not emanated by the kind of spirit which we see more and more of in documents presented to us here, that the whole idea, is to give a free hand to the gardaí and all will be well.  That is a dangerous spirit. It is a spirit which is coming to the fore more and more in many countries, including the United States and Canada, and which is, I think, as serious a source of disquiet to the citizens as the law-breaking which it is ostensibly aimed to combat.  In fact, we have found that this kind of extension of police power is not a favourable symptom of what is happening in society and it is not a good way of dealing with these matters.  It is a way of bringing about maximum confrontation. I think that among the people who have organised various forms of activity which this Bill is aimed at there must be some, perhaps many, who are hoping that this Bill will be passed and applied so that we will have the maximum confrontation, the maximum clash, the maximum possibilities of charging police brutality and so on.  There are people who want that.  We on these benches do not want that and that is among the reasons why we consider this an unwise and dangerous measure and a further erosion of our rights as citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of the constitutionality of this whole measure.  I presume the Government have been advised.  I presume they have taken advice as to whether everything in this is constitutional.  I hope we will hear a little bit more <Col N="147" /> about that.  Of course the Government, under ouh Constitution, are not the final and determining authority on whether it is constitutional or not. Even if the Minister tells us it is constitutional he may well be wrong but at least it would be interesting to hear why he thinks it is constitutional. Article 41 (1) of the Constitution reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the majority of the homeless squatters are married people. Generally speaking it is only after marriage and when there are children that people find the need to have a separate place.  Most single people stay with their families.  So, it is the family that is affected.  This Bill as well as the Housing Bill &mdash; some aspects of the Housing Bill at least &mdash; but certainly this Bill is, in effect, an attack on the family unit whose rights are stated in the Constitution to be antecedent and superior to all positive law.  One would wonder what view would be taken in relation to that if the case described by Deputy FitzGerald were to come within the cognisance of a court if such a family met with penalties under this Bill.  We would like to hear from the Minister about this.  How exactly is this Bill consonant with the section of the Constitution which I have read in so far as it may be invoked against families?</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity of discussing each section of the Bill in Committee.  I do not want to go through them in detail at the moment. We have received, I suppose, some education in civil liberties and civil rights if only as a result of the developing situations in the North, and anyone concerned with civil liberty <Col N="148" /> must look with horror at section 4 of this Bill.  In particular what is disturbing about this is not the letter of the Bill itself but the completely casual, callous, insensitive way in which this Government extend the area of State or police control, the way that they override freedom of expression, freedom of the Press.  All through Western Europe and in America and many other parts of the world there is a struggle going on over similar things, that is to say, in what circumstances is it right to curb freedom of expression? I do not think anywhere among countries where democracy is practised and there is at least nominal respect for civil rights, I do not think anywhere in recent times such an instrument has been envisaged as this one.  I would like to consider how the Minister deals with it.  He says:</P>
    <P>Section 4, subsection (2), of the Bill provides that, where a statement encouraging or advocating the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation is made by or on behalf of a group of persons, each member of the group will be guilty of an offence.  Contrary to what I understand has been suggested by some critics,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I understand&rdquo;.  Apparently he does not read the newspapers.</P>
    <P>&mdash;there is in this no element of guilt by association.  A member of a group is not being held responsible for what other members say unless what is said was said by or on behalf of the group.</P>
    <P>Of course if it was said by or on behalf of the group then he is being held responsible. He is not just responsible, he is guilty of an offence if something is said by somebody else with whom he is associated.  If that is not guilt by association what on earth is it?</P>
    <P>He goes on:</P>
    <P>A member of a group is not being held responsible for what other members say unless what he said was said by or on behalf of the group.  Here I would point out that whether a statement has been made on behalf of a group is a question of fact which the prosecution would have to prove and, accordingly, the provision could not <Col N="149" /> apply to a statement purporting to be made on behalf of the group which was actually made by some outsider.</P>
    <P>Well, this is to tell us that the common law is not being entirely demolished by section 4 of this particular Bill.  We need not thank the Minister or the Government for this. He goes on and this is more interesting:</P>
    <P>Even though the provision is limited in this way, it might be unfair to individual members of a group to allow them no line of retreat where a spokesman has perhaps said more than some members would wish and subsection (3) of section 4 provides, therefore, that it will be a good defence for a person charged with such an offence to prove that he immediately took all reasonable steps open to him to dissociate himself from the statement or that the statement was made without his knowledge or that it was made without his consent.</P>
    <P>Notice on whom the onus now falls. It is not, as we are taught in our studies of our legal system, a burden of proof on the prosecution; it is a burden of proof on the man himself. You belong to what is vaguely called a group of persons.  A group of persons could be anything, including a newspaper.  It could be a radio.  It could be a television session.  It could be a political party.  It could be a club.  It could be anything.  A group of persons could be literally anything whatever.  If some member of this group says something which can be taken as encouraging or advocating the commission of an offence, then all the members of the group are <i>prima facie</i> guilty of that offence.</P>
    <P>Notice that it is not even enough for the Minister to make it advocating an offence.  It has to be encouraging an offence.  If somebody in a group to which you belong seems to a court to have encouraged an offence under this Bill, then everybody concerned is guilty of the offence unless he can exculpate himself.  The burden is on him. No doubt the original man who encouraged or advocated it has the benefit of the normal legal right of the <Col N="150" /> citizen that the offence has to be proved against him but, once it is proved, that is it.  Then the burden shifts.</P>
    <P>If a leader writer on one of our papers does something like saying that the squatters in Hume Street on the whole did a good job because they brought the Government to consider the question of our heritage in this city then, if that leader writer is deemed to have encouraged squatting &mdash; and I think it would be reasonable to find that he did in those circumstances&mdash; then the board of his newspaper, his colleagues on it, and certainly his editor, would be deemed to be guilty unless they would repudiate him.</P>
    <P>At this level there is something sordid about this Bill and particularly about the Minister's explanation of it, something that very much recalls the McCarthy days in the United States. Even though the provision is limited&mdash; it might be unfair to individual members of a group to allow them no line of retreat &mdash; it is provided there that it will be a good defence for a person charged with such an offence to prove that he immediately took all reasonable steps to dissociate himself: in other words, if he runs away, if he repudiates his colleague, if he humiliates himself and his group in these circumstances, and if he says he will be a good boy, then he will be kindly let off, at that cost.  I think this is a very wrong provision and a very wrong excuse for the provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so, Sir, if I may.  The point about this clearly is that within any group &mdash; and <Col N="151" /> I think this would be true of any of the three main groups in this House &mdash; there could well be a span of opinion.  We realise now that there is a considerable span of opinion on these benches on my left on such a matter, with definite views held of a different character by people who respect one another generally and who can work together generally for a common cause.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald said, and it is true, that in certain circumstances he, as I also, and other Deputies here gave what the court could reasonably regard as encouragement to a group of people in Hume Street who were engaged in squatting.  We did that.  I know that Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde would take a poor view &mdash; and I respect his motives and his position &mdash; of that kind of activity and that kind of encouragement. Deputy Esmonde will forgive me if I introduce his name purely for the purpose of the illustration of an argument and without any other intention.</P>
      <P>Supposing Deputy FitzGerald &mdash; after this Bill becomes law, if it ever does become law &mdash; were to be so rash as to contravene it, or was found guilty, perhaps, without having contravened it, or found guilty having contravened it, in a case to which he attached importance. We know that Deputy FitzGerald would not do such a thing lightly.  Supposing he is found guilty of doing it, then the pressure is on Deputy Esmonde.  He is guilty of the same offence.  He might very much disapprove of what Deputy FitzGerald had done, but the pressure would be on him.  He would be guilty of the same offence unless he scurried forward and disavowed Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might well disapprove of or dislike something a colleague in a group had said without at all being willing to go so far as to disavow him, particularly at a moment when he stood in danger or when he had in fact been penalised.  Anyone who felt a scruple of that kind would find very scant comfort in this Bill or in the type of explanation which has accompanied it. So, I would entirely repudiate and reject the claim made by the Minister here that this section of the Bill does not introduce guilt by association.  Guilt <Col N="152" /> by association in its most abhorrent and humiliating form is precisely what it does introduce and it compounds that by adding to guilt by association the reversal of the normal process whereby a person is considered innocent until he is found guilty.  I do not know whether that is in accordance with the Constitution.  I hope it is not.  I think it is certainly not in accordance with the spirit of reasonable liberty under which we should try to live.</P>
    <P>I must ask the Minister this.  Does he know of any provision equivalent to this which has been introduced and has become law in any other country in recent years?  Perhaps he will tell us whether there are precedents for this, I will not say in Greece, or in Albania, or in Spain, or in Bulgaria, but in countries with legal systems similar to ours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Cuba, if you wish &mdash; countries with traditions which are similar to ours and which have a respect for due process and for the rights even of the accused.  I do not think it is sufficient answer to that simply to leer and shout &ldquo;Cuba.&rdquo;  I am not arguing in favour of Cuban jurisprudence.  The kind of measure which is evoked here is the kind of law for which people legitimately criticise or attack countries like Cuba. It is not the Labour Party who are trying to introduce a provision of this kind.  It is the governing party.</P>
      <P>We challenge the Minister to produce from the legislation of, I will not say the individual States in the United States but the Federation, Canada, Scandinavia, Britain, West Germany or wherever he likes, some equivalent to this law and to give us an opportunity of consulting that in the Library.  I wanted to make that challenge to him because in the Committee Stage of this Bill, assuming it comes to a Committee Stage, we will necessarily have a great deal more to say about this pernicious, callous and humiliating piece of legislation which is offered to us in particular in section 4 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In winding up his speech the Minister <Col N="153" /> spoke about the housing situation itself. He said:</P>
    <P>Dublin and to a lesser extent other cities and towns, like cities and towns in every other country that we know of, have a shortage of houses, though it is of nothing like the dimensions that some of the critics would have us think.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear Deputy Moore on that.</P>

      <P>The Minister also said:</P>
      <P>Those who have studied the problem most extensively say that the only city without a housing problem is a city that is dead or at least dying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard that cliché many times from those benches.  It is their main contribution to the housing problem. It covers absolutely everything because the worse the housing situation is in the city the more healthy one can say the condition is.  The city, far from being dead or dying, has more homeless than any other city in western <Col N="154" /> Europe.  We are in a fine state under this Government.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>If they are right in this &mdash; and I believe they are &mdash; we must accept as a fact that urban housing shortages cannot be solved overnight, particularly in a country like ours which has limited resources.</P>
    <P>What about the people who have been homeless or ill-housed for years?  What is overnight?  How long a period of time is it?  Is it 10 years or is it 20 years?  He continues:</P>
    <P>Given that situation, it is essential that priorities should be determined in a rational and objective way.</P>
    <P>We are all for priorities being determined in a rational and objective way, but we are also in favour of the goods existing to which the priorities mean entitlement.  We, on these benches, have asked for the declaration of a housing emergency; instead, we get this repressive measure.  Repression was something against which our people complained and struggled for generations. In a situation calling for reform and change the Government provide coercion because that is cheaper.  This, in effect, is a coercion Bill, in the spirit of the old coercive Bills of the Tories of the nineteenth century and it is offered to us with a complacency and a supply of clichés worthy of that tradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Great emphasis has been placed by some opposition Deputies on the fact that squatting in local authority houses has taken place because there is a grave housing shortage. I have never tried to pretend that there is not a serious housing shortage in the city.  I believe it is the duty of any Government to create conditions whereby a family or individual who qualifies should have proper housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want now to comment on the need for this Bill.  We must face facts: no democratic Government would attempt to bring in legislation seeking to penalise any citizen unnecessarily.  To my mind there are three different types of squatting. The first type of squatter is the poor unfortunate man, with a wife and children, who out of sheer desperation may well squat in a property that is not his own because the family have <Col N="155" /> no proper accommodation.  The second type of squatter is the man who is being used by certain agitation groups, who are not concerned with the man's circumstances, but hope to make political capital out of that man's misery.  The third type of squatter may be described as the middle class idealistic squatter, who squats in order to save a building which he thinks should be preserved. It seems to be the fashion for public figures to engage in this type of squatting and it is the one I am least concerned with.  The point I want to make here is that some families have been made to squat by agitation groups.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien asked me if I would try to defend or show that this Bill did not favour landlords rather than families.  Even if I were to prove that to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien I doubt if he would accept my word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could try.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No more than I would accept his word if the procedure were reversed.  There is no point in my trying to convince Deputy Cruise-O'Brien but it is my duty to try to show him that Fianna Fáil are aware of the housing situation; to tell him what is being done to alleviate the situation, and to tell him why this Bill is necessary to safeguard some of the families about which Deputy Cruise-O'Brien is so concerned. Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and Deputy Pattison stated that the Labour Party were not in favour of squatting. I welcome the conversion of the Labour Party to this point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say I was unconditionally against squatting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just saying generally.  I can recall some spokesmen in this city advocating squatting in the early days when we had an outbreak of this type of activity.  The fact that better counsels now prevail in the Labour Party is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention one case which highlights the need for this Bill. The corporation welfare officers wanted to take an elderly blind man out of the run down room in which he was living <Col N="156" /> to a modern flat suitable for an old person.  The flats when completed were handed over to the corporation but when the welfare officers went to place that old man in his new home they found it was occupied by an adult family, not a mother, father and young children, but four adults.  The old man was taken back to his run down room because the corporation could not take any action against these adults who were occupying the flat. Four bully boys took over that flat without caring what happened to the old man who was entitled to it and all the corporation could do was to take the old man back to his garret again.</P>
    <P>I admit that the housing shortage is responsible for some of the squatting in the city.  When anything becomes scarce the demand increases.  In some cases it is hard to condemn a man and his family for squatting.  At the same time if we subscribe to the idea that squatting is right there will be anarchy and chaos.  The weakest section of our community will suffer.  Reference was made this afternoon to Article 41 of the Constitution which guarantees the sanctity of the family as a group.  The family is the basic group in our society. Fianna Fáil policy has been that we should seek to preserve the sanctity and the rights of the family.</P>
    <P>We come now to the people on the Dublin Corporation housing list. Dublin Corporation have already provided 55,000 dwellings.  These figures refer to the city area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>One could say that one-third of the people in Dublin are being housed by the corporation.  I am not talking about the loans given to people to build their own houses.  The corporation are building about 2,500 houses, and over a five-year period we have plans to provide 21,000 dwellings. Some members are forever telling us they are socialists and that there is a socialist Utopia somewhere in the sky where there are no housing shortages, no squatters and no protest marches.  Some years ago a well-known trade union leader went to <Col N="157" /> Moscow to a conference and he commented that the housing problems in that city would never be solved.  This comment came from a country where land, property and even individual rights had been nationalised.</P>

      <P>There is nothing we can do about 1957 now.  We must look to the future of the city.  This is being done.  Nobody can deny this.  I have given figures from official sources.  I look forward to the time when the number of houses required will be reduced, not because people have left our city but because we have been matching our resources of capital and labour and land.  We will have been able then to reduce the housing list to its lowest proportions.  There will be no squatting.  We will be thankful for that. In the meantime, it is the duty of our Government to protect the weakest families in this city.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien equated landlordism and wealth all the time.  I know of an old lady who has a local authority house.  In trying to help the housing problem she accepted some people into her house as tenants and before long we had to go to ensure that she would not be driven from her house by the people she had brought in.  She was a tenant <Col N="159" /> with rights to hold on to her house. She had to be protected in order that she could remain in occupation of the house.  She was quite entitled to remain there.</P>
      <P>It may be the ambition of the Opposition to suggest that all the goodies are on one side and all the baddies on the other, but life in reality is much more complex than that: this is where the Opposition fall down in their approach to the Bill. They adopt a legalistic approach and they fail to assess the human problem. They fail to understand the problem this Bill seeks to solve.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the law will be there for those who need it.</P>
      <P>I said earlier we have groups which agitate about housing.  I know some are concerned about housing.  Others are not.  Let us face it; in their anxiety to help the underdog they often fail to realise who the underdog is and they end up making those they are allegedly trying to help more miserable still.  We have had cases in which people were encouraged to squat by certain groups. In some cases there were those who refused to have anything to do with these groups.  Indeed, in the papers a few weeks back a gentleman who was very active in what I will call &ldquo;housing agitation&rdquo; explained why a certain group had become quite silent; he said they were too political and the people would not touch them.  That, I think, is high tribute to the intelligence of Dublin people; they were not prepared to allow themselves to be duped by these people who come forward with gifts in one hand and a knife in the other, their whole aim being to cause trouble and chaos.  If we do not ensure that the rule of law obtains we will end up in anarchy.  To safeguard the weakest sections it is the duty of the Government to ensure that anarchy does not prevail.</P>
      <P>Nobody has yet invented &ldquo;instant housing&rdquo; and, until somebody does, we will always have a housing problem of one kind or another in cities like Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Labour Party do not care we must care on this side of the House.  We do care.  If we did not this Bill would not be before the House tonight.  It is not designed to save the landlord.  Wealthy landlords have the means to deal with squatters.  The Bill is designed to help those who need housing.  The position is a little confused. Two years ago a certain man was very active in a housing group.  I spoke to him and pointed out to him that he qualified for housing.  He is now housed and quite happy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and Deputy FitzGerald suggested in their own devious fashion that the Hume Street row arose because Dublin City Council was abolished.  That, of course, did not affect the issue in the slightest degree.  If planning legislation in regard to Hume Street was bad then we should change the law but we should not allow a citizen who has not broken the law to be subjected to any kind of agitation over his property.  If a man breaks the law he should be prosecuted, no matter how wealthy he is, and made to pay for his transgression.  However, to suggest the Hume Street houses were put in jeopardy because we had no city council is an absurd argument.  It was advanced by a Deputy who really should know better.  Houses were demolished even when the city council was there.  Last year we passed legislation here prohibiting the demolition of habitable houses.  Not alone do we want to build more houses but we want to preserve the existing stock.  That is why we had the anti-demolition Bill introduced.  That measure has helped to preserve the existing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make the progress we want to make it is absolutely essential that we have an ordered society in which no group will take unto themselves the right to say: &ldquo;This shall be done or not done.&rdquo;  The people have put their trust in this Parliament and it is for this Parliament to ensure that the law is upheld.  At times it may be necessary to bring in unpopular or too severe measures but that is part and parcel of government.  Any government that would jib at bringing in legislation which is necessary for the common good because of the hazard of unpopularity <Col N="163" /> should not be in government. I think the Opposition will agree that the Fianna Fáil Government can never be accused of being afraid to bring in legislation which they believed was right and was brought in with an informed collective conscience.  If this legislation, as far as we know, will safeguard and promote the welfare of even our weakest citizens, then I call it good legislation.  There are other parts of the Bill on which I hope to speak on the next Stage, such as the forcible occupation of land or a vehicle.</P>

      <P>I was at Hume Street but I shall never get to Stephen's Green if I am being interrupted all the time. The absence of the city council had nothing to do with the Hume Street affair.  As far as I can recall, the people who owned the Hume Street houses had complied with the law.  If the law is bad we should change the law.  Is it right that when an individual or a company complies with the law he or it should be held up to ridicule? They announced what they intended to do.  I am not an architect but if the Hume Street houses are worth preserving and can be preserved they should be preserved.  That is common sense. The Hume Street affair was made the occasion for publicity-seeking by a number of politicians who went there and stayed talking to the people there but not very long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are going home to <Col N="167" /> bed.&rdquo;  If Hume Street were to be the only issue, we could dismiss it.  The citizens have a right to protest if they feel some desecration is about to take place of some architectural gem.  I do not know if Hume Street houses could be so described but the students apparently felt that way about them.  I am trying to be fair.  Even though we may disagree with certain changes in the city scene we have no right to break the law in order to win our point.  If the law is bad and if certain citizens are being deprived of rights under it, I think that law should be changed and not to have every group who feel like it taking the law into their own hands saying: &ldquo;We decide that this should happen.&rdquo;  If we believe in democracy we must accept that majority rule counts.  The Government returned by the people are the custodians of law and order and it is they who have to draft legislation, improve on it and continue to improve on it, until we have, as far as possible the perfect legal code. We know that we will never have the perfect legal code but at least we can continue to strive to ensure that majority rule will count.  This is a democracy worth defending against any group and to suggest that you can be selective about squatting is not to face the issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who hoped I would comment on the housing situation.  I <Col N="168" /> am trying to do this because this is the kernel of the whole thing.  I have tried to show the Government recognise that we have a housing problem and that they tackled the problem with all the resources our economy would allow.  I may say at times that I am disappointed that we do not spend more on housing because the most serious problem all over the country, and the one which should get top priority, is housing.  We may say, to comfort ourselves, that we are making as much progress with this problem as any other country.  However, in this city we have had to bear the slings and arrows of militant groups because we tried to do something to improve the situation. The members of all parties in the city council had to run the gauntlet at Cork Hill and Lord Edward Street from people who threatened violence, and indeed on one occasion assaulted a Labour Party Deputy, an alderman.</P>
      <P>This was all done because they claimed they wanted the housing drive speeded up.  On two occasions they broke up meetings of the Council, again in the name of housing agitation. However, they never explained how they would speed that drive by destroying meetings of the council who were discussing housing and allied matters, or how to obtain more money so that the housing drive could be accelerated. The great pity was that some people in the city were fooled by these demonstrations on behalf of homeless people. We heard the famous cry &ldquo;on behalf of the 10,000 homeless families in our city&rdquo;.  No matter how many times we may deny this fictitious figure they still should about 10,000 homeless families. This is very relevant to this Bill because here we have incitement of a section of our people by others who are themselves well housed.  On a previous occasion I pointed out that in this city at present we have not got, and I thank God for this, even 10,000 housing applications so how could we have 10,000 homeless families?  We have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said this evening about Article 41 of the Constitution regarding the status of the family.  It is the most important article in the Constitution because the family is recognised as the whole basis of our society.  The first requirement of any family is that it should be housed properly and lack of housing should not be made the means by which any group or political party can make political capital.  As the Minister stated, some people may say that the Bill goes too far while others may say it does not go far enough so, perhaps, the Minister has reached a happy medium.</P>
      <P>There are sections which in an earlier age might have been questioned but in this age the Minister for Justice, having the benefit of sound advice, has had legislation prepared which he feels will fulfil the needs of the moment and of the future.  Nobody can accuse him of not having faced up to the realities of the situation.  On other stages there will be suggestions for amendments and we will have had a better opportunity of studying the Bill when we reach Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This is all part of the democratic process for putting legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas so that no legislation will infringe on the legitimate rights of all our people.  This is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must always guard against the fact that there will be people who will call out and say this means a certain <Col N="171" /> penalising of a section of the community. This Bill will not penalise anyone unless there is some cause, or thought to be some cause, for action by the forces of law.  Today I was handed a document on the prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill, 1970; comments issued by Sinn Féin of Gardiner Place.  While it is understandable that such a party should interest themselves in all legislation, despite the fact that the people have not returned any Sinn Féin members to this House, at the same time no Fianna Fáil Government will ever try to deprive any citizen of his right to free speech and protest.  Because we believe in democracy, it should not be thought a weakness on our part to allow any group to voice their protest. If a man wants to hold a meeting in this city he has a perfect right to do so but he must remember that other citizens also have rights on which he must not infringe.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to ensure that this will not happen.  No group can say &ldquo;We have decided that this should be done and, therefore, it must be done, despite the injury and annoyance it may inflict on others&rdquo;.  I would defend the right of any man to voice his opinion but I will also stand behind any person who considers his rights have been infringed by a group or an individual.  This is what democracy is all about.  We cannot always have legislation that will be acclaimed by every section.  I think I can truthfully say that no Bill has ever been put before any democratic House or gathering which was accepted <i>in toto</i> by every member of that gathering.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be criticised, attacked and misrepresented, but the people will recognise the fact that the Government have felt strongly about the issues with which this Bill seeks to deal, their draftsmen have drafted the proposals and the Bill is now put before the House.  It is for the common good and by this I mean the good common to all and not just for the benefit of some group or party.  When people attempt to take the law into their own hands inevitably we have a state of chaos.  If some Deputies in the House considered <Col N="172" /> that enough had not been done for housing and if they took some action that was against the law, those Deputies would be liable to punishment just as would the citizens of the country, because all stand equal in the eyes of the law.</P>
    <P>The criticism voiced against this Bill suggesting that it is aimed at certain groups, not because they are breaking the law but on account of their political persuasion, is absurd.  In the last two or three years we have had ample evidence of groups in this city who have sought not to better the lot of the people in whom they profess to be interested but rather to bring about disruption and to spotlight their own existence.  One sees the same faces in all the protest parades and this makes one critical of some of the groups who participate in those protests.  Their slogan seems to be: &ldquo;We will pull down society, let us protest&rdquo; and they protest on any pretext whatever.</P>
    <P>It was essential for the Government to act.  They have not acted on the side of the big landlord because to our mind the big landlord and the most impoverished person in our society have certain fundamental rights, irrespective of poverty or wealth.  Unless we uphold the rule of law and the democratic process we are heading for Orwell's 1984.  Unless the Government step in we can see the day when Big Brother, in the guise of some militant group, could take over and tell us how we should lead our lives.  The essence of democracy is rule by an elected Government and not by some self-constituted group which decides what is good for the people.</P>
    <P>We are committed to uphold the democratic process and this Bill, despite what has been said about it by Opposition members, will play its part to uphold the law.  When people seriously consider what is in the Bill and the thinking behind it I am convinced they will appreciate that the Bill is for the common good.  I know that the people of Dublin are highly intelligent and will recognise this fact. We have been taunted here tonight that we are defending the wealthy landlords but this is totally untrue.  We are defending the right to private property, <Col N="173" /> whether that property belongs to the man living in the small country cottage or the person living in a local authority house in the suburbs of Dublin.  These people have certain fundamental rights which the law must uphold and the day this House plays <Col N="174" /> politics on such issues I feel we are on the road to chaos.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that many government offices including the Estate Duty Office continue to fail to quote addressees' references in correspondence; and if he will issue a new directive to all civil servants requiring them to quote such references in the same manner as the civil service requires the public to quote civil service references in letters addressed to government offices.</P>

      <P>Statistics for the offence of driving or attempting to drive while drunk are not available for years prior to 1958, and statistics of persons committed to prison for this offence prior to 1969 could not be obtained without a disproportionate expenditure of time on examining old records.  The number of persons committed to prison in 1969 following conviction for the offence was seven.</P>
